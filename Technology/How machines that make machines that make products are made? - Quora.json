            "answer_text": "As you travel through industrial areas you will see a lot of tool and die shops, often with names such as Chuck's Tool & Jig, National Mold & Die, and so forth.  Every shop specializes in making tools for a particular type of manufacturing, such as extrusion, powdered metal, sheet metal presses, or cold heading. They have machines that are used for creating the parts for the making of things in large quantities.  Engineers design the tooling and make drawings of what is needed, then the toolmakers read the drawings and create the tooling.  The tooling is then shipped to the factory that ordered them. The machines they use to make these tools include manual equipment like bandsaws, powered machines like mills and lathes and EDMs, and even computerized numerically controlled machines.   Sometimes the engineers in these shops see a way to improve on the way these machines work and, with enough funding, are able to create new machines, often going into business building these machines to make machines for manufacturing. When I was in college I worked as a toolmaker for a few years.  It is a highly skilled trade, the pay is good, and it is very rewarding.  If you're really curious about it, you may want to stop into a tool and die shop and ask if they will show you around. ",

            "answer_text": "*iterative manufacturing* is a form of knowledge so the *machine* is in fact your mind and from that is created an item which can do a repetitive task. In order to create these machines they must move from mind to paper or a clay model. The simplest form of a machine that makes machine that makes a product would therefore in my mind be a *mold* from whence a substance be poured into and thus be made an armature or some such thing. From this begets a *hard drive* begets a semiconductor begets a modem begets an interface begets connectivity begets a computer begets standardization begets a few machines that make a machine that becomes the product with an oversight mechanism that relays back to the producer said machines that produced the product did so per specification. All starts with the human mind tho. ",
