            "answer_text": "It positively increases our capacity to do something. Like dynamite increases our ability to make a big bang out of a small hole - drill hole in rock (very hard work) put in gunpowder - light fuse and leg it - Bang. Make same sized hole, put in stick of dynamite, light longer fuse and leg it - BIGGER BANG ! Eases mine work. Increases productivity. Made Alfred Nobel awful righ man - hence the prizes. Also dynamite of considerable interest to the military. You may consider this as bad, or a \u201cnegative\u201d impact - but that is just you being a pacifist. Do not bring your philosophical, ethical hangups to a discussion of technology. Better steel, sharper blades, swords that kill better, and better scalpels for the surgeon. There are ethical consequences of \u201cbetter steel\u201d - but the steel is better even if you choose to do murder. Do not confuse two disjoint areas of thought. Ethics - you and your mates, and how you treat them. Technology, you and your tools, and how you develop the skills to use them. Both discussions can use terms like \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cgainfully\u201d or \u201cas required\u201d or \u201cdesirable\u201d - but the word means different things in different contexts.

Having conveniences such as hot and running water, medicine, food, clothing, A/C and heat, electricity, electronics, a home, a car, or most anything else you enjoy as part of the abundance available all around you. That depends of course on where you live. Some people even in the heart of our big cities don\u2019t have any of that. ",
