The field of AI is huge, encompassing any number of sub-fields. Then make sure it\u2019s something your advisor either knows about already, or is interested in. Then make sure the review committee is likely to understand the topic sufficiently well to approve your thesis when you finally complete and submit it to them. This all assumes, of course, that you have the time, talent and background knowledge to complete the research and prepare the document. ",

            "answer_text": "You must find that all important research question - not to big that I cannot be done in time and sufficiently original. The trendy stuff on computers is what most go for but it is like mining on spoil heap. You need to get help from your supervisor -s/he has to sign up for whatever you choose and that means they have to see its originality and its scope. This can be very tricky. If I suggest topics then could get stranded so I wont. You need to build a map of topics so that you can then narrow down your area of interest - it must be of interest to you and your supervisor Look back into the past for more topics than are in the list (previous answer) Also be aware that AI is about real-time systems (ie us) and so control/robotics/cybernetics are valid and define terms (up front) such a knowledge, Intelligence , information Finally don\u2019t assume that computers will ever truly exhibit AI - this is a current sticking point and we have been here before! The architecture for AI will more closely resemble a comand and control system (as typified in defence systems) - look them up for concepts such as data/sensor fusion, association, focus of attention (see blackboard architectures (hearsay 2)) , viewpoints, world picture etc. Good Luck.
