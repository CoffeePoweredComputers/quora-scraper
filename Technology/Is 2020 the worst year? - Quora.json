            "answer_text": "No , 2020 is not the worst year !! Now many people say how ?? As covid 19 occurs , famous actors dies , economy loss and other destruction !! So u all say that it is the worst year !! But let me tell u one thing ! 2020 is just a year(basically its a year which is created by humankind). So we cant say 2020 is worst year as these all problem was created by us(mankind). So why we blame a date or year for any destruction or anything !! If scientists don\u2019t create made mistake in lab , then covid-19 not occur ! So this all is the mistake of human ! Who did this things but now blame on a year ! Hope you understand :) ^this is my first answer , if u agree with my views,upvote & follow :) ",
