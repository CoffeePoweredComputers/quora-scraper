            "answer_text": "Putting aside how 'ethical use' really can be done, the term 'ethical use' is completely about 'priority'. Who is for who? Technology should be for people, not the opposite at all. If you want to see a real case of 'people are for technology', then look into the historical case of Unit 731 in World War II and what they did. Or you can even see the movie Matrix that people are actually used as bio-batteries for machines or Resident Evil (aka Biohazard series) in which innocent people are misused for biological experiments and ultimately for a company's business profit. So the consequences of unethical use of technology can be summarized into one sentence: people are no longer masters on top of everything, rather they just become slaves being used laid underneath.
