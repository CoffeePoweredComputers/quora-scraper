            "answer_text": "List Of Hot Futuristic cars We\u2019re starting off our list with a pretty rare specimen 1. Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita \u2013 $4.8 million  The Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita comes built with a twin-supercharged 4.8-liter v8 engine with 1018 horsepower. For a quick refresher, horsepower is the amount of power needed to move 33,000 pounds 1-foot in 1 minute. The CCXR is truly a stallion. You\u2019d think a car boasting such gains would require a sufficient amount of mass to go 0 to 200 but here\u2019s the kicker \u2013 this car only weighs 2821 pounds. Aside from its extreme rarity, this state-of-the-art vehicle has car freaks drooling over more than just its speed. This cars impressive interior has a knockout body to match. Built with one-of-a-kind sparkling white carbon fiber unique to the CCXR. This car is literally sparkling with diamonds. This is due to a unique coated fiber solution that changes the colored dazzling white. Did we mention how rare this car is? Only two CCXR\u2019s currently exist in the world and for a mere $4.8 million you can own one of the rarest vehicles out there. Hey, Jay Leno owns one why can\u2019t you? 2. Pagani Huayra Roadster \u2013 $3.4 million  Though weighing in at 200 pounds lighter than the CCXR the Pagani Huayra Roadster is certainly no summer breeze. This car has a starting price of $3.4 million. A modest price to pay for its carbon titanium bodywork. The interior is nothing to sneeze at either. A combination of artisanal wood luxury leather and other carbon materials weave together throughout the car\u2019s interior pairing the laser-cut accuracy of a race car with the elegance of mother nature into a stunning union of aesthetics. With a catalytic converter employing Formula One technology this glorious beast can seriously drive. If you find yourself behind the wheel of a BC roadster, you can confidently floor it knowing you\u2019ve got a twin-turbocharged V12 engine with 791 horsepower to boot. The future is now with this automotive animal and hey, at $3.4 million it\u2019s pretty much a steal. So you\u2019ve been shopping at the car store for a couple of minutes and all these $4 million rides are tempting you really want something that\u2019s gonna break the bank, something edgy individual and truly one-of-a-kind. 3. Lamborghini Egoista \u2013 $117 million Well, look no further the Lamborghini Egoista is here. Egoista literally translates to selfish in Italian and it\u2019s clear why. The designer Walter DeSilva former head of Volkswagen said the Lamborghini Egoista is hedonism taken to the extreme. The cars of one-seater with the fully removable canopy door modeled to look like a fighter jet. The car\u2019s exterior is even made with anti-radar material keeping faithful to the aircraft\u2019s inspiration. The bodywork for the Egoista boasts advanced aerodynamic panels that shift in height in relation to downforce and stability. Can you guess the launch price of the Egoista? Yeah, you really think you can guess? Try $117 million. A number so big we had to spell it out in this script so it wouldn\u2019t be mispronounced and don\u2019t worry I won\u2019t judge you if you can\u2019t afford these Futuristic Cars. 4. Lykan Hypersport \u2013 $4.5 million  Who says expensive futuristic cars are only for the private buyer. This 789 horsepower steed is actually used as a police car in Abu Dhabi. However, the Lykan Hypersport is no Ford Crown Vic. This car can go 0 to 100 kilometers in 2.8 seconds making it optimal for high-speed driving over long distances. With only seven models in existence, you can rest assured the Hypersport certainly costs a pretty penny. For only $4.5 million you too can own this audacious oddity with real diamond embedded headlights. But don\u2019t worry if diamonds aren\u2019t your thing the manufacturer also offers a selection of rubies, yellow diamonds, and sapphires to choose from. You can even color-coordinate it with the paint job. The Hypersport was featured in the beloved classic film Furious 7. Though the production team had to use a Hypersport replica made with cheaper materials. 5. Nouvoyage Tender 33 \u2013 $2 million Perhaps the new Nouvoyage Tender 33 was what Frank Sinatra was singing about when he recorded somewhere beyond the sea. This amphibian mousse is truly one for the books. Behold the 33-foot boatmobile which comfortably seats 12 passengers and two crew members. This car even has its own galley and a retractable roof. With a top speed of 28 knots, you can sail this car right into your bank account as it can someday be purchased for about $2 million. A Nouvoyage the company responsible for this aquatic wonder also claimed to be working on a 45-foot water limo for the mega yacht market. 6. Tesla Roadster \u2013 $250,000  The heavily anticipated Tesla Roadster is coming in hot. This electric car can go 620 miles on a single charge with an acceleration rate of 0 to 60 miles in 1.9 seconds flat and it\u2019s electric induction motor weighs just 70 pounds. The futuristic cars slick innovative design already guarantees at a classic car of the future and good news anxious investors this car has a starting price of only $250,000. Better reserve this one fast before the prices go up as this car is destined to be a surefire bestseller. With fully removable glass roof this card doubles as a convertible making it an ideal cruiser for long autonomous drives down the beach. However, if you\u2019ve got a serious need for speed the Tesla Roadster can travel over 250 miles per hour. 7. BMW 328 Hommage  So we\u2019ve seen carbon fiber, carbon titanium but how about carbon fiber reinforced plastic. Due to its lightweight bodywork, the whole car weighs in at 1720 pounds. Pretty futuristic for a car that celebrates the past. The Hommage features a variety of other materials including leather and aluminum on the exterior resembling somewhat of a suitcase appearance. A pretty unusual look for a two-seater. Perhaps the car\u2019s history can account for its bold look. Modeled after the BMW 328 touring coupe from the 1930s, the new 328 is history in motion. Because this is technically a concept car it was pretty difficult to find a price point for this bad boy. So I\u2019ll ask you, how much would you pay for this state-of-the-art blast from the past? 8. Aston Martin Valkyrie \u2013 $3.2 million  No expensive car list would ever be complete without an Aston Martin and that\u2019s why I\u2019m thrilled to include the Aston Martin Valkyrie. Marketed as their first-ever hypercar. This spicy little number of VOC\u2019s connotations of being chosen by the gods according to their website. Let\u2019s take a look under the hood to find out why it\u2019s aerodynamic full carbon fiber bodywork makes it a street-legal wunderkind for high-speed experimentation. With its V12 engine, this 1600 horsepower vehicle can go up to 250 miles per hour, and hey relatively speaking Aston Martin is seriously mass-producing these things. 150 units with a starting price of $3.2 million, it might make a nice stocking stuffer for Christmas 2020. 9. Tesla Cyber Truck \u2013 $60,000  Yep, you guessed it with all the current hype around the cyber truck you\u2019d bet it\u2019d make our list. The most noticeable thing about the Cyber Truck is its zealous design built with ultra-hard 30 x cold-rolled stainless steel. The cyber truck is one tough beast. It\u2019s sharp geometric tinted windows made of armored glass give it some serious Tron dives. This truck can go 250 miles in a single charge and with 7,500 pounds towing capacity you could tow another Tesla cyber truck on your way to the mountains. As this truck weighs about 5,000 pounds. Well, it\u2019s no Lambo Egoista, the cyber truck can reach speeds of up to 110 miles per hour. If you want in on the action you can purchase one of these bad boys for around $60,000 with some of the lower end models starting at just $40k. Now we know some of these cars like the Tesla Roadster aren\u2019t on the market just yet but hold on, these are the cars of the future in a couple of years they\u2019ll be as common as sliced bread or hovercrafts. 10. Mercedes-Benz Vision AVTR So continuing into the future I\u2019d like to end my list of Futuristic Cars with a concept car so prophetic, so mesmerizing you won\u2019t believe it\u2019s not butter. Introducing the Mercedes-Benz Vision AVTR. This concept car is hot off the press and ready to change the world one biodegradable battery at a time. The AVTR stands for \u201cAdvanced Vehicle Transformation\u201d. But the acronym also serves as a shout out to James Cameron\u2019s 2009 film Avatar. Cameron worked closely with the Mercedes-Benz team to design the car much like the film\u2019s eco-friendly message. There are virtually no earth metals used in the making of this electric car. The AVTR can go 450 miles on a single charge and here this Tesla \u2013 it charges in 15 minutes. This 469 horsepower car is equipped with front and rear steering. So essentially this car can drive sideways which will be a game-changer for those of us who are still mastering the art of parallel parking. Though this strange beauty is yet to hit the commercial markets you can be assured that this vehicle is a preview of what\u2019s to come in the near future. ",
