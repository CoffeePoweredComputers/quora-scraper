            "answer_text": "Let me start by upvoting Jesse Emspak\u2019s detailed and thoughtful response. And just add a few notions of my own. Technology is as broad and deep as say \u201cmedicine\u201d or \u201cliterature\u201d and rarely \u201cbelongs\u201d to any one nation or people. Indeed sharing - whether intended or not - is a feature of all three genres. Once a drug or a novel or a new way to make RF filters is out, it is in the nature of human knowledge to spread. Post-war Japan was hungry to import and adapt what it could, as was early Meiji Japan, from industrializing countries in the West; or going further back, 6th century AD rulers were to import Chinese technology for writing, urban design, administration and so on. Much of Japan\u2019s early post-war success was in fine-tuning PROCESS technology, in areas such as shipbuilding, continuous casting steel furnaces, myriad fibers including carbon and composites, so useful in modern aircraft; and of course bulk memory-chip fabrication - with core technology licensed from the US and other countries. (I am avoiding the use of the phrase \u201cmore advanced\u201d countries, because Japan was rarely far behind modernity and its post-modern developments ). As Jesse notes, much of Japan\u2019s contributions to \u201ctechnology\u201d are imbedded, and reliant on craftsmanship as well as mass production. Well-known are anecdotes about master craftsmen in the die and mold industry able to discern fractions of micrometer tolerances in metal molds with their fingertips. One area in which Japan has had great leadership (until deliberately pilfered by Chinese industrial spies) is in the iconic \u201cbullet\u201d train, aka Shinkansen, which since its debut in 1964 has gone thru many upgrades. (France has remarkable parallel technology to Japan, btw, a rarely noted \u201cnational\u201d excellence, eg. La Grande Vitesse etc.) Little known is the complexity of the collaborative technologies that had to be harnessed to make the Shinkansen a reality back in 1964, just in time for the Tokyo Olympic Games. Key elements include the rails, and the steel-making prowess that allows steel to be durable yet pliable at those speeds. Nippon Steel reinvented steel-making in that era, continuous casting requires superb process controls and metallurgical science. Patience as well as confidence. A bullet train does not have a \u201clocomotive\u201d per se. Japan Railway engineers with their industrial partners put a motor in each rail-carriage. Wow, what an insight. But computers were also needed to compute the speeds, braking time, etc. to ensure second-by-second precision. And as some of you know, even the terminal station cleaning staff employ smart human \u201ctechnology.\u201d By turning around each train in less than 15 minutes, these humble cleaners earn the JR companies tens of millions of dollars by improving the productivity of the valuable railcar assets. Do the math. Four Tokyo to Osaka trips per hour instead of three. (My back of envelop math suggests the annual boost to revenue is \u00a511.3 billion, or about $100 million - from a cleaning crew!) Toyota also deployed a \u201chuman\u201d technology in its constant improvement, kanban, and suggestion-box strategies in the assembly plants. Because Toyota used so many supplier companies, that knowledge soon spread across Japan helping others achieve astounding QC (quality control) success. Let me note, it is NOT achieved by robots, but by management and staff working patiently together, even today. Where Japan in the past 20\u201330 years has fallen behind is in the networked language-is-not-an-obstacle-system conception of the global market. Akio Morita at Sony not only created the original Walkman portable audio player, he invented the digital camera, and was an early proponent of GPS in consumer devices. Jesse talks about a \u201cdevice\u201d focus in Japanese IT companies - a fact Steve Jobs was supremely able to capitalize on, and in his wickedly successful way, he quite brutally spread tech ideas from Japan to Taiwanese and Korean rivals to encourage faster and cheaper development. iTunes was mirrored in globalism by Facebook, Google, Twitter et al. Two-byte coding was learned in the 1980s, allowing those global players to use ANY language on Earth. Meanwhile Japan still at times struggles with apps that only allow JIS text encoding. Some called it the Galapagos Effect, and it has not gone away. Buy a nice DSLR camera and try to access the firmware, software, updates. OMG. But of course most Russian and French apps are as provincial. (Maybe it took an immigrant-fed culture like America\u2019s to finally perceive that the Tower of Babel is a resource, not an obstacle.) Bit still, it may be that only thanks to the combination of the fertile Silicon Valley \u201cpetri-dish\u201d of venture capital, skilled personnel willing to move for more interesting stock options, nearby world-class engineering schools, and the \u201cjust-right\u201d distance from the military-aerospace complex in SoCal. DARPA projects were likely more suited to the NoCal mentality. NOWHERE else on Earth is there anything akin to Silicon Valley - though China is pedal to the metal to recreate the meme. But who else had a Rome back then, a Florence in the Renaissance, a Cambridge-Oxford hotbed when radar and code-cracking were so desperately needed? China is probably the place to watch. Like Florence, \u201cmorality\u201d will NOT GET IN THE WAY of progress. (I would say we are at the cusp of Pax Sinica. Ouch.) Yet at the end of the day, \u201ctechnology is a human race\u201d - to develop, to deploy, to IPO, to hack, to regret. Sony stalwarts may regret Steve getting the idea not only for the iPod, but for iTunes, and then the duh follow-on, iPhone, all based on the Sony WalkMan. But Steve walked those hard, lonely miles in the Wilderness. (If you take the \u201clong-view\u201d fear not the \u201cdemise of the West\u201d or the \u201crise of China\u201d because it is likely a coin-toss and either one unstoppable as it was in the past. China\u2019s dynasties oscillate between brilliance and barbarism - EXACTLY as those in the West, South, North and North-East etc. My beloved Scandinavian Vikings were shall we say, both cruel and compassionate. Hehehe.) But let\u2019s not forget, a brilliant Japanese engineer discovered the \u201cquantum effect\u201d by which electrons morph into photons and vice versa. Thanks to him, LED lamps and photovoltaic energy farms. Japan has its share of Nobel laureates - a tribute to a culture that admires and promotes learning, and by oversight, allows genius, creativity to flourish. DARPA loosed rather than tightened bureaucracy. We\u2019ll see what China\u2019s Xin Jinping will do. ",

            "answer_text": "I think this is one of those questions that depends on what you mean by \u201ctechnology\u201d and how you value different things. Let me explain a bit. In the US, we love planned obsolescence. That is, very little is made to last; we decided as a cultural matter a long time ago that new is better, and \u201cnew\u201d means anything less than a few years old. Many businesses in the US, in fact, are built on the idea that you will buy something new after only a few years. Cars are one example \u2014 we have ads telling us to buy a new one every year, but odds are your car will last a decade or two with care. Is there much difference between a car built for 2017 and one in 2015? Not really. (The extra bells and whistles have little to do with the function of the car). I have a TV that is 10 years old and is just fine, it\u2019s even a flat LCD. But companies upgrade models every year or two. In Japan the situation is very different. They never really bought into planned obsolescence as a culture. It just didn\u2019t take off the way it did here in the US. There are a dozen reasons for this I could come up with, from memory of wartime privation (this is probably why it doesn\u2019t fly real well in Europe either) to the way their culture looks at art and craftsmanship. So there\u2019s a lot of technologies they use that seem old hat here in the US, but really, they\u2019ve been refining stuff because they know it works. Further, I\u2019d posit that there\u2019s a certain sense of craftsmanship that\u2019s deeply embedded in the way they view making things. An American manager will say, \u201cmake the chair good enough, if it breaks someone will buy another\u201d in Japan, making a chair, even a cheap one, anything but beautiful and durable would be hard to swallow. This is why even gift boxes of cheap cardboard are so beautifully made there, I submit. Why do I bring all this up? Because the Japanese innovations, and there are many, have all been affected by this kind of philosophical difference. In the US we love the term \u201cdisruption.\u201d We say that if it\u2019s new and different, it must be better. Japanese people would say, \u201cwhy is that so?\u201d and it\u2019s not an invalid question. When I look at what was on offer from the Japanese electronics industry (I was at the 2011 CES) one thing I noticed was a penchant for discrete devices \u2014 there was this real sense of \u201cright tool, right job.\u201d In the US people liked more generalist devices, and there\u2019s kind of this holy grail of making a single device that does everything. In Japan the philosophy is different, they\u2019d ask why you need that, because designing generalist devices is actually pretty hard, and doesn\u2019t always get the results you want. (Look at the struggle to make the Internet of things work for people \u2014 does your toaster really need to be Internet-connected?). So in that sense I would say in Japan there\u2019s a lot of great-quality stuff that gets made, and interesting innovations, geared to devices and tools that do specific things well. And the country is still a net technology exporter. About the only area I can think of where they are significantly behind the US might be aviation technology, but that\u2019s in part due to the war and the wholesale destruction of that industry; the Japanese were ahead of their US counterparts in 1939\u201341 in some areas. Other answers have noted that the ubiquity of online shopping and credit cards isn\u2019t there in Japan. But again, I\u2019d say that the reasons are that cash works well enough, and there\u2019s no cultural imperative to be connected all the time to buy things. (However there\u2019s a thriving online culture there in social media and the like; Japanese people are online as much as Americans are, they just don\u2019t order everything that way and don\u2019t believe in taking on debt. This is not a technological issue, though). Often in Japan there\u2019s a lot of really advanced technology all over the place. But you just can\u2019t see it because it\u2019s running all the stuff behind the scenes. This too is where the design philosophy difference shows up. In the US we love visible technology, but we hate the idea of spending on the invisible stuff like the electrical grid or the water pipes. In Japan there\u2019s much more investment in behind-the-scenes stuff. This is one reason that the trains there run so well; there\u2019s been a massive investment in the underlying infrastructure. So the answer to your query might be better addressed with the old saying: not better or worse, just different, reflecting different needs and different ideas of what makes \u201cgood technology.\u201d ",
