            "answer_text": "NetBIOS is an acronym for Network Basic Input/Output System. It provides services related to the session layer of the OSI model allowing applications on separate computers to communicate over a local area network. As strictly an API, NetBIOS is not a networking protocol. It was created by IBM for its early PC Network, was adopted by Microsoft, and has since become a de facto industry standard. NetBIOS provides the session and transport services described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. However, it does not provide a standard frame or data format for transmission. A standard frame format is provided by NetBUI. NetBIOS provides two communication modes: session or datagram. Session mode lets two computers establish a connection for a \"conversation,\" allows larger messages to be handled, and provides error detection and recovery. Datagram mode is \"connectionless\" (each message is sent independently), messages must be smaller, and the application is responsible for error detection and recovery. Datagram mode also supports the broadcast of a message to every computer on the LAN. Ref: What is NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)? - Definition from WhatIs.com ",
