            "answer_text": "Local recycling centerBulk pickup day (sidewalk).If the computer is older than a Core 2 Duo, forget it. A Core 2 Duo booting Xubuntu works great as a web browsing machine. Older gear tend to use a lot of electricity. Pentium 4s used 120 watts!. Core 2 Duo and later CPUs (business grade) average 50 watts or less. New computer gear is so cheap now that old parts really aren\u2019t worth recycling. Even older monitors suck .. electricity. Smaller than 19\u2033 \u2014 throw it away. LED-backlit LCDs flatscreens use half the the electricity of older CCFL backlit LCDs. Use Kill-A-Watt to determine if something is worth keeping. Yes, the old gear is free, but the electricity it uses may eat you out of house and home. ",

There is also the way that everyone know, but is illegal (it\u2019s stealing) and is highly frowned upon and not suggested. ",
