            "answer_text": "Sweden. Lots of criminal activity doesn\u2019t appear in the official statistics due to political reasons (e.g., balcony women). From Wikipedia: There has been debate in the media about the crime rate in Sweden, and further debate about how crime has been affected by the accumulated immigration and refugee influx. Some international media have claimed that the refuge immigrants in Sweden created dangerous neighborhoods that are now \"no-go zones\" for Swedish police. Several pieces by Norsk rikskringkasting, the state-run media channel in the neighbouring country Norway have described the \"no-go zones\" as areas in which ambulances, the fire brigade and police are routinely attacked, with reporter Anders Magnus in 2016 threatened and hurled rocks at by masked men when he tried to make interviews in Husby. Norwegian minister of immigration and integration Sylvi Listhaug and opposition politician B\u00e5rd Vegard Solhjell said that they were \"shocked\" by the emergence of no-go zones in Sweden. Another incidence of foreign journalists attacked in a Stockholm suburb includes the Australian team of Liz Hayes from CBS's 60 minutes in Rinkeby in 2016, working with anti-immigration activist Jan Sjunnesson, in which a member of the crew was allegedly dragged into a building during filming and punched and kicked by several people. In 2017, independent investigative journalist Tim Pool was escorted out of Rinkeby by police, \"as many men were getting agitated by our presence\". However, Swedish police authorities claimed that Pool was not formally escorted out of the area, as no police report on the incident was filed. After his visit to Sweden, Pool concluded that Sweden \"has real problems\". While Swedish police have objected to use of the term \"no-go zones,\" an official report from the Swedish Police Authority published in December 2015 describes certain areas in Sweden where the police are having difficulties completing police tasks. They may be met with hostility and violence from crowds attacking police patrols by throwing stones at them and burning police cars, which at times force the police to postpone an intervention. This aggression is also directed at other official representatives of Swedish public institutions such as ambulance and fire brigade personnel. Fifteen specific areas are categorized as particularly critical areas (sv:S\u00e4rskilt utsatta omr\u00e5den) where incidents like these often take place. Swedish-Kurdish economist Tino Sanandaji said that due to fear of being perceived as racists, it has been taboo in Sweden to describe the situation in vulnerable areas due to their having a high fraction of immigrants.

            "answer_text": "The answer is Greenland. Greenland is part of Denmark, so it is technically part of Scandinavia. According to the Wikipedia list of countries by intentional death rate, it is number one in the entire world. It is followed by Honduras at number 2. The homicide rate is not nearly the highest in the world at 19.2 per 100K, but it stands out like a lighthouse over the other Scandinavian countries and territories. 19.2 is horribly high. Finland, if you consider it part of Scandinavia (it is \u201cNordic\u201d), comes in at a distant second place, at 2.2 per 100K, which is less than half of the USA at 4.8, while Finland\u2019s neighbour Estonia has 5.9, but it is not part of Scandinavia. Finland\u2019s rate of 2.2 is more than double Sweden\u2019s 1 and Denmark\u2019s .9 and Norway\u2019s rock bottom .6. So the core Scandinavian countries in Northern Europe are rather safe places to live. Iceland is even lower, at .3. (I didn\u2019t expect to find this out about Greenland\u2026 shocked) ",
