            "answer_text": "First and Foremost- Plan Based on Your Budget These days, you can buy a usable laptop for under \u20b912000, but if you can budget more, you'll get a system with better build quality, stronger performance and a better display. Here's what you can get for each price range. \u20b911000 to \u20b915000: The least-expensive notebooks are either Chromebooks, which run Google's browser-centric OS, or low-end Windows systems with minimal storage and slower processors, such as the HP Stream 11 Use these as secondary computers only or give them to the kids.\u20b915000 to \u20b930000: For well under \u20b930000, you can get a notebook with an Intel Core i3 or AMD A8 CPU, 4 to 8GB of RAM, and a 500GB hard drive, all respectable specs. However, at this price, most notebooks don't have an SSD, a 720p display or long battery life.\u20b930000to\u20b9 60000 : As you get above \u20b960000, you'll start to see more premium designs, such as metal finishes. Manufacturers also start to add in other features as you climb the price ladder, including higher-resolution displays and SSDs.Above \u20b9 60000: At this price range, expect notebooks that are more portable, more powerful or both. Expect higher-resolution screens, faster processors and possibly discrete graphics. The lightest, longest-lasting ultraportables, like the Apple MacBook and the Dell XPS 13, tend to coat more(although you can get the Dell for less if you don't opt for a touch screen). High-end gaming systems and mobile workstations usually cost upward \u20b9100000. Pick Your Specs Notebook components such as processor, hard drive, RAM and graphics chip can confuse even notebook aficionados, so don't feel bad if spec sheets look like alphabet soup to you. Here are the main components to keep an eye on. CPU: The \"brains\" of your computer, the processor has a huge influence on performance, but depending on what you want to do, even the least-expensive model may be good enough. Here's a rundown.Intel Core i5: If you're looking for a mainstream laptop with the best combination of price and performance, get one with an Intel Core i5 CPU. Models that end in U (ex: Core i5-7200U) are the most common. Those with the a Y in the name are low power and have worse performance while models with an HQ offer four cores. Intel's latest-generation, \"Kaby Lake\" CPUs have model numbers that begin with 7 (ex: Core i5-7300U) so look for those to get the best performance.Intel Core i7: High-end performance for gaming rigs and workstations. Models with numbers that end in HQ or K use higher wattage and have four cores, allowing for even faster gaming and productivity. There are also Core i7 Y series chips that have lower power and performance. Keep an eye out for CPUs that have a 7 in the model number (ex: Core i7-7820HQ) because they are part of Intel's latest, 7th Generation Core Series, and offer better performance.Intel Core i3: Performance is just a step below Core i5 and so is the price. If you can possibly step up to a Core i5, we recommend it.AMD A, FX or E Series: Found on low-cost laptops, AMD's processors -- the company calls them APUs rather than CPUs -- provide decent performance for the money that's good enough for web surfing, media viewing and productivity.Intel Atom: Found on very low-cost laptops -- think 12000 and under -- Atom offers basic performance but more battery life than Celeron/Pentium.Intel Pentium / Celeron: Common in sub \u20b920000 laptops, these chips are a little faster than Atom, but offer worse battery life. If you can pay more to get a Core i3 or i5, you'd be better off.RAM: Some sub-\u20b912000 laptops come with only 2GB of RAM, but ideally you want at least 4GB on even a budget system and 8GB if you can spend just a little more. For most users, 16GB or more is overkill. Storage Drive (aka Hard Drive): Even more important than the speed of your CPU is the performance of your storage drive. If you can afford it and don't need a ton of internal storage, get a laptop with a solid state drive (SSD) rather than a hard drive, because you'll see at least three times the speed and a much faster laptop overall. Among SSDs, the newer PCIe x4 (aka NVME) units offer triple the speed of traditional SATA drives. Sub-\u20b912000 laptops use eMMC memory, which is technically solid-state but not faster than a mechanical hard drive. Display: The more pixels you have, the more content you can fit on-screen, and the sharper it will look. Most budget and mainstream laptops have 1366 x 768 displays, but if you can afford it, we recommend paying extra for a panel that runs at 1920 x 1080, also known as full HD or 1080p. Some higher-end laptops have screens that are 2560 x 1600, 3200 x 1800 or even 3840 x 2160, which all look sharp but consume more power, lowering your battery life. Touch Screen: If you're buying a regular clamshell laptop, rather than a 2-in-1, you won't get much benefit from a touch screen and you will get 1 to 3 hours less battery life. On 2-in-1s, touch screens come standard. Graphics Chip: If you're not playing PC games, creating 3D objects or doing high-res video editing, an integrated graphics chip (one that shares system memory) will be fine. If you have any of the above needs, though, a discrete graphics processor from AMD or Nvidia is essential. As with CPUs, there are both high- and low-end graphics chips. Nvidia maintains a list of its graphics chips from low to high end, as does AMD. DVD/Blu-ray Drives. Few laptops come with optical drives, because all software and movies are downloadable. However, if you really need to read / write discs and your laptop of choice doesn't come with a built-in DVD drive, you can always buy an external one that connects via USB for under \u20b91500.

            "answer_text": "What are you gonna use it forThere is really a wide variety of laptops out them with loads and loads of features. So first try to find out the main use of your laptop. E.G If it's for office purpose, you don't need heavy specs for that.Don't buy last gen processorThe thing about computers, especially laptops is that they are improving at a really drastic level. What it means is that the current gen processor is significantly faster than that of the previous gen processor. So if you're planning to use it for 4\u20135 years, you'll end up with a pretty slow processor which in turn case your system to lag GO FOR A DEDICATED GRAPHICS CARDA dedicated card is not only useful for multimedia and games but also reduces the work load of the processor. A integrated graphics card uses the CPU cores for processing data which in turn burns out the processor. Make sure what are the ports/accessories availableSee a powerful laptop in a bargain price? Check out its ports. Chances are you'll get only 2 usb and maybe no CD-Drive. People always come to the conclusion that \u201c2 USB ports are enough\u201d. I promise you THEY ARE NOT!!! E.g. Suppose you are printing something and the data you have is stored in an external storage device. You try to put in the device but oh no\u2026 you don't have any usb ports left because your mouse and printer are connected. See my point here. 2 USB ports are never enough. Also make sure you have a DVD/blueray reader and a VGA port. Some say they are obselete but soon you'll find out 90% of projectors and monitors on VGA rather than HDMI and people still use CDs and most of your office or school data we'll come through DVDs. Don't spend money on gaming laptopsIf you're planning to buy a gaming laptop, don't. Go for a desktop as they are Easily upgradable, unlike laptops where it is really limitedCosts way lessMeans the same as gaming laptops run on full power only when plugged in, which basically makes it a desktop.Overheating issues in laptopBasically gaming destroys a laptops battery.Laptops do give you the option of portability though so if you move quite a lot than gaming laptop may seem to make sense but then again, to run the modern AAA games you need a seriously powerful and expensive laptop which is gonna be outdated in 2 years time. So these are the things I think you should go through before buying a laptop. Upvote if you like the answer ",
