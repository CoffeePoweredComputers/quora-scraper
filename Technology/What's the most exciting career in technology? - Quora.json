            "answer_text": "Meet Marques Brownlee aka MKBHD.  Like many of us this guy is a tech freak, loves owning and using new gadgets. But unlike many of us, this guy made a unique career out of reviewing gadgets and technologies. He joined youtube in 2008 and started reviewing basic products that he already owned consisting of just an image where he wouldd talk about it.. His first several hundred videos were primarily hardware tutorials, and freeware.  He was later approached by companies to demonstrate their paid software and hardware, but only reviews products that would be of interest to his audience of technology enthusiasts.  He is noted for responding to viewers' feedback about what questions they have, and features they want explained, as well as demonstrating a \"deep knowledge of the products he discusses, and his understanding of what his audience wants to learn.\"His reviews are often timely, coming out the same day or soon after for anticipated products. He is arguably best known today for his content about hand-held devices.  As of December 2015, his channel has gained over three million subscribers,making MKBHD the most subscribed-to 'tech-based' YouTube channel. On average, Brownlee uploads one video per week. The channel receives an average of 2,000 subscribers every day (as of July 2015). I think this is one of the most unique, if not safe careers related to technology and love for gadgets and proves that you can be an expert at anything if you pick your career in something that you love.

            "answer_text": "Personally I think IT Security would be the most exciting field. (Probably one of the most lucrative as well.) If you have a gift of learning how to poke through security and coming up with way to get around security then it can be really fun. A lot of it can be pretty mundane but what job doesn't have that quality? Reading over code, dissecting binaries, watching packets - all can get really boring at times. But when you get through someone's security it can get exciting. I will suggest that you work on becoming a \"white hat hacker\" rather than a \"Black Hat Hacker\". It may seem really cool to be on the edge of the law but when they catch up to you (and they almost always do eventually) you will hate life more than you thought you could. ",
