FIVE CHANGES THAT GLIMPSE THE EDUCATION OF THE FUTURE WITH TECHNOLOGY The educational transformation advances at a dizzying pace. In a very short time, technology has had a great impact on teaching, completely changing the outlook for the future. Today, students would not understand an education without online platforms for notes and homework, collaborative software for group work or the use of social networks as part of training.  Below we will see five changes to which education will be focused in the coming decades thanks to technology: 1. The classrooms will disappear as we know them. In the future, classes will not consist of spending hours sitting in desks and in front of blackboards, elements that little by little they will be lost sight of. The desks will adapt to the needs of the students. For example, when they have problems concentrating or if they need more space or a place for group work. Likewise, interactive projectors will end up replacing the interactive whiteboards that already exist in many educational centers. As part of these changes, the walls will also create adaptable spaces. 2. The rise of gamification Gamification (using game mechanics for teaching) is more fashionable than ever and it seems that it will not stop. This method of training will play an essential role. It is particularly popular in companies focused on objectives, but it is increasingly seen in education. Although this technology is relatively new in the sector, new platforms are emerging that will make teaching a lot more interactive and fun. 3. Augmented reality Increased reality is increasingly considered an innovative educational resource, capable of immersing students in subjects through 4D environments. The possibilities are endless: from conducting chemistry experiments without the dangers involved, to talking to English natives without moving from the classroom. The main advantage is that geographic and financial barriers will cease to exist. It will be much cheaper and easier to provide students with an enriched education. It will also involve adding sound, video and interaction to a flat world where the text reigned. 4. Collaboration and flexibility Tools such as cloud storage or Google Docs are already a reality of the educational transformation. This technology allows collaborations between students from anywhere in the world in real time and significantly reduces the cost of paper. In terms of flexibility, in the future it will be possible to adapt the tasks to the different learning styles. In this way students' competences can be assessed in a more appropriate way to their profiles. Each student has needs, strengths and weaknesses that can not be evaluated in a homogeneous way. 5. The impact of online training Today, a thirteen-year-old student with only one email account can complete free studies in a wide variety of academic disciplines, and for free. There are thousands of courses taught by professors from the most prestigious universities in the world. Therefore, there will be no need to spend four years going to classes to obtain a training that can sometimes be repetitive or not fully adapted to the student's objectives. ",

            "answer_text": "The future of education technology is increased engagement, cohesion and cooperation from teachers and school leadership with regards to digital initiatives. As much as we love to fantasise about the role that future tech could play in the classroom; 3D printing, AR, robotics, VR, drones, interactive holograms etc. the reality is that we\u2019re not even truly making the most of what is available now. Coupled with a year-on-year reduction in school IT budgets (at least in the UK) means schools are expected to do more with less; which means no 3D holo-dinosaurs rampaging throughout the lesson any time soon. EdTech has exploded over the last decade but, personally, I don\u2019t believe the attitudes have completely caught up yet; by which I mean schools having a forward-facing attitude towards the technology they have and how to make the most of it. Many educators teaching today are from the blackboard era. This includes things like hiring teachers with progressive, growth-mindset attitudes towards EdTech and not treating it as a circus curiosity, and whole-school training in these areas which comes from the top rather than from the ICT teachers. Once attitude, training and engagement are fixed, I would then encourage schools to examine their current workflows and see how tech can be introduced into them to improve and modernise them; such as going completely paperless, using Google or Office365 for digital homework collection, and encouraging students to be more proactive in class through things like live content sharing and peer-to-peer learning through their laptop or Chromebook. If a new \u2018baseline\u2019 is established for technology adoption in class, then the rest would certainly follow\u2026as would the 3D holo-dinosaurs! ",
