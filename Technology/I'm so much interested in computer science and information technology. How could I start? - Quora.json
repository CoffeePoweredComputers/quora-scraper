            "answer_text": "Oh man, is THIS an open ended question. So, first, pick what you want to learn about. IT and CS have so many subfields it\u2019s crazy. For starters hit up a website like Codecademy - learn to code, interactively, for free and learn to write in a language. Any language, really. You just want to get an idea for how programming works and computers think. Additionally, read a book like the Mike Meyer\u2019s guides for the CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+. These books will give you a really general overview (and prepare you for certifications) of the core facets of IT. After that the sky is the limit, friend. ",

If you are student, take computer science classes, otherwise go online and learn computer science, learn programming, and get certified in programming languages. Hope this Helped! ",
