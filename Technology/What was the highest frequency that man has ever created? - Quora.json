            "answer_text": "Photons in the lab system? At least ~100 GeV, which corresponds to 2*10^25 Hz. I would expect that the LHC collisions produced some photons with up to ~1 TeV, too, which adds one order of magnitude to this value. Photons in any arbitrary system? There is no limit to the frequency, as it just depends on the system where you calculate the frequency. Relativistic, quantum-mechanical frequency of particles in the lab system? 4 TeV, or 10^27 Hz for protons in the LHC. Again, in other systems this number is different. ",
