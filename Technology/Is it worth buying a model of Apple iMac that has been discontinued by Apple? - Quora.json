            "answer_text": "Depends on which models you\u2019re talking about.\u2020 Anything pre-2011. Really not at all. They can\u2019t run the latest OS and their hardware is so outdated. What\u2019s more, the 2009\u20132010 models had some really stark hardware flaws that are very expensive to fix. They were hard to recommend when they were new, much less 8\u201312 years later. 2011 is a maybe. It was one of the best models of iMacs ever (along with the whole Mac line in 2011) and made for great, lower cost Macs to start out with when they hit the used market after a few years. In addition to some great processors and other features, they also came with Thunderbolt which allowed for some great expandability, including the ability to add USB 3.0 and USB C, but also the ability to add an external graphics card. These were great machines. Unfortunately, they have finally lost support for macOS and are not able to run the current version of macOS 10.14 Mojave. With an SSD and increased memory and installation of macOS 10.13 High Sierra, they still make for great machines (I\u2019m typing this answer on a 2011 iMac right now), but we\u2019re reaching a point of diminishing returns with them. 2012-present models for sure. These are all great models with current software support and many of them had the options of SSDs. It can be hard to install your own SSD, but with Thunderbolt you can expand almost endlessly. Obviously, this is predicated on getting a good price. I recently purchased a 2013 iMac for under $300 (they typically sell for upwards of $1000) because it was dropped and the bottom is dented and the screen is cracked. It works for my purposes. \u2020This answer was written October of 2018 and can be assumed to be up to date to that time. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean something like a 2016 or 2017 Apple iMac still in its box\u2014something that\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d (meaning unused), although it\u2019s an older or discontinued model? If it\u2019s a matter of affordability, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate. If you\u2019re buying a used machine that\u2019s older than a year or two, I\u2019d have it checked out first. And if a tech-savvy person gives it a clean bill of health, I\u2019d go for it. Heck, I\u2019m using a 2009 MacBook Pro. It\u2019s ready to receive its last rites\u2014I\u2019ve had to replace the keyboard, remove the battery and disconnect the trackpad\u2014and often goes dark without warning. I suspect that\u2019s because it has been subject to rough handling, bouncing along in an unpadded backpack stashed in the trunk of my car in fifty thousand-plus miles of road trips over its lifetime. The fact that this MacBook works at all is a testament to its fundamental robustness and superior design. I\u2019ve had issues with it, of course. It\u2019s running Mac OS X 10.8.4, which browsers like Google Chrome and Firefox no longer support. Apple\u2019s own non-serious software applications like Pages can\u2019t be opened. But that\u2019s OK as long as I have BBEdit, my text-editing software of choice. It\u2019s different with an Apple iMac. The iMac is a desktop, so chances are good that even if it\u2019s a used machine, it hasn\u2019t been subjected to much abuse. Besides, it\u2019s a workhorse\u2014built to last. ",
