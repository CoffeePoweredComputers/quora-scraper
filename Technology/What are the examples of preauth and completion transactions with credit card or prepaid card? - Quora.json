            "answer_text": "A verification is done to ensure that the card is good and the credentials the cardholder entered were accurate. Using a verification is standard process for adding new users or for someone about to use a metered service. (Uber or Lyft for example checking to make sure the card is still good before they let you ride.) An authorization might be done for a couple reasons. The first would be to make sure the amount being charged is available, as well as having the benefits of a verification mentioned above. Another reason would be if you're shipping physical goods. A company may authorize the card and then not capture until the physical good ships. This helps reduce chargebacks and general concerns from cardholders. ",

            "answer_text": "Pre Auth transaction is authorizing your Card details in prior . Best example is the app Booking.Com . As soon as we book the Hotel on the app, It will ask for card details . It will just ask for card details but not Cut the money from the Card . If its not cutting the amount, then why details ? If you book the Hotel \u2026and its confirmed. So, different hotels have different plans. You can cancel some hotels till the date of Entering for free. Then Not a problem .Some Hotels, You cannot cancel once booked . If you attempt to cancel, then the amount will be cut from the Card :) .Its a good method. But quite confusing . Cheers ",
