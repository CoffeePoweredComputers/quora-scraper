            "answer_text": "Recent iPhone models are made from pretty premium material. Recent iPhone models like the 8, 8+ and X are the most premium iPhone in the whole iPhone line up. With glass back on all iPhone 8, 8+ and X. Aluminium frame on the 8 and 8+ but for the X, it\u2019s stainless steel. So all these premium materials are pretty slippery. Even a more expensive and premium material like Titanium, Sapphire Glass, Ceramic ect. are slippery. If Apple were to address issues like you\u2019ve asked, then their phone would feel like a Nokia phone. Made of plastic, polycarbonate or even rubber will make the phone feel super cheap. Best solution is to buy a skin or case which are good for grip. ",
