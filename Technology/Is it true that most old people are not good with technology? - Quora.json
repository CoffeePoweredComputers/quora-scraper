            "answer_text": "I\u2019m 65, and it is certainly not true for me. I am a still employed Silicon Valley engineer who has spent the last thirty years working for Apple, Adobe, eBay, Microsoft, VMware, Cisco, etc. helping to create and perfect that very kind of technology. In case you don\u2019t understand what that means let me be a little more specific about that. Most young people are not as good with technology as this old person. I bet that sounds like a stereotype, right? It is. And even though that statement is true, it serves no useful purpose whatsoever in real life to say something like that. I have been to 20 countries in my lifetime and met many hundreds if not thousands of people all over the world in all races, cultures, and age groups. Consequently, there is only one stereotype that works for me. It is the notion that each and every person \u2014 whether presently living or ever lived \u2014 is a unique and one-of-kind person. I have never met any two people who were anything alike. Stereotypes are mostly for people who are too intellectually lazy to think for themselves or unwilling to evaluate people just as they actually are. They serve no useful purse that I can think of. Take each person just as you see them and know them; and, throw away the useless baggage of stereotypes. You\u2019ll be better off if you do. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is a recent story that illustrates how this perception can be misleading. Just over a week ago, my wife's mid-80s uncle suffered a mild stroke. Its onset was slow so he was able to talk on the telephone. His same age friend went over to see how he as doing as he was in denial about what was going on. He resisted going to the hospital, asserting whatever was going on would just pass. So the friend whipped out his phone, similar to the one I'm typing on now, Googled up the symptoms of a stroke, showed them to our uncle who then said, I've got all of those. Off to the hospital they went and all is now fine. Motivated old people keep up with technology. Many don't because they believe, correctly or not, that it adds little to enhance their lives. They settle at a level of technology that serves their needs and interests. PS \u2014 just to stir the pot a bit on the ongoing topic here on Quora about socialized medicine, this event took place in Canada. Our uncle was in and out of a local general hospital, not a stroke centre, with diagnosis and treatment in about three hours on a weekend, and got in to see both his family physician and a neurologist within three days. All for the cost of parking. ",
