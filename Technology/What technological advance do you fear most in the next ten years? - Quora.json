I fear the snowflaking of the big social and ecommerce by the left. These systems are firmly in the grip of the country\u2019s left wing, and are deploying their power to attack and damage conservatives and libertarians. The demonetization of conservative videos, the clearly biased \u201cfact checking\u201d systems which never seem to call out left wing sites and pundits for their mistakes and dishonesty, the vicious treatment handed out to Jame Damore and his colleague at Google, the list goes on and on and on. There are more subtle things taking place. For instance, Amazon censoring independent book author\u2019s covers if they have have a picture of a hot chick holding a gun. That\u2019s OK for James Bond novels, but you, uh, no. Everyone knows that pictures of hot chicks holding guns leads to guys who can\u2019t get dates shooting up schools. We need David Hogg, gun control\u2019s own mini me version of Elmer Gantry, to get cracking on the entire issue. Amazon has entirely too much power in the book industry. If movie studios were told by the government they couldn\u2019t own theaters, then Amazon, which has achieved a monopsony in ebook distribution, should be told to get out of the ebook publishing business. The Zon has rigged the pricing market for indie authors, controls the most prominent review site (Goodreads), controls the industry standard format for publishing ebooks, sends out creepy bots to censor reviews if god forbid you and another person happen to be in the same online meetup group, etc., etc., etc. That\u2019s way too much literary and publishing power concentrated in the hands of an organization with a clear left wing bias. I will be writing in greater detail about these issues in the third edition of \u201cIn Search of Stupidity: Over 20 (now 30) Years of High-Tech Marketing Disasters.\u201d (If you\u2019ve read this and are interested in receiving an advanced review copy, my contact info is up on the Softletter website.

            "answer_text": "Personally, I fear AI the most, but in the next 10 years, I fear people\u2019s reaction to AI more than the AI itself. AI will certainly allow fewer people to do certain jobs than have been needed in the past. Joblessness and underemployment will lead to societal problems but it may not be easy for society to diagnose and solve those problems within the next 10 years. The result will be an increase in crime and more anti-elitism and populism. In a similar vein, manufacturing is poised to be revolutionized. There are certain manufacturing jobs that are still labor intensive and require humans. These are the jobs that are often done in developing countries because labor tends to be cheaper there. As it happens, robotics advances will be coming online in the next decade that will likely render many of those jobs unnecessary. You won\u2019t be able to point to any specific technological advance that did it because it will actually be a series of small, seemingly innocuous advances. Unfortunately, this is all happening at a time when technological advances are driving significant medical advances. That means the need for people to work is going to go up. Together, these have the potential to upend our world trade and social system and it is coming (or even causing) a shift in how we relate to each other. I think we are unlikely to have the optimal reaction to these changes within the next decade, though I remain hopeful about the next century. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, there! It\u2019s a rather interesting question. Every now and then I ask myself about it, but the matter of fact is that I don\u2019t fear any technological advances. Moreover, I am sure that technologies are designed to make life easier for people. So if you don\u2019t mind, I will focus on the most promising trends of the next decade including: Mobile commerce. Time is money and mobile payments are intended to save this time for life. This technology is also very useful for retailers as merchants could be in instant contact with customers. No random movements, no needs to go shopping in the mall - everything is on your phone, just click and pay. Card-to-cloud transition. Contactless cards are already the common part of the daily life. As recent surveys show, UK in-store contactless payments overtake PIN and chip: June analysis has 51% of such transactions being contactless, July has 52%. But it\u2019s still not enough for today\u2019s customers. People spent almost half of the day glued to the screens of gadgets, so merchants try to meet consumer\u2019s needs. As a result, card-to-cloud transition may happen in the nearest future. There are other fintech technologies that will definitely have an impact on our lives and lives of the next generation. You can read here more about these trends. Summing up my answer: I am not afraid of any technological advances and I am still sure that they will make our life easier. Thank for the question, Rick Wilz ;) ",

            "answer_text": "The problem is that any technology which could be a danger is also a technology which could be a benefit. AI is the obvious big bogey-man, but AI also has the potential to free humanity from drudgery, and if fusion power is achieved so we have plentiful energy, AI can free us from poverty as well. Even low-level AI is making a difference. One example is court issues: I had a problem a while back with an officer who was trying to find any way at all to get me into jail (to the extent of issuing a citation for \u201cmisappropriation of state resources\u201d \u2014 for building a dam in a creek on the beach!), but no way could I afford a lawyer. But I found a place that uses AI to find past related cases, and using it I got a list of precedents, several dozen of them including some from an angle I wouldn\u2019t have thought of. Using those, I put together my case and pretty much wiped the floor with the officer \u2014 who was warned by the judge against harassing and persecuting! Even good sides of AI have a down side: automated calls from doctors and others make sure we\u2019re reminded of appointments, but they also mean employees aren\u2019t needed any longer to make reminder calls; automated calls about products save us from having to try to figure out what the call is even about because of thick foreign accents, but they also mean that the employees who used to do that are now out of jobs. Hector Quintanilla illustrates this with the video about Google assistant: thousands of people now employed at call centers will be losing their jobs, and probably within the year, not ten. So the technology we can most welcome is also the technology we can most fear. ",

Will this be how it will build up its dater base? So two things I looked up recently. When did slavery in Africa start? first answer up 15th century by the Portuguse. No for ever, its always been there the 1st major slave revolt was in 840 in the present day Iraq. How do women get cervical cancer? no mention of the face that women who sleep with many partners are more likely to get it than those who don\u2019t. So what information will AI produce only that which they want us to know very dangerous! ",

            "answer_text": "I know nothing about AI and I don\u2019t follow any news regarding it. Call it fate, but I was just thinking about writing something related to this and viola, an answer by Hector Quintanilla lands me on this question. I guesstimate that the situation may lead to various scenarios - AI will develop at a steady pace and displace a lot of jobs (incl white collared ones). This may result in unrest at best and complete Armageddon at worst without careful planning. There would be a war of sorts between those who don\u2019t want AI in their lives v/s those who want to implement it. This will be a messy affair and a victory of any side would not be beneficial to humanity in the long run. If the Pro-AI party wins, they would lose sense of their humanity as they would have massacred a lot of their fellow humans for a selfish goal. If the against group wins, well, they would have stopped technological evolution, but not for long, as people of the next generation will get curious and carry out the remaining works, which would make the war meaningless. This is the negative scenario.On a positive scenario, people may be open to AI displacing their jobs and making their lives more efficient. But, as one answer on Quora said (unable to recall), it is the distribution of existing resources which will be the major problem. There is enough for everyone\u2019s need, but not enough for one\u2019s greed. (MK Gandhi). Humans are greedy and selfish, wanting more and more. That is the reason development has taken place till now. That will have to change. The concept of Global Basic Income will become the talk of the century. For that, people have to discuss and work in a sensible and pragmatic way, which, based on the present human generation\u2019s, behaviour, wouldn\u2019t be feasible. If the distribution stage is planned perfectly, we are in for the best lives the world could offer.People can truly not worry about survival anymore. Even today, we are still on survival mode, with money being the major driving factor. That wouldn\u2019t be the factor anymore and we would be free to follow our wishes.Sports, Arts and other related activities would be our priorities. There will still be some issues caused by human behaviour i.e jealousy, but that would be tackled by placing some agreed upon global guidelinesFarming/ Horticulture and similar relaxing activities would also be popular. Food scarcity would not be an issue too.Those who are naturally and truly interested in furthering AI development would live in a center researching on AI development and maintenance.Those who want to focus on space exploration will be free to do and also be aided very much by robots that could offer more efficient help than most humans could ever offer.All in all, people will be able to truly \u2018follow their passion\u2019 and not bother about money/survival etc.Or, you know, Robots turn sentient, an Matrix/iRobot/ Terminator scenario where Robots are in control of humans and whatever happens in the movies might happen for real.I have fun thinking various scenarios based on what I know. This one was on my mind last night and thankfully, I got it out on writing very soon. Personally, scenario 1 is more realistic right now than 2. I truly want this aspect to to become more relevant soon, preferably within my lifetime. ",

            "answer_text": "Directed energy weapons going mainstream. There has been a lot of testing of microwave cannons and other types of secret squirrel things for decades, and thus far the data has not been shared or stolen. But that will change I am sure. If a roque group with money is able to point one with any accuracy at satellites and starts shutting them down it could begin a chain of wrecks out there which will effectively shut down manned space exploration for decades.  Same problems with nut jobs pointing their emitters at airliners. I doubt the FCC has many detector/tracker gizmos out there that can react fast enough to catch a mobile \u201cray gun\".  Now let's hear all the real scientist rebuttals. ",

In the future they will be the source of near infinite supply of precious resources. 2. Recording and Replaying Dreams  Scientis in Japan have been working on a machine that would allow this.

Until we have a standard for capability and security with no deployment of services until passed testing, there is little hope of holding down a set of rules.
