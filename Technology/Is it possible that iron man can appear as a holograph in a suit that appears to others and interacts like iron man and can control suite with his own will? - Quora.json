            "answer_text": "In comics anything is possible, you are talking something at its basic form is science fantasy. The Iron Man Mark 2 is fantasy, it is beyond our level of technology to create let alone nanite suits. So,sure if you want an Iron Man suit that projects realistic life like holograms and can control itself just as well as Stark could, why not. Realistically the suit was always controlling the vast majority of operations that allowed it to function at all. The only thing Stark did was make decisions as to which protocols to run. So, yes, in the comics or MCU your question is possible. In the real world basic power suits used in factories have to be directly connected to a power source, ie plugged in, in order to work for more than a few minutes. And all they do is pick stuff up and move it. No repulser blasts or flight or inertial dampening etc. ",
