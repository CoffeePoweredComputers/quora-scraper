            "answer_text": "The best evidence comes from an area that has largely been overlooked: random experiments. This issue is almost always examined through observational studies. In other words, people look at the raw difference in earnings and try to explain it by adjusting for different factors (education, experience, occupation, etc). In my view, these studies are flawed from the start. There are far too many factors involved, and they all have complex interrelationships. For example, it is true that women tend to go into lower paying occupations. But who's to say whether bias is the reason why those occupations are lower paying. To figure out whether gender bias is real, you really need to hold all other variables constant and isolate the effect of gender. Thay is exactly what random experiments do. They do not provide much information about the size of the effect, but they can tell you very well whether it exists. And they show overwhemingly that gender bias is indeed real. Here is one such example, in which the same applications were submitted for both genders, some under a male name and some under a female name. Despite having identical applications, the \"males\" were evaluated much higher on all categories. http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/unofficial-prognosis/study-shows-gender-bias-in-science-is-real-heres-why-it-matters/ There have been many similar experiments in areas outside of STEM.  If you want to read throught them, there are links at the bottom of this post. http://metrocosm.com/a-visual-history-of-the-gender-employment-gap/ ",

Though it talks about crowdfunding and tech start-ups, it does spend paragraphs discussing the gender gap issue in venture capital field. And for the general gender gap in the tech industry, I guess the reason is likewise. Hope it helps. Crowdfunding To Narrow The Gender Gap in Venture Capital ",
