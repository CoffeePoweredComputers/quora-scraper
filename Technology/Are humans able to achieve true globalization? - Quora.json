            "answer_text": "Able? Globalization is an ever-going process, started thousands of years before: Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Christopher Columbus, were all doing that without even knowing. The real losers are the great powers - USA, Russia, China, because even if at the beginnings they are in advance, in the long run they have to confront a real competition in economy, and to lose their privileges they now hold within UN. See the case of Spain - initially the greatest colonial power, lost it quickly to the competitors (England, Netherlands, France\u2026). There are two different drives that propels globalization: one is social (we are all crew mates/passengers on the same space ship: Earth) and the other one is technological: Internet and travel technologies(flight) enable us to go wherever we like/desire/need. At the end of the 1800s, a spiritual guide and the Founder of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, foretold it in a very expressive sentence: The world is but one country, and mankind its citizens.
