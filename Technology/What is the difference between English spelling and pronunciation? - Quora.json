            "answer_text": "The spelling is based on the pronunciation of 600 years ago. To increase the complexity, the earliest phase of English (Old English) used an entirely different system of spelling which was better suited to the language. In 1066, however, England came under the rule of French speakers, and French replaced English as the everyday spoken language of government and learning. Old English ceased to be used as a written language, and when the next phase of the language (Middle English) was written down, it was written phonetically by people whose reading language was French. In the early 15th century, Henry V of England (reigned 1413 to 1422) ordered government business to be done in English rather than French, supposedly because he didn\u2019t speak French well. The use of English was retained by his successors, and it led to a standardized written form of late Middle English, known as Chancery English because official documents were prepared in the Chancery. That standardized form of English was very similar to the Middle English of Chaucer (whose Canterbury Tales were written circa 1390), but it included innovations such as the use of they, their and them as third person plural pronouns instead of hey, hir and hem, which are found in Chaucer. The more modern forms were used in Northern England and had the advantage that they were not so easily confused with the third person singular pronouns he (masculine), her (feminine) and him (masculine and, at that time, neuter). Chancery English is said to have been adopted by the English printer Caxton, whose business included official government printing, and the use of Chancery English became the standard for written English. Caxton himself wrote about language change, using the example of eggis (\u201ceggs\u201d) replacing eyren. Again, this was an instance of a Northern form replacing the Southern form that would have been more familiar in London. Approximately 150 years after Henry V and Caxton, late Middle English had transitioned into the early Modern English of Shakespeare and the King James Bible. The spelling was essentially the same, but the grammar and some aspects of vocabulary were transformed in a way that makes Shakespeare much easier for a modern person to read than Chaucer, even though they are only about 200 years apart in time.

            "answer_text": "60% of English words have silent letters in them which can cause all sorts of problems with spelling and pronunciation. The spelling of lots of words is different from the pronunciation because our pronunciation has changed over the years while our spelling system hasn't changed much. Remember - we can see the history of the word in some spellings: knife, know, knock, knee, gnat, gnaw are all Viking words (Old Germanic). The k and g used to be pronounced. We keep the k ang g because it shows the history of the word. The history of the word is in plumber, it comes from the Latin/Roman word plumbum meaning lead (lead piping) used in plumbing.
