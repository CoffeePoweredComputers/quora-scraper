            "answer_text": "You cannot increase the ram without buying it. However if a software refused to work because you were low on ram, you could increase your swap file and the software would open. But it probably wouldn\u2019t work smoothly or nicely because a swap file cannot replace your ram. There was a piece of software from 1996 called Syncronys SoftRam95. I had actually used it and assumed it helped my then 16MB ram computer perform better. I read online a couple years ago that softram was a scam and all it did was lie to your face. It did not make the system even 1%better it was all smoke and mirrors. It was discovered that the software was fake by a team that reverse engineered the software and they realized it wasn\u2019t doing what it claimed to do at all ",
