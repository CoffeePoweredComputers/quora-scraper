            "answer_text": "Consider: your thoughts about physical therapy now are probably a lot like your thoughts on IT used to be.  You haven't studied in the field, you have limited or no experience in it, but you think you'd like it.  This sounds like the classic \"The grass is always greener on the other side.\" I know lots of students in IT who love what they do.  Some aren't crazy about a particular boss or work environment, but there are lots of open jobs, so there are alternatives.  Some don't like a particular aspect of their jobs, but that is true in nearly every profession. How many people have you heard gripe about their IT jobs?  5? 20?  2000?  Think about that a bit before you make rash decisions.  How often do you come in contact with people who may really like their jobs? Everyone hates his or her job sometimes. Keep that in mind when you hear complaints.  That said, if your foremost motivation to enroll in any major is the potential salary, that is a poor choice for a path to being happy.  Choosing to jump to PT could also result in you being unhappy, too.  Whatever choice you make should be informed and carefully thought through, preferably with some experience to back it up. If you like zoology, then consider it!  If you like medicine and zoology then maybe you should consider veterinary medicine (as a technician or actual DVM).  There are even jobs that meld computing and medicine \u2014 the whole field of biocomputing and biomechanical engineering.    The question you really should be asking is how to find what would make you happy.  You should check with your advising center on campus (if there is one) to investigate some aptitude testing to see what you like. Then seek out something that you think would make you happy and fulfilled even if the pay isn't so great.   Consider an internship or shadowing someone in your candidate field for a while to see if you really might like it.  Take a few intro courses related to the area of your interest and see what you think (and how you do).   Treat this as a research project rather than a whim based on gossip. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I am very happy that you are thinking about your post-college career plans! Many students graduate with relatively impractical degrees and no real plan for what they were going to do after college aside from some half-baked pipe dreams and are surprised when things don't immediately work out by themselves. I agree that having a job you don't dread going to every morning is more important than a huge TV or a fast car, however I caution that being a PT can also be less than glamourous as well. One important thing to consider is what you normal day will be like as a PT vs a IT professional. Being a PT will involve constantly interacting with people, many of whom will be in pain and sometimes they will not in a great mood and it will be your job to keep them in good spirits and motivated. If your the type of person that is energized by meeting new people all the time, then maybe being a PT is something to look into. Because you said that you IT courses are interesting, I think the best plan is to stick with your IT degree and take the PT prereqs. I advise you to try and get a part-time job at your college working in IT and/or at a local PT office so you can see what it is actually like - that will help you make you decision between the two as neither is intrinsically better than the other - what is important is to find the one that fits you the best. Good luck! ",
