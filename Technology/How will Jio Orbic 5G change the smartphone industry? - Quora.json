            "answer_text": "Reliance Jio might be close to launching its first Android-powered feature phones. HIGHLIGHTSReliance Jio has reportedly listed three new phones on US FCC website.All three smartphones are likely to come with stock Android.Google had invested in Reliance Jio earlier this year.Reliance Jio's partnership with Google, a rather strategic one, is seemingly materialising. The Mukesh Ambani-led telecom company is pulling out all the stops to wrest the Indian tech market and its latest salvo against rivals could be Android-powered feature phones that might also have 5G connectivity. Over and above the rumours we have been hearing, it is the first time we are seeing some concrete development. Reliance has listed three phones on US FCC website called Jio Orbic Myra 5G, Orbic Magic 5G, and Orbic Myra. Going by the name, the first two devices - Jio Orbic Myra 5G and Orbic Magic 5G are going to be 5G handsets while the third one will settle for 4G connectivity. A listing on the FCC means the phone use Google's technology that needs clearance from the US government. This is perhaps the low-cost Android that will power these phones. The FCC listings have revealed the three phones will run stock Android 10. However, the specifics of how this firmware will be low-cost and trimmed down in comparison with conventional Android and Android Go handsets is not clear. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly for india i am not confirm about the standards and QoS of 5G. Still we are struggling to get better receptions of 4G and we are not using actual power of 4G then we can not able to say anything about 5G. Coz technology is not game changer, but users and how they use that that is actual changer. If you use 5G only for Youtube and Netflix then no matter for you \u2026. ",
