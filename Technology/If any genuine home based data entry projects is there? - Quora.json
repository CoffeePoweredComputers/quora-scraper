            "answer_text": "Have you ever wondered if a job is real or a scam? Sometimes, it can be hard to tell the difference. Here are some tip-offs to help you identify fake job offers and avoid job scams. Internet fraud is rampant and scammers prey on job seekers. Your best defense is to do your research and report internet job scams. Review these tips, so you can identify and avoid a variety of different types of scams designed to get your personal information and your money. Too Good to be True: Good jobs are hard to find. Like your mom always said, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. You didn\u2019t contact them, they contacted you: They say that they found your resume online. They either offer you a job right away or say they want to interview you. Sometimes the scammers will try to entice you by saying that you made the cut and they are interviewing the finalists for the job. They want you to pay for something. Legitimate companies don\u2019t ask for money. If you\u2019re told that you need to purchase software or pay for services, beware Do not pay money - for anything. Legitimate employers don't charge to hire you. Don't send money for work at home directories, advice on getting hired, company information or for anything else related to a job. Forget getting rich quick. Avoid listings that guarantee you quick wealth or financial success. If it sounds too good to be true, you can be sure it is. In particular, stay clear of listings that offer you high income for part-time hours. Keep in mind that we are living in cyber era and most of the legitimate websites have digital ways of data entry. It looks strange if a reliable and reputable company pay thousands of dollars for data entry work. You should remember that most of the companies are entering necessary data through software and other digital ways. If there are companies that look for manual data entry, they do not pay much for this simple job. Choose wise. Improve your communication skills. Try to work on real projects, may be they looks hard to work , but trust , these are only allow you to earn real money . Feel free to communicate if need any projects to work on. Good luck.

            "answer_text": "Hi Amanda, Yes, there are. But the fact is there are way more scams posing as data entry jobs than legit jobs. I would recommend you to what another person answered here and check Upwork or Freelancer. They offer data entry jobs and as you gain your reputation, you can increase, so that you don\u2019t work for pennies. (I say this because I\u2019ve seen people pay $3.33/hour in data entry!) You should try Fiverr. It\u2019s quite the reliable site and it works for gig. In fact, we have a whole starter\u2019s guide in our site, f4freelance. The good thing with Fiverr is that you can promote your gig on social media and gain more exposure to clients looking for data entry freelancers. The post is here Good luck! ",
