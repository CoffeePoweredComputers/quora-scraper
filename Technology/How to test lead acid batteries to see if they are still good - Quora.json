            "answer_text": "xxx I have written about this before. The ONLY sure way is to know how te battery performs under high discharge conditions. The usual home voltmeters and ammeters simply do not cut. I had an old carbon powder resistor that can take a discharge of a few hundred amps for several seconds. Current professional models of these are available in your local mechanics\u2019s garage, or in Pep Boys, etc. See below:  High amp discharge after a full charge is the ONLY fool proof way to test a lead acid battery. Unfortunately, my local AAA mobile battery tech does not carry one. Resulting in his coming and testing mine and declaring a \u201cPass All Test\u201d three times over two months, before I made the decision to change it no matter what their meters tell them. ",

            "answer_text": "A simple approach is to try to charge it, then take it off charge and see if it has held the charge. You do that by measuring the battery voltage. If the voltage drops substantially over a short period like hours or a day, the battery is probably going bad. A second test is to see whether the battery can supply much power to a load or whether it drops voltage quickly. ",
