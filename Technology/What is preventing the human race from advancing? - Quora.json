            "answer_text": "Humanity\u2019s advancements are being stunted by: air - water and soil pollution, by \u201cmodern\u201d medicines that kill around 800.000 people in the US alone and mentally and physically disable an unknown amount of people throughout the world, by chemical additives in our food and clothes and materials we are daily exposed to. All these elements have a negative effect on humanity\u2019s cognitive evolution and deform our genes and DNA, resulting in weaker off-spring. Humanity\u2019s technological growth has gone so much faster compared to its spiritual growth and understanding of social sustainability. As a result many people are stuck in religious dogma and political extremism that doesn\u2019t serve humanity, quite the contrary. Trans-humanism is slowly erasing our human roots and making new generations oblivious to what it really means to be human. Social structures are deliberately being construed to serve a capitalist economic model that has caused enormous suffering throughout the ages, and still to this day serves only a few. Humanity is well on it\u2019s way to destroy itself, and all this in favor of greed and money, because the show must go on. For humanity to survive, we have to profoundly change the foundation of human behavior, because we are radically undermining the environment and ecosystem and destroying ourselves. And then we will be able to advance as a species once again. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing. We are in a state of continual advancement. I answered a question about global change once, by relating what my great great auntie Nina had seen developed during her life time. She was born in 1900 and died in 2004, at the age of 104. She saw the development and mass distribution of automobiles, planes, commercial airliners, nuclear power plants, vacuum cleaners, computers, television, phone systems that didn\u2019t require an operator to connect your wire to the correct wire to patch you through to the recipient. Then push button phones, cell phones, satellite phones, smart phones. Saw photography go from black and white to colour to digital to smart phone based (though still fairly low res in smart phones in 2004). Saw the discovery and distribution of anti-biotics, prosthetics, robotics, automation. Air conditioning. Rocketry, satellites, space travel, space based telescopes. Radio antennas, dishes, and arrays. The discovery of general relativity, and quantum mechanics. DNA analysis. Genetically modified crops. The mass availability of electricity in homes. The internet and global sharing of information. Social media. And more. All in the span of 1.04 centuries. When will humans \u201cadvance\u201d? Tomorrow. And the next day, and the day after that. And after that. and after that. It is now. And there is no stopping it. ",
