            "answer_text": "In no way is support for Donald trump waning. If you look at the size of his rallies they are huge. even a good section of Hollywood is swinging around people like 50 cent, Dean Cain, Kirstie Alley and others have spoken out in support. He has the support of numerous Law Enforcement unions and departments. Minority groups are rallying behind President Trump. I recently watched a rally in Arizona were before it started they were asking people where they were from. A huge portion came from California. Polls say he is trailing in certain battle ground states. However it has come to light that just as in 2016 they are over polling Democrats. Now there may be some Republican lawmakers who do not act all that enthusiastic but They are not the ones who count. The democratic strategy of trying to attack the President and blaming him for the number of Corona deaths. Or now trying to reinvigorate the whole Russian narrative like Adam Schiff is doing. The democrats IF they truly want to win need to connect more than just opposing Trump. their plans lack substance, You have Biden and Harris both flip flopping on things like Fracking, the second amendment. The you have Pelosi and Schumer going CooCoo for cocao puffs of the Amy Coney Barrett nomination. say that if democrats take the Senate that nothing is off the table in terms of stacking the court, removing legislative filibuster (which they have used many times). They are talking making DC a state which the Founding fathers were 100% against only because they would hope to gain 2 more Democratic seats giving them a secure advantage. Many American are waking up to what the Democrats are doing. It is a recipe to have ONE ruling party and the ultimate elimination of opposition parties. So NO, I do not see support for President Trump dropping and no where near collapse. ",

            "answer_text": "As anyone who\u2019s read my answers here knows, I\u2019m not a Trump fan. But I don\u2019t think \u201cbrink of collapse\u201d applies to Trump\u2019s support, even as a concept. Trump has a core of supporters who would walk through fire for him, even if you drenched them in gasoline first. Therefore, I don\u2019t think his support is susceptible of going beneath a certain number, somewhere around 37% - 40% approval. That\u2019s what the Gallup weekly approval ratings seem to show. Now, if you define \u201ccollapse\u201d as \u201cinsufficient to win the election\u201d, then I\u2019d say that it\u2019s been there all along. His core supporters, while loyal, are not enough to win him the presidency. ",
