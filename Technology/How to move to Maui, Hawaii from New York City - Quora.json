            "answer_text": "Easy. I did it over 13 years ago and cannot live anywhere else (for now).. Maui gets into your bones and very being. I felt the \u201ccall\u201d for years to come even though I had never been to Maui.. I knew as a spiritual teacher I needed a \u201chome\u201d that would be more conducive to who I really was. Peace with a sense of the elements all around me. I decided I would start getting my beloved cat Izzy shots to start the process of committing to my move. Months later, I put up an ad for a house/petsitter and things escalated from there. A petsitting gig was set up for a month stay. Then I found another one dogsitting for another month after that while I was still on island. Izzy was being taken care of in NY by a subletter. Within a week of my first gig I knew I was going back to Jamaica Estates, packing up and start anew on the valley isle. I came back to NY and within 3 months Izzy & I started anew. I even got to housesit again from the original gig but that is another story. Izzy & I got eventually settled into a share situation but there was an \u201cinitiation\u201d time before I got fully \u201csettled\u201d\u2026\u2026 Suffice to say, there has been ALOT to get used to that I never ever considered or thought about, however, I don\u2019t regret the trans atlantic/pacific move. I believe I am a true city girl but Maui has now received my Heart & Soul and There is no turning back~ Jump In! ",
