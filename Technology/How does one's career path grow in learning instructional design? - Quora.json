With all the new technology and tools available today to create online courses, this is an exciting time for eLearning, and a great time to be in this industry. But, before you start, it\u2019s important to choose a framework that works best for your style and your training team. It's important to understand how to create an online course, and to understand the criteria needed to maximize value. The right Instructional Design framework will set your eLearning project up for a successful outcome. Why You Need An Instructional Design Framework To Create Online Courses An Instructional Design model -or framework- is a tool to help design and create courses. It\u2019s a systematic approach to developing training solutions. You\u2019re probably thinking, \"But I know what I want to teach and I\u2019m ready to start creating content\". So, why is it important to pause and first consider a framework? Let\u2019s use the analogy of building a house. Before you start, you need to have a vision of what you want. Then, you work with an architect to draw up the plans: where the doors and windows are placed, how big the garage will be, the type of wood that will be used for the kitchen cabinets, the specific tile chosen for the bathroom, and the color of paint for the outside of the house. Only then does the building process begin, as the contractor and team embark on executing those carefully considered plans. Imagine if you started to create online courses without knowing who your audience is, what objectives you wanted to achieve, how you would measure the course effectiveness, how you would market it and other details such as which videos, and images, and colors, and fonts will be used. Without a plan, you might waste a lot of time making decisions and adjustments as you go that could ultimately cause you to end up reworking the whole course. Using a framework provides a step-by-step guide to help the Instructional Designer (like the contractor) organize the project, and ensure that all aspects of the project are covered along the way. This method saves time and builds an eLearning process that can generate ideas for the Instructional Designer. Additionally, the structure will help identify gaps within content and visualize training, so the design process can be laid out in easy-to-follow logical steps.

The website Instructional Design identifies 25 Instructional Design frameworks [1], including: ADDIE.Popular in business and organizational environments, the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) model is a framework in which each phase is perfected before moving on to the next one.Rapid Prototyping.This model follows an iterative process to create online courses in a continual design-evaluation cycle.SAM.Like Rapid Prototyping, SAM (Successive Approximation Model) uses a process that enables analysis, design, and development to take place at the same time.KEMP.Consisting of 9 steps, the KEMP model [2] promotes a continuous cycle for the design and development process. It places emphasis on defining the instructional problem.Dick and Carey.Popular in schools and educational environments, the Dick and Carey model [3] starts by identifying instructional goals, and it ends with conducting a summative evaluation.See the full framework here - 5 Steps To Follow When Using An Instructional Design Framework For Your Online Courses - eLearning Industry ",

            "answer_text": "If you're asking how to learn the craft, start by internalizing theory from education, cognitive psychology, etc. with application in mind, to give you a working mental model of how the mind and learning work. Add practical experience building or designing things to build layers of understanding around how businesses or schools work, and how tech and media support (or don't support) learning. Eventually, you'll probably add a layer of management, project management and/or business analysis in order to broaden your focus to leading teams, communication and solving business problems beyond the instructional.  In practical summary, read as much theory as you can use. Acquire as much tech, media and communication skill as practical. Build leadership and other business skills. ",
