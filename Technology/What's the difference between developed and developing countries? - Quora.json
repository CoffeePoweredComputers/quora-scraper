            "answer_text": "Definitions from Wikipedia: Developed country A developed country, industrialized country, or \"more economically developed country\" (MEDC), is a sovereign state that has a highly developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less industrialized nations. Most commonly, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are gross domestic product (GDP), gross national product (GNP), the per capita income, level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living. [1] Which criteria are to be used and which countries can be classified as being developed are subjects of debate. [1] Developed Economy Definition. Investopedia (2010-04-16). Retrieved on 2013-07-12. Take into account the last sentence: Criteria to classify countries is subject of debate. Developing country A developing country, also called a less developed country or underdeveloped country, is a nation with a less developed industrial base, and a low Human Development Index (HDI) relative to other countries.[1] On the other hand, since the late 1990s developing countries tended to demonstrate higher growth rates than the developed ones.[2] There is no universal, agreed-upon criterion for what makes a country developing versus developed and which countries fit these two categories,[3] although there are general reference points such as a nation's GDP per capita compared to other nations. Also, the general term less-developed country should not be confused with the specific least developed country. Sullivan, Arthur; Steven M. Sheffrin (2003). Economics: Principles in Action.

So when we look forward there are many countries better off in this criteria and worse countries as well. We are some where in middle due to a big period of hindu rate of growth.Almost four decades were lost in so called socialist thoughts and we are back on track since 1991.
