            "answer_text": "The main difference (i would consider) is the medium used to transmit power. In Hydraulics liquid/oil is used to transmit power, whereas in pneumatic compressed gas (generally air) is used to transmit power. Due to this difference there are many things that differ between the systems. For example you would need a tank to store oil from which the system can draw oil in case of deficit. In pneumatic the system can just draw air from the atmosphere and just a filter would be required to purify it. In my opinion I wouldn't say that either is more common than the other, rather each have their own specialties which make them unique for their corresponding applications. For further detailed explanation of the differences read on. Here is a basic comparison of the two.  Here is a application wise comparison of various power transmission systems. The also have details of other mechanisms kindly ignore them.  A brief on the pros and cons of each system Pneumatics offer a very clean system, suitable for food manufacturing processes and other processes which require no risk of contamination. Hydraulics is generally not used in these environments due to the risk of hydraulic oil leaks from faulty valves, seals or burst hoses. Pneumatics offer rapid movement of cylinders and have the great advantage of availability in very small sizes. Why do pneumatics offer a higher operating speed of its components? This is mainly due to air compressor flow rates, air is very agile and can flow through pipes very quickly and easily with little resistance, while hydraulic oil is a viscous substance and requires more energy to move. Also in pneumatics, cylinders and valves can dump their compressed air straight to the atmosphere when they need to change direction or alter their state quickly, compared with hydraulics where the oil must be routed back to the reservoir. Pneumatics does not have the potential force that hydraulics has to offer. The lifting or moving of heavy loads is not best suited to pneumatics. Hydraulics can smoothly lift and move loads because the hydraulic oil is not compressible, compared to air which can become jerky and spongy as the air pressure fluctuates with cylinder movement or load changes. In general a much larger pneumatic cylinder is needed to obtain the same force that a hydraulic ram can produce. In terms of energy costs pneumatics is more costly than hydraulics, this is mainly due to the amount of energy lost through heat production while compressing air.

            "answer_text": "Actuator is a device which convert one form of motion to a different motion. Generally there are two types actuator : Linear actuatorRotary actuatorEach can be pneumatic , hydraulic , electric or magnetic. Difference among above is type of energy required for rotary or linear actuator. Hydraulic Actuator : In hydraulic actuator pressurized oil is used for actuator. actuator are generally hydraulic cylinder (linear ) or motor(rotary) . There are different type of hydraulic linear actuator : single acting , double acting , telescopic , tandem etc . Also rotary actuator : Gear motor , vane motor, piston motor etc. Hydraulic actuator is used generally where large force and accurate speed and position control is required. Pneumatic Actuator : In pneumatic actuator compressed air is required for actuator. Same as hydraulic actuator pneumatic actuator are cylinder(linear) or motor(rotary). Linear Pneumatic actuator : single acting cylinder , double acting cylinder , tandem cylinder , stopper cylinder etc . Rotary pneumatic actuator : rotary fixed rotation cylinder , continuous rotation cylinder etc Pneumatic actuator is used generally where high speed is required rather than large force. It is also less costly among all. Electric actuator: Electric actuator use power screw with motor which required electric power. Rotary motion of motor is converted in linear motion using screw and nut mechanism . Electric actuator serve between hydraulic and pneumatic system. It can be used for large force and high speed also. Magnetic actuator : Electromagnetic actuator is generally solenoid. in which electric energy is converted in to magnetic field and due to magnetic field armature moves on. It is generally used for small stroke and quick response. ",
