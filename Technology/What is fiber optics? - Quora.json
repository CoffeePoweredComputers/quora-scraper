            "answer_text": "Fiber optics are a way of sending signals over a long distance with little loss in signal and at the speed of light.  The fibers are made up of two different glasses a core and a \"wrapper\" layer.  The difference in density of the two makes the light bounce off the interface between layers and stay in the inner fiber.  Small lasers or LED's create the signal on one end, and a photo-detector receives the signal at the other end and turns the signal back into an electronic signal. ",

            "answer_text": "In the recent years, fiber optics is steadily replacing copper wires. It is a better and apt means of transmitting communication signals. Today, fiber optics cable span across long distances between local phone systems. In addition, it also serves as the backbone for many networking systems including: Cable TV servicesUniversity campusOffice buildingsIndustrial plantsElectric utility companiesInternet connectivityStereo systemsTelephone systemsFiber Optics Cable use pulses of light to transfer data using the event of total internal reflection. The cable has a coating of plastic. This protects the cable from exposure to heat, cold, and other weather atrocities. It also protects the cable from electromagnetic interference and ultraviolet rays of sun. These cables are the most reliable and fastest data transfer cables on the planet. A fiber optics cable system is very similar to the metal wire system. The fiber optics is replacing the metal and copper wire system. The basic difference is that fiber optics uses light to transmit data; whereas metal wires do not. It sends the data down the fiber lines instead of using electronic pulses for transmitting data like in the metal wires. Fiber Optics Cables serve the purpose of connecting and transferring data across continents. They are fast and they can carry large capacity. The signals have higher strength and need least maintenance. ",
