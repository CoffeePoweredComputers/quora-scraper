            "answer_text": "Yes. There is no actual start for a Tesla, you don\u2019t have a bunch of gears that have to start turning to manage miniature explosions. You just put it in gear and press the pedal, putting electricity to the motor and you go. The remote aspect is an app for you cell phone that allows you to turn on heaters or air, along with a multitude of other activities. It will open the garage door and back out, shutting the door behind it, and wait for you with the seat and mirrors adjusted to that owners specs. It has more than 1 available for all family members. The newest trick is to go park itself or come and pick you up at the door all by itself. So it\u2019s kind of a remote start with a doctorate and advanced physical capacities. ",

Tesla includes this connectivity in every car. The cost is included in the purchase price. Because the car is always connected to the internet, you can use the Tesla app for a smartphone to control many features of the car from anywhere in the world, as long as the car and your phone have cell service. One of the most common uses is that you can preheat or pre-cool the car. But you can also flash the lights, honk the horn, open the trunks, turn heat seaters on or off, and even (if you aren\u2019t too far from the car) summon the car to come to you without a driver in the car. The summon feature isn\u2019t working terribly well yet\u2026 ",

What I can do via the app, whether or not the car is plugged in and charging, is either pre-cool or pre-heat the cabin interior in the summer/winter months. I can turn on the seat heaters and defrosters as well. If it\u2019s particularly cold outside and I\u2019m going on a long trip, I can pre-heat the batteries by turning on the heater or further charging the battery to a higher percentage so that energy isn\u2019t consumed from the battery when I\u2019m driving, enhancing my range.

One can also control three levels of heat for each (any of all) of five seats. I think you can also remotely change the default conditioned temperature minimum and maximum of 40 to 105 degrees to be tighter range, however that will be in effect all the time, whereas getting the cabin comfortable, even from an extreme temperature takes only 5 to 7 minutes, so normally one would not waste energy keeping it between 60 and 80.
