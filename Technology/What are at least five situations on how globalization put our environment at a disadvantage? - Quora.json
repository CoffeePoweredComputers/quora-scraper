            "answer_text": "Globalization has increased demand from Asia. Globalization transfers money to China and Vietnam for manufacturing. They have zero enforcement of their many environmental protection laws. They produce a lot of pollution per manufactured good. In China, in some cities, each large building in a large city has its own coal fired electrical plant in the basement. They use low grade coal with inefficient burning. They have minimal, if any, exhaust clearing. This is why so many Chinese have breathing problems. There is minimal enforcement of their toxic dumping laws, causing toxic runoff. Asia accounts for most of the plastic in the ocean. Very high tariffs keep Western products out of Asia. Price supports for asian producers and minimal western tariffs increase demand for asian products. ",
