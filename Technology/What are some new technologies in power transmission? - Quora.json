            "answer_text": "human being is a kind, always looking for better to live & to be serviced as well.. yes, they\u2019ve introduced a grid then smart grid system regrading modern transmission, incorporation of Automation (SCADA, PLC), HVDC to avoid the losses respect to AC transmission, Power line Carrier communication to avoid frequency hazard & to sustain economy, distributed series reactors / continuously variable series reactors, introduction of fiber optics technology, uses of IGBT drivers instead of GTO one, privileged Modular FACTS controllers & many more\u2026 even if you notice, you\u2019ll see the modern transmission towers are steel lattice tower to ensure more reliability & stability, carry more strength even after considerable sag, atmospheric changes & calamities\u2026  even today may be a chance to be discovered something new & get applied to the system\u2026 :) Thanks!

            "answer_text": "Voltage-source converters for HVDC. This will allow multi-terminal HVDC, improved harmonic performance and less dependence on synchronous machines in the AC system. Currently only used for low and mid-range voltages, but is gradually gaining acceptance at higher voltages Ultra High Voltage: In both AC and DC, voltages are now reaching the MV range-requiring brand new line designs, insulators, protection, etc. High-temperature, low sag conductors, such as ACCC (composite core). There are a number of different technologies, but typically there is a trade-off of higher capital cost for improved performance (eg. lower losses and/or higher thermal transfer capability). ",
