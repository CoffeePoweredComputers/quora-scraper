            "answer_text": "I have to suggest Evariste Galois, a French mathematician, is the greatest mathematician of all time, and here\u2019s why: The whole definition of being \u201cgreat\u201d in a field is subjective, and to me, the greats of a field are those who leave a lasting impact or those who had an enormous potential and achieved a flurry of miraculous work in a short amount of time. Evariste Galois falls into the latter category. He published his first paper in 1828 at the tender age of 17 years old about continued fractions and then began to shift his focus to theories and formulas involving polynomial equations. After finishing college in a year, he published a series of papers that would form his greatest contribution to mathematics, establishing a solution to the long-standing question of determining when an algebraic equation can be solved by radicals as well as laying out methods of solving quintic equations. In addition, he contributed greatly to abstract algebra, specifically group theory, but his ability in mathematics is only one half of his greatness. Galois was a freedom fighter, and he was removed from working at his former college due to suspicions of republican activities. As he became increasingly radicalized, his political affiliations and activities as a staunch republican during hte rule of Louis-Phillippe distracted him from his mathematical work, and he was finally killed in a duel in 1832 and he died young at only 20 years old. Galois\u2019s identity as a republican and supporter of the coming revolution as well as his brilliant work in mathematics truly elevates him above the rest.  What a legend. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard enough to compare mathematicians in any meaningful way at the top that you are unlikely to get any list that you can take seriously as a real top ten list. It\u2019s really hard to compare pre-20th century mathematicians with recent ones because the subject has changed so much. It used to be possible to be outstanding in all fields in mathematics because there was less of it, but now even just following all of it is impossible. As an example of how hopeless all this is, I just have no idea of how to rate someone like Saharon Shelah with his over 1,000 papers especially in comparison with the old greats. I\u2019ll say he appears to be better than what his publication volume by itself would suggest (yes! it\u2019s possible to be unusually prolific with \u201cminimal publishable units\u201d, or at least a bunch of minor additions to the literature, but he\u2019s not doing anything like that). But I\u2019ll decline to guess how he deserves to rank against a bunch of these other people. I just don\u2019t know. Part of the problem is that you almost have to be a professional logician really to know in his case. If you are in a habit of perusing logic journals, though, you can hardly help but notice his output. One day I wondered to myself if he had had to avoid overloading a certain journal by publishing too much in it (mostly kidding, but not completely). So what I think we\u2019ll all wind up doing is just naming a few outstanding people, and this is what I\u2019ll do. Archimedes was remarkable among the ancients. He was doing something really close to calculus and people seemed not very often to understand him at the time. It appears a bunch of his work was lost. One of his texts was only recently discovered: Archimedes Palimpsest. Hilbert was remarkable among mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century. You can almost not avoid running into his work. Among his contemporaries, it seems to be easy to underrate Emmy Noether. As I recall when she died the New York Times got a letter from some famous scientists saying that when the world\u2019s greatest algebraist dies she deserves more of an obituary than what they had given under the title \u201cBryn Mawr prof dies\u201d. If you think \u201cgreat algebraist\u201d, though, probably you won\u2019t be expecting someone who contributed as much to mathematical physics. I think most people\u2019s top ten lists, if they agreed to make them, would include Euler and Gauss. I may be biased because of the fields I\u2019ve studied, but I wouldn\u2019t bet heavily that there have been 10 mathematicians better than Grothendieck. He\u2019s one of the most outstanding mathematicians that the typical layperson with a liking for mathematics would not have heard of. If you ask people in certain fields to name someone who had a really \u201cdeep\u201d understanding they\u2019ll probably mention him. In keeping with a couple of other answers, probably Euclid deserves some kind of special recognition prize. It\u2019s not clear how much mathematics he did himself. Writing a textbook that was used for thousands of years counts as contributing to mathematics, though. Very hard to compare with others, though. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s clear what was original with him in the books so much as organized by him. G.H.Hardy once said that on a scale of raw talent from 0 to 100 he would rate Hilbert at 80 but Ramanujan at 100. Ramanujan is super hard to compare with anybody else. He made all kinds of unproven observations about modular forms and related topics and in some respects seems to have been way ahead of his time. Then he died young. I feel as though he kind of got cheated by circumstances but he was impressive anyway. However much you think about this kind of thing, you will be bound eventually to realize you\u2019re leaving out somebody important. ",
