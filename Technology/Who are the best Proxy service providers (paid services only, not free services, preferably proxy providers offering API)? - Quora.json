            "answer_text": "Free proxy services normally are bad and mostly their networks are abused and paid services that are good are mostly expensive especially if the proxies are residential. Surprising many companies that offer residential proxies do offer it on very high price and there are many reasons why such companies base their pricing on GB consumed which I am not going to discuss in this answer. So let me give you some providers that do have an API and are doing a good job with a fair price. ProxyCrawl goes on top of my list, I guess if you just check their tools, you would know why, but preferably. They have Crawling APIs, Async APIs, Proxy Backconnect and also has a control API. They also offer Scraping APIs for various e-commerce. Basically they are an API platform for developers for web crawling and their proxy network is very good. I often use them to crawl website like Amazon, Google, Linkedin and many difficult websites. They are not really metered by GBs, I truly like that. Why? Because you do not get value if you receive a response from a proxy that is a 300kb page but the page is showing you a captcha to solve or any other non relevant information, so GBs metered services in my opinion for web crawling is not efficient. ProxyCrawl meters the proxies by successful requests/responses, so only if you do crawl website X and the website X returns a good response, they charge you otherwise you can use them freely if the website does not work. They do also offer a proxy backconnect with an API if you prefer to do the hard work at your company side, I do recommend anybody nowadays to deal with proxies because you have to do a lot of work to keep your scraper undetected, that is why platforms like ProxyCrawl offer APIs for web scraping.Apify has also a proxy service which is similar to the above work with clean proxies and normally their service is of very high quality. I find it very useful especially combined with their public available scrapers so you do not have to maintain your own custom web crawlers. Their pricing is overall and not exclusive to a single service. So you buy a whole set of tools together with a set of proxies. I find that a bit unfair because unlike ProxyCrawl you can use each service separately from the other. For example, you can buy for proxy backconnect subscription separately or you can buy their Scraper Api package for Linkedin also separately. Can be useful for instance if you want to focus on proxies that work for certain website and also do scraping on top.",

Proxy servers are considered to be one of the most reliable solutions when it comes to accessing information online by hiding your identity. Choosing the right proxy server is necessary, there are many secure and good proxy servers which have multiple features but what meets your requirements is what you need to pick. Here\u2019s my steps to How to Choose the Best Proxy Service for You 1. Great Support System The support systems need to be 24/7 present to cater to users who are experiencing any problems. Support services are looked upon by multiple users hence it is necessary that when you invest in a private proxy service provider, their support game is on point. 2. High Internet Speed As a business there will be much work for you to conduct using the online platform and in this case if you have a lower internet speed, chances are your work will slow down and so will the productivity levels. 3. High Number Of Proxies Conducting online activities with so many limitations isn\u2019t safe as your brand can stand a chance of being blocked. To avoid that invest in a private proxy server that offers you a good amount of proxies so that your IP address doesn\u2019t get tampered. 4. Good Security Another feature you need to keep in mind when investing in a private proxy service is whether the proxy is secure enough. How to Choose the Best Private Proxy Provider Hope This Helps ",
