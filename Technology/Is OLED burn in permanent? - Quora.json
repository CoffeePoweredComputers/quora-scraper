            "answer_text": "This is gradual. For the sake of naming, it starts as persistence. Image persistence can still go away with activating the built-in anti-burn in setting of most current OLEDs, by not viewing the static images that cause it and simply viewing varied images, by lowering the brightness, by just turning off the TV after it\u2019s been on 24/7 for a week. If viewing patterns are not changed, image persistence very gradually becomes permanent burn-in. After it has become bonafide burn-in, it\u2019s like laser-etched in stone & nothing will undo it. Burn-in also existed with CRTs and plasma and is all about extremes. Sane people are unlikely to get burn-in on their OLEDs but the fact the possibilities are very real scares those who become aware of the issue. For the rest, what they don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt them. ",
