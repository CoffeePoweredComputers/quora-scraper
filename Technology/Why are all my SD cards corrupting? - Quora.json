            "answer_text": "I think It is becoming normal nowadays..Maximum life of SD cards with high capacity seems to be around one year. I never removed my SD card, Left half of memory blank still I lost my project precious MIS Data collected nearly for Two years, without any warnings or errors. Jeez, Somehow I got everything copied to my GDrive inadvertently while copying some of my personal photos. That saved my Entire Career. If you go to Amazon, and read reviews you can note that whatever brand, Class it maybe all or most of the cards have negative review regarding to corrupted card. Initially I thought am alone, It may be due to my usage pattern, Later But by reading reviews it seems SD cards are Unreliable if you go above 16 gb. So normally I customed myself to use Gdrive or Onedrive whenever possible. It helps me to store data Safely, and also helps me to retrieve remotely. If you are ease at using file manager, Download Xplore (For Android), and Configure it to use Gdrive or Onedrive. Then make it a habit to regularly copy files to cloud. Some Data is Better than No Data.. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Why are all my SD cards corrupting? Honestly, despite its popularity, I dislike the SD form factor, and the uSD type even more intensely. They are not designed for repeated transfer from one device to another, and I find that their physical size only contributes to lose-ability. Unless you always convey them in their protective shipping sleeves, it\u2019s too easy for an ESD (Electro-Static Discharge) event to occur. To add insult to injury, many lesser brands have no gold on the contacts and you are looking at the \u201cgold\u201d color of nickel. This easily deteriorates with handling. ",

            "answer_text": "For several years, I took pet pictures with Santa.  We used 4 SD  cards:  take the picture, review with the customer, pick a picture, then take the card out and give to a person running the photo-printer.  After 5 or 6 hours, the cards became unreadable by the photo-printer.  We made it standard procedure to reformat the cards after 4 hours. So, to summarize: card goes in and out several times and after a number of re-insertions, read error.  I'm guessing the \"read-write head\" in the camera is not exactly repositioned over the same spot on the FAT table and when the table is updated, it is writing to another position. Another time where I saw corruption was my battery was about dead.  Essentially, it died during a file write to the card.  There seemed to be enough power left to turn the camera on and activate the viewer, but it ran out when trying to write the file.   ",
