            "answer_text": "Custom-made controllers implemented in one or two IC packages that are specific to the type of appliance. Ovens will use one type, washing machines another, and so on. There will be a small number of discrete components needed as well, usually in the interfaces to the various input and output devices, switches, displays, sensors. solenoid valves and motor control components. Discrete power electronics may be needed to control large currents e.g. for washing machine motors. ",
