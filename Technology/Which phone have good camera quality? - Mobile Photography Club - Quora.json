            "answer_text": "There are alot of phones in the market with good quality cameras. I have been using Redmi note 7 pro since a year now, and I'm highly impressed with the camera quality. It comes with a (48 MP + 5 MP) dual-rear camera and a 13 MP front camera which allows you to click amazing pictures. Also it has 2.0 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 processor makes multitasking easy. Here are some pictures I myself took from the Redmi Note 7 Pro: 1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.  9.  10.  11.  Apart from that there are a bunch of editing apps which enhance the photograph even more like Adobe lightroom, Photoshop, Snapseed. Hope you like the photos ",

Go for phones of MidRange like Oneplus, Realme , Xiaomi phones they provide you better battery backup and as well as other features In my opinion go for Realme series they provide the best camera quality and excellent photos Peace \u262e\ufe0f Tajammul Hussain ",
