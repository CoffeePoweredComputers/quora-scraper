            "answer_text": "My experience is that there are two factors you should consider when deciding orientation. First, remember that it\u2019s not uncommon for the side that is printed on the board to have a little bit of bulging around the edge, and it\u2019s also usually going to look look a little off ( the visual texture will differ a bit). This can effect appearance, so it is worth noting. The other factor to consider is scaffolding for overhangs. The less scaffolding, the better, and this is heavily determined by the print orientation. Generally speaking, I recommend printing to mitigate scaffolding above all else, with orienting to reduce imperfections being used only in certain specific cases. ",
