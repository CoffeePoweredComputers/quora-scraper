            "answer_text": "If you use the word \u201cstrategic resources\u201d to mean \u201c resources used in developing or advancing a competitive position\u201d, resources are divided into two categories, 1) those used for defending a current position and 2) those used for advancing a position. Since defense comes first and defense is less risky and costly than moving forward, resources used for defense could be called strategic, but only in the sense that everything involved a strategic position is strategic. Typically, we define those \u201cexcess\u201d resources used for improving a position as \u201cstrategic resources\u201d. Of course, the exact nature of those resources depends on your position and the nature of the advance you are trying to make. Strategic resources are devoted to the future: advancing into new markets, developing new product, identifying new customers, etc. The basic assumption is that maintaining your position isn\u2019t enough because change constantly erodes that position. The position that matters is the one you are staking out in the future, not the one you have today. You need your current position as a stepping stone to future positions. Another way of making this distinction is separating \u201cpredictable\u201d from \u201cevent driven\u201d. Resources used in predictable activities, such as production in a factory, are not the same importance strategically as resources resources needed deal with an unexpected event, one that creates an opportunity or a crisis. The first category of decision-making maintains the status quo, but the later can dramatically change if, for the better of worse. In making decisions about the future, production and competition require completely different sets of skills. For more, read this article. ",

            "answer_text": "Strategic resources are those allowing you to achieve strategic goals and therefore generate sustainable competitive advantage. There are 4 'generic' kinds of resources:- Human resource- Financial resource- Physical resource- Intangible resource (patents, know-how, relationships.etc.) However, these must qualify the following criteria to be of strategic importance (i.e to be 'core competences): Valuability, rarity, unsubstitutability, inimitability. Those described above concern the 'content' of resources rather than 'process'. Keep in mind that strategic resources/competences emerge from a 'collective' learning proceess which relies on a learning organizational culture. ",
