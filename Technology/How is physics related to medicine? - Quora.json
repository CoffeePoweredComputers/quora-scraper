            "answer_text": "The field of Physical Medicine is in essence, a study in physics, that when given proper consideration can restore quality of life. Our perspective is that the human body is, among other things, a machine designed to interact with its environment and that derangements lead to suboptimal function. This is echoed in the early osteopathic philosophy which stated simply, \"Form governs function. When form is impacted, it follows, function is impacted as well\".  Restoring the ability of an organ or body structure to interact properly, as efficiently as possible, and complete the role given it, is paramount to our approach. If that is not possible, we adapt the environment, or by using equipment, the way we interact with that environment.  Physical Medicine & Rehab docs are keenly aware that joints are axes of rotation through which angular momentum are generated by the contraction of muscles, the torque of which are governed by their tendon's insertion points distance from the axis. Gait, for instance, is a design in effeciency. Increased stride length, for example, increases distance covered but increases rise and fall of center of gravity, which in turn burns more energy. Decrease too much? Inefficient in that not enough ground is covered in a given amount of time. Arthritis? An increase in the coefficient of friction leading to loss of the synovial membrane. Take also electrodiagnostics. Nerve transmission is a marriage between electrical theory and biochemical potentials. Our equipment measures the time it takes for an action potential to travel a certain distance of nerve. Distance and time? We have velocity, when put up against normative data, allow for accurate diagnosis of neurological and neuromuscular conditions. That's just scratching the surface of my field alone. I doubt there's a branch of medicine not profoundly based upon the basic laws of physics. My field identifies problems that are largely reduced to problems in physics. Math has been called God's language, and physics in turn would be nothing without math. A look at the human body's amazing functioning reveals not just a beautiful interplay between physics and chemistry, but perhaps all of the basic disciplines combined. A marvel indeed. ",

            "answer_text": "It has always been an essential discipline to understanding muskuloskeletal/myofascial capability. However, the newer research into the anatomy and physiology of the fascial (connective tissue) system is like a whole other new branch of research into a system that was once considered to be \u201cjust packing\u201d for the more interesting systems. It is now understood that fascia is a system unto itself, with properties very unique to it, and it is very interactive with associated neurological and muscular systems. See: (book) Fascia: The Tensional Network of the Human Body: The science and clinical applications in manual and movement therapy, 1e: 9780702034251: Medicine & Health Science Books @ Amazon.com and (research) Myofascial Helices - Tensegrity In Biology Myofascia  The myofascia is traditionally classified into three different regions (Turrina et al 2013), which together form a hierarchical network of fibrous tubes or sheaths enclosing smaller tubes within them, and is continuous with \u2018higher-level\u2019 fascial tubes (compartments) that surround groups of muscles, the limbs and entire body (figure 1). Although some authors consider that the myofascia should no longer be considered as a collection of \u2018tubes\u2019 or \u2018sheaths\u2019, as it is really a \u201cthree-dimensional matrix that is continuous throughout the entire organ\u201d (Purslow and Delage 2012 p 5) and \u201ctremendously complex compared with other connective tissues\u201d (Gillies and Lieber 2011 p 318), a comparison with crossed-helical \u2018tubes\u2019 in other parts of the body and in different species suggests that an appreciation of this pattern is important to furthering our understanding of muscle mechanics (Clarke and Cowey 1958; Kier and Smith 1985). Here\u2019s where it gets interesting: The helical tube  All these tissues contribute to the highly complex and continuous structural network that extends from the inner cellular cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, endomysial sheath, perimysial fascicules and epimysium to the tendons and surrounding fascia, muscles and bone; with each region playing its own specialized part in the transfer of tension. The descriptions of myofascial tissues as \u2018tubes\u2019 naturally follows from their cross-sectional appearances; and the higher-level fascial tubes surrounding groups of muscles, the entire limb and body wall are similar (figures 1 & 2), with the orientations of collagen fibres within their walls having an important functional role. The \u2018walls\u2019 of the perimysium and epimysium are distinct in that they frequently contain two crossed-ply sets of collagen cables aligned at about \u00b1 55 o (relative to the long axis in resting fusiform muscles) (figure 3), while the apparently isotropic orientation of collagen fibres within the endomysium appears to be random but collectively has a (numbers-weighted) mean alignment of about 59 o (Purslow and Trotter 1994). All these angles increase with muscle contraction and become more aligned with its transverse, or circumferential, plane and when the muscle is stretched the angles decrease as the fibres become aligned towards the main direction of tension, indicating that the collagen fibres are mechanically linked with each other (Purslow 1989; Chaudhry et al 2012). The particular alignments of collagen fibres within the walls of these tubes can thus not be considered incidental but a contributor to the mechanics of muscle function, which can be simply analysed if the crossed-ply sets of collagen are considered as left- and right-handed helixes, or spirals (figure 5). A ubiquitous pattern  Crossed-helical winding and its functional significance have been described in the body walls of squid (Johnsen & Kier 1993), amphibians (O\u2019Reilly et al 2000), eels (Hebrank 1980), fish, dolphins and whales (Pabst 2000) suggesting that a similar pattern is likely to occur throughout the human. Indeed, the alignments of muscle and investing fascial tissues that curve around the body wall and limbs are also suggestive of helical arrangements, if only in part (Benetazzo et al 2011; Vleeming 2012) (figure 8); and Scarr (2013) also suggested an alternative helical arrangement of collagen in the limbs of mammals, although this remains unconfirmed. Crossed-helical arrangements of collagen have also been described in the walls of elastic arteries (Holzapfel 2006), the inter-vertebral disc (Hukins and Meakin 2000), heart (Buckberg 2002), trachea, oesophagus (Carey 1920a & b), small intestines (Gabella 1987) and embryonic notochord (Koehl et al 2000); and tubular organs that maintain constant volume throughout changes in shape due to crossed-helical arrangements of muscle and fascial tissue have also been described in the tongues of mammals and lizards, the arms and tentacles of cephalopods and the trunks of elephants (Kier & Smith 1985). The mechanical principles that underlie the value of this ubiquitous pattern in biology even contribute to the novelty of the \u2018Chinese finger trap\u2019 toy and its effectiveness as a suture in gastro-intestinal surgery (Song et al 2008). (emphasis, mine) Considering the similarity between the theoretical fibre angle that balances both longitudinal and circumferential stresses (54.44 o ), and the alignment of collagen fibres within the myofascia of resting muscles and other biological examples, it would seem that these geometric crossed-helical arrangements are indeed contributing to the coordination of changes in muscle shape. They would also enable such tubes to bend smoothly without kinking and resist torsional deformations, thus further demonstrating the value of this particular arrangement to muscle mechanics (Wainwright 1988 p 71; Etnier 2003). The human body is amazing, and we have so very much yet to learn, from the body, and from from interdisciplinary collaboration in research! ",
