            "answer_text": "If I\u2019m being honest\u2026 this is a vague question\u2026 The rectum is a hollow muscular tube at the end of the sigmoid colon that is about 8 inches in length and 2.5 inches in diameter at its widest point. Now the Anus itself is the last part of the rectum. it consists of the two anal sphincters (internal and external). These two muscles ensure to keep the whole closed. so, in this case, the anus would be a tightly closed whole\u2026 2 inches deep\u2026 yet, somewhere I actually read that your anus can stretch up to 14 inches. This in itself is a vague concept because your rectum is designed to hold large amounts of feces, making it stretchy. BUT, that\u2019s properly not what you asked for so I will be going now. Disclaimer: I am not a doctor\u2026 I had to research some facts myself, but the internet can\u2019t always be trusted. So\u2026 Some of these facts can be wrong! rather ask a specialist just to be safe. ",

The Average height of the Male Asshole in Europe is 5\u203210\u2033 which is one inch taller than the average height of the American Male Asshole at 5\u20329\u2033.
