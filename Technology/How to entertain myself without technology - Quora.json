            "answer_text": "Go for a walk somewhere, like I prefer to walk by a seaside although I do listen to music(I don\u2019t know if you would count that as technology). You could read a book on some topic that interests you or even a novel, grab a coffee whike reading a book or just chat with a friend over coffee and play a game of stacking your phones, first one to grab their phone pays for coffee. There is sports like basketball, volleyball, football(soccer), jogging, go swimming also and a lot of sports do not need any technology. Maybe if you like writing or you are at least interestsd try writing. Write anything, you can write in a personal journal, brainstorm thoughts, write short stories, write about ideas you have as it is said 80\u201390% of our greatest ideas are forgotten or pushed aside due to insecurities. Do some volunteering for orphanges or elderly homes, kids are fun to play with and listen to(you could even teach them a thing or two, maybe learn from them. Elderly people have the greatest experiences ane stories. They also tend to entertain themselves with games like chess or backgammon(that is if they are not watching TV which ruins the technology part a little for you). You can try taking a hobby of an artistic kind like poetry, painting, drawing, dancing, singing and even pottery. Maybe try some more nature related hobbies like fishing, rock climbing, snorkling, hiking, horseback riding, archery, and such nature related sports or adventurous hobbies. You can go a bit wild by bungee jumping, skydiving, cliff swinging and all those adrenaline addictive sports. Go spoil yourself with a massage or some kind of spa. Even try the needle therapy thing if you want. Travelling usually does not use much technology yet is an amazing way to explore cultures and see new things in life without being stuck to a screen. Maybe learn cooking or baking those mostly require an oven or stove. Get yourself even a pet like a cat or dog or turtle, you name it(dogs are the best, they will always love you). Thats all outta the top of my head. I sort of ran out of ideas. To be honest depends on your likings, how adventurous you are, and how much time you have for entertainment. Hope these helped. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s easy \u2014 make stuff up. We used to make up stories all the time together when my kids were small. Sometimes with props like hand puppets or a doll house, sometimes just talking in the dark. It goes like this: Someone throws out a situation. For example, you wake up one morning suddenly able to time-travel. Now play that out. Where and when do you go? What happens to you? How do the people in your new environment react to you? Are your clothes strange to them? What about your vocabulary? How do you find your way around? Do you have or need money? Where do you sleep? How do you get back to The Now? Are you stuck there forever? Why did you go in the first place? Props just lend themselves to storytelling. With their dollhouse, my daughters had a traditional family of four with Mom, Dad, older child, baby, and a golden retriever. They named the older child \u201cTanya\u201d, and she was a chaotic influence on the entire make-believe household. If the dog was found sitting on the toilet, it was Tanya\u2019s doing. Baby on the roof? Where\u2019s Tanya? Toy groceries strewn about the yard? Had to be the work of Tanya. Every story was about the futile process of trying to turn Tanya into a civilized human. It was a perpetual struggle, and the source of much hilarity until the kids grew up and the dollhouse was sold at a garage sale. I\u2019m sure Tanya brought her reign of destruction into another household. You can also create fake family mythology. It\u2019s fun, you should try it. My daughter got an assignment at school. Answer the question \u201cWhat is unique about your family?\u201d Well, we took that and ran with it. I became the only person ever to be born fully-clothed. My mother had been knitting a sock when she was in labor, and she was too distracted by the labor pains to shape the sock, so it grew and grew, until it became a very long tube. When I was born, I slid right into the sock! Because she wasn\u2019t done with it, it had a perfect opening for my head. To this day, I love to wear stripes. Make up something unbelievable about yourself and stick to it. This is my go-to in awkward situations. \u201cYeah, but did you know I was born fully-clothed?\u201d Here\u2019s one you can do alone\u2014 use mental rehearsing to get better at something you enjoy doing, like public speaking, or playing golf. Just do it over and over again in your mind and think about each step. Imagine yourself doing whatever it is and the next time you do the thing, you might actually have improved. Use your imagination. Start now. It\u2019s a great source of entertainment, and a little-known secret to resiliency. It might even save your life in a rough situation, like a 4-day-long power failure. You\u2019ll be able to keep your sense of humanity if anything truly trying ever happens to you. ",
