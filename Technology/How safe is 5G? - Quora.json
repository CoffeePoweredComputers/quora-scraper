            "answer_text": " This is not an easy question. Let's analyze 5G technology from the point of view of chemistry and physics, especially since it will be quite informative. So, 5G technology uses electromagnetic radiation to transmit a signal in a band called New Radio (NR). This range is subdivided into two frequency bands: FR1 (600 - 6000 MHz) and FR2 (24 - 100 GHz) (5G - Wikipedia). Naturally, further we must determine whether the radiation of this range will negatively affect the human body. A microwave oven will help us with this question (Microwave oven - Wikipedia). Yes, yes, just an ordinary microwave. Especially note that the microwave oven heats food with electromagnetic radiation at a frequency of 2450 MHz. That is, this is actually the middle of the FR1 frequency range (600 - 6000 MHz), which is used in 5G technology. Moreover, as we will see below, another FR2 frequency range (24 - 100 GHz) is also fundamentally no different (from a microwave). This is a very surprising fact. Therefore, below we will consider in detail the physical and chemistry of the process of heating food. Surprisingly, this will be enough to understand the impact of 4G and 5G on the human body. \u201cA microwave oven... is an electrical appliance that allows you to heat water-containing substances due to electromagnetic radiation in the decimeter range (usually with a frequency of 2450 MHz) and is designed for quick cooking, heating or defrosting food. In industry, these ovens are used for drying, defrosting, melting plastics, heating adhesives, firing ceramics, etc. In some industrial ovens, the radiation frequency can be changed (the so-called variable frequency microwave, VFM). Unlike classic ovens (for example, an oven or a Russian oven), heating food in a microwave oven occurs not only from the surface of the heated body, but also along its volume, containing polar molecules (for example, water), since radiowaves of this frequency penetrate and are absorbed by food about 1.5 - 2.5 centimeters deep from the surface. This shortens the heating time for food; the average heating rate in microwave ovens is 0.3 \u2013 0.5\u00b0C per second\u201d (Microwave oven - Wikipedia). The principle of operation of a microwave is very simple: in a microwave oven dielectric heating of substances occurs, which consist of polar molecules. That is, microwave radiation (more precisely, its electrical component, E) accelerates the movement of polar molecules. When the molecules begin to move, intermolecular friction arises between them, which leads to the absorption of microwave radiation, and therefore to an increase in the temperature of the substance. This is the essence of dielectric heating of substances. The pictures shows a water molecule, which is a typical dipole, since the O-H chemical bonds are polar (Dipole Moment).    \u201cDielectric heating is a method of heating dielectric materials by a high-frequency alternating electric field (HFC - high-frequency currents; range 0.3-300 MHz) or an electromagnetic wave (microwave-ultra-high frequency; range 0.4-10 GHz)... Heating is caused losses for the dipole polarization of dielectrics. A distinctive feature of dielectric heating is the volume of heat release (not necessarily uniform) in the heated medium. Microwave heating uses electromagnetic waves with frequencies above 100 MHz. Modern microwave ovens typically use 2.45 GHz, although there are devices operating at 915 MHz. When using electromagnetic microwave waves, heating is caused by molecular dipole rotation in a dielectric - a typical dipole molecule is a water molecule... Forced vibrations of polar molecules under the action of an external electric field lead to intermolecular friction, as a result of which heat is released in the entire volume of the dielectric. In imperfect dielectric materials (partially conducting electric current), additional heating occurs due to conduction. In dielectrics, in which the process of molecular polarization is insignificant, and the electrical conductivity is extremely low, heating by the electromagnetic field will be absent; such materials: glass, paper, porcelain, earthenware, many polymeric materials, air, etc. The method is most commonly used for defrosting and heating food. Since water in food contains a large amount of various salts that dissociate into ions, which serve as carriers of electric charges and also react to an alternating electromagnetic field, heating of the food is caused by both the reorientation of polar dipole molecules and the displacement of ions\u201d (Dielectric heating - Wikipedia). That is, all molecules that have a dipole moment (that is, polar molecules) will be heated by microwave radiation. It should also be noted that the frequency of microwave radiation (or wavelength) that is used in the microwave oven is specially chosen to lie within the absorption spectrum of water. Also, the depth of penetration of radiowaves into the heated object depends on the radiation wavelength: the longer the wavelength, the deeper the penetration, since even with attenuation, penetration will occur at least one wavelength. Therefore, the wavelength should be around a few centimeters for the food to be heated. That is why food is well heated in the microwave, since the frequency of 2450 MHz corresponds to a wavelength of 12.236 centimeters. For clarity, let's translate the frequencies of the above ranges FR1 (600 - 6000 MHz) and FR2 (24 - 100 GHz) into wavelengths. 600 MHz is the wavelength \u03bb = 49.965 centimeters, 6000 MHz is the wavelength \u03bb = 4.997 centimeters, 24 GHz is the wavelength \u03bb = 1.249 centimeters, 100 GHz is a wavelength \u03bb = 0.300 centimeters. Thus, the microwave radiation that is used in 5G will have a wavelength of 0.3 to 50 centimeters. Now let's look at the absorption spectrum of water (File:Absorption spectrum of liquid water.png - Wikipedia).  This graph ends at 1 centimeter (10 millimeters), but it is quite obvious that further the degree of radiation absorption will drop slightly (up to 50 centimeters). Remember that in a microwave the radiation has a wavelength of 12.236 centimeters. That is, if we analyze the 5G radiation range (FR1 and FR2, 0.3 - 50 centimeters), then it follows from the absorption spectrum of water that with an increase in the radiation frequency, the degree of absorption of this radiation will inevitably increase. And this means that the biological effect on the body will also increase. It is because of the strong absorption that this radiation is not able to spread over long distances. \u201c...5G at 24 GHz or higher uses higher frequencies than 4G, and as a result, some 5G signals are not able to travel long distances (more than a few hundred meters), unlike 4G or lower 5G signals (up to 6 GHz). This requires placing 5G base stations every few hundred meters in order to use higher frequency bands. In addition, these high frequency 5G signals cannot easily penetrate solid objects such as cars, trees and walls due to the nature of these high frequency electromagnetic waves. 5G cells can be deliberately designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, which finds application in places such as restaurants and shopping malls...\u201d (5G - Wikipedia). Naturally, the safety of this radiation, both 5G and microwave, will be determined by the radiation power density. Radiation power density is defined as the radiation power of a source divided by the area of \u200b\u200ba sphere of a certain radius. P = N/S = N / (4 * \u03c0 * r^2) where P - is the radiation density, N - is the power of the radiation source, r - is the distance from the radiation source. 5G is considered safe radiation if the established safety standards are met. Likewise, microwave ovens have regulations that regulate radiation outside the oven (radiation power density should not exceed 5 mW/cm\u00b2 in the ANSI standard). According to safety standards, the output power of a 5G source in a room should not exceed 10 - 250 mW. Outdoors, the output power of the source should be no higher than 200 - 20000 mW (5G - Wikipedia).  Using the above formula P = N/S, it is easy to verify that the permissible radiation power density is safe (according to the established regulations). For example, let's analyze the power density of 5G radiation outdoors, at a distance of 1 meter from the radiation source. Let's say the source has a power of 20 000 mW. It is easy to verify that safe standards are not violated. P = N/S = N / (4 * \u03c0 * r^2) = 20000 mW / (4 * \u03c0 * (100 cm)^2) = 0.16 mW/cm\u00b2 But, there are nuances here. Let's analyze them. \u201cThe impact of microwaves on a person is reduced to thermal effects (local overheating), manifested in burns and cataracts. Soviet scientists also noted neuropsychiatric effects (fatigue, headache) [7], the reasons for non-thermal effects have not been studied [8]. A person can feel microwave radiation (sensing heating) at a power density of 20 - 50 mW/cm\u00b2. Long-term irradiation above 100 mW/cm\u00b2 can lead to cataracts and temporary infertility. The ANSI standard considers a level of 10 mW/cm\u00b2 to be safe, and the limit for microwave ovens is set at 1 mW/cm\u00b2 five centimeters from the oven. The European standard considers a safe level of 10 \u00b5W/cm\u00b2 (0.01 mW/cm\u00b2) at a distance of 50 cm from the oven [9]\u201d (Microwave oven - Wikipedia). Thus, if the radiation power density is 20 - 50 mW/cm\u00b2, then the person will already feel heating. This means that the physiological effect is already felt by the person himself (devices are not needed). And if the radiation power density exceeds 100 mW/cm\u00b2, it can lead to cataracts and temporary infertility. We got a figure of 0.16 mW/cm\u00b2, that is, almost 100 times less than 20 mW/cm\u00b2. A person will no longer feel heating, but a physiological effect on the body will occur. The mechanism is quite interesting. Recall that microwave radiation, which is used in 5G, heats up materials that are composed of polar molecules. These molecules include water and most biopolymers. That is, various proteins, DNA, RNA, enzymes, etc. substances. Look at pictures of DNA, RNA.  Now look at the picture of proteins. The amide group of proteins (CO - NH) also has a dipole moment and will also be exposed to microwave radiation.  It can be rigorously argued that any organic molecules that contain the appropriate functional groups will be subject to dielectric heating. And in the body it is the overwhelming majority of physiologically active substances. After all, it is due to functional groups that chemical reactions occur. Take a look at the functional group table. All functional groups that contain polar chemical bonds (single or multiple), such as C - F, C - Cl, C - O, C - N, C - S, P - O, O - H, N - H, C = O, C = N, P = O are dipoles, and will be exposed to heating by microwave radiation, that is, radiation, which uses 5G technology.   Moreover, if we remember that enzymes in the body are used in negligible concentrations, and play a decisive role in the biochemistry of the body, then it becomes obvious that the effect of microwave radiation on the body requires additional study. The amide group of proteins will react very intensely to microwave radiation. And therefore, the protein can change its structure (spatial), which will greatly affect the physiological activity. Each specific protein will have its own specific functional groups, and therefore it is fundamentally impossible to predict in the general case the response of proteins to radiation. DNA, RNA and other biopolymers will react in a similar way. After all, the constituent parts of DNA and RNA (ribose, deoxyribose, phosphate groups, pyrimidine and purine bases) are also polar fragments, so microwave radiation will set them in intense motion (like amide groups in proteins). Moreover, all biopolymers (DNA, RNA, enzymes, etc.) when exposed to radiation can rupture. Literally. This is due to the fact that one part of the molecule will react more intensely to radiation than the other part of the molecule. Something similar happens when raw eggs are heated in the microwave: the eggs explode as the water heats up much faster than other ingredients. It is the same in all biopolymers: due to the intense movement of polar fragments, a biopolymer molecule can simply burst. And these are enzymes, DNA molecules, RNA... Moreover, this will not appear outwardly in any way (heat release, etc.), since the concentrations of biopolymers are small. Of particular note, human blood is also an ideal medium for microwave heating. First, it consists of water and electrolytes. Secondly, blood contains many physiologically active substances, which will react intensively to radiation. Note that not only blood, but also other organs, in which the water content is maximum, will react most sharply to the effect of microwave radiation. Thus, we can conclude that the effect of microwave radiation on the human body has not been studied well enough. Especially when you consider the effect of radiation on various physiologically active biopolymers (this simply has not been studied). Therefore, in our opinion, additional research is needed, and obviously, the development of new protocols.     ",

            "answer_text": "Which 5G ? If you cannot tell us what frequency range is of concern, you don't understand what 5G is. 600 MHz, 800 MHz, 1.9 GHz, 2.5 GHz, 28 GHz, 39 GHz? These are ALL 5 G wavelengths that T\u2013Mobil / Verizon / AT&T / Sprint are using! All for difference reasons that I cannot explain easily to you only because I spent 4 years getting a degree in Electrical Engineering, so it will take a very long time to teach you what is going on. I've got it, Your afraid of 5G But do you understand that 5 G is a term, like \"color TV\u201d which is different than B&W TV? Seriously. 5 G really doesn't exist and you can look this up and maybe you will understand how it is a refinement in the WAY the information is transmitted. These are ALL \"5 G\" wavelengths that T\u2013Mobil / Verizon / AT&T / Sprint are using!!!!!!!!!!!!! So what is it? 600 MHz is 600,000,000 Hz 39 GHz is 39,000,000,000 Hz Which one? The difference is between the wavelengths requires an understanding the difference between Millions and Billions and how that energy can, or cannot penetrate trees, buildings, elevators. Is it just a mile away, or if we are on an open stretch of I-10 heading into Arizona, MILES away from a town. Its just NOT THAT EASY! The 5G in Downtown LA, will not be the same as the 5G 75 miles outside Phoenix. It will still be TERMED 5G. In the world of Electronics the difference is huge !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just like my bank account (I wish I had THAT problem) Please be specific. You do not deserve to be afraid. The real studies have looked at the various wavelengths. Interestingly some 5 G uses the same wavelengths as the existing 3 and 4G LTE (Color TV vs B&W, still TV). You really don't have to be afraid, since it isn't an issue, and as I have said before in other responses, with 5 Billion people using cellphones EVERY DAY, there are no bodies, no links to cancers or any health risks. There is no problem. ",
