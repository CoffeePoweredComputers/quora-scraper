            "answer_text": "As the name suggests, \u201csmart\u201d devices have the capability to connect to the internet. A smart STB may have a browser, certain pre-installed apps and few other features that aren't available in a conventional STB. Latest ones can be connected to your router via Ethernet or Wi-Fi. So even if you don't own a smart TV, you can still experience specific types of online content on it. Amazon's FireTV Stick is probably the best choice available in the market. It supports a wide range of OTT apps like PrimeVideo, Netflix, Hotstar, YouTube, Hungama, etc. All you need to do is to plug the device into a HDMI port and connect to your Wi-Fi router. ",
