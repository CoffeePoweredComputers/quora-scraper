            "answer_text": "Solar panel systems are measured in terms of kW. A common size solar panel array is usually around 5kW and takes up around 400 square feet of space. An array of this size can produce an average of 350-850 kWh of AC energy per month. To put that into perspective, a typical household uses about 897 kWh per month. Solar panels no longer require more energy to produce than they produce on their own. That's because: Raw material processing is more efficient. Solar panels are more efficient at converting sunlight into electricity. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Solar Panel material there... ",

SunPower is one such company that has signed on to the Carbon Disclosure Project. You can see that report here: http://bit.ly/SyXUCj In the past, I've seen SunPower systems average a year to cover their manufacturing and shipping footprint. ",
