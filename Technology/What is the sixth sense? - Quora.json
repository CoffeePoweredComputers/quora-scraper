            "answer_text": "The mind has two modes - conscious and subconscious. Conscious mode are what we are aware at the moment, like, reading this comment, hearing a song, seeing our computer, writing comments on Quora. Subconscious are information that are \u201cswimming\u201d beneath the conscious mode - mind chatter, stream of consciousness, intuition, gut feeling, hunches, dreams, nightmares, hallucinations. These information are gathered to and from the senses via synapses, neuronal firings activated by the brain. The final destination is in the mind. The conscious mode uses the left side of the brain while the subconscious mode uses the right side. These modes compete with each other for supremacy or they can work harmoniously. The AHA! and the EUREKA! moments are from the subconscious mode suddenly surfacing into conscious mode. Many artists are aware of this because it is the more dominant mode for them. Who controls the mind? It is the spirit soul which is separate from the mind, from the brain and from the body. The spirit soul is the one watching our dreams and nightmares when our body is asleep; like a moviegoer is watching a movie from a distance. Here\u2019s a more detailed information. Long post. Our physical body and the brain are made of gross matter - different chemicals, atoms, molecules that makes up the trillions of cells and the billions of neurons collectively. The living human being may be likened to a desktop computer setup, the body and the brain are the physical parts that we can see and touch and manipulate, like the computer housing/tower made of metal or plastic\u2013 monitor, keyboard, mouse and all parts inside it - motherboard, hard drives, processors, video and sound cards, RAM, etc. The computer is designed to encode, print and transmit data, to capture and view photos and videos, watch our favorite movies, communicate with people worldwide via the internet and so on. Aside from the hardware, the computer needs software that holds codes, information, program and operating system (mind and intelligence). Not only that, it also needs a person, someone to manipulate it \u2013 an operator or a programmer (consciousness). The full potential of this system is dependent on the capacity and capabilities of the four distinct components \u2013 hardware (physical body), software - codes/information (mind), operating system (intelligence) and the operator (consciousness). The computer on its own without the operator, will not work as intended, rendered useless and just an expensive piece of equipment. The MIND is a subtle material energy. It is the repository, a reservoir of all our experiences gathered from the five senses - hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting and touching, including subliminal inputs and messages our mind picks up unconsciously. These experiences are transmitted to and from different regions of the brain via synapses (a communication between neurons through electrical impulses and neurotransmitters that passes via the complex network of nerves, much like a complex interchange). These experiences are collected and stored into their final destination \u2013 the mind. The mind is a distinct entity from the brain, contrary to what many neurologists and psychologists said that it is only a product of the brain. Their connection is subtle and invisible. \u201cThe working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he (the soul) is even higher than the intelligence.\u201d \u2013 Bhagavad Gita 3:42. These individual experiences are like fishes swimming freely in the boundless pond of the mind. Each one has its own idiosyncrasies and behavior like what each fish is supposed to be. They can swim on the surface, stay afloat or swim deeper and buried in the mud to hide or hibernate. Catching them is sometimes easy and sometimes difficult. A lot of them are slippery, good in hiding and elusive, like when we try very hard to remember where we put our keys to no avail. The mind, although has no awareness or life of its own exhibits idiosyncrasies. It is elusive, tricky, deceptive and hard to tame, like a turbulent wind or a chariot pulled by five wild horses. That is its nature. The mind is where our developed talents, acquired knowledge, feelings and emotions are imprinted and stored, like a documentation of all our experiences in our diary or journal of life. They are always there, sometimes hidden and sometimes visible. \u201cA mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.\u201d - Bhagavad Gita 6:5. An illustration: we are reading a book while listening to music, eating potato chips, drinking orange juice. All these sensorial stimulation/experiences (conscious and unconscious) are stored in the mind \u2013 title, author, story and passages in a book, a sentence or two, snippets of music and lyrics, the color, texture, sweet/tangy taste of orange juice, the crispness and salty taste of potato chips, and everything that our subconscious mind picks up that we are not even aware and conscious of, like the scent of our room, the ambient sounds and atmosphere inside and outside, our feelings, and so on. The senses are only limited to their given task, like eyes are only for seeing, nose for smelling, and so on. They only function when receiving the command from the mind, otherwise, they will only work subconsciously in the background. It\u2019s like clicking a key in a computer keyboard for a specific command. In learning sports that requires finesse, complexity, fine-motor skills, it requires repetitions to be ingrained in the mind deeply and become second nature \u2013 spontaneous, intuitive and will not be forgotten easily; the same in memorization, developing habits and so on. The old adage says: \u201cNot in sight, not in mind\u201d, holds true. Endless practice is what sharpens the mind that trains the senses and the physical skills. The mind has two modes \u2013 the conscious and the subconscious modes, each one uses the brain\u2019s left or right hemispheres (cerebral cortex lobes) connected by a band of nerve fibers called corpus callosum. The conscious modes are information readily accessible to us, like what we are reading right now or in having a conversation. Its forte is analytical, sequential, literal, logical, reasoning, linear, etc. The subconscious or the unconscious mode is the information hidden from us at the moment, like what we ate yesterday, the clothes we wore ten days ago, the last movie we watched or our puppy love. We can summon the memories or information from our subconscious, but they can reveal or hide from us indefinitely or be totally blocked, like in a dementia or amnesia. Its forte is imagination, creativity, feelings and emotions, metaphor, non-linear, etc. Although the subconscious is chaotic, disorderly and disorganized like a stream of consciousness (stream of mind stuff) carrying all kinds of random information, it is a self-patterning system capable of self-organizing, like in an intuition, spontaneous actions, hunches, or dreams and nightmares. It can present valuable patterns and ideas that cannot be had with the analytical, critical, sequential, linear mode of thinking. It organizes itself in a randomly disjointed montage of information or experiences. For example: In a dream, we are flying over the mountains along with pink dolphins and headless chickens, we are being chased by a hundred winged hammers, we are zooming through dark clouds and suddenly finding ourselves in the company of Mickey Mouse and Superman, sitting on the golden table with tall grasses in the middle, we are conversing with our neighbor\u2019s dog and an unknown friend from long ago. Different information from different times and places grouped together to form a surreal but whole story. This dream can be an inspiration for a painting, a novel, a movie, poetry and so on. The sudden AHA! or EUREKA! moments catching us by surprise and elation, which inspired many great inventions, discoveries and ideas is part of the unconscious\u2019s self-organizing system. Google, sewing machine, DNA was inspired from dreams. Play-doh, post-it notes, Velcro, microwave oven was invented because of Eureka! or AHA! (big idea) moments. Knowledge, skills, talents, interests as well as positive and negative traits from our past lives is also etched, imprinted in our present mind that sometimes manifests in our dreams, idiosyncrasies, our unusual interests, talents like those of child prodigies and savants, phobias. In a 40-year study of reincarnation involving 3000+ cases by the well-known psychologist Dr. Ian Stevenson, his subjects remembered their past lives vividly in their minds. Many creative thinkers study the mind extensively to harness its full potential, particularly in generating and formulating creative ideas in all fields of expertise. The INTELLIGENCE is also a subtle energy but is superior to the mind. It is a distinct entity that has no awareness of its own. The intelligence is a tool used to organize the random information in the mind. It is used to arrange the different random words into a coherent sentence, sorting what information needed at the given moment, like a complex task of driving a car, a complex combination of moves in dance, martial arts technique, sports, cooking, sewing and so on. It is the one arranging the beautiful melody in music, fiddling notes on a violin, taking care of a family, harmonizing a relationship, choice of words in a conversation, shining shoes, etc. Knowing and acquiring different skills is the forte of the mind. Arranging them in a coherent grouping at the given moment is the province of the intelligence. Intelligence is what we use to elevate the bar higher in all our undertakings \u2013 science, educational system, economics, religiosity, spirituality and even in deceit, wheeling and dealing, manipulation, and wars. There are two major types of intelligences \u2013 material and spiritual. In material intelligence, there are still different categories formulated by psychologists - Musical Intelligence, Logical-Mathematical Intelligence, Interpersonal Intelligence, emotional intelligence and so on. Intelligence is concerned of what is essential and what is worthless, what is good and bad which the mind cannot know the differences. The mind is like all the different ingredients thrown in a pot, the intelligence cook it into a palatable stew. The intelligence is generally superior to the mind, but sometimes the mind can overpower the intelligence, just like in cases of some people with mental handicaps, mentally challenged/unstable, crazy, a madman. A crazy person behaves irrationally, erratically, unintelligently, no concern whatsoever, roam the streets fully controlled by the mind and live like an animal. It is said that intelligence is a two-edged sword that can free oneself from the miserable existence or entangled forever is this world. Suicide is when the mind wins over the clouded intelligence. The line between genius and madness is very fine. Material intelligence is both useful and dangerous, it can make our life easier and comfortable, but it can also fast track our destruction. And, it can only give us so much, even the best product of material intelligence can\u2019t help us solve the problems of birth, diseases, old age, death, unhappiness, anxiety, depression, misery. Spiritual intelligence is much superior to material intelligence because it can liberate us from the miserable bondage of material existence. It can solve all the problems in our worldly existence and answers all our questions about life, its meaning and purpose, and how to know and love God. Even while still living in this world, spiritual intelligence can gradually elevate us several notches higher from materialism and will not be affected by the chaotic world, inside and outside of us. Who harnesses, uses and controls the intelligence and the mind? It is the CONSCIOUSNESS, the self, the spirit soul, the perceiver of our individual existence. It is the driver, the experiencer, the seer of all our experiences. It is the programmer behind the computer software, the user/operator of the desktop computer, the one who encodes, view, transmits, uses the files and information, etc. The consciousness is both the state of consciousness (awareness, frame of mind) and the state of being \u2013 (conscious spiritual self). It uses the intelligence to direct, sort and organize the mind, the brain and the senses. It is the one responsible for animating the physical body, like a driver manipulating his car. The driver switches on the engine, manipulates all the controls in his car, drives and steers where he wants it to go, feeling/sensing everything that happens to his car, etc. The moment the driver switches off and leaves his car, the car won\u2019t function anymore. The consciousness can exist without the intelligence, the mind and the physical body. But, the mind, intelligence, the brain and the body are useless and cannot function without the consciousness, the life inside it. There are cases of people with very little or with no brain (gray matter) but many live a normal life until adulthood, like in the cases of hydrocephaly and anencephaly. The consciousness, intelligence and mind directly communicate with the senses, like taking a shortcut without passing through the \u201ctoll gate\u201d of the brain. The intelligence is what the consciousness uses to sort the random information from the mind and gives it a coherent value, like arranging jumbled words into a sentence, paragraphs and into a book, or finding and arranging a word from random letters in a Scrabble game. The ultimate goal of the consciousness is to guide and elevate the mind, intelligence, bodily senses into a higher platform of spirituality. The consciousness/spirit soul has to understand first its inherent nature, it\u2019s distinction as spirit soul from the physical body, mind and intelligence, and its innate nature and position in connection with the Supreme Spirit, God. All our talents, mind, intelligence, achievements, successes will be lacking and ultimately has no value that will be stripped from us at death, unless we used them in a much higher purpose - spirituality.

            "answer_text": "6h sense is a very real phenomenon. It shows you present or future events. Did you ever get a sense something was going to happen it did. Or it happens in the future ? Many of these things give us a heads up to watch what's happening. I had a sense something was very http://wrong.My head kept realing,many thoughts of things going on. I heard loud pounding,and felt true feelings of being scared. I was talking to my friend Susie on the phone. It was broad daylight and as I looked up towards my door,I seen blood running down the wall beside it. I started screaming.Walked over to the wall and ran my fingers through it. It left my finger prints threw it. When I looked at my hand there was nothing. Not on the wall either. I heard someone running up and down http://steps.So I called my next door neighbor Becky and asked why here boys kept doing it. Her response is they weren't home but at their dads. 2 o'clock seemed to stick out on everything I looked at.What the hell's happening to me ?! Finally I talked myself into calming down about 1. 2 oclock I heard the pounding again.I was scared to get out of bed but the pounding kept getting louder. When I looked out the window there was my ex husband.Drunk and high screaming he was going to kill me.Our last a history of domestic violence. I called the police and begged them to hurry.He was prying open my door with a tire iron. They told me to keep him talking as long as possible to give them time to get there. I rattled on like a crazy person.He told me since it was close to my birthday he would let me chose how I was going to die. Standing,sitting or laying http://down.My daughter of 3 was sleeping upstairs. I just sat there staring at him.He grabbed my armpulling me up and slinging me on the wall,beside the door. He raised the tire iron over my head to hit me.I heard a loud banging on the door. I shoved him back as hard as I could and he fell on the coffee table breaking it. I swung open the door to see a police officer.They wrestled on the floor trying to get him handcuffed when the second officer arrived. They got him out and arrested. Many things I seen and heard warned me of danger .I couldve died that night.Without my visions and hearing things I would never had known what I did. That's how the 6h senses work ",
