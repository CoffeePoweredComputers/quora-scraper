            "answer_text": "Are you talking about \u201cthe brick\u201d ?  Its battery lasted for about 30 minuets of actual talk time. The minutes were very expensive (something like 7\u201310 dollars a minute or something like that if I remember correctly) and charged by the minute used rounded to the next minute. It cost almost 4000 dollars ( nearly 10,000 dollars in todays money). This wasn't for texting, web surfing, snapchat updating and twitter fallowing. It was a phone to use when you were out of the office. It used a much smaller cellular network that was only available in the large cities like NYC, Chicago, or LA for example. It ran on the AMPS cellular networking . It was an analog wireless signal and has been obsolete for several decades around the world now. What was it like? The best ever look into the future of communication and electronics. About as exciting as the first TV, radio, telephone, film camera, and phonograph. It is a museum relic today and about as useful as a desktop figurine, just something to look at. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question Kitty. Here is a overview of the first portable cell phone by Motorola. DynaTAC is a series of cellular telephones manufactured by Motorola, Inc. from 1983 to 1994. The Motorola DynaTAC 8000X commercial portable cellular phone received approval from the U.S. FCC on September 21, 1983. A full charge took roughly 10 hours, and it offered 30 minutes of talk time. It also offered an LED display for dialing or recall of one of 30 phone numbers. It was priced at $3,995 in 1984, its commercial release year, equivalent to $9,634 in 2018 Quite an interesting read. Imagine paying almost 10K for a phone. ",
