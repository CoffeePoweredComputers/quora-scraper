            "answer_text": "There are few options. Good cities should have (1) native good universities, (2) good citizen culture, (3) industry ecosystem, and (4) good connection to the central government. Citizen culture means people are not lazy (laid back) and not overly aggressive. I will give you score in each four categories, from 1\u20135, with 5 being highest. China has unique city residence system - it is difficult for graduates to be admitted as a city residence. It is not like in America where you can move freely and live freely in cities.  Shenzhen: 2\u20132\u20135\u20134 (Shenzhen is super expensive and super sneaky, with no good historical universities of its own. Shenzhen does industrial development fast!!) Beijing: 5\u20134\u20134\u20135 (super expensive and difficult to get Hu Kou, or residency) Hangzhou (Alibaba headquarter): 3\u20133\u20134\u20133 Shanghai (the financial capital): 4\u20134\u20134\u20134 (hard to gain residence) Wuhan (Hubei province): 3\u20133\u20132\u20133 Suzhou: 3\u20134\u20134\u20133 (super developed but lacks high caliber nerds culture) Chengdu: 4\u20134\u20132\u20133 (strong nerds culture, but a bit far from capital)  These are my opinions, after many years in China and USA doing business. If you ask me more specific cities I will rank them for you.  This is Suzhou. A typical research park looks like this. This is the \u201cNano city, phase 2\u201d.  Shenzhen, does not do research, but only does development. Full of hope, and full of scams of ALL SORTS. It will take you a life time to learn all Shenzhen scams. ",

            "answer_text": "Please, no. Do not just hit Shenzhen for tech, Shanghai for consulting/finance and Beijing for culture. Do not fall prey to stereotypes. China is big, times are always changing, and business choices involve money. You want to make the most out of your money. China is filled with special technological development zones which encourage specific tech fields in the various provinces of the nation. On one side, they help to diversify the local economies, on the other, they can be synergic to the key industries and local geography. Shenzhen is a wonderful city, there are so many industries there, but it grew expensive (in certain respects, it is the most expensive city of China) and it relies on other cities for manufacturing due to the rising costs of life. If you want a GIANT tech company, sure, you may want a representing office in Shenzhen, just like you may want one in Shanghai, Chongqing and Beijing, but I would not bet my initial investment in a city that is not perfectly suited to my needs, just because it is famous. What type of technology you will work on? Will you do R&D? Manufacturing? OEM manufacturing? Trade? Cooperate with an important company? According to the answers to these (and many other questions) you will have very different options ahead. I\u2019d be glad to help you once you have some more details. ",
