            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a tough one. Suggestions: Fast boot up - Boots up in seconds.Fast setup - Connect to WiFi, sign into Google Account, start working.Google Suite - Chromebooks are designed to work with Google Suite i.e. Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides etc.Collaboration - Work easily with others.Secure - Since files are stored on the cloud, in the event of device loss/ damage, files can be access via another Chromebook, PC, Android etc. Contrast this with Win10 where files tend to be stored locally with risk of data being compromised.Hassle free update - Chrome OS updates are pain free. Contrast this with Win10 which is time consuming and potentially problematic.Restore - Google Suite files can be restored to an earlier version. Great for recovering from mistakes.Media - View/ listen to photos/ videos, podcasts/ music that have been downloaded or online. Most Chromebooks have USB or MicroSD ports.Google Play apps - Install Google Play apps.Long batt life - Easily eight hours.Cost effective - Available via Amazon from USD 170. Even if lost or damaged, it will not cost an arm or leg to replace.Chromebooks are a better way :-) ",
