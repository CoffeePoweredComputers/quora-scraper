            "answer_text": "Depends on the specific doorbell that you are talking about! Check for it\u2019s manual or inspect it to understand what type of battery it requires to run. Although most doorbells do not use battery, they either use a small transformer to power the doorbell circuit or like the one that I\u2019m using now that cleverly uses a electromagnet running on AC so it oscillates back and forth and hit two bells on either side and make sound.Although before this I used one that had two AA cells inside and they are pretty easy to replace, just open up the back cover and change the cells and you are good to go!

            "answer_text": "Most permanently installed wired doorbells do not have batteries.There's usually a 24 volt AC transformer operating from the AC mains in the attic or somewhere, that powers the circuit. If you have a wireless doorbell then the transmitter will be in the button at the door and have a small battery. The receiver will be at the bell and have a larger battery in it. ",
