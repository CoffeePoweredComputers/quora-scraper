            "answer_text": "The main danger that humanity faces in regards to technology is its utilisation as a crutch rather than a tool. The former scenario has definitely occured quite frequently in recent decades. It is not all bad though--advances in technology have made life more convenient, enjoyable, and productive, and computer science alone has revolutionized human society in an unprecedented fashion (think of the internet, social media, e-commerce, or even gaming). However, there are clear signs that we are becoming overly dependent on technology. Automation and artificial intelligence have trivialised dangerous or tedious tasks, but we sometimes rely on them too much to get work done. Do we really need robots to mop our floors, or a smart device to give us random information? People will also rely on grammar and spell-checking software while writing instead of making the effort to learn the proper way. Studies have shown that some people even regard these softwares as authoritative figures, like a teacher! You know it\u2019s bad when people respect lines of code more than an actual person. In addition, we rely heavily on technology to control or predict aspects of life that wouldn\u2019t naturally be possible. For example, in vitro fertilisation (IVF) has allowed couples struggling with infertility to conceive, and the genomes of plants and animals are altered to suit the needs of humanity (GMOs). Even weather modification, though mostly the realm of science fiction, has already been attempted several times in the form of cloud seeding. One can only imagine the extent to which humanity will resolve to control nature as technology develops further. The reasons why we are becoming enslaved by technology are the same reasons why we are being uplifted by it. Technology provides solutions, but it is not the solution. Technology is becoming integrated into everyday life, and that can/should be a good thing so long as we don\u2019t allow it to overstep its boundaries in our lives. In the end, it all comes down to us embracing our ever-advancing technologies with responsibility. ",

            "answer_text": "No. We are not becoming slaves of technology - we are already. And there\u2019s hundreds of examples to show it, but just consider your own survival in an \u201cend of the world\u201d scenario. Let\u2019s start with the food. Do you know how to make your own food? I\u2019m not talking about going to the fridge and fixing yourself a tuna sandwich: I\u2019m talking about literally growing it. Have you ever planted anything? Can you tell crops from weeds? Have you ever hunted an animal? Did you skin it? Do you know how to preserve the parts you didn\u2019t eat, so that they don\u2019t go bad? Do you know where your nearest source of drinking water is? Then, let\u2019s move on to clothing. Do you know how clothes are made? If all you had on hand was some fresh animal pelts, would you know how to preserve them, so that they don\u2019t rot? Can you stitch them together to make trousers, or a jacket? Or a blanket even? Let\u2019s say you survived a few weeks on what you\u2019ve found around you, but eventually you\u2019ve run out of things to find and you have to move somewhere else. So, topic number three: transportation. How far can you walk in a day? How many days in a row can you walk? If you come across a broken car - can you fix it? Or if it\u2019s not broken - hotwire it? Do you think you\u2019d be able to catch and ride a horse? Ah, forget riding it - even put a saddle on it? I remember reading somewhere a commentary about the series Revolution, whose author argued that should all electricity in the world fail (physics behind it aside), 85% of the population in developed countries would have died within 4 weeks (more and faster if it happened during winter in the northern hemisphere). If technology is ever going away, then so are we. ",
