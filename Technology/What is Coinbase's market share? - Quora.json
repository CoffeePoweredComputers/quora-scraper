            "answer_text": "Coinbase has three major product lines: wallet, exchange, and API. Wallet The best survey data we've seen (from around July 2014) indicates that about 42% of wallet holders use a Coinbase wallet, making it the most popular wallet out there right now.  The next closest competitor in the wallet space is Blockchain.info with about 34%.  (note that this survey allows recipients to mark multiple wallets in response to the question) Results of a 3,000+ person Bitcoin survey   It's worth noting that this is based on people marking which wallets they actually use, which I feel is a better measure than purely number of signups. In addition, Coinbase accounts are more closely linked to an individual person whereas on some other services wallets can be created programmatically with no link to an identity, so they could (in theory) be used to create throw away accounts, or create a new wallet for each transaction if people wanted to obfuscate what they are doing. Exchange The traditional way to measure market share is by trading volume, although it should be noted that exchanges self report this number so it can be easily manipulated. Three months after launch, Coinbase Exchange is currently #1 by USD-BTC volume in the United States.  We are #3 or #4 in the world by volume (on the USD-BTC currency pair) as of April 2015.  Coinbase also trades EUR-BTC and GBP-BTC. Source Bitcoinity.org API (This includes our merchant tools/payment processing business, which is one aspect of our API https://developers.coinbase.com/ ) One (imperfect) way to measure this is to look at open source Github repositories and which API they are using.  However there are quirks to how Github searching works which make this difficult.  For example searching \"coinbase.com\" in Github does not match the string exactly (quotes don't work on Github like they do on Google). Github actually searches \"coinbase AND com\".  Coinbase is a rare enough word that is mostly works, but it makes it difficult to compare to others. Hope it helps! ",
