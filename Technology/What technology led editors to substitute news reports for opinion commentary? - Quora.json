            "answer_text": "Glad you noticed this trend! It\u2019s very common all over the world for editors to substitute news for opinions. Today, it\u2019s really hard to distinguish between the two, especially on partisan platforms like Fox News, Republic TV etc. But why is that? It\u2019s a one word answer: the internet. Thanks to the internet, the world has information at its fingertips. We now have access to facts and news faster than organisations can digest, edit and report. The instantaneous nature of social media means we get to know things as soon as they happen. The downside of that is over information. Now, we are crowded by information of all kinds. That lead to a new problem: questioning why we should care about certain things. That, plus the capitalistic goal of improving revenue has driven organisations to offer new and unique opinions, in the hope of driving traffic. As you can guess, it worked quite well. ",

            "answer_text": "In legitimate journalism editors do not substitute news reports with opinion. Legitimate media offers news, that is always accurate, fact checked, and unbiased. Legitimate media offers opinion called editorial content. As any fool and idiot knows opinion is not news, it is opinion. Offering opinion is not a \u201ctrend\u201d. It has been with us since the beginning of formalized news reports. ",
