            "answer_text": "Optical communications is based on the use of \u201clight\u201d for the transmission of information. If communication is over the air the systems are usually known as free space communications; if optical fiber is used, then these systems are named Optical Fiber Communications (OFC) and use infrared wavelengths. In OFC systems the optical fiber acts as a waveguide of the light, which in multimode optical fibres is well described through the phenomenon of total internal reflection, whereby light is total internally reflected between the boundary of the core (higher refractive index) to the cladding (lower refractive index). Optical fiber is the preferred medium for the transmission of hight rates of information over long distances, record capacities of 166 Pb/s\u00d7km have been recently been achieved. Recently, optical communications systems are also being explored for underwater communications within ranges lower than 100m at a few Gbit/s rates, based on green or blue wavelengths. ",

            "answer_text": "When electric current is used to carry the signal it is called wired communication. When RF signal is used instead it is called radio or microwave. When light (guided in a fiber or propagating in free space) is utilized to carry information it is called optical communication. ",
