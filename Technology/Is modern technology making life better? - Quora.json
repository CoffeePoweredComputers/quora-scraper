            "answer_text": "Nowadays, modern technologies have become indispensable parts in many sectors from communication to transportation to food processing. Some people argue that the advent of advanced technologies makes life more complicated and people busier. From my own point of view, most of those technologies have positive impact on society. I think, new technologies have helped people achieve many things which were previously formidable or even impossible. For example, since modern solar panels, which efficiently absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity, were introduced, the price of solar energy has been reduced significantly, encouraging more people to use this renewable source of energy. Moreover, nowadays, people usually spend less time on doing housework, travelling and writing thanks to the introduction of washing machines, motor vehicles and computers, respectively. The extra free time can be used for beneficial activities like hanging out with friends and indulging in physical exercises. ",
