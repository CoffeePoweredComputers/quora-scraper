            "answer_text": "As a personal view, education is a term which is loosely defined these days, usually limited to getting a degree. Education is a vast subject in itself to dig through. Every minute from getting up from bed to going to bed, even while in sleep can be a subset of education. No its aim should not be limited to livelihood but we can\u2019t ignore that aspect as well. Its of no use if you are highly educated and can\u2019t even earn your bread. That will be a definite insult to your education. If you are living in Himalaya with a perspective for spiritual knowledge that\u2019s another point. Earning livelihood is all where it starts. Then you go beyond livelihood. You start using the money and education to solve the problems of society e.g. poverty, illiteracy and lot more. Your money gives you the confidence that you can start some projects on your own. You no more seek funds from govt. You respect your knowledge/education, you don\u2019t let it get insulted. Education is where it all get started. So in short, no education\u2019s aim is not to earn just livelihood. ",
