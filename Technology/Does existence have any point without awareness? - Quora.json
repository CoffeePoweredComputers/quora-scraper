            "answer_text": "Your question is irrelevant if you are talking about human beings because they DO have awareness that they exist. They realize that they can think, feel emotions and also feel pain. They know when they don\u2019t have a shelter over their heads, they know when they are hungry, and they are well aware of the fact that they should wear clothes in our society. They are also aware of the fact that they can make choices, and in fact their whole life consists of choices one after the other. We choose what to eat, we chose what to wear, we even choose who we have relationships with. We make many choices each and every day. How could we make choices without being aware of our existence? We have to make them even if they are pointless by some way of thinking. Now, if you would like to know whether animals have awareness, that is a different question. Most people would agree that animals feel pain - although the jury is still out when it comes to insects and fish. The jury is still out on whether animals are able to think or feel emotions, too, but many people and scientists think that they do. Do they make choices? Yes, of course they do, even if their choices are mundane by our standards. When it comes to whether nature has the same awareness, we are suddenly treading on foreign ground. Do flowers know that they exist? Do lakes or rivers have any idea that they exist? And do stones know that they exist? How aware are they exactly? Many people think that inanimate objects like stones have awareness of their existence, but this has not been proved. Whether there is a point to all of this is another matter. How many people appreciate animals and nature? Do they see the point to it all? These are the questions that have no answers because nobody has yet proven that nature or inanimate objects are aware of their existence. We must decide for ourselves if these things have a point, and if they enrich our lives. ",
