            "answer_text": "While you're waiting for a more qualified answer, I can answer (in a basic sense) the second half of your question. Ophthalmologists are full medical doctors (M.D. or D.O.) and share the same core training requirements as other physicians, plus additional specific requirements. This distinguishes them from optometrists, who have the title \"Doctor of Optometry\" (O.D.) for pursuing a four-year eye medicine program but are not physicians in any other sense. What optometrists can do is limited by state laws; they can diagnose and treat conditions to a certain extent, but usually cannot perform certain surgical procedures. Ophthalmologists however can legally perform any ophthalmic procedure and have a more in-depth understanding not only of the eye but also how it related to all other medical fields. First there are four years of an accredited undergraduate degree (B.A. or B.S.). Your major can be in any subject, but you will need to fulfill certain core requirements to take the MCAT \u2013 Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Biology, and Physics \u2013 and additional requirements (e.g. Mathematics, English) and likely some recommended courses (e.g. Biochemistry, Anatomy, Sociology) to apply to med school. Then it's four years of general allopathic or osteopathic medical school, learning both academic and clinical medicine, including rotations in the major specialties and elective rotations in other specialties of your choice. Prospective ophthalmologists will obviously seek an optho elective, which is one key to landing a residency. At this point they are full M.D.s or D.O.s, but the last core physician requirement is a general intern/surgery year of residency, to cement their qualifications as medical doctors. After that, the specific ophtho training includes three years of additional residency (that's four years residency total) learning general opthalmology, after which candidates become board-certified ophthalmologists. However, some (most?) will go on to do a year-long fellowship in an ophthalmic specialty such as glaucoma, retina, etc. to gain even more capacity for that condition before joining or starting a practice. To summarize, that's 4 years of college, 4 years of med school, 1 year of general medical residency, 3 years of general opthalmology residency, and in some cases 1 more year of a specific ophthalmic specialty fellowship. Finally, there is regular continuing education and recertification. ",
