            "answer_text": "Not all Dominicans hate being \u201cBlack\u201d. Im Black and I\u2019ve had 2 dominican girlfriends in the past. However these is some anti-Black elements in the culture. Google \u201cMejorar la Raza\u201d. It means \u201cImproving the race\u201d. This means rejecting people darker or more African than you and having kids with only White people or people more White than you. I grew up around Dominicans so I know about this. Mejorar la Raza Haitians and Dominicans are genetically cousins on the same island of Hispaniola. The west side of the Island was ruled by the French so Haitians are part French and African, however they defeated the French early in the countries history so they are more African than French. The East side of the Island was ruled by the Spanish so Dominicans are part Spanish and African. After the Haitian revolution the Spanish were afraid that the Dominican slaves would revolt like the Haitians did so they sought out techniques to prevent this. They used social techniques. The encouraged Spanish people to move to the island and mix with the African slaves to \u201cWhiten\u201d the population. They also told the people that they are Spanish not Black Africans. Haiti and the Dominican Republic ruffly had the same population but Haiti shares only around 1/3 of the island. Because of this many Haitians lived freely in the Dominican Republic. In 1937 (really not that long ago) a very White looking Dominican Dictator by the name of Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo had an obsession with Whiteness and making Dominicans White. He order the execution of all people whom couldn\u2019t pronounce the Spanish word for Parsley (Perejil). French speaking people have a harder time rolling their tongue like Spanish speaking people. Because of this over 30,000 innocent men, women, and children were killed. Not only were Haitians killed but so were many dark skinned Dominicans and the children of Dominicans that had a Haitian parent. This was called the Parsley massacre Parsley massacre - Wikipedia. Some people consider this the biggest display of \u201cBlack on Black genocide\u201d in the Americas.  Considering that this happened less that 90 years ago there are few people still alive that lost love ones or remember seeing the carnage as a child. Psychologically speaking why would a Dominican wan\u2019t to be called Black, they know the consequences of being Black in their society. On average Dominicans are around 37% African (1/3). Haitians average around 88% African. In the Caribbean the average African percentage is around 75% (3/4). African-American average around 80%.   ",

Black is associate with Slavery, the bottom, un clean, uncivilized, stupid ect.  On the show Orange is the New Black the Dominican inmates refer to their tan skin as the color of their Indigenous Native American ancestry, completely ignoring their obvious African ancestry. 'Orange Is the New Black' and Ethnic and Racial Differences Within the Latinx Community My friends is African-American and wife is Dominican (she looks like Kelly Roland to me). Her family went complete Ape Shit when she said she was dating a Black American. They threatened to even kill her if she got pregnant. My boy looks like Jesse Williams from Grey\u2019s Anatomy. When they finally saw he was a fair skinned hazel eyed African-American they completely changed their attitude and congratulated her and gave their blessing.  ",

Even the palest individuals are considered and treated as black people if they have known or visible black ancestry. Dominicans have every right to think and to feel that they are not black. It is not a matter of hate, it is the reality of their every day life. The USA is a white society with \u201ccolored\u201d minorities. That is just the way it is. Outside the USA, there are millions of people in the world who cannot be considered black because they have European ancestry or other and they do not identify with any black culture. The best examples are the Colored of South Africa. ",
