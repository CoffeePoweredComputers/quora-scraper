            "answer_text": "You need either a zero/all region player, which are surprisingly cheap (I have a few Region 2 discs also), or to order a Region 2 player online, which would likely be more expensive, at least for shipping. What I\u2019m desperately holding out for is a machine that plays Blu Ray discs, and all regions of DVDs. Blu Rays are universal by design, so it\u2019s been obnoxious trying to read in the specs whether the player can handle all DVDs. When the search terms include \u201cuniversal,\u201d it pulls up every Blu Ray player ever, with no DVD-specific info. Most of my huge collection is DVD, with a few dozen Blu Ray, and maybe a dozen Region 2 DVDs. The player I just got is supposed to be universal, even playing audio compact discs, but no Region 2. ",

You could use some region-free player programs to play your region 2 DVD discs, as region free player such as Leawo Blu-ray Player can play DVD discs from any region. Or you could make a copy of the region 2 dvd and remove the region code. ",
