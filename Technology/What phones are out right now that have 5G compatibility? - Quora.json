            "answer_text": "The lists of phones with some level of 5G support is very misleading so I will not list them. The problem is that all these Android phones use a first generation 5G chip that was rushed to market because Huawei attempted to own the entire 5G market as a monopoly by announcing 5G cell tower hardware, years before the industry was ready for a full scale deployment. This attempt, which was funded by Chinese taxpayer dollars, appears to be attempt by the Chinese government to be able to spy on any conversation or Internet traffic that passed through Huawei 5G hardware anywhere in the world. This would have worked had the Austrian intelligence agency not noticed that China was building up a digital 5G spy plan. That is what triggered Australia to ban Huawei\u2019s 5G, which then triggered the US to ban Huawei (the media only reported on the US ban, obviously trying to beat up the US again) which was then followed by multiple other Western countries banning Huawei. While all that was going on, Huawei and other rushed a first generation 5G modem chip to market. The problem with these first generation 5G chips is that in the rich to market the chip design was not optimized so it was not finished. Independent reviews show that these 5G phones can only actually use 5G for up to 30 seconds before they overheat. Once overheated some phones switch to 4G, other simply shut themselves off to cool down. That means that the \u201c5G\u201d that they promise is not real. We the consumers want to be able to sit in the outdoor table of a bistro and use 5G continuously for the half hour or so that we sip our espresso and munch on our croissant. These \u201c5G\u201d phones simply cannot do that. So should they be called \u201c5G\u201d? Probably not because they really are nothing more than wannabe 5G. ",

However, I really do not consider this is a right time and Mate30 as the right choice to purchase. You should wait until 2020 When Qualcomm made this broadband and smartphones (X50 is not counted since it cannot be integrated in the Soc but used as the 2nd part to work with the Soc). Above ",
