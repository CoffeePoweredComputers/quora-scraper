            "answer_text": "Nowadays, you have to filter all the medias, the fake news channels, the social sites that silence your opinions and the books that are fictionalized history. The blogs and newsletters that have an agenda too. It is not transparent as it used to be. I miss nothing -personally as the media has known that bad news is the best seller. Same as Hollywood knows that death and violence and drugs and crime- appeal to a wider audience. I use the net to see the old movies and TV shows of my youth. When it was creative and not political and had surprise endings and not the predictable crap of the present. Same for music and the lack of talented musicians in the computer copy and paste and push button compositions. That classic Rock and folk and Country stuff is the real deal! If I want to see about the latest disaster, I watch the Thai news here and my son translates it to me to get the true picture. I prefer to watch documentaries and Nature programs and science and technology and inventions of mankind and actually learn something , instead of losing hope for the world and seeing the worst of humanity! History is way cool to understand our World! If there was Zero Media. I would, -like many others, do just fine and indeed it would make my observational skills get stronger and more Earth centered smart! ",

However, it would be nice to be without most media. I ignored the news, TV, magazines, and radio for 5 years. But then the virus happened, the world went stark raving mad, and so I had to\u2026you know\u2026pay attention again, for some reason. That was dumb of me. However, the form of media I would miss most in a situation without media, would be books. Stories. They provide a much needed escape from my fellow humans. ",
