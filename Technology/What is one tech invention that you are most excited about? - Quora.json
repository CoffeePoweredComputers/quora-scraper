            "answer_text": "I will answer this question in the context of healthcare. Technological innovations are enabling healthcare providers to advance and enhance the medical industry at an alarming pace. And it\u2019s not just fast. In addition, it\u2019s efficient. Some technologies allowing doctors to diagnose illnesses with 100% accuracy. By means of science and technology, researchers are building new innovations that are expanding and transforming health care. I\u2019m excited about 3 following advancements: ADVANCED IMAGING TECHNOLOGIESNowadays, machine learning algorithms enable practitioners to process massive amounts of imaging data instantaneously. The technology is much more precise compared to a human\u2019s ability to notice tiny details in imaging results such as mammograms and computed tomography (CT) scans. Deep learning technology also helps the latest imaging equipment to identify conditions that doctors are not looking for and might miss because they are concentrated on resolving an immediate health problem. This is particularly beneficial for identifying potentially lethal conditions that would go undiagnosed without the technology. 2. ENHANCED SOFTWARE AND ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRs) EHRs are the subject of much debate. Some researchers argue that EHRs are a pivotal development in the enhancement of the health care system. Nevertheless, lots of care providers find that current EHR systems are awkward to utilize, resulting in the slow adoption of the technology. Doctors that do utilize the technology spend a great deal of their time performing repetitive tasks. Still, researchers hope that AI technology will shortly automate recordkeeping by improving on existing innovations such as voice recognition. In addition, doctors could use artificial intelligence to collect data from disparate sources, such as sensors and wearable health devices, and feed that data directly into patient EHRs. 3. IMPROVED CANCER RECOVERY SOURCES Genomic sequencing has enabled researchers to discover hundreds of cancer-related aberrations, and they expect to discover more. Utilizing this same methodology, researchers are also developing genomic-based medicines for other diseases. Additionally, genomics developments have affected the health care legislative process, with the FDA giving expedited approval of a genomic technology that doctors can now use regardless of where a growth is located. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) performed an evaluation in parallel with the FDA to make this unprecedented decision possible. For the first time, the FDA approved a single test for the diagnosis of each solid tumor. Legislators recognized the genomics worth as a source which is effective for identifying treatment options with a high probability of success. The result is that genomic testing is today accessible to all qualifying Medicare and Medicaid patients.  ",
