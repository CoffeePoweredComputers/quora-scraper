            "answer_text": "I would recommend The DJI Mavic Pro  The DJI Mavic Pro is a small yet powerful drone that turns the sky into your creative canvas easily and without worry, helping you make every moment an aerial moment. Its compact size hides a high degree of complexity that makes it one of DJI\u2019s most sophisticated flying cameras ever. 24 high-performance computing cores, an all-new transmission system with a 4.3mi (7km) range, 5 vision sensors, and a 4K camera stabilized by a 3-axis mechanical gimbal, are at your command with just a push of your thumb or a tap of your finger. Features\u00a0Fly by phone - All you need is your phone. TapFly - Beginner pilots often have trouble flying in a straight line because they aren\u2019t familiar with joysticks, which then makes shooting smooth video tricky. TapFly means you can just tap where you want to go and the Mavic will fly smoothly in that direction, so you can focus on controlling the gimbal and capturing photos and video. Flying really can be that easy. At your command - The Mavic acts on your every instruction almost instantly. Whether you want to shoot a slow, graceful flowing shot, or get your blood pumping at 40mph (65kph) speeds in Sport Mode. See the world like a bird - See the world through the eyes of a bird when you wear the super high-quality wireless DJI Goggles.

            "answer_text": "Since you do not post what is large scale you may be thinking about something that is doable as you mention the best . For the average guy having to do some Surveillance the DJI Phantom 4 Pro with the Phantom Rain Wet Suit is best. The Phantom 4 Pro has 4k inch sensor camera, Can fly a comfortable 4 miles Affordable at $1800 and the Wet Suit is an extra $100 The amount of software for Surveillance to engage in way points is good. Return to Home features are nice. Connection to flight is GPS Satellites and it offers 3D Mapping. You can go to my site phantomrain .org to see more.  ",
