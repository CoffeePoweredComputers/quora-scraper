            "answer_text": "This question lacks specifics, but I will answer the two different ways I see it being interpreted.   IT is a career that if you do not love technology and how it functions you are going to have a bad time. There are other ways to make money.  Getting a \u201cGood job in IT\u201d:  If you are currently working in IT but you hate your surroundings or you are looking for more income with creature comforts skip the longer part.   Specialize, cert up, build your resume and keep your LinkedIn updated. If you do not like the people you are working with, change it. If you feel you are not being paid fairly, change it. If you have done your part in experience building the best you can with the job or jobs you have while keeping your knowledge fresh the rest is just a process. Sometimes experience building is changing departments or jobs because you have gotten as far as you can. If you have a current LinkedIn it\u2019s going to send you job openings and recruiters are going to hit you up about jobs. You just need to figure out which environment is best for you then find the balance of comfort and income. Comfortable jobs generally do not pay as well as stressful jobs. If your current position doesn\u2019t fulfill your desires, find one that does. If you are still new to the career, skim through the rest of this post.   Just breaking in to the career:  If you have a knack and already find yourself following a current technology for fun, spread out and learn more about it in general. Starting at computer hardware and what it does is always a good start, then pivot platforms. Learn how your phone works or other technology works and how they work together. If this is something you have already been tooling with in your down time you are a few steps head of the person that is not curious. If you are not currently curious of these things, get curious.  The first step in picking a direction after getting some fundamentals down; figuring out which side of the house you want to work in, Dev or Ops. If you are ultimately curious feel free to dabble in both but starting out you are going to want surface knowledge of lots of things that have you curious about technology, yet still hone in on something.   With development and the new world, living in the future now as we are, you can pretty much pick tons of SDK\u2019s or languages and learn them for free. If you are more interested in phone apps work with the Android SDK. You want to poke video games? Download the Unreal SDK and play away. But you probably want to start with basics of learning a language, like Java, .Net, or C. Learn syntax and how it goes together to do different things. There\u2019s tons of open source code to dump into whatever flavor you pick to get an understanding of how it functions.  Dev has lots of facets ranging from user interface design to business analyst. If this is specifically you want to break into I\u2019m sure there is a more detailed post on getting into development. It\u2019s a specialty I\u2019ve never taken very far, though I do work with developers daily.  With Operations things vary beyond code, you will be supporting and building the platforms where Dev and Production live. Most of the humble beginnings in IT in this branch are helpdesk. Being the front lines of troubleshooting is where almost everyone starts and you can learn a lot from it. Troubleshooting being the keyword, if you can work your way up from a problem it\u2019s a tool you will keep in your tool box always. If you want a quality structure to troubleshooting look up the Navy Six steps of troubleshooting. A Microsoft engineer I did some work with swears that he\u2019s spent most of his career using those steps.  In the big scheme of operations you want to learn specialties: servers, OS\u2019s, networking, applications, and security.   If you are interested in servers you could start with Microsoft certification material to get a better understanding of how the OS works. You can download ISOs to install in virtualbox on your PC or laptop to get a feel for how it functions. If you do not have a PC or laptop, question your lust to join this field. Get one! :)  I\u2019m not excluding Linux, you can also get distros and play with them as well. It\u2019s a whole different ball of yarn and is equally fun with its own learning curve. If you are new to Linux I would suggest a distro with a GUI like Ubuntu. Knowing various operating systems will go a long way.  Pursuing servers you should also have a basic understanding of the hardware servers use as well as networking. Knowing the spec sheet of your gear can save you lots of time troubleshooting, after dealing with them a while you will get a hang of how vendors lay out their servers for diagnostics etc.  If networks interest you, start learning some Cisco or Juniper certification material. There are tons of methods of using emulation or you can even buy older equipment to learn either. Cisco has packet tracer you can generally get for free and GNS3 emulates equipment from both vendors.   For someone breaking into IT as a career I would suggest working on certifications in the field that interests you. Certs can help get you past HR or get a resume on a desk; from there you really need to know the subject matter. Granted the other side of certs is increasing your knowledge and building your career, so when you do get a job keep your skills evolving with the technology.   College is not required for this career but you will find even entry positions want a degree. The best way around this if you do not have a degree is persistence with confidence bothering everyone you can think of about jobs that sound cool. Lots of jobs listings will post degree or equivalent experience required, if it only says degree with enough experience it\u2019s worth still applying. If you have a degree it will ease the process but in either account the person on the other side of the interview table is looking for your passion of the subject matter. If you enjoy this stuff, the sky is the limit. Once you get your first job it\u2019s all on you where you want to take it next and sometimes you have to change companies or specialties to increase your income or move up in your career. Sometimes changing specialties has a pay decrease with longer better goals in mind. The most important thing is to love technology.  I\u2019m sorry this answer is so long, I\u2019m rather passionate about my career. I spent a long time trying to break into it proper years ago getting tips from people that were less direct to a path, because sometimes in IT those people do not even know how they got there. If there are more questions or I can assist further feel free to ask, I will gladly respond. Happy hunting. ",

            "answer_text": "1 Focusing Your Interest 1Decide if you\u2019re suited to IT. You may be inclined towards information technology work, even if you haven\u2019t given it much thought before. If you have a computer and use it for more than just homework, games, and casually browsing the web, then you may have the right stuff for the Job Group S.r.l. - Business Solutions work involves a lot of puzzles and experimentation. This makes it great for folks who like making connections and solving problems.[1]People who want to go into IT should be able to work independently. This means that you must be motivated to solve problems on your own, and able to push yourself to improve.[2]2Identify your passions and work with them. IT is a vast field, so it\u2019s worth it to focus on sectors that reflect what you love. For instance, if you love computer games, focus on that! Look into \u201cIT computer gaming careers\u201d and you might learn about IT fields you never knew existed, from game testing to writing game software to gaming customer support.3Focus based on your work style. You may love computer games, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re suited to every gaming job. Your personality shapes your talents as much as your passion does. There are hundreds of IT job descriptions out there, but most of them fall into three categories: consultant, project manager, and developer. The one which suits you most will depend on your personality.[3]Look into consulting if you\u2019ve ever dreamed of having your own advice column. Consultants work independently and dish out advice and expertise to multiple entities; the best consultants are friendly, patient, and helpful.[4]If you\u2019re good at getting organized and inspiring people, think of being a project manager. Not all project managers are as rigid as Darth Vader. Successful ones are energetic, focused, and good at seeing the big picture.[5]If you\u2019re bursting with ideas, look into being a developer. These workers are the creative side of IT: they invent new strategies and fix their own mistakes.[6]4Get to know the right people. Many IT gurus love to assist people. If you\u2019re just dipping your toes into the world of IT, investigate to see if you have someone in your friendly or professional network who can tell you about the basics of your chosen field.[7]There\u2019s nothing wrong with networking, so don\u2019t be shy about asking questions.Find a role model. If you know someone with your dream job, it\u2019s especially important to talk to them! Meet for coffee and ask them about their career arc. What kind of education do they have? What do they know now that they wish they\u2019d known before?[8]If you don\u2019t know your career role model personally, that\u2019s fine too. Try looking at the LinkedIn pages of folks with jobs you admire. What sorts of experiences have they racked up? What do they emphasize about themselves?[9]Method 2 Getting Educated and Certified 1Evaluate your existing degrees and certifications. A bachelor\u2019s degree in IT is helpful for entry level jobs, but it\u2019s not absolutely mandatory. Some employers will accept a bachelor\u2019s degree in a related field (like computer science) or an unrelated field (like history). You might even be able to swing an entry-level position with no bachelor\u2019s at all.[10] However, many if not most IT positions prefer some sort of higher educational experience.2Review your self-taught skills. The more education you get in the field, the better your income will probably be in the long run.[11] Still, don\u2019t discount the importance of skills you\u2019ve learned outside the classroom.Think about projects you\u2019ve worked on (like designing a website or a game). What role did you play in them? Were your creative or organizational powers challenged?Find out if any of these skills are certifiable. Certification is often as easy as paying a fee and taking a test; if you\u2019re already so comfortable with something that you feel confident about taking an exam in it, go ahead and get certified.3Identify your availability. Are you just starting undergrad, or are you a stay-at-home parent? The amount of time you have to devote to your IT training and education will shape what you are able to do. However, if you\u2019re not able to set aside 40 hours a week to learn about IT, don\u2019t despair; remote and part-time opportunities may be just what you need.[12]4Search for educational opportunities. Based on your desired career path, current educational and professional experience, and amount of free time, look into different schools to figure out which suits you best. Don\u2019t forget to determine what the entry requirements are for each field of study.Make a spreadsheet to keep you on track. Include time commitment, commute, and financial aid, as well as certification.[13]Don\u2019t go into unmanageable debt for a higher-education degree. Reputable online programs, trade schools, and financial aid can help you manage the cost of your schooling.Know that there is no single educational path to an IT career. It's a broad field, and your education may take anywhere from a few months to four years to complete. For instance, to be a systems analyst, you may need a bachelor's degree, but for help desk work, you may only need experience or an associate's degree.[14]5Look into professional certifications. Even without a college degree, an MCSE or A+ certification can gain you significant credibility. For most certifications, you'll study and review a certain narrow subject, then sign up for an online exam. There is usually a fee, but the exams are often quick and can be done in your home.[15]Figure out the best certifications by researching which ones are popular in your country and field, and stay updated! As you might expect in a tech field, certifications emerge, update, and become obsolete every year.Consider getting certified in a popular programming language, like Java.[16]Information Technology Infrastructure Library certification has been around since the 80s (with updates, of course). It's one of the most broadly applicable certifications around, so it's good for generalists.[17]Database certification will also serve you well, since all sorts of businesses use them to organize their information. Oracle offers several database certifications at different levels.[18]Don\u2019t assume your educational degree will be enough. Certifications can net you an 8-16% pay increase. Not only that, but they make you look committed to learning and growth, which is attractive to employers.[19]6Get an internship in a reputable IT department. Good grades are nice, but work experience is even better. If you get a feel for what it\u2019s like to work for a reputable company, you\u2019ll build a network and learn a great deal about IT workplace norms. Also, many of IT internships are paid, which is a nice bonus.Talk to professors or professional acquaintances to make internship connections.[20]Make your resume as great as possible. Even if you don\u2019t have a ton of work experience, a clearly-written and focused resume which highlights your strengths can help you snag that internship.[21]Apply for internships at a range of companies, from tiny to well-known. You might be intimidated by the idea of interning at Google, but remember that someone has to fill the internship spots there. Why shouldn\u2019t that person be you?Method 3 Seeking Your First Job 1Form a resume. Even if you already created a resume to nab an internship, give it a refresh before you apply for a full-time job. Resumes adhere to strict guidelines, but if you work within those parameters, they can say a lot about you. Write in clear, accessible language, and don\u2019t be afraid to show yourself in a positive light.Include relevant work experience and accomplishments.[22] In many cases, customer service is relevant, even if it doesn\u2019t directly pertain to IT.[23]Emphasize your certifications and education, too.Know you\u2019ll have to tweak your resume based on the jobs you\u2019re applying to. Stay flexible.[24]Post your resume on job search and networking sites like Monster and LinkedIn.2Apply with a broad focus. You don\u2019t need to apply to every single IT job in a hundred-mile radius, but don\u2019t waste time looking for the perfect job either. Read job descriptions thoroughly, and give your time to any that pique your interest and seem to mesh well with your skills and experience.[25]3Take time on your cover letter. Your resume shows a lot about your history of accomplishments, but your cover letter shows off your personality. There isn\u2019t as much structure to a cover letter, but in general, you\u2019ll want it written in businesslike language, focused on you and the job you want, and carefully edited and proofread.Tailor the letter to the job. Mention details of the job description, and why they match up to your skills and talents.[26]Emphasize the good qualities and things you\u2019ve accomplished that might not be visible on your resume.[27] For instance, if you\u2019ve done relevant volunteer work as the webmaster of your church\u2019s website, you can expand on it and explain its relevance to the job you\u2019re applying for.4Interview smart. If your cover letter and resume are up to scratch, you may be invited in for your first IT interview. Interviews in any field can be stressful, but with a little preparation, you\u2019ll be able to breathe a lot easier. Focus on doing your homework before so you can concentrate on seeming confident in the interview.Practice your answers to questions the night before. You won\u2019t be able to predict everything you\u2019re going to be asked, but know your chief strengths and weaknesses, your relevant experience, and how to describe yourself in a minute or less.[28]Show up on time and dress neatly. IT workers are famous for a casual aesthetic, but you still want to look like you pay attention to detail.Remember that you\u2019re interviewing the company, too. Ask questions about the culture and expectations.[29] Some examples are \u201cWhat is the last person with this position up to now?\u201d and \u201cDo people in this position work in teams, or independently, more often?\u201d5Keep honing your skills. IT is constantly changing, and once you have a job, you should continue growing along with the field. Keep up with evolving applications, hardware, and software that you'll need to utilize. Blogs and IT publications can be useful resources to find out what\u2019s new, and so can your coworkers and professional network.<Consider getting additional certifications outside of work, either to broaden your scope at your job or make you better at your current specialty.[30]Keep your ears open about professional development opportunities offered within your company.[31]",
