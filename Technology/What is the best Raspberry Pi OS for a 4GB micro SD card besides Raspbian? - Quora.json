            "answer_text": "It depends on your goal. If you\u2019re simply looking for alternatives from a mainstream Linux distribution I suggest one of the Ubuntu RPi releases. I\u2019ve had good results (in terms of performance & resource utilization) with Snappy Core but it\u2019s not a strict Ubuntu subset. Whether the differences matter depends on your requirements and reasons for wanting an alternate OS. Here\u2019s a link describing some alternatives; it has embedded links to install instructions & downloads for various RPi OS distributions. This is not comprehensive but it provides a quick overview from a third-party reviewer: Best Operating Systems for Raspberry Pi 2 & 3 | Top 10 OS List ",

            "answer_text": "You could consider Gentoo for Raspberry Pi. It is a lean and mean distro that is tighly compiled to not waste a single CPU clock-cycle\u2026 well, in theory at least. The upshot is that it is highly performant and will easily fit on a 4GB SD with plenty data space to spare. It is also a very configurable distro so you can configure it from the ground up for the type of application you have in mind. Note that you get to do the building of the actual packages on the Pi device youself, so installation can take a little longer. If you just want an alternative desktop app, try Sabayon Linux for Paspberry Pi, which is pre-built for you and based on Gentoo Linux. ",
