There\u2019s a worldwide rightwing political movement; global warming is becoming an irreversible threat to the planet; extreme wealth disparity is laying bare some essential flaws of capitalism; we over-consume, blah blah blah. But the most central figure that has more impact and on more fronts is probably trump. And WE, human civilization, are like the extreme alcoholic. It seems like our only hope is to \u201chit bottom\u201d, and HARD! trump is that cold slap in the face, if we can manage to learn the proper lessons from it. I\u2019m not at all optimistic. But perhaps we\u2019ll wake up. Without trump though, we were on a slow burn anyway. They\u2019ve been talking about the threat of global warming for decades. American politics has been in shambles for many years. The toxic problems that come from capitalism were not going to change. On top of all this though, we not only have to recognize that we have a problem, but have acceptable plans to make a transition. I have notions about those, but have no audience that\u2019s listening. ",
