            "answer_text": "Only the physical packaging is different. The architecture, technology etc is the exact same. They follow the DDR SDRAM standard. PC uses the form factor called DIMM. Laptops use a shorter version of DIMMs called SO-DIMM. SO-DIMM is just shorter in length and width than a DIMM.... Some laptops may have a lower power RAM but it still will be a SO-DIMM and conforming to the DDR standard. ",

            "answer_text": "Both rams differ in power consumption Laptops- low power, performance is not in par with pc ram,small size,can throttle at benchmark tests but desktops can endure that too to some extent Pc -high power, excellent performance,size is bigger,pc ram is more durable, So the take home message is you comparison is bit biased because it depends on the application of the machine you can compare a portable machine vs sedentary one but the comparison doesn't hold it good ",
