Steve jobs literally brought revolution to almost each and every industry he worked for. Now compare these with all the existing and past CEOs of different companies and check if anyone matches such credentials. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably I would put Satya Nadella above him for reasons below. In 2014, Microsoft market cap was around 300 Billion USD when he succeeded Steve Balmer. As of this morning, 1054 Billion USD leaving Amazon, Apple and Alphabet behind.Well numbers are magnificent but that\u2019s not the reason I would put Mr. Nadella before Mr. Jobs. For the reason I put him above the legendary Steve Jobs or Bill Gates lies in reasons given below.Before Satya Nadella assumed office in 2014, we all know that Microsoft\u2019s innovation was long gone because of culture dysfunction. Top talent were leaving and new talent was looking at Microsoft as an option to start or continue their career. Individuals were frustrated because their work was being rejected despite their work could have fixed major issues in the products and existing culture and vision was way away from Bill Gates\u2019s and Paul Allen\u2019s vision for the Microsoft.Mr Nadella took custody of the company made of more than 100,000 employees and not only fixed the culture, but made it the best culture in the industry.When N Korean hackers threatened to take down any digital company dare to host \u201cThe Interview\u201d movie, Mr Nadella led Microsoft stood up the ground to defend the human rights of people like us.When Government came up with spooky schemes where our rights were at stack, Microsoft stood up the ground and fought in courts including Supreme Court to protect our rights and privacy.When there was a need of alliance to make transparency on how government\u2019s use our data, he worked hand in hand with rival to protect of our own rights.When he did not convey a message appropriately, he did go out in public, apologized and made sure to convey the message concisely.His core is all about Empathy and we all know how hard it is to find a leader with great empathy. I think having a children with CP and Dyslexia would teach any parent on how to become the all time great (people\u2019s) CEO\u2026 ",
