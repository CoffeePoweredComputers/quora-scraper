            "answer_text": "From its origin as a dull white box, the desktop has become a hub of creativity and imagination, with technologies like depth-sensing cameras and 3D printing spinning off a variety of innovations. One example is HP's Sprout, which looks like a normal all-in-one PC, but packs the latest imaging and collaboration technology. At the base of Sprout is a giant touch pad called a Touch Mat, which is a dual-purpose digital canvas on which images can be scanned and also manipulated. A 3D depth-sensing camera lodged in Sprout scans the objects placed on the Touch Mat -- for example, if a coffee mug is placed on the canvas, the 3D camera will scan it to depth and size. A projector on top of Sprout can then reflect the scanned image of a coffee mug on the Touch Mat, which artists can then manipulate by touching the digital canvas.  Computers will become more perceptual with a combination of gesture, voice and visual recognition technologies being installed in PCs. Starting next year, 2D cameras in PCs will be replaced by Intel's RealSense 3D cameras, which will be able to recognize objects and even measure distances between items. The camera's Kinect-like gesture recognition capabilities will also make PC gaming hands free and interactive. Intel has lofty goals, aiming to combine visual, voice and sound input to recognize human moods and reading habits. While those won't happen in the coming year, the 3D camera will certainly make Skype chats more fun. ",

            "answer_text": "Network virtualization in the data center using overlay transport mechanisms like VXLAN, OTV, NVGRE, and the new Geneve draft. These enable geographically-dispersed systems to maintain Layer 2 adjacency, and allow host mobility to occure more smoothly--very helpful in Disaster Recovery situations. Whitebox network platforms and SDN are also emerging and maturing technologies. The idea of building your network on commodity hardware instead of being locked into a specific vendor's platform, and controlling your network centrally and programmatically to adapt to changes in demand and application requirements, is becoming very popular with organizations with large-scale data centers spanning the globe.
