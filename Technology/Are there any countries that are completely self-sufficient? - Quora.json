While there might be some smaller island nations or otherwise isolated countries that may be more self-sufficient %-wise, by necessity or choice, my guess is Russia. Based mainly on having a long history of operating in this waynatural resources potential of Russia is over 20% of the world\u2019s reserves. ... Natural resources used by the economy of Russia account for 95.7% of national wealth. There are large deposits of fuel and energy resources: oil, natural gas, coal and uranium ore. \u2026 In addition, metal ores are mined on the country\u2019s territory ores: iron, nickel, copper, aluminum, tin, polymetals, chromium, tungsten, gold, and silver. There is a great variety of non-metallic ores: phosphates, apatites, talc, asbestos, mica, potash and salt, diamonds, amber, precious and semiprecious stones. Very common are construction materials: sand, clay, limestone, marble, granite and other materials.  In 2005 Russia was the richest country in gold reserves. On the territory of Russia is 1/4 of the world's reserves of wood. (Wikipedia)Russia accounts for 1/4 of the world's production of fresh and frozen fish\u2026 (This and below statements are from other sources. I haven\u2019t linked them because they might me slightly outdated.)[For an approximate understanding,] 9 % of the world\u2019s agricultural land is located in Russia.

You name it, they probably have it over there.a huge agricultural potential that\u2019s fueled by vast reserves of land and fresh water and can sustain both grain cultivation and animal husbandry.25% of all the world\u2019s wood reserves (Forestry in Russia - Wikipedia).a population of over 140 million people, ready to provide the needed workforce in all sectors of the economy.a very good system of education, ranked 13th in the world, especially excelling in technical areas (Education in Russia - Wikipedia), coupled with a strong technological base.a government debt-to-GDP ratio of just 17.7%. That\u2019s the second lowest in Europe after Estonia (Kosovo would also rank higher, but that\u2019s not really a country). A prudent limit for developed countries is thought to be 60%. The USA stand at a whopping 104.17% (Country List Government Debt to GDP).And last but not least, Russia also has the military power to ensure that what\u2019s theirs stays theirs (and maybe what\u2019s other\u2019s becomes theirs as well).

Even if the country has enough resources , for good harmony it has to be a player in the international arena and there has to be a cordial relationship with other countries to ensure world peace. If the Arab nations don't share oil with other nations, the economy of other countries may collapse. Colonisation of most Asian countries happened mainly for search of natural resources. If such a scenario arises- where a country is self reliant, it will be either invaded or colonised. Very rare to find such a country in the world. ",

In countries with very low imports, there could be a lot of things not available though.

Similarly, a country can survive, but without using other support it is not possible to become strong and developed or maintain it.
