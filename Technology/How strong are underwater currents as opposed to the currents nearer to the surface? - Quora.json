            "answer_text": "Tim Cox answered well about oceans. As a lifeguard for seven years, I want to add that in rivers it varies depending on the configuration of the channel, both the bottom and the sides. A rough bottom can send a hidden current to the top; a sharp bend will focus the current to the outside. But strong or weak, the currents that are dangerous to swimmers are the underwater ones for a simple reason: unless you are really, superbly good at the flow dynamics of rivers and very, intensely familiar with the particular river you happen to be in, the underwater currents are the ones that will catch you by surprise, and if they catch a swimmer there\u2019s no way to predict where it will take him! I once rescued a kid who got knocked off his inner tube and vanished under the surface: I recognized within two seconds that a current had him, and knew that the only way to help was to get myself into that current and chase him down (thanks to good training and an adrenaline rush on my part, all he lost was a shirt). But surface currents? No matter how strong they are, they leave you one advantage: your head is still above water and you can breathe! ",

            "answer_text": " It is fair to say that both types can be strong (fast flowing) or weak. We notice the surface currents, if we are out there but for every surface current the will be an under water current usually moving water it the opposite direction. You probably know, or have heard of, the Gulf Stream that runs from the Caribbean northwards up the Easter chore of American then across the Atlantic to the west coast of Europe. This is a surface current. On reaching the polar region it has cooled and starts to flow down to the ocean bottom. It then flows south finally ending up in the Indian ocean. ",
