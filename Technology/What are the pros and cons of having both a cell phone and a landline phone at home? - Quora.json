            "answer_text": "Pro: In a wide-spread emergency, one that interrupts AC power for many hours, most cellphone towers will be disabled.* This means your cellphone will be worthless, even before it dies from lack of charge. Your landline, on the other hand, will still work because federal law requires telephone companies to have battery back up. (Note -- If the event caused some cables to be downed, service to some areas may be impaired.) Con: You need to maintain (and pay) two telephone accounts. *Cell towers, in some cases, will not become disabled due to physical damage but will be deactivated by the provider in order to protect their infrastructure and devote limited resources to higher priority users, such as emergency responders. My Advice: Keep both services active, as I do. Also, make sure you have at least one landline handset in the house that requires no AC power to operate because your so-called cordless phones will stop working when the power fails. Finally, do not bundle your landline telephone service with your cable or satellite TV and/or Internet service provider because their routers rely on AC. Instead, make sure your landline provider connects to your house with copper wire and/or fiber optic cable. ",

            "answer_text": "Many landline phone plans offer unlimited calling throughout the US. I use a prepaid cell phone that charges 10 cents a minute. Even with a contract plan, landline phones are cheaper. In an emergency, I know exactly where my landline phones are. My cell phone might be upstairs, or in the basement, or who knows where. That\u2019s not true for everybody when they use cordless phones. But it\u2019s true for me almost all the time. All those people who are so concerned about my car warranty, my computer virus, and want me to give them money seem to call my land line phone. What would I do without all these kind people looking out for me? ;-) But the one reason why I maintain my landline phone is this. My 90-year-old parents have my cell number and my landline number. I never know what number they will use to call me. Neither do they. I can\u2019t possibly give up my land line number, because I don\u2019t want them to be unable to call me. ",
