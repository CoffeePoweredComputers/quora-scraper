            "answer_text": "First and foremost is to be totally aware of  what information you are broadcasting. Provide as little information as possible on social media. That includes where you live, where you work and who your friends and family are. That is not always easy since some people may identify you on their wall or pages. You can ask them to remove any information you want to keep secure. Don't use your picture or the picture of your children or spouse. Use a pet or something like a nice sunset. Be extremely careful about talking about your life and activities. I understand that is what social media is all about but you should still exercise caution. Don't \"friend\" the friend of a friend. This allows that person access to your social media page. Be careful of sites like LinkedIn where a lot of your information and resume material is stored. Be careful with online forms. Make sure you know who is receiving the information. A lot identity theft occurs as result of phony job offerings requesting resumes and online applications. Never, ever use your social security number online unless you beyond certain who is seeing it. Also make sure your computer is clean of any malware and spyware by using a good software tool. A lot of information is stolen through spyware that is implanted on computers without you knowing. Secure your home network. Make sure you have a strong password on your wireless router. A lot of routers come with the factory default password that does not get changed. Its easy to find that password online. Once someone has it they can monitor your Internet activity and eventually get your information including banking passwords. Use powerful passwords to protect your social media sites and email. When using email delete any suspicious emails with attachments or links. Again, this is how a lot of malware gets on your computer. Do an Internet search of your name ans see what information is available. You might be surprised what you find. A lot of public information is out there as well as comments and opinions you posted. Use an alias whenever possible. If your name is Robert Green you don't want to use rgreen or robgreen@soso.com. Instead use something less revealing like R55g@soso.com. Use multiple email accounts. One for friends and family. One for business and one you throw around to anybody who may request it.  Hope this helps. ",
