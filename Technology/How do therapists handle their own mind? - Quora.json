            "answer_text": "We call it self care. It's very easy to fall into the trap of taking on your clients problems as your own. It's a natural extension of caring about your clients. It is important to keep in mind that doing so does not help your client it only makes you less effective as a therapist . So just like in any other profession it's important not to bring your work home with you. Unlike most other professions however we deal with very real human problems in people we care about who are in crisis. ",

            "answer_text": "They see therapists of their own and I am not kidding. For all of the reasons you may have been told to see a therapist, the same holds true for them. Just because they can be very knowledgeble, professional and helpful with your issues, doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have their own. They are just better able to recognize when they need to talk things out with someone other than themselves. ",
