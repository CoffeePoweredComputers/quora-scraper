            "answer_text": "It is having agencies of the government or hackers watch all of your online activities. If you love in the USA all of your online activities as well as all activities on your cell phone are monitored by the governments various agencies. This is obviously an invasion of privacy, but the American population has allowed this to happen. The government in the USA took away all of the most basic of rights to privacy after 9/11 under the presence of protecting America\u2019s freedoms from terrorism. A government cannot take away freedoms in order to protect freedoms but with a population that gains its information from a corporate controlled media they are easily manipulated to believe such a thing. The name of the patriot act itself is laughable, there is nothing about this bill that would imply a true patriot would support it. This bill was written well before 9/11 but introduced almost immediately after the \u201cterror attacks\u201d, it is a extremely lengthy bill that a lot of time was put into the writing of the bill. It was such a lengthy bill it is highly doubtful that it was read by the senate and house members that passed it. If we as a people wish to live in a free society we must stand up for our freedoms and not watch quietly as they are taken away. Every patriot in this Country should be placing calls and writing letters to their elected officials, Secretary of State, etc and voicing their objections to the tyrannical actions of the government and its agencies. We live in a fear based society with the government and the media instilling this fear into the populace on a daily level. USA citizens should be fearful, but not of terrorism or crime, of a government that is on a daily agenda to strip its populace of their rights and freedoms. If you are worried about crime, buy a gun and protect yourself. If you are worried about terrorist, next time you see one be in a position to defend yourself. I have never met a terrorist but I have met many government officials acting in a criminal capacity. History repeats itself and NAZI Germanys history is not worth repeating in America. ",
