            "answer_text": "Virtual reality and augmented reality are the two hot buzzwords lately. But what\u2019s the difference between them? Virtual Reality \u2013 It\u2019s a computer-generated simulation or replacement of one\u2019s environment. Virtual Reality comes from two different words, Virtual - Not an actuality, Reality- Which means real. Example- You put on a headset, it blocks out your world view and substitutes the digital world which is designed to fool your senses. From the point of view of your brain, you are somewhere else, but in reality or physically you are here only. For example, you are watching a virtual reality video with required wearable devices on of Paris. You see the Eiffel tower in front of you. You move your head around and you notice the video is changing its appearance according to your movement making your brain think that you are actually present there watching the Eiffel tower and not just watching a video of it. Okay, let\u2019s move on to Augmented Reality. Augmented reality is also known as mixed reality is something very different from virtual reality. This is because its main purpose isn\u2019t to cut out the real world and transport you to another world, but rather is to be an enhancement of your real world with a set of magical virtual objects in it. When a person\u2019s real environment is supplemented or augmented with computer-generated images usually motion tracked then its augmented reality. So, if you have played Pok\u00e9mon Go or you have used Snapchat lens face filters then you\u2019ve already used primitive forms of augmented reality. The term augmented reality is attributed to a former Boeing researcher, Thomas Corder in 1990. Augment is from the Latin word which means \u2018to add\u2019 or \u2018to increase\u2019, Hence AR Technology is adding to our existing reality. Applications - There are numerous possible applications of augmented reality, from gaming and entertainment to medicine, education and business. Archaeology - AR has been used to assist archaeological research. By augmenting archaeological features onto the modern landscape, AR allows archaeologists to formulate possible site configurations from existing structures.Architecture- AR can aid in visualizing building projects. Computer-generated images of a structure can be superimposed or placed onto a real-life local view of a property before the physical building is constructed there.Education - Text, graphics, video, and audio may be superimposed into a student's real-time environment. As AR evolves, students can participate in interactively and interact with knowledge more authentically. For example, anatomy students can visualise different organs of the human body in three dimensions.Visual Art - AR applied in the visual arts allows objects or places to trigger artistic multidimensional experiences and interpretations of reality.Video Games - Augmented reality allowed video game players to experience digital gameplay in a real-world environment. The gaming industry embraced AR technology. A number of games were developed for prepared indoor environments, such as AR air hockey, collaborative combat against virtual enemies, and AR-enhanced pool table games.Industrial Design - AR allows industrial designers to experience a product's design and operation before completion. Volkswagon has used AR for comparing calculated and actual crash test imagery.Spatial immersion and interaction - AR Technology can also digitize human presence in space and provide a computer-generated model of them, in a virtual space where they can interact and perform various tasks.Military - AR can be very effective to virtually design out the 3D topologies of munition(arms and ammunitions) storages in the terrain with the choice of the munitions combination in stacks and distances between them with a visualization of risk areas.Flight training, navigation, tourism and sightseeing, broadcast and live events, etcetera are some other illustrations. Some of the earliest cited examples include augmented reality used to support surgery by providing virtual overlays to guide medical practitioners, to AR content for astronomy and welding. AR technology is also used by furniture retailers such as Ikea, Houzz, and Wayfair. The app made it possible to have 3D and true-to-scale models of furniture in the customer's living space. Risks in AR Technology - Reality Modification - Although, this could be a nightmare to numerous brands that do not manage to capture consumer imaginations it also creates the risk that the wearers of augmented reality glasses may become unaware of surrounding dangers.Privacy Concerns - Modern AR Technologies depends on the ability of the device to record and analyze the environment in real-time. Because of this, there are potential legal concerns over privacy. In terms of individual privacy, there exists the ease of access to information that one should not readily possess about a given person.Difference between VR and AR Technologies - Virtual Reality tends to be completely immersive with no real-world stimuli affecting the experience, its real goal is to make the user feel as if they are in another place. In Stark contrast to this, augmented reality acts as a digital addition to the user\u2019s world. For example, objects can appear on tables, information can be displayed on floating windows and graphics can be generated all seamless motion tracked to the user\u2019s field.The thing that makes AR and VR different from any other forms of technology is that it directly affects the perceptions and processes of the human mind in an obvious way if the only technology that can provide actual packaged experiences.While there are a large number of people that do think both AR and VR technology will fade out like other forms of technology in the 80s and 90s, the thing to note here is that the underlying technology is vastly more powerful this time around and it's very much feasible.At current rates by 2025, attractive augmented reality experiences will be common places. If done right this technology show incredible potential.",

            "answer_text": "VIrtual Reality The definition of Virtual Reality is coming from the definitions for both virtual and reality. Thus, the definition of virtual is nearby and reality is what we experience in that as a human beings. So the term Virtual Reality basically means near-reality. This could mean anything but it actually refers to a specific type of reality emulation.  What is virtual reality in technical terms is straight-forward. VR is the term used to describe a 3-D, computer generated environment - which can be explored and interacted with by a person. The person becomes part of this virtual world or environment or is immersed within this world and whilst there, is able to manipulate objects or to perform a series of actions. Augmented Reality Augmented Reality (AR), on the other hand, is a technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real surroundings, thus providing a composite view.  AR is changing the way we see the world - or at least the way its users see it. Imagine yourself driving or walking down the street. With AR displays, which eventually in the future will look like a normal pair of glasses, informative graphics will pop up in your field of view, with audio that will coincide with whatever you see. Augmented Reality is closer to the real world than the VR which is creating practically a new world. AR adds graphics, haptic feedback, sounds and smell to the natural world as it exists. For us to better understand these two remarkable and future technologies, THIS SOURCE is the best for their differences and what kind of opportunities they represent! ",
