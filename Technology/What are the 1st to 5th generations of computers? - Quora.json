            "answer_text": "1940 \u2013 1956: First Generation \u2013 Vacuum Tubes These early computers used vacuum tubes as circuitry and magnetic drums for memory. As a result they were enormous, literally taking up entire rooms and costing a fortune to run. 1956 \u2013 1963: Second Generation \u2013 Transistors Although first invented in 1947, transistors weren\u2019t used significantly in computers until the end of the 1950s. They were a big improvement over the vacuum tube, despite still subjecting computers to damaging levels of heat. 1964 \u2013 1971: Third Generation \u2013 Integrated Circuits By this phase, transistors were now being miniaturised and put on silicon chips (called semiconductors). This led to a massive increase in speed and efficiency of these machines. These were the first computers where users interacted using keyboards and monitors which interfaced with an operating system, a significant leap up from the punch cards and printouts. 1972 \u2013 2010: Fourth Generation \u2013 Microprocessors This revolution can be summed in one word: Intel. The chip-maker developed the Intel 4004 chip in 1971, which positioned all computer components (CPU, memory, input/output controls) onto a single chip. The Intel chip housed thousands of integrated circuits. The year 1981 saw the first ever computer (IBM) specifically designed for home use and 1984 saw the MacIntosh introduced by Apple. 2010- : Fifth Generation \u2013 Artificial Intelligence Computer devices with artificial intelligence are still in development, but some of these technologies are beginning to emerge and be used such as voice recognition. AI is a reality made possible by using parallel processing and superconductors. Leaning to the future, computers will be radically transformed again by quantum computation, molecular and nano technology. ",

            "answer_text": "The earliest computers didn\u2019t belong to one of those generations - they were mechanical (the Zuse Z1) or they used electromechanical relays. The first generation was computers built from vacuum tubes. The second generation was computers built with discrete transistors. The third generation was computers built with integrated circuits. The term \u201cfourth generation\u201d was sometimes used for computers built with large-scale integration, but not using a microprocessor for the entire CPU. The term \u201cfifth generation\u201d was used for an initiative in Japan to make more advanced computers that used artificial intelligence. While today we do have advanced computers that use artificial intelligence - look at Google\u2019s success with machines that play chess and Go - that was long after the Japanese fifth generation project was abandoned as unsuccessful. So while the firstt three generations of computers are universally agreed on, the fourth generation is a little unsure, and nothing really belonged to what once was called the fifth generation. ",
