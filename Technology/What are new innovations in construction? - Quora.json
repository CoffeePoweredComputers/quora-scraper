            "answer_text": "Here are some innovative changes are being made to old construction technologies to make the future beautiful, clean, and (most importantly) livable. Diamond Nanothreads Diamonds are the hardest minerals that occur naturally on Earth. In the right form, that strength makes diamonds an excellent building material. At Penn State University, researchers have created innovative diamond nanothreads that are 20,000 times thinner than a strand of human hair. Even so, diamond nanothreads are considered the strongest material on Earth (and possibly in the universe). Besides being thin and strong, they are incredibly light. The researchers were able to create these strings of ultrathin diamonds by applying alternating cycles of pressure to isolated benzene molecules that were in a liquid state. This created rings of carbon atoms that came together in an orderly chain.These nanothreads may not be used in everyday construction, but they could be used in ambitious projects, such as the cable for a space elevator, which could lead to cheaper space tourism. Aerogel as InsulatorIt is created by removing liquid from gel and replacing the liquid with gas. By doing this, the substance becomes ultralightweight because it is 90 percent air. When made into a blanket, it is great for insulation. Aerogel has been used to insulate piping in industrial areas, and it was even used on the Mars rover. One company that wants to use aerogel technology for home insulation is Aspen Aerogels. They created a product called Spaceloft blankets that are easy to work with because they are so light and thin. Despite their light weight, the blankets have two to four times the insulation value per inch when compared to traditional insulation of fiberglass or foam.Spaceloft blankets also allow water vapor to pass through them, and perhaps most impressive, they\u2019re fire-resistant. Although houses wrapped in aerogel blankets won\u2019t be fireproof as the houses in Fahrenheit 451, this type of insulation would certainly reduce the number of residential fires.The problem is that aerogel is much more expensive than traditional insulation, although it will save money on energy bills in the long run. Also, not all houses can be easily retrofitted with the material. The blankets work best in older homes or with new homes that are specifically designed to be insulated with aerogel. Road Printer Road printers like the Tiger Stone paving machine, which can \u201cprint\u201d 300 square meters (3,200 ft2) of cobblestone road in a day.Another is RPS\u2019s RoadPrinter, which can do 500 square meters (5,300 ft2) per day. One to three operators feed loose bricks into the machine. Then the pusher sorts the bricks into a pattern like a carpet. At that point, gravity takes over, and the machine lays down the brick road. Afterward, a steamroller presses the bricks into place. The printers are electrically powered and don\u2019t have many moving parts, which makes them easy to use and maintain. Also, they don\u2019t make much noise, especially compared to traditional methods of paving roads.Of course, the major difference between most roads and the machine-printed ones is that the machines lay down brick instead of asphalt. However, brick roads are also better than asphalt because they filter water, expand when they are frozen, and last longer. Solar PaintsOne of the biggest complaints about solar panels is that they are large, clunky eyesores that aren\u2019t powerful enough. To change that, a few researchers are producing solar cells that are so small and flexible that they can be painted onto surfaces. In fact, a team of researchers at the University of Alberta has created a spray-on solar cell with nanoparticles of zinc and phosphorus. If every homeowner painted his roof with this type of solar paint, it could generate more than enough energy for the house and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. No retrofitting would be needed, which would minimize construction work. Also, solar paint is much less expensive to produce than traditional solar panels. The solar cells used in the paint are not efficient yet, but the researchers are working to fix that problem. Smart concrete (Topmix)When an area starts to flood, there aren\u2019t enough places for the water to drain. This becomes worse in urban areas because there is less soil to absorb the water. To reduce flooding, UK company Tarmac has created an asphalt product called Topmix Permeable. Most concrete allows some water to soak into the ground, but only about 300 millimeters (1 ft) of water gets through per hour. Topmix can allow 36,000 millimeters (118 ft) of water through per hour, which is about 3,300 liters (880 gal) per minute.Instead of using sand like most concrete, Topmix makes its product with pieces of crushed granite that are packed together. Water drains through these pieces of granite, where it can be absorbed into the ground, routed to a sewer system, or collected in a water reserve. Besides reducing the chances of flooding, Topmix keeps the streets drier, which makes them safer. Also, the water can be routed to a reservoir for reuse in any number of ways. The problem with permeable concrete is that it can only be used in areas where it doesn\u2019t get too cold. Cold weather would make the concrete expand, which would destroy it. It is also much more expensive to install than traditional concrete, but cities may save money in the long run if the product reduces flooding. Smart Bricks Smart BricksbJust by looking at the Smart Bricks developed by Kite Bricks, you can see that they were inspired by Lego. These building blocks have knobs on the top, and they connect exactly like Lego pieces do. Smart Bricks are held in place using rebar, with pieces of different shapes layered in the design. Instead of using cement, the bricks are held together with a strong, double-sided adhesive. On the inside of the building, interchangeable panels with patterns can be attached to the bricks. These panels would remove the need for drywall and painting. There are also pieces to build floors and ceilings. The centers of the blocks are empty, leaving room for insulation, plumbing pipes, and electrical wires. The bricks would lead to better thermal energy control, greater versatility in construction, and lower construction costs of about 50 percent. Robot Swarm Construction 1 Robot Swarm ConstructionTo develop innovative methods in the construction world, Harvard researchers turned to nature for inspiration, specifically termites. Termites can build large structures despite having no central supervision. To do this, termites bring a piece of dirt to the first construction site. If that spot is taken, they simply move to the next spot. The TERMES Project uses the same idea of swarm construction, but they use small robots. These simple, inexpensive drones build structures by following an initial design and putting a block in the next available space until the structure is finished. This means that the swarm needs little intervention from humans after the initial design. The swarms would be ideal for building structures in dangerous places, such as those in space or underwater. They could also do menial work that would be a waste of human time. As they are self-guided, they can build structures more efficiently and effectively than humans. ",

This is a product specially created keeping in mind the changing climatic conditions, keeping homes naturally cool & comfortable throughout the year for generations.  Advantages: 1.Natural and green 2.Comfortable and healthy living 3.Fire protection 4.Easy installation Disadvantages: The compressive strength of Porotherm Thermo bricks(3.5 N/mm\u00b2) is very less than Class I clay bricks(7 N/mm\u00b2)(Based on British Standard 3921:1965). This restricts the use of Thermo bricks in huge structures.These bricks have density of approx. 694 to 783 kg/m3 which is pretty less than that of clay bricks (which ranges from 1400kg/m3 to 2100 kg/m3). Thus the Porotherm bricks cannot be used, specially for foundation and base-slab works in areas of high round water table as they would not be able to resist the negative pressure of water and capillary action.The water absorption of Porotherm bricks is 15% .Preferred absorption is 10% in clay bricks as more absorption leads to salt attacks and thus reduces the strength of the structure.Continuing use of clay bricks in construction industry will lead to extensive loss of fertile top soil. This can lead to devastating environmental hazard.3.EPS Panels: Expandable polystere panels are precast panels which are cost-effective,lightweight construction material with excellent insulation properties.  Advantages : Effective and durable thermal insulationAbsolute water and vapour barrierAir-tightness for controlled environmentsLong life, low maintenanceLightweight, fast and economic constructionHygienic food grade finishMost cost effective insulation material available.Disadvantages: 1.Complex construction as it involves hanging nets.2.Toxic, ordinary polystyrene foam insulation board is easy to burn, toxic combustion fumes is emitted when burnt.3.Material strength is poor, prone to cracking and falling insulation phenomenon.4.These panels needs strengthening treatment because of its limited strength. Although the advantages of polystyrene foam insulation board is more, but the disadvantages are more deadly. At present, the market has been gradually reduced the use of EPS panels. ",
