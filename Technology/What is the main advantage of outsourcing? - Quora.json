            "answer_text": " For startups with limited capital, cost-cutting is a fact of life. Luckily, outsourcing is one of the best ways to staff your company without breaking the bank\u2026 and it can help you save in more ways than one! Here\u2019s how: 1. You can hire more employees for the same amount of capital. According to The International Labour Organization (ILO), the average monthly wage of most 1st world countries is approximately 3800 AUD. Compare this to salaries in countries such as the Philippines, which averages to a little under 380 AUD per month. Even with a quick glance at those figures, it\u2019s easy to pick the more practical choice. Some may think that outsourcing means settling for low-quality work, but that\u2019s not the case at all. In fact, workers in countries where outsourcing is an industry in and of itself are often college-educated and highly trained in their fields of expertise. Additionally, workers in countries such as India and the Philippines are fluent English speakers, making communication a non-issue. Of course, the best way to keep things running smoothly is to regularly communicate your needs with your outsourcing company. 2. You can spend less per employee. Hiring in-house is always the ideal scenario, but you have to factor in the combined cost of salaries and other full-time benefits. It doesn\u2019t stop there: you have to provide equipment, software, and other necessities for each employee you hire just so they can get the job done\u2026 not to mention have enough space in your office to give them their own workstation. We haven\u2019t even included the cost of recruiting each person. In fact, Forbes notes that hiring a new employee costs 1.25 to 1.4 times of said employee\u2019s base salary range. That\u2019s a lot of spending you might not be able to afford right off the bat, and where outsourcing makes the most sense. You\u2019ll expect to spend around half of what you currently spend on in-house employees in terms of taxes, benefits, onboarding, and training\u2026 maybe even less. Plus, you can choose to bring them in only during peak seasons, further maximizing your spending.  3. You can run a more flexible team. It takes a lot of time and money to hire the perfect in-house employee. Thus, it\u2019s in your best interests to keep your staff happy. However, losing employees is an almost inevitable part of owning a business. According to a paper published by the Center for American Progress, the average cost of employee turnover is over 200 percent of said worker\u2019s compensation for a year, including the costs of recruiting, training, and onboarding, to name a few. However, you can sidestep all of that by staffing part of your team with offshore workers. Not only can you pretty much skip the hiring process, but you won\u2019t have to spend as much time getting these workers up to speed, either. Since they\u2019re already trained in their specific niches, all you have to do is reach out and bring them in whenever you need to. The same is true for letting go of offshore employees who don\u2019t work out\u2026 and they\u2019re infinitely easier to replace than in-house staff, that\u2019s for sure. 4. You\u2019ll be able to focus on more important things. In most startups, employees have to don many hats to get things done. Unfortunately, this can lead to employee burnout. Not only that, but it can greatly compromise the quality of your work. According to a study conducted by the University of London, the IQ of people who multitasked while carrying out cognitive tasks dropped significantly. An article on Inc. also notes that multitasking also pumps up the stress hormones in your body, making you feel more exhausted. Multi-tasking won\u2019t just affect your physical and mental health, but your company\u2019s bottom line, too. Studies conducted by Humboldt University show that distracted people take around 23 minutes to re-focus on important work, with interruptions causing employees to take approximately 50 percent longer to finish tasks. To make matters worse, said tasks will be completed with 50 percent more errors. If you multiply that by the number of people on your team, that\u2019s a lot of hours going down the drain. By outsourcing menial work, you and your core team can place your full attention on higher-level tasks instead.  5. You can potentially keep your business running 24/7. There\u2019s that age-old saying: \u201ctime is money.\u201d And while running a business from 9 to 5 is still the norm, more and more consumers are expecting companies to be available for inquiries at odd hours. Thankfully, you can outsource services such as Customer Service and I.T. so that your clients and customers have someone to reach out to at any time of the day. Additionally, globalization has totally changed the game. Depending on what industry you work in, you don\u2019t necessarily have to limit yourself to doing business only in the country where you\u2019re based. Marketed properly, your company could earn from clients in other countries. The only problem is that your team is most likely asleep when your potential clients are up and about. But why close up shop when you can keep operations running? By hiring offshore workers, you can essentially keep your company open indefinitely, which means you won\u2019t have to miss out on extra income. As an added bonus, these employees can also be pick up extra projects that your core team may not be able to get to. You may never have to say \u2018we\u2019re fully booked to another client ever again. (Of course, do all this within reason\u2014outsourced employees are human and are prone to burnout, too.) If your business is struggling to stretch out that capital, outsourcing may be the answer you\u2019ve been looking for. To reap these many benefits and more, reach out to us at Outsource Accelerator, a BPO Directory of Philippine outsourcing companies. We can help you get started on finding the best people to get your company going. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey Jake! It very much depends on their business, and type of process they choose to outsource. Start-ups for example. They often chose to outsource due to flexibility, short contracts, lack of in house knowledge and to make sure they can focus on making their business work. Outsourcing their Customer support or back office means they know this will be well taken care off, the provider will be guaranteeing the SLAs and KPIs so the owner can focus on their core business. It\u2019s also common that as they grow, they wish to be able to offer 24/7 contact centers, and that is a lot easier to offer throgh outsourcing. In some cases we are even part of our clients business even before they launch. Having an outsourcing partner to the help build and plan their contact center solutions means they don\u2019t need to focus on this at all, knowing they have experts helping them set it all up, and then running it. A lot of SMEs chose to start using outsourcing as they grow to be able to scale up in a fast but secure way, not having to hire a lot of staff locally while keeping the costs at a minimum. In these cases the company usually have a in house team already performing the tasks they wish to outsource. But by extending their operations with a remote team, they don\u2019t need to worry about getting bigger offices, recruiting/hiring and managing a lot more staff, risking that non-core tasks start taking up to much or their focus. Often do they promote the local team to managers to manage the outsourced team and making sure that the quality of their services do not suffer. Basically how you would normally do on a local level, just at a much lower monthly costs and with no need of any investments in infrastructure. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Outsourcing is in the air, everywhere I look around\" as John Paul Young could have said. Outsourcing is one of the most popular ways to make the third-party vendor work for you on a contract basis. Here are the 3 main benefits of outsourcing, especially IT outsourcing: 1) It reduces costs With IT outsourcing you can get high-quality and low-cost workforce. Especially if you hire IT specialists from such countries as Ukraine, Poland or the Czech Republic. Also, If your business needs to maintain infrastructructure, or choose a new marketing strategy, outsourcing often removes the needs for the supplementary budget. 2) You can focus on the main business activities. You save your time and nerves from continuous thinking and scrolling through Google pages, looking for the information. That's normal not to have expertise in all spheres. With outsourcing, you save time and money, focusing on dealing with the main tasks of your organization. Your outsourcing partner focuses on other tasks that are needed to be done but are out of your expertise or too time-consuming. 3) It makes your business more competitive Outsourcing helps your organization gain the competitive edge in the market. As it not only provides you with a more customer-oriented marketing strategy but increases your productivity. Strategic outsourcing helps manage your in-house resources intelligently, as it provides you with analytical expertise. The other well-presented benefits of outsourcing are provided by Deloitte (Global outsourcing survey 2016)  Also, here are most reliant on outsourcing business sectors  So now, while you are thinking whether to outsource or not, your competitors benefit from it.

It is natural that this growing amount of non-tech business people seek for co-founders possessing technological knowledge. Naturally, without know-how, this searching process becomes very challenging.  source: Merixstudio\u2019s Instagram Building an MVP with offshoring company seems to be a natural choice. However, such patch might become even more difficult than finding a CTO and start recruiting an in-house team. The main benefits of software outsourcing are: Cost efficiency. By hiring a team elsewhere you cut the costs of manpower by hiring a team from a country with a lower currency and financial expectations. The worth of mentioning is the price-quality rate which looks different in specific regions. I.e. hourly rates in Poland are significantly higher than in India, although the service quality, as well as communication (crucial element), are outstanding.Skillset.

This is one of the conditions you need to consider while choosing a possibly suitable team.Cost efficiency (again). You don't need an HR manager. And office. And Employee Branding strategy.

Outsourcing helps founders concentrate on business development instead of handling all the miscellaneous business processes. The main advantages of outsourcing in my opinion are: High quality - outsource service normally specialise in one particular area they have expertise and experience at. Cutting costs - outsource service cost 2 times less than in-house on average. Plus normally you only pay for the amount of work done, no hidden fees and bonuses. Saving time - once you hire an outsource firm, they normally take care of everything trying to make running the business as easy as possible. ",

It allows you to focus on your business without needing to directly employ specialists, which may be a long and costly process. At the end of the day, you only pay for the service delivered by the consultant without the need to hire a new staff. There are other advantages such as cutting costs without compromising quality, grow competencies your business needs and more. Of course, apart from the numerous benefits IT outsourcing can bring about to your business, it\u2019s also essential to be aware about its potential risks \u2013 you can read more about it in this post on our blog.

            "answer_text": "Because division of labour is often efficient both from cost and quality point of view. With the advancement of both management and production technology it\u2019s getting more and more difficult for in-house divisions to compete with commercial service. Take translation business - the activity that has long been outsourced by even those companies that translate humongous volumes of text on a constant basis. A specialised translation agency has tons of tricks to make their work more efficient - freelancers relations, computer-assisted translation tools, specialised management and organisational techniques, specialised project managers etc. etc. This takes years and millions of man-hours to build. And then it requires constant attention to maintain that edge and stay on top of the market - new stuff is being invented and introduced every day. As a result an in-house translation division will almost always be outperformed by a top-notch external agency. And what if your in-house service falls short? What if it\u2019s mismanaged and inefficient? You, as a company, will have to own the losses. If an external supplier fails to deliver all you need to do is change the supplier and be top-notch again. This is why companies specialise - the way to survive on a highly competitive market is to be the very best at what you do. And that often means getting the very best suppliers too. ",

Outsourcing enables lesser costs due to several reasons such as: You don\u2019t need to spend on equipment and facilities. The outsourced team already have their own.Outsourced team asks for cheaper salaries.One obvious reason for this is that the currency of the location your outsourced team is in might be lesser in value than that of the currency in your home country.How does it increase productivity?: Teams affiliated with a BPO company often work 24/7.Their office is always online and work continues. Expect your project or projects done in no time without the quality of it being sacrificed.You get to tap a workforce which specialises in specific areas of your project.Each agent is trained to handle a single task assigned to them.
