            "answer_text": "Many are the advantages of information and communication technology, also, many are the disadvantages of it. First, let's consider the advantages: 1). Information can reach large, wide, multiple classes of audience at same time. In the past, researchers always took time to segment audience into groups or categories, but now with information and communication technology, audiences segmentation may not be required to promote meaningful messages; because every category of audience is on social media same time, same place. 2). Immediate response or feedback: one of the essential elements of communication is response or feedback. In the past, newspapers/magazines messages may take long before responses were received, but no more with social media back by internet access, computers, smartphones, tablets, smartwatches. Feedbacks from messages on social media are immediate. For instance, the world was stunned by 9/11 attacks and within seconds, just imagine global reaction. If it were in the past, it will take world of mankind days before reactions would come in. 3). The process of storing and retrieving information has improved significantly. Today, information is stored on supercomputers that can protect information for decades, even centuries without going bad. The era of celluloid information preservation is gone. 4). New communication technologies continue to help in areas of quality production, enhancements, color quality to almost real life creation. With several computer applications, contents in terms of messages, pictures, concepts have significantly improved and considering daily launch of new applications and devices, communication will always be better. 5). Another area of interest is communication technology's ubiquitous; in the past, you had to get home before you could make and received calls, but not again. Now we have portable smartphones, where local and International calls can be made in a jiffy. We have internet access laptops and tablets official assignments can be carried out without being in the office. 6). Another area of interest is the advancement in auto insurance. Remember, an average American spends more than six Hours, one-quarter daily life driving; with advancement in auto industry through infortainment, we now have mobile theater on cars, vans, SUVs, trucks, trailers, and buses. Either at home or not, a driver loses nothing; he can listen to radio programs, watch movie, listen to choice music on pandora, Sirius, Hulu, Netflix and many more. On the other hand, these are the Disadvantages: 1). The feedback at times aren't real, because of the immediacy of feedback. We have seen on many occasions when people react to information on social media, reactions are based on impulse not on reasons. Unlike yesterday newspapers/magazines reactions. 2). There still glitches with quality regardless of advancement in information and communication technology. 3). Information is yet to be global because there are still billions of people around the globe without access to computer, smartphone, tablet and other communication devices. They rely on secondary information, which may be partial false or wrong information. 4). Another problem with modern technology is that, they have become a monitoring devices, instead of communication devices. Most of these devices have hidden recording mechanisms that can take your information unknowingly. Information that could be used against you in the future. ",

            "answer_text": "Advantages of digital communication:  1. It is fast and easier. 2. No paper is wasted. 3. The messages can be stored in the device for longer times, without being damaged, unlike paper files that easily get damages or attacked by insects. 4. Digital communication can be done over large distances through internet and other things. 5. It is comparatively cheaper and the work which requires a lot of people can be done simply by one person as folders and other such facilities can be maintained. 6. It removes semantic barriers because the written data can be easily chaned to different languages using software. 7. It provides facilities like video conferencing which save a lot of time, money and effort.  Disadvantages: 1. It is unreliable as the messages cannot be recognised by signatures. Though software can be developed for this, yet the softwares can be easily hacked. 2. Sometimes, the quickness of digital communication is harmful as messages can be sent with the click of a mouse. The person oes not think and sends the message at an impulse. 3. Digital Communication has completely ignored the human touch. A personal touch cannot be established because all the computers will have the same font! 4. The establishment of Digital Communication causes degradation of the environment in some cases. \"Electronic waste\" is an example. The vibes given out by the telephone and cell phone towers are so strong that they can kill small birds. In fact the common sparrow has vanished due to so many towers coming up as the vibrations hit them on the head. 5. Digital Communication has made the whole wordl to be an \"office.\" The people carry their work to places where they are supposed to relax. The whole world has been made into an office. Even in the office, digital communication causes problems because personal messages can come on your cell phone, internet, etc. 6. Many people misuse the efficiency of Digital Communication. The sending of hoax messages, the usage by people to harm the society, etc cause harm to the society on the whole. ",
