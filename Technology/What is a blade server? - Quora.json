            "answer_text": "According to Wikipedia, \u201cA blade server is a stripped-down server computer with a modular design optimized to minimize the use of physical space and energy. Whereas a standard rack-mount server can function with a minimum of a power source and a network connection, blade servers have many components removed to save space, minimize power consumption and other considerations, while still having all the functional components to be considered acomputer. [1] Unlike a rack-mount server, a blade server needs a blade enclosure, which can hold multiple blade servers, providing services such as power, cooling, networking, various interconnects and management. Together, blades and the blade enclosure form a blade system. Different blade providers have differing principles regarding what to include in the blade itself, and in the blade system as a whole. You can see the most popular Blade Servers, alongside real user reviews from the IT Central Station community. HPE BladeSystem is currently ranked as the number one blade server according to IT Professionals on our site. ",

Whereas a standard rack-mount server can function with (at least) a power cord and network cable, blade servers have many components removed to save space, minimize power consumption and other considerations, while still having all the functional components to be considered a computer. Unlike a rack-mount server, a blade server needs a blade enclosure. A blade enclosure, which can hold multiple blade servers, provides services such as power, cooling, networking, various interconnects and management.
