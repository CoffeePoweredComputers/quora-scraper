            "answer_text": "I have the same model router at home, so I am answering from my own experience here. Your father did not install VPN there - the application is built-in to the factory firmware already. All he needed/needs to do is configure the VPN service, that he will want to use (OpenVPN, PPTP or L2TP). All that configuration is done within the router's web user interface. You are correct that there is no selection possible, either all traffic is directed to the VPN endpoint or none at all (connected to VPN service or not, respectively). The only way that you can do it on your own is by logging in to the router user interface with a username and password. This does presume you know or have these credentials. Another option is to just communicate with your father over this to understand the reasoning and maybe find another solution. ",
