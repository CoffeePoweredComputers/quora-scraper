            "answer_text": "I recently upgraded with Sprint to an I 11 from starting with an I 4 in 2014.  I was used to the flip phones and the salesman said the iPhone would increase my business. Paying for Internet service all along I was such not a techie that it took me about a year to ask and figure out that Safari was the way to get on the Internet, then things took off. Probably about 2015 and 2016 I was watching as many as 6 to 8 hours of Ted talks every day and got to the point probably in 2017 that I started seeing the results of my screen time. I\u2019ve seen this one, I\u2019ve seen this one, I like this one, I\u2019ll watch it again ! I was reluctant for program updates because I would have to relearn what I knew as the path to function. Finally with the 11 I can push OK and the phone will go through an update on its own. There are so many uses including Quora because I don\u2019t work with laptops. I can honestly say I\u2019m very happy with this Apple product.  Pictured above is my kind a tech \u2026.Mark ",

            "answer_text": "I wear hearing aids and yet I still have trouble understanding some of the dialog on tv. I was having my aids serviced. They need cleaning every couple of months and filters replaced. The hearing aid company made me an offer on a new set of blue tooth hearing aids.(I didn\u2019t know they even existed). Better hearing aids because they work with more frequencies than the old aids. I had to replace my s phone with an I phone since they are made to work together. Now when my phone rings it connects wirelessly to my aids and I can hear the phone even over nearby noise. I\u2019ll try to get to the point now. I ordered a tv transmitter that links up to these blue tooth aids. My wife insists it was worth every penny because I can turn the sound off on the tv and still hear the dialog clearly through the aids. So now I can sit and watch tv while the wife sits next to me and reads without any noises in the room. ",
