            "answer_text": "What happens to a computer if the power goes out while it's running? I've had this happen to my home computers often, because the electric power to my house is unstable. Basically, without power the computer turns off. When power is restored, the computers are able to boot up and are ready for processing. When modern computers sense loss of power a \"power fail interrupt\" is issued to the CPU, the CPU is able to safe itself using the remaining energy stored in the computer power supply's capacitors to do the necessary processing to place critical components, such as the disk drives, into a safe state. This safe mode processing takes just milliseconds. See VAXELN Runtime Facilities Guide ",

            "answer_text": "As long as the computer isn\u2019t writing to a disk, all the computer does is shut off. It may or may not come back on, depending on the settings in the BIOS. Most don\u2019t come back on for safety\u2019s sake. If the computer is writing to a drive, then that data are usually corrupted by the incomplete write. If it happens during a Windows update, sometimes you will be required to reinstall windows. ",
