            "answer_text": "Most certainly, to allow for rapid adaptation to changing conditions, a culture must welcome open questioning and disputation of all dogma and traditions. In this way useful ideas (like sustainable living) will be re-enforced while nonsensical (and often cruel) ideas (like the oppression of women) will get tossed. This allows for political and ethical progress, in addition to advances in science and technology. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Culture affects EVERYTHING, including the progress of science and technology. Culture affects how much time, energy and financial resources are dedicated to research and development, and which projects are considered a priority. It affects how much personal sacrifice people are willing to endure in the pursuit of science & technology development, and how much society will reward them for their achievements (financially and otherwise).
