            "answer_text": "Few challenges will face our youth in future- Kids will find, to communicate verbally in person very very tough. I've seen few teenagers who are so apt at texting, mainstreaming but zero at communication skills. They can't even introduce themselves with confidence in face to face conversation. This will lead to obstructions in maintaining interpersonal relationship and rapport with family, friends and colleagues.Digital life is making lives so easy and accessible, hardly there are kids who can go a day without electronics. This is creating chaos inside their heads. They are unsecured and less productive. I have barely seen a kid helping their parents in the household chores during holidays.One of our friend who happened to be a psychiatric doc was telling the other day. Comparatively there are double the kids who come along with their parents due to mental illnesses rather than adults at OPD. He was telling it is all due to technology and it's misuses both by parents and kids.I have seen how the society is demanding children for the validation from others. Also, parents make sure to craft their children \u201cextraordinarily\u201d by putting make over to kids who are less than 15 years old and dressing them in a skimpy outfits which is not necessary at all. Likewise, kids are seen putting lipsticks at school only to be noticed by others, look cool among peer groups and things like that. This is destructive! No kids will love themselves the way they are! They will please others, be superficial and thus can never be satisfied with themselves.Comparison: So many kids wants same bicycle or a video gaming equipment not cause they don't have it but cause their friends have it and they don't want to look un-sophisticated in front of their acquaintances using the old one. From their points: uncool one. This is sucking out the goodness in self.Children below 16 years old are seen to care only about \u201cmoney\u201d. I overheard their conversations. They said how they can't wait to be 21 years old to be able to get married legally to an old man aged double their age (rich) so that they can have lots of money and enjoy their lives without struggling a bit.\u201cOh! My nose is so crook. I want to fill up my upper lips!\u201d I hear this kind of phrases often from children less than 16 years old. I was so surprised and worried at the same time hearing so. How can one not love enough to themselves? This: the underestimating self, going for plastic surgeries and BOTOX will paramount to next level and still people won't be satisfied with self.Already people have started to stop breastfeeding to their kids due to various reasons. This will rise more than we can imagine the worst! People don't get how important it is to breastfeed their new born babies exclusively for 6 months and upto atleast 2 years of age. This is beneficial for both baby and mother. It can prevent \u201cbreast cancer\u201d which is staggering so high these days. Some people don't get it or they ignore it. Idk! But, this is going to get higher than we can imagine.Kids will no longer be faithful towards family or partners. Kids already know what does One night stand mean which I only came to know recently from an answer in quora being 26 years old. They will want that instant pleasure and temporary fun.I guess marriage will collapse and few people who get married with life long togetherness will be a joke to many. Well, that's what i feel. Due to all this newly seen instant connections and disconnection within a blink of an eye, I feel so.Sadly, Education will most probably lose the value in the society. People are seen to run behind money so much that it might get vanished.Suicide is par amounting so much. People find it easier to quickly \u201cgive up\" rather than trying one more time. They just don't get it. It's okay to fall down, to be behind. What matters is to look forward always! To never ever give up! It will stagger more in the future.",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know which generation you are thinking about, but I would guess that my daughter born in 2014 will see and deal with all the 2\u20133+ degrees C temperature increases and the 1\u20132 meter sea level rise that has been predicted (by the time she is 86, in 2100). That there, without the additional doubling of Earth\u2019s population that will occur by then (86 years / 12 = 7 billion new humans) will cause the migration of some 400 million or more away from the coasts where we have strategically misplaced all of our current urban infrastructure that will become inundated. Let\u2019s assume that we got smart (between now and then) and we moved the cities and people in time, however the Earth is still going to double in numbers of humans. There will likely be shortages of food, fresh drinking water, and unless we can figure out replacements for the minerals we require in today\u2019s smartphones, we will have mineral shortages. Hopefully we will have figured out how to transport and power ourselves totally from sunlight, and eliminated all of the burning of fossil fuels. However, I\u2019m a realist, not an optimist, and I think by then it is also possible that we will have had World War Three (and be digging ourselves out of Stone Age II). I mean they didn\u2019t build all these rockets and bombs just to look at them, did they? And to top it all off, Ensia believes that 100 US, European, and Asian nuclear power facilities will be threatened by serious flooding caused by accelerating sea-level rise and more frequent storm surges.
