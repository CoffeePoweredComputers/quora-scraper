            "answer_text": "Let us take a simple example to understand the concept. Further let us try to find out on what factors does power loss depend. Case 1: Assume you have a thin wire of 5ohms resistance & 5A current through it. Hence, total loss=(I^2)*R=(5^2)*5=125W Case 2: Assume you have a stranded conductor made of 5 identical thin wires of resistance 5ohms. These wires are also identical to that of Case 1's wire. The 5A current is now divided into 1A through each wire. Hence, total loss= Summation of individual losses  =5*(1^2)*5=25W So what we observe? The stranded conductor consumes less power than a single thin conductor. Case 3: Now if we take a single thick conductor instead of a stranded conductor, let us see what we get. We choose its length and thickness in such a way that we get its resistance as 5ohms. The formula to calculate R of a wire is, r=resistivity*(length/area) where, resistivity depends on the material and the temperature. Now assume we got R=5ohms of that thick wire. Hence, power loss=(5^2)*5=125W Now we observe that it produces same power loss that of the thin wire! So where did we went wrong? Let us have a look at the above formula to calculate r. r is inversely proportional to area. Case 3's wire has a larger area than Case 1's. So to obtain r=5ohms, either resistivity has to be increased or the length. Assuming same working temperature and material, resistivity can't be changed. Hence, length has to be increased to get r=5ohms. Now if we cut down the length of wire so as to match it with Case 1's, r drops and hence power loss drops (which is obviously less than 125W as in Case 2). So what do we learn? 1. The power loss depends directly on the length of wire but inversely with the Area of cross-section. 2. The power loss depends on the material we use as a conductor. 3. Increase in the temperature increases resistivity and hence the power loss increases. Now, a conductor heats up as current flows through it. Hence this increases the resistivity and ultimately leads to more power loss. So to avoid this kind of situation, we either use a fan or heat sinks to cool down the system. Hope this helps :) ",

            "answer_text": "Thicker wire consumes less power compared to thin wire. Here I provided an experiment details with result, you will performs it own self. Problem: Does electricity move better through thick wires or thin ones? Materials: Plastic strawScissors2 unused D batteriesElectrical tapeSteel wool pad2 new flashlight bulbsProcedure Create a hypothesis, your best guess about what is going to happen. Will a circuit with thicker wire work better than one with thinner wire?Get your batteries set up on a flat surface. One battery will get thin wire, and the other will get thicker wire.To install your wires, cut two pieces of straw that are the same length as the battery. Place the straw lengthwise on the side of the battery, and tape it onto the battery with the electrical tape.Your steel wool pad is a good source of wires for your thin wire circuit. Pull it apart and take some strands of steel from the pad. Make a small pile of these on the side of the table.Now it\u2019s time to create a conductor, something that helps electricity move from one place to another. Take three strands of steel wool and use your fingers to roll them together into a thin wire. Now, take ten strands of steel wool and roll them together until they make a thicker wire.Now you\u2019ll have two wires: one thick, one thin. Put the thin wire through the middle of the straw on one battery, and put the thick wire through the other straw.Tape one end of the thin wire to the negative end of the battery (this is the flat end and should have a minus sign on it).Wrap the other end of the thin wire around the bottom of one of the flashlight bulbs. Tape it to the bulb with electrical tape, and make sure the bottom part of the bulb is still exposed.Now, move the end of the light bulb down until it touches the positive side of the battery (the part that sticks out). If your circuit is complete, the bulb should come on!Repeat steps 7-9 with the thicker wire. Which light burns brighter? Results The bulb that\u2019s attached to the thicker wire is brighter. Why? Imagine a parking lot that\u2019s packed with cars, all waiting to move from one place to another. That\u2019s your battery. Imagine opening up a single lane road. How fast would the cars be able to leave? Now, imagine opening up a four-lane highway attached to the same parking lot. How fast would the cars be able to leave now? The thin wire will conduct electricity, but there is more electrical resistance. The thicker wire is like the four lane highway. There\u2019s a lot less electrical resistance, and as a result, that light bulb burns brighter because more electricity can reach it. What do you think would happen if you used a different type of conductor? Does every type of wire move electricity in the same way? ",
