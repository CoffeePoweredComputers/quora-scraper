            "answer_text": "Open source technology is a growing trend in GIS, but what is it? Open source software is software in which the source code used to create the program is freely available for the public to view, edit, and redistribute. Any type of software program can be open source, including operating systems (e.g., Linux), databases (e.g., PostgreSQL), applications (e.g., Apache OpenOffice), games, and even programming languages (e.g., Python). Esri Geoportal Server includes add-ons to access and search geoportals from within web apps built with ArcGIS Web Mapping APIs.  Open source software is identified by the type of license it is released under. These licenses include the Apache 2.0 license, the Microsoft Public License, and the GNU General Public License. While there are some variations, most open source licenses require that the source code be freely available and users are free to modify the source code and redistribute the software and derived works. Non-open source software is called closed source or proprietary software. The open source license encourages a shared community approach to the development, extension, and patching of open source software. Most open source projects have a dedicated group that moderates and directs the core software development and ensures that needed new features are being developed, bugs are being fixed, and the supporting documentation remains current. Sometimes an open source project will \"fork,\" meaning a group of developers will lead the development of the software that is independent of the original project. Improvements in the \"fork\" project could either become incorporated into the core project or evolve into a completely new project. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I may not be the appropriate person to express my views about this topic. But let me just give it a try. --Open Source Technology-- Assumption: \"Wikipedia\" and \"Encyclopaedia\" are known to everyone. Difference between the two: Former can be edited by anyone (read modified), obviously after getting scrutinised to the core by some adept personalities. While the latter has been prepared by well-educated, well-informed and content expert authors, after their appropriate research in the relevant subjects. Dearest Quoran, here Wikipedia is acting just like an Open Source Technology. Definition: Open source technology is defined as the production and development philosophy of allowing end users and developers to not only see the source code of software, but modify it as well. Example: Linux - Open Source Technology Windows - Closed Source Paradigm Thanks for A2A. :) PS: I would be glad if somebody (read expert) could enlighten me in this regard with more examples. ",
