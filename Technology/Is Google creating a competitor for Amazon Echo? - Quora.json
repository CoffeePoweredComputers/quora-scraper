            "answer_text": "As of now there are no competitors of Amazon Echo and Google Now is a competitor of the Amazon digital assistant \"Alexa\". Amazon Echo is a hybrid speaker clubbed with voice recognition which will answer you questions and would be able to manage particular tasks. Before you consider buying this great product, I must remind you that Amazon Echo is the most strategically planned product from Amazon and it more about getting to know you better which will help Amazon sell their stuff.  Amazon Echo has one of the best business models till date. Amazon sells us everything from grocery to Clothes and consumer electronics and everything in between. Amazon Echo will be shipping to the customers in the coming few weeks. At the moment, Amazon Echo is available at an invite only basis, though the price of the product is just $199. Just for the first few weeks, Amazon will provide an opportunity to their prime members to lay their hands on Amazon Echo on an invite only basis at $99.  This will spread the word of mouth publicity from direct Amazon loyal users and it is a good marketing tactic from Amazon. The device will always be connected to Amazon Cloud and you will get access to information, news, music, weather updates etc when you feel like it. The kind of services you expect from Google, only it is provided by Amazon. Checkout more about Amazon Echo here : http://bit.ly/1yuAn9a ",
