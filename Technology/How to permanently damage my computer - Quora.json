            "answer_text": "Let me answer your question because I have completly destroyed 1 laptop and 1 desktop on new year morning. (And the answer to Maybe why you shouldn't try to repair your laptop at 2 in the morning when you are high on caffeine). Laptop While playing cs:go at 2 am in the morning on new year morning, my 1 year old laptop started lagging super hard and then suddenly went black and was not starting (not even bboot menu). I was scared and have been drinking coffee all night, so a little bit distracted. But I had repaired my laptop few times before when last month my hard-disk crashed. I was super confident that somehow I will fix this problem by myself. So I opened it started looking for the cause. After few hours of looking at the disassembled laptop I concluded that the problem was the FFC ribbon and to fix the problem I cut the ribbon in two equal parts. Now the ribbon was too short to connect the power button to motherboard. So I took the another FFC ribbon(connecting trackpad and motherboard) and cut that in half as well because why not? Now I had 4 half FFC ribbons which were useless and a disassembled laptop. Then a thought ran into my mind \u201cwhy not open my desktop that I had assembled by myself and look for a FFC ribbon. So I opened my desktop in search for a FFC ribbon just to find out that there is not a single FFC ribbon and I should have known that because I had assembled that desktop by myself and repaired it many time by myself, but my mind was not thinking straight because it was now 5 o'clock and I hadn't slept in 24 hours and wasn't thinking straight. But the curiosity. At that time i really wanted to apply some thermal paste to processor. After applying thermal compound I put the processor back into its place. And then\u2026 Fun fact :- I am an idiot. Desktop \u2026\u2026Insteadf reassembling my desktop I thought(big mistake), \u201c why shouldn't I transfer all the data from my laptop hdd to desktop. So I unplugged the HDD from laptop and using an external case I tried to transfer all my data to my fully exposed desktop. But as soon as I plugged the cable into the socket and switched on the power, it started smoking inside of desktop because the processor was now superhot. I immediately switched off the power. After few more hours and few more attempts I had completely killed my PC's ( both laptop and desktop). Now I have 2 dead PC's and my dad doesn't know about this( he is in defence force) because I haven't told him about this yet and begged my mom and my brother to stay silent about this. He is coming home next week. And he will disown me after finding out about the whole incident. #4dinoka\u092e\u0947\u0939\u092e\u093e\u0928 ",
