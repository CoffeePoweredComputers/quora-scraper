            "answer_text": "Goodness no! Why paint such a YUGE target on the idea the Trump Administration is unpopular, irrational and in disarray? Why give that Administration anything else to point to as \u201cthe enemy\u201d, to distract each and every one of we citizens from the very real- and often imbecilic- crap this Administration has done, continues to do, and plans to do more? It would be like leading a giraffe onto a basketball court during the middle of a championship game, thinking you will help \u2018your team\u2019. You won\u2019t; you will only distract your team members from their play, and offer the opposition a chance to score. Obama is a private citizen now; for the good of the country, he needs to remain a private citizen. ",

            "answer_text": "No. I think that would make the Resistance seem like a cult of personality, and that\u2019s something President Obama would never think of doing. I believe he will continue to make statements and give private speeches, as former Presidents do, but he\u2019d never try to position himself as a force in the Resistance. Trump, on the other hand, like most authoritarians and lousy leaders, makes it all about himself and his popularity. He knows he\u2019s doing a crappy job and that he\u2019s got the lowest approval rating of any modern president, so he holds rallies to soak in some uncritical adulation and make himself feel better. Obama has never, ever been that insecure or fragile. The marches for women, climate, science, etc. are the proper venues for the resistance, because they focus on issues, not on a leader -- as they should. ",
