            "answer_text": "A genuinely *low end* PC is not ever going to be capable of 4k video editing, no matter what you do to it. For 4k video editing you may need workstation levels of performance. Since that\u2019s likely to be outside of your budget, I\u2019d consider buying a \u2018second-user\u2019 workstation type PC from eBay. Dell and Hewlett Packard make some nice ones often using Intel\u2019s XEON Server orientated processors. I\u2019m actually in the process of buying one myself. For not much money you can even outrun any i7 CPU and maybe even an i9 especially using twin CPUs ! You won\u2019t need a gaming GPU either. Look at Nvidia\u2019s inexpensive Quadro cards for starters. They have the kind of acceleration that you\u2019ll need and are almost \u2018two a penny\u2019 when carefully shopping around, second user again. ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest.. the entire PC if it is \u201cthat\u201d low end. My PC is: Asrock X370 killer SLI, amd 1800X ryzen 7, 16 GB DDR4, whatever ssd, 650 W corsair power supply and RTX 2080 graphics card. Everything except the RAM and graphics card. It was the strongest possible thing in 2017, cutting edge. Now, in 2020 everything except the graphics card is 3 or even 4 generations obsolete. 4K means a lot of power, so basically you need cutting edge. ",
