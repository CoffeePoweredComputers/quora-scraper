            "answer_text": "A free diver's maximum depth is limited by how long they can hold their breath.  The current world record is over 700 feet.  This is a no limits record, attained by riding a weighted sled down and riding an inflated airbag up.  There other disciplines with other records, such as constant weight, with/without fins, etc., they all have different records. Currently the world record for a SCUBA dive is over a 1,000 feet.  However, theoretically, a person could dive to the bottom of Challenger Deep (the deepest part of the ocean, in the Mariana Trench) unharmed.  The primary danger in diving too deep for too long is that the deeper and longer a diver is down, the greater the build up of inert gasses (nitrogen in normal air, often helium in deep SCUBA diving) in their tissues and blood.  These gasses need to be dissipated slowly and safely as the diver returns to normal atmospheric pressure. If a diver ascends too quickly from a deep or long dive, the inert gasses come out of saturation, and the diver may experience the effects of decompression sickness, or the bends. On this world record dive (Scuba Diving World Records) the diver descended in only 10 minutes, but it took almost 9 hours for him to ascend, and slowly decompress. There is something known as saturation diving, where divers may live in a pressurized habitat down deep for weeks at a time, fully saturating their body with inert gasses and never decompressing.  Even though a diver is out of the water, they are still breathing compressed air, as if they were diving.  These types of diving habitats are beautifully showcased in the movie The Abyss, and the book and movie, Sphere.  This is like being on a weeks long dive.  Saturation diving has been done at depths over 1,700 feet, and simulated in onshore hyperbaric pressure chambers at depth equivalents around 2,200 feet.  Decompressing from such depths takes WEEKS. To attain these depths, divers are breathing a special mix of gasses.  Oxygen, helium, nitgroen, and hydrogen at various concentrations that change with depth.  Nitrogen can behave as a narcotic at high pressures, and oxygen under high pressures becomes toxic.  So nitrogen is replaced with helium and hydrogen, and the concentration of oxygen is reduced so that its partial pressure is below its toxic threshold. Despite all of this divers at extreme depth have shown symptoms of what is known as High Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Symptoms include tremors, memory loss, fatigue, etc.  These high pressure induced effects seem to set the limit for conventional, air supplied diving.  Enter liquid breathing.  This is also demonstrated in the movie The Abyss.  gasses are compressible, where as liquid are not.  Theoretically, breathing an oxygenated fluid, a person could descend to any depth, without any of the problems associated with decompression, or breathing high pressure gasses. The scene portrayed at the end of the film where Ed Harris dives to over 20,000 feet is fake, but a scene earlier in the movie, where a rat is submerged in fluid and breathes is real.  Liquid breathing does exist and has been experimented with in laboratories for many years, however, it does not come without its own set of problems, such as gas/fluid exchange.  Liquid is much denser than air, and lungs have work much harder to circulate fluid to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.  Successful liquid breathing would require some sort of mechanical assistance in circulating the breathing fluid. While animal tests have seen small mammals successfully breath liquid for weeks, the technology has not made it to the ocean. ",

            "answer_text": "The present record holder is Ahmed Gabr . Ahmed reached a depth of 332.35m and spent more than 14 hours underwater. But Deep Diving has got human limitations. It differs from person to person. Normally a Diving till 10 Meters is considered safe, this can be performed without the availability of a pressure chamber. It is generally advised to have a pressure chamber if a dive is performed more than that depth. However at various places it has been seen that recreational divers make people dive till 16\u201318 meters without availability of pressure chambers. For all those who are not aware about diving, when we go underwater and we are diving with air ( same air which we inhale on surface) then the percentage of nitrogen in about 72%. Whilst we are on surface we exhale the nitrogen outside without it getting dissolved in blood (Gases laws which we studied in our high schools come handy here). However, as we go deeper in water the nitrogen starts dissolving in blood and may cause narcosis. Hence we require the pressure chambers. Deep diving is Diving to a depth beyond the norm accepted by the associated community. In some cases this is a prescribed limit established by an authority, and in others it is associated with a level of certification or training, and it may vary depending on whether the diving is recreational, technical or commercial. Narcosis becomes a hazard below 30 metres (98 ft) and Hypoxic Breathing Gas is required below 60 metres (200 ft) to lessen the risk of Oxygen Toxicity. Professional divers may use an Atmospheric Diving Suite that allows very deep dives of up to 610 metres (2,000 ft). For some recreational diving agencies, Deep diving, or Deep diver may be a certification awarded to divers that have been trained to dive to a specified depth range, generally deeper than 30 metres (98 ft). However, the Professional Association of Diving Instructor(PADI) defines anything from 18 metres (60 ft) to 30 metres (100 ft) as a \"deep dive\" in the context of recreational diving (other diving organisations vary), and considers deep diving a form of technical Diving. A depth below about 60 metres (200 ft) where hypoxic Breathing Gas becomes necessary to avoid may be considered a \"deep dive\". It is advised here that diving must always be done under supervision of someone who is well qualified. ",
