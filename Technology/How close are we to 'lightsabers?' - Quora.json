            "answer_text": "I really couldn't say how close we are to making one, but I could speculate just for fun on how we might move towards the idea with existing cutting edge technology.  The caveat is that I have no ACTUAL idea what I'm talking about and if anyone who DOES know what they're talking about reads this they'll probably just laugh.  Here we go. First, you have to throw out the \"light\" part of \"light saber\" as being a literal description of the material of the blade.  Let's call it more of an appearance description.  It's a saber that lights up. Ok, so now we can move into how it behaves instead and go at it however we like instead of trying to somehow make a sword out of  lasers. How it behaves:  It cuts through almost anything really fast.It stops other light sabers cold without cuttingIt makes noise when it swings through the airIt makes a different noise when it hits another light saberIt makes another noise when cuttingIt emerges from the hilt when turned on rather than hanging around all the time like a regular sword.The first thing that comes to mind is monofilament wire.  This, of course, is no good because that's just another science fiction concept.  However, nanotechnology might let us make some headway. Let's say we make some multi-walled nanotubes, which are basically nanotubes inside of nanotubes, kind of like a telescope.  They can slide around against each other in an almost zero friction state.  The longest nanotube we've seen according to wikipedia is about 18.5cm long, but that might be a good length for our purposes, if we can telescope a few of them together.    So now we have this strong (for its weight), but very thin potential cutting surface that can telescope out to a longer length. Let's slap an electromagnet on the end and use magnetic forces to extend the thing when you push a button.  Somehow the nanotubes would have to be shaped so that they don't come apart, and the magnetic fields involved might need to be unreasonably strong and highly directional. (shrug) Now you'd have to find a way to make it glow and maybe to help it cut through things even faster. Let's run some electrical current through the thing.  Nanotubes have this \"remote Joule Heating\" thing going on that allows them to heat things near them without getting hot themselves. http://phys.org/news/2012-04-carbon-nanotubes-weird-world-remote.html So let's say that if you pump enough current through them you start heating the air around them.  Maybe we could even put some kind of coating on the nanotubes that would retain heat and glow when heated. http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-03/heat-channeling-carbon-nanotubes-creates-100-times-more-energy-li-ion-batteries So then let's somehow oscillate the magnetic field to introduce a vibration into our nanotube to help with its cutting action.  Maybe the vibration produces a slight hum like a light saber. So now we have a super thin cutting surface, super hot, and vibrating.  It glows and it makes noise.  And just maybe it's so good at cutting that it doesn't actually get mechanically stressed much when chopping things up so it doesn't break. BAM!  Light saber! The above has all been the purest of made up garbage with only the slightest relationship to reality.  The shear strength of a nanotube, at least when not bundled with enough other nanotubes is pretty poor on an absolute basis.  We could maybe strengthen it with lots of other nanotubes, but at what point does it become bad at cutting?  In addition, that whole magnetic field to extend it thing is not going to work at the length of a blade.  Not to mention that the powersource for this thing is pretty much not invented. But then, we are talking about light sabers here.  How real do I have to be? Besides, sometimes good ideas start with bad ideas. Inspiring brilliance by prodding with stupidity is a skill too... kind of.... maybe... ",

            "answer_text": "So this is a good one to actually show off my sci-fi geek knowledge. With all due respect to Joshua Engel we do actually have a pretty good idea of how lightsabers are supposed to work thanks to the extensive technical manuals written by the Lucas team. The first part of this answer would be, what is a lightsaber as described by the series and how does it work? The second part would be, what is the closest thing we could make to that?  ^ from Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary via Wookieepedia (http://starwars.wikia.com) Here is a canon cutaway view of the internals of a lightsaber. It's interesting but what does it do? The first thing you need to know is the beam is not actually made out of light. The name is a misnomer like how \"tin foil\" is made of aluminum, not tin, shooting stars which are not stars or \"pencil lead\" which does not contain lead. The most common and consistent description is that the lightsaber creates a powerful arc of plasma and then via magnetic fields and the focusing crystal that arc is pushed out into a very long thin arc. The beam is pushed out from the center and then corralled into a straight edge with some kind of magnetic field confinement. We need to remember this bending is done with something very similar to the same force that allows Jedi and Sith to throw each other around... It starts with something like this at its very core. A simple electrical arc as seen in this plasma arc speaker. In this case the arc is being modulated so the variations in the arc create recognizable sound and music!  Or this arc between two nails.  It is not too hard to imagine if that tiny ribbon were grabbed in the middle and somehow stretched out about 3-4 feet how that could become a lightsaber as they describe. The reality of the matter is far more complicated, I will get back to that in a moment. Given the explanations above we can see that we actually already have something very similar as far as the essential technology and function of a lightsaber. Every day we use \"beams\" of superheated plasma, some in in excess of 40,000 deg to easily slice through several inches of metals in factories all over the world.  The device is a plasma arc cutter/torch/welder/sprayer. In this simple diagram it even looks like a little like a lightsaber! Unfortunately this is where the similarities end. Firstly the actual arc is very small as shown by that tiny blue jagged line above. This tiny yet very hot arc ignites a gas that is continually pumped through the nozzle and the gas carries away the heat produced in a \"beam\" that acts as the working medium of this tool.  It still almost looks like a very tiny lightsaber. Jedi Master Mace Windu would probably love this arc welder. (Bonus points if you know why) The problem with plasma cutters is the arc is not long enough to form a blade and even with a continuous supply of gas the arc is at most a three to six inches long. Also the devices require a huge amount of electricity to run and produce a massive amount of waste heat in all directions. The tip of these devices must actually have a continuous flow of water going through it for cooling or the arc will literally melt the entire tip of the cutter. Some arc cutters use the gas itself as a cathode and the cutting surface as the anode so the arc runs much longer and the heat is projected outwards away from the tips but this will not work for a sword as it is still very short and would require you first attach a high energy cable to your opponent. We just do not have any effective way to bend the arc of energy far enough outward and then confine it in a magnetic field to keep it straight and narrow. Even if we could bend the arc outwards it would waver in random directions and eventually try to ground out on anything it touches. Additionally as the sides of this arc get closer together it would just collapse into a shorter arc. Even if we could solve the first two problems we have excessive waste heat and a \"blade\" that is not rigid and cannot be used to block or parry. We may have to go in a completely different direction if we want something even remotely like this as a weapon. So we want a handheld weapon that can cut through various materials, has an extendable blade and glows. The closest thing to that we might find as Kevin Coe points out, would be with a few strands of carbon nanotube wire. These are then pulsed with electromagnetic field vibrations and/or plasma to give them some extra cutting power. This would effectively create a type of \"energy vibro-sword\" but without a solid backing behind the length of it you would get a whip and not a blade.  Further refinement. Perhaps some kind of telescoping portion behind the cutting edge could contain a bundle of carbon-nano tube threads that are held in place and energized with plasma creating a burning edge. The telescoping portion would also be made of advanced materials for strength such as carbon nanotubes and graphene. The rigid edge would be thin enough on one edge to follow through the hot cutting edge and thick enough at the other side to make a rigid parrying weapon. To preserve the threads as long as possible and reduce energy and waste heat the threads would not be energized until just before they hit. As the sword nears a target a pulse of energy is sent through the threads at the leading edge of the blade. Little by little some of the threads would be sacrificed as the charge moves from the outside edge to the inside wires and eventually the leading edge melts or burns away. In this way the sword would continually ablate part of its material adding to the heat and cutting power but would necessitate continual feeding with more thread; the thread we are using is fortunately very thin. The thinness of this thread would also make it very good for cutting as we get a razor thin edge. You would still need a very large power pack (maybe backpack) possibly with some exotic energy storage medium and you would need heat protection for your hands and arms as well as special flare compensating glasses for your eyes. A 3d rendering to give an idea of what this might look like. I designed and rendered this image and 3d model specifically for this answer. The name well that just came naturally after I looked at it... :D Aside from just sounding awesome!  ^ Original artwork \u00a9 by Ariel Williams, all rights reserved.Harpsword technical concept and idea, Ariel Williams, all rights reserved. <Cross-Promotion>I was asked to answer another how close are we to question just today (likely due to this one) and thought I would share it.
