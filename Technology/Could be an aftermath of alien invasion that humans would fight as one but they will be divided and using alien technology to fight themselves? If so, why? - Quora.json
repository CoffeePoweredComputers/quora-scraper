            "answer_text": "They won\u2019t be invading. Not in this Universe. In this incarnation of reality, the distances are so astonishingly vast that the aliens would first scout us out. And then, after scouting, if they choose to come at all it will be with a plan for eliminating us cleanly without us having any chance to fight back. If there\u2019s a giant pandemic and billions are dying over the course of a few months, that might be the aliens. If we\u2019re hit by 30 different large rocks (meteors) in the space of a week, that might be the aliens. If we suddenly cannot breathe and have no idea why, that might be the aliens. Landing? With \u201cblasters?\u201d No. Not going to happen, the laws of physics just aren\u2019t compatible with those kinds of storylines. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea of an alien \u201cinvasion\u201d is ludicrously bad\u2026 Any technological race capable of projecting force at interstellar distances would hardly need to invade and slog it out toe-to-toe with us\u2026 But to engage the fantasy\u2026. When the Spanish Conquistadores invaded the Aztec empire with a pitifully small force of (admittedly well-equipped) men, they did not go toe to toe with the Aztecs. Instead, they found and exploited the divisions in Aztec society, and allowed the Aztec to fight among themselves (and of course suffer losses from European diseases)\u2026.. All greatly to the advantage of the Spanish. It\u2019s not too difficult to see a similar situation with an alien race\u2026. Provided the aliens did their homework regarding human behavior and divisions before announcing themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "If I'm understanding your question, I could easily see humans dividing rather than uniting, despite an ostensibly apparent common foe. Some would argue over how to fight the aliens, some would advocate an appeasement policy by accepting \u201cour new alien overlords\u201d, and some would actively conspire with them. And when the smoke clears, if the invasion is thwarted, a new arms race would begin in in earnest, with whomever salvaged the most alien technologies seeking to dominate what remains of human civilization.
