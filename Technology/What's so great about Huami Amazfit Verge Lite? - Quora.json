            "answer_text": " Amazfit Verge Lite is just one of the many options offered by Amazfit, however, according to me, it is easily one of the best. It is priced at an affordable price yet includes most features you would expect in a top-class premium smartwatch. After using it for a few months, here is my review for the device - Price The cost of this device is 5,999 /-. This is significantly cheaper than its competitors such as Apple, Fitbit, and Samsung. It is the perfect fitness device for fitness casuals like me, who do not want to splurge large amounts on a fitness device. Display According to me, this is where Amazfit dominates the market. The display clarity, size, and quality are simply unmatched by its competitors. The Amazfit Verge Lite features a 1.3 inch AMOLED HD display which promotes an interactive user-interface which helps users view health insights, notifications, alarms, and reminders quite clearly. Features Firstly, the Verge Lite has an impressive battery life of around 20 days. I think only another Amazfit device has a longer battery life than Verge Lite. It also offers more than 5 unique sports modes. The tracking features include sleep & heart-rate monitoring, and customisable watch faces. You can even control your music and view notification alerts across social media applications, and incoming calls as well. ",
