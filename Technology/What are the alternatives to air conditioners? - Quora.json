            "answer_text": "The nearest alternative to airconditioners are:- ( The main aim is to cool the air) Natural VentilationIt is known that hot air is lighter than cold air, Hence air when heated in a closed space like the room in a house will rise towards the ceiling. If an opening is provided near the ceiling the hot air will escape to the surroundings and in turn draw (cold) or outside air from the lower parts of the room viz the doors and windows. 2. Natural Cooling : The Indian plant \u201cKhus\u201d has a unique property that it draws water through its roots. The roots are immersed in a water trough and this is placed on a window, the incoming air is cooled by the evaporation of the water from the plant. The principle being energy is needed to convert water into vapour. (540 Cal per gm of water). This energy is extracted from the natural flow of air (breeze) into the room which cools it. It is important to note that this works well only where the air is dry ( Low humidity / low moisture ). Since the water has to evaporate. This is not very effective where the air is humid like the sea coast. 3. Artifical Methods This method is refined now by Air Coolers. Here the \u201cKhus\u201d is replaced by various natural and synthetic materials like Grass mats or synthetic fibres. These aborb water by capillary action and the air is forced through these mats by a high speed fan. Needless to say, even these are not effective in humid places, if used, the discomfort increases, since the humidity rises. ",

            "answer_text": "Air conditioners are a fairly recent invention, and people have been hot as crap since the Sun rose, so a number of options exist! ONE option, which fit into the window of time between inventing Ice making, and having AC options, is making a shit load of Ice and putting it into your building. Crazy you say? Well, in the USA, they sell AC by \u201cTonnage\u201d. Really. And THAT is from back in the day I described! What Is The Proper Size For My Central AC? What is Ton and BTU? Another option is an evaporative cooler, works great in dry places, as evaporation lowers the temp just like sweat cools your body, but does raise humidity, so if cooler more damp air is ok for you, great for deserts! Beyond AC, Ice and Evap coolers, all that is left are Fans, which increase heat transfer rate by moving air, either moving hot air (over 98.6 F, you HAVE to have water or you die, as you sweat and cool even at 120F!) over your sweaty ass body, or moving cool air from under your house into your house.
