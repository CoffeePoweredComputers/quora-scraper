            "answer_text": "It is a tricky question because from the first glimpse it appeared to me that technology has affected interpersonal communication only in a destructive way. But to be objective, there are pros and cons, and it is your turn to decide, what side to choose. Positive impact Instead of calling a person or arrange a personal meeting, we all have an opportunity to chat and solve one-minute-questions without wasting our time on optional social norms.It is now more possible to preserve distance relationships with people, no more carrier pigeons:) The ways we can communicate with the ones who are far away have broadened.Technology made communication rapid and easy. We are now able to get the news extremely fast. And if something bad happens, we can track our closest ones and take the right measure (of course with them knowing they\u2019re tracked).Negative influence The quality of the conversations and overall face-to-face communication degraded. We get distracted by our phone notifications and chats even on family gatherings and friend meetings. For a lot of civilized people, it sounds devastating to put a phone down for a little while, filter annoying push notifications, and concentrate on the present.People share too much information and there is no strict line of what is personal, and what is not. We give too much information to people we barely know. The magic of discovering another person\u2019s interests or the way of thinking has turned into silent surfing through the profiles of others.We create an ideal picture of ourselves on the Internet. Sometimes it looks like a competition - who\u2019s happier, who\u2019s richer, this list may last forever. We tend to think that all these profiles and pictures of bloggers/celebrities are a real reflection of somebody\u2019s life. And feel broken, not good enough, not worthy enough.The dialogue has turned to monologue. We send or record our messages, knowing that we may not get the feedback in a quite amount of time. I feel like people now are more about sharing than listening, commenting than participating in a live discussion. The worst invention is voice recordings in messengers, it is lifeless and robotic. Instead of a real dialogue, we get recorded messages, also most people overuse this tool which makes the online conversations unbearable.We have all became robot-alike, with all the technologies rushing into our lives, let\u2019s preserve our human nature and use the innovations wisely.

            "answer_text": "I think it depends on each person. They say \"Facebook bring closer the people that are far and distances you from the people that are close\". And that may be true to a certain degree, the thing is you can still aproach to the people that are close to you and have this tool to get closer to the people that are far from you, it can be used to just bring people closer. The idea of Twitter before it became the comercial success it is was to just let people know what you are doing wherever your are doing it, so it was a tool let people know your wherabouts even if they arent close to you at that moment. Without internet we wont be having this exchange of ideas right know and its something that without technology I wont be able to do, and the plus side of this is that based on my experience here writing stuff to random people, I can then use that knowledge with my personal close ones. So it depends on each person, somebody that distances himself from other people, probably technology will enhance that side of his personality and he will be even more anti-social. Anti-social person that want to improve his social skills can use technology, like this very own website, to ask questions and see how he can improve himself, something imposible without technology. In general, whenever you see somebody coming with absolute phrases like: \"Violent videogames makes people more violent\", \"Celphones are making zombies out of people\" or \"Technology is making less and less people comunicate with each other\", probably those absolutes needs some reviewing because is not the games that are violent, people is violent and are using games as a gateway for those feelings, probably with the usage of violent games violent people become less violent (there are studies that show that is true, I just dont have the reference link at hand). Is not technology seting people apart, is people dividing people, and some people may use (even at a subconcient level) the technology as a tool to be apart from other people, the blame here should not be on technology, technology has no agenda, should be on people.  May not exist technology as we know it right now, people will use other outlets like workaholics or just read books, they will keep their own tendency to be appart from people if that is what they want.

            "answer_text": " Image sourced from Google This is an envelope. You write letters by hand (or typing), put it in the envelope, buy stamps and send it through the post office. A few years back, this was the most affordable means of communication as telephone calls were quite expensive. However, it could take weeks or even months just go get delivered to the person your sending to. Oh yeah, and if by then they had moved or changed address, your letter may be lost like that. Plus you had no way to confirm if they received it. So you just had to wait hopefully and in a few weeks, or months, you would get your reply back.  Image sourced from Google This is a Nokia 3310. Around a decade back, phones of this type were the most common in most households. Owners could send instant messages (texts) and voice calls to others who owned similar phones. Nowadays, people consider this \u201coutdated\u201d and not many people would even think of buying such a phone.  Image sourced from Google This is the modern day phone, a smart phone. This is the normal phone to own these days and some are even available for as low as $50. Aside from texting and voice calls as the Nokia 3310 above, you have a whole tonne other features. Haven't seen your parents in a while? You can video call them and chat face to face. Baby taking those first steps? You can snap that picture or record a video and send it to your friends. You can also keep in touch with your work mates on the go and submit that project you've been working on at home to your boss. As technology is evolving, more and more features are being added to these smart phones and with it, the world is becoming \u201csmaller and smaller\u201d. You can connect with a person from the opposite side of the world effortlessly and cheaply now. Plus it all happens instantly. ",

However, if it is just simply about sexual exploitation, created or developed specifically for seduction and sexual exploitation of young people, one will probably find respect and admiration rather difficult to feel.

These three primes often converge creating the secret underground \"older man being financially generous to beautiful younger woman\" situation. Sounds like sexual exploitation to me. ",
