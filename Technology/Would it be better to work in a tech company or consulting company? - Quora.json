Best things about consulting Never a dull moment as there are plenty of things going on with all kinds of clients.Losing a contract sucks, when you get benched, start looking for another jobYou've got no say on the product, you're constantly building something where you can't say: you know, I think it would be better this way...Your agency will generally stay away from the hard stuff, simply because its hard to estimate. But when they do, consider yourself lucky to build something amazing.Things about working for a tech company You will probably have input into the product, as a product person is (should) be on your team, if not, there are dedicated channelsYou will learn a lot about a specific problem domainYou'll likely deal with distributed systems that will amaze you, and challenge you.You'll probably end up with unlimited vacationYou'll build something that will impact potentially millions of people, instantly.I'd go for both, personally. I mean, that's what I did... You've got a long career ahead of you, theres no reason not to. ",

            "answer_text": "My background shall probably back my answer, I am a computer engineer and currently working for a consulting firm. Working for a tech firm as a developed/ tester and working in a consulting firm are absolutely two different zones. Neither of them is bad, but they give u a totally different experience in terms of learning, exposures. As a consultant you travel a lot, meet different people from different industries which helps you grow as a professional. You understand different sectors, so even in later part of your life you want to switch from consulting , you know where to go. But nothing comes easy, trust me travelling for months is not an easy job, its not a 9 to 5 job. ",
