            "answer_text": "As others have mentioned there are other aspects and challenges to making a blog successful besides naming. I will put these in context and give you a process for both getting a better name AND for increasing your likelihood of success. If Nick Swinmurn, founder of Zappos.com, had decided that there were already too many shoe stores in the world he never would have bothered to create a company, never would have generated over $1 billion in sales in 2008 and never would have sold to Amazon for $1.2 billion. I\u2019m not saying that will be your story, but I am saying that in a country full of shoe stores he found a way to succeed. So, don\u2019t be discouraged by the naysayers, but do take their comments to heart and think about how to distinguish yourself. A name alone will not make or break your business. However, a good name can help and a bad one can hurt. But what makes one name good and another one bad?! I want to talk about two things: narrowing your blog niche and choosing a name. In the world of blogging it\u2019s a good idea to narrow your niche. It may seem counter-intuitive, but you can find more success by choosing a narrow niche. Refer to my article 8 Ways a Narrow Niche is Better for Your Blog for more details. Tech encompasses a LOT of niches so there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t find one and become the best in the world for that niche. Next, choosing a name. Zappos was originally named ShoeSite. I would have chosen ShoeSite. I\u2019m not a fan of nebulous names. It worked out fine for Zappos, but I prefer names that are clear and obvious. When you hear the name it should be obvious what the blog is about. This is another reason I\u2019m not really a fan of naming your blog after yourself\u2014not to mention the fact you\u2019d never be able to sell the blog if it\u2019s named after you. So\u2026the name you choose will depend upon the niche you choose. In order to find a good niche, spend some time on Google\u2019s Keyword Planner. This will allow you to find niches that have high search volume (which indicates interest) and yet low or medium levels of competition. Low competition means that that specific keyword is not heavily targeted by other sites. If you\u2019re trying to compete with every other tech blog, yes, you\u2019ll fail. But there are still many under served niches. Let\u2019s walk through an example. I entered \u201ctech blog\u201d in the keyword planner and got back some other related keywords. \u201cTech blog\u201d itself has a fairly low search volume on Google, only 1\u201310K per month. But \u201ctech news\u201d gets 100K-1M searches per month. To focus things more, I then searched for \u201clinux blog\u201d which turned up \u201cUbuntu,\u201d a flavor of Linux, which gets 100K-1M searches per month with low competition. You should probably only use keyword planner as one of several metrics for deciding what is a vibrant, but under served, niche. I\u2019m not sure it tells the whole story. I\u2019d follow up with a general google search on \u201cUbuntu blog.\u201d You can see in the search results there are several sites devoted to Ubuntu. Look them over and determine whether there\u2019s some aspect they are missing that you can use to distinguish yourself. Here\u2019s one search result that lists the 10 best Ubuntu blogs. It looks like only about four are strictly devoted to Ubuntu. If you\u2019re really passionate about it, you could probably make a dent in that niche. There can be more than one blog on a topic. That\u2019s actually a good thing and shows there\u2019s demand. But if there are already 10 or more large blogs devoted strictly to your niche I\u2019d see if I could focus my niche further. So, after doing your homework to narrow your niche and ensuring there\u2019s demand, I\u2019d choose an obvious name. I searched a few possible domain names and found these available on my first try: http://UbuntuEncyclopedia.com http://Ubuntu2.com http://UltimateUbuntu.com Once you narrow your niche it\u2019s easy to find a name. Obviously, Ubuntu may not be your thing, so explore specific topics you are interested in and see what turns up. I would caution against a generalized tech blog. Stand for something! Narrow your niche! Otherwise, why should anyone read your blog instead of one of the many other tech blogs. Good luck. P.S. Also note that competition in the world of the web is not the same as say, fishermen on a lake. If one fisherman catches a fish in a lake it means that no other fisherman can have that fish. With blogs, many readers read multiple blogs. You can share readers. Some competition is OK and even helpful. ",
