            "answer_text": "We\u2019ll start with the second part (the first part\u2019s answer will make sense with it): The mysterious and blatantly futuristic technology of piling dirt.  Working on Qin\u2019s projects, colorized. OK, these ladies are actually Hmong building a home; the actual tomb builders were not so lucky\u2026 You can actually build (in theory) any pile at any size: all you have to do is make sure that the pile\u2019s slope is less than that of the angle of repose. However, in practice the pile\u2019s height is limited by the availability of resources: you need a ridiculous quantity of dirt to make even a middling mound.  Qin\u2019s monument. Lot\u2019s of run, very little rise: evidently this is a reflection of emperor Qin\u2019s prowess and power. Personally, I\u2019m skeptical that this was what he was going for, since unlike Khufu\u2019s pyramid, this wasn\u2019t exactly a labor of love by volunteers competitively working for their ruler. The Chinese sort of made it harder on themselves, by ramming the earth all down: it\u2019s way stronger than unconsolidated dirt, but it also needs more dirt. At some point they had to just start using unconsolidated dirt, for maximum volume. It\u2019s why, for example, Qin\u2019s pyramid (see above) has so much volume (and width), but very little height, relative to Khufu\u2019s Pyramid. Originally, it would have only been half the height of the great Pyramid, at around 70\u201380 m (now, at around 45 m, it\u2019s more like a third); the base is ~350 x 350. It was a truncated pyramid, with the top originally ~50x50. The dimensions give a volume of ~3.7 million cubic meters.  Qin\u2019s tomb, as it would have originally looked. This is indeed bigger in volume than the Khufu\u2019s pyramid, but I think you\u2019d be surprised at how anticlimactically so it is: the pyramid was originally at ~2.6 million. That makes Qin\u2019s tomb 42% bigger than the pyramid by volume, but about half its height. That isn\u2019t remotely close to the \u201ctwice the size\u201d of the Great Pyramid (that would require Qin\u2019s pyramid to be 100% bigger than Khufu\u2019s pyramid).  The Great Pyramid: Khufu\u2019s bizarre idea of what a horizon looks like, and proof that and that he was everyone\u2019s daddy. And actually the flimsy-ass construction method has allowed simple erosion to reduce the size of Qin\u2019s pyramid so much, that the difference is now even less: ~3.1 to 2.5 million in Qin\u2019s favor (or 24% larger than the great pyramid). The only way I could get it to actually be double the Great pyramid, is if I use the modern top\u2019s dimensions, and the original height. But that would be fucking stupid\u2014but then it takes a stupid person to make these bizarre claims, so\u2026(no, not the person asking: whoever they got it from). And Qin\u2019s tomb is the largest Chinese tomb of its kind: that\u2019s why I focus on it. The overwhelming majority are much smaller affairs, which Khufu\u2019s pyramid often outsizes. EDIT: oh, yes: it all began apparently with early pilots flying over these. People are shit at judging size without references, so tend to err on the big size. So they started taking 300 m tall pyramids. But as mentioned, in practice the tallest was 76 m\u2014around half \u201cKhufu\u2019s horizon\u201d. Some sheenius then took these uncritically, and spread the misunderstanding around. So to sum up: 1-no, Chinese pyramids were not on the whole, twice the size of the pyramids. This is the case even for the largest one. The most you can say is that they were bigger at times (and purely by volume) 2-They piled dirt. Piling dirt is not particularly hard, or advanced technology. (Tom: thanks for the A2A btw!) References: Chinese pyramids - Wikipedia Desclaimer: all relevant jokes are directly targeted at the two rulers, and not their people. I constantly rib megalomaniacal rulers, because they\u2019re asshole, and deserve to be called out for all the suffering they brought to their own people. That and I think they\u2019re all overcompensating\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The great pyramid, that has wrongfully been named Cheops pyramid, was built by RA in 4120 BC through the use of consciousness. RA, a 6th density social memory complex ,used thoughts to guide \u201crock consciousness \u201c to create the pyramid from it\u2019s own fundamental elements. It was finished off as blocks so that the Egyptians would not interpret RA as a god and would accept the pyramid as man made. The purpose was to be an instrument of consciousness transformation that would align with other pyramids and nodes around the planet. Atlantis blew itself up around 7500 BC and the confederation of planets that had given them nuclear technology around 14500 BC were extremely concerned for humanity and planet earth being able to make it to the beginning of the new cycle of consciousness due their bellicose ways. The great pyramid was designed to transform the bellicosity into more humane ways so that fourth density consciousness could be achieved around the planet. For the first 100 years it began to work and the new energy was shifting through the nodes and other pyramids. The priests began perverting that system for their own greedy and selfish needs so Ra had to leave because of the hypocrisy. The law of \u201cFree Will\u201d is always the most fundamental basis of doing things. Their well meaning action had been perverted again. RA had another shot in 1350 BC with Akhenaten as he saw the merit in the Law of One. It also lasted less than 100 years and mankind resumed it\u2019s march towards doom. When the atomic bomb was exploded in 1945 a hit was placed on humanity. If they did not blow themselves up they were going to be terminated around 2040. In 1980 Don Elkins had been researching UFO\u2019s since the early 1950\u2019s and RA gave it another shot at helping us thanks to the integrity of Don, Carla and Jim. With other connections from higher consciousness entities, we made it to 2012 and the termination was nullified. If you have no understanding of this stuff it can be found in The Law of One channeled information. We have been inundated with science fiction, TV and movies for the last 60 years so that reality seems like fiction. The truth has always been in plain sight but with subtle twists to give distorted views, The bible and many holy books have also told the truth with distortions that deceive the readers. The indigenous Australians understood rock consciousness for the last 25,000 year cycle at least, as they were experiencing fourth density consciousness through their \u201cDreamtime\u201d. Their communication system was centred at Uluru and people could communicate with each other throughout the whole land without \u201csmart phones\u201d or smoke signals. Uluru is one of the connecting points of the Earth grid. There is material logic and spiritual logic in RA\u2019s story and the indigenous Australians. As well, Moses seems to have been around at the same time as Akhenaten. As far as I know, there are no other pyramids the same size or with the same inner designs of chambers. Ra speaks of how they were used to shift a persons consciousness into a more unconditional loving perspective as this is the foundation of fourth density consciousness. People are now shifting around the planet into this way of being. ",

Even the tomb of the first emperor is significantly shorter than the larger Egyptian pyramids. That said, there are some very large pyramidal structures in China, but they were constructed on a very different basis. Rather than being built from the ground up, a good number of imperial family tombs were made by starting with a more or less pyramidal or conical natural hill and shaping it, taking away rocks and dirt to make it the desired form. They were made by extreme landscaping to tear things down, rather than by construction building things up. ",
