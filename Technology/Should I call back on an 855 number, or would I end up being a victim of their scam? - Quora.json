            "answer_text": "If a number calls you that you don't recognize and you haven't initiated the call, doesn't matter the area code even yours, DONT call back. If they have left a message and it sounds legit make your decision but even at that be careful. It's bad enough when it's telemarketers but if legit you can probably count on actually getting your purchase or service. The present day atmosphere however is that the likelihood of it being a scammer is high and they just want information so they can access your accounts. Cynical I know but don't want you ripped off. Any area codes from 001-999 be cautious of. P.S. Just cause it needs said. It's immaterial where any area code originally was designated as belonging to what location. With scamner technology any number they use can be coming from anywhere. A local area code doesn't mean it's a local number calling. ",

As an example, our local pharmacy just changed the number they call from when the meds are ready. So an unknown 866 number leaves a message for me saying that my prescription is ready, that\u2019s legit. And I add the number to my list of known numbers. An unknown number without a message or a message that makes no sense (the IRS doesn\u2019t have a warrant for my arrest!) ignore. If you don\u2019t know what the call is about, ignore. Don\u2019t answer, don\u2019t respond. Your life will be much simpler. ",
