            "answer_text": "\"Can the US Customs search through my HDD?\" To your first question, the answer is an unqualified \"yes\" \u2013 they absolutely can, for whatever reason they like, and without any need for \"probable cause.\" See the Electronic Frontier Foundation's article, Defending Privacy at the U.S. Border: A Guide for Travelers Carrying Digital Devices for more details in that regard. That said, and as the article above points out, the practice of doing this isn't common. It's never happened to me even once in all of the cross-border trips I've taken into the U.S. over the years. They used to ask me to turn my laptop on just to ensure it actually was a laptop (as opposed to something else disguised as a laptop), but new security techniques don't even really require that to be done any more. The EFF article notes an \"average of more than 300 border searches of electronic devices a month,\" but that's a tiny fraction of the number of travellers who cross the border each month. \"If so, by finding the movies and TV shows, can they sieze the HDD? Also, how will they ascertain that the stuff is pirated?\" As Neale Paterson points out, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is not really equipped or trained to act on copyright infringement, both in terms of jurisdictional authority and simply in terms of training. They're simply not equipped to know what is or isn't a piece of copyrighted material, and whether something that is on your computer is a legal, legitimate copy or not.  Technically speaking, U.S. Customs and Border Protection doesn't \"seize\" an HDD or laptop in cases such as these, but rather 'detain' the device in question, usually for further forensic investigation. This is normally only an issue if they can't conduct a search on your laptop or HDD through normal means, or they believe there's some need for deeper forensic investigation because they saw something else suspicious. Ordinarily, an initial search is done in your presence (not that you're allowed to witness the search itself -- merely to be in the room), but if they need additional help, they can \"detain\" the device to send away to a forensic lab for further analysis.  Note that all of this is pretty unlikely to happen unless you're giving the agent a really hard time, or they have some other reason to believe that something on your laptop or HDD bears further investigation. \"If they do, what can I do to get it back ? Assuming I can get it back.\" Since the device is only \"detained,\" it is normally returned to you within a reasonable time frame unless it becomes part of a criminal investigation or some other law enforcement or National Security issue. Despite what the RIAA and MPAA want people to believe, copyright infringement is not a \"criminal\" matter \u2013 certainly not for personal use \u2013 and therefore would be well out of their purview.  Customs and Border Protection Directive No. 3340-049: Border Search of Electronic Devices Containing Information specifies the details of how this works, and as per section 5.3.1, \"Unless extenuating circumstances exist, the detention of devices ordinarily should not exceed five (5) days.\" Once again, however, all of this leans highly to the end of improbability: You're unlikely to have your device searched at all.In the rare case that your device is searched, provided nothing on it looks suspicious and there are no impediments to the search itself, the CBP agent would mostly likely just glance through it, shrug, and return it to you.In the extremely unlikely event that they saw something that warranted further investigation, they could detain the device and send it away for further examination, in which case it should be returned to you within 5 days, assuming of course they don't actually find anything criminal in nature.Note that all of this presumes that you're being a polite and cooperative individual as you go through the CBP process. Start acting difficult or suspicious, and all bets are off. It's also worth noting that despite what many folks say, encrypting your hard drive won't be a defence against any of this. The CBP agent can ask you to provide your password, and while you can refuse, they can also refuse to let you into the country, and still decide to 'detain' your HDD to send it away for 'further analysis' just to make a point.  That said, encrypting a portion of your hard drive can be a good idea in some cases, in the sense that if the CBP agent points at your laptop and says, \"Here, enter your password\" you can comply, but you're under no obligation to point out that there's a hidden Truecrypt volume laying around elsewhere \u2013 unless of course they explicitly ask (it's an offence to lie to a CBP agent). However, it's still not likely worth concerning yourself with when it comes to merely copyrighted material, unless you're concerned that some of that material may be questionable under U.S. law. For example, I would avoid having any pornography on your laptop or HDD, as it can be very difficult to draw the line between what's legal and what's not, and CBP agents finding anything that's even borderline may be likely to consider that probably cause to dig deeper.

            "answer_text": "Many times it is not the inbound US customs that will be the check point but outbound from the country you are leaving. The RIAA, has been very aggressive in pushing anti-piracy policy within international trade agreements and countries like Vietnam have negotiated back saying they will not police copy right infringements within the boarders of the country, but will search for outgoing material\u2026 Since privacy & property rights are dictated 1st by the local laws and 2nd by international law once you clear customs, the expatriate country has carte blanche in dealing with your belongings. For example, Vietnamese customs confiscated DVD\u2019s I was bringing home to my parents a few years ago, and more recently some hard disks I had packed in my baggage were degausse erased with out my consent or knowledge.. imagine getting home and finding all of your Tax records and family pictures are gone. If you want to be sure to keep your files The best advice I have is:1) Bring only 1 HDD (more than one brings suspicion of trafficking material) - or bring the HDD\u2019s as an complete computer.2) Put the files that might upset the RIAA in a hidden encrypted partition3) Carry any HDDs or the external drives as carry on .. at least you will know what is going on and it is more difficult for them to devote a lot of attention to you as there are long lines of people to be served.
