A further discount of 10% , then I pay 80\u20138= 72% of the bill . So I am paying 75\u201372=3 percents less or 500x3= 1500\u20b9 less with successive discounts // ",

            "answer_text": "If a discount of 25% is provided to you for a bill amount of Rs. 50000, your spend from your pocket will be Rs. 37500; Discount will be = 12500                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              On the other hand, if a discount of 20% and 10% are applied successively to the bill, your spend will be 80/100*50k*90/100=0.72*50k=Rs.36000; Discount=14000;                                                                                                           So, applying 2 successive discounts yields better results compared to your one-shot discount, in your problem statement.
