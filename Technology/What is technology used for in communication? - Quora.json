            "answer_text": "To take a heterodox view, what technology has done to communication is similar to the old adage that we were given tongues to allow us to keep our secrets. Technology has made an exponentially growing difference to the ability to communicate - my wife even phoned my son in his bedroom two nights ago, from the living room. In fact there is so much communication now, that I start to wonder whether the sheer noise is drowning out the signal. I do welcome the democratisation of information - while Rupert Murdoch and his pals still control huge swathes of international and national communication, ordinary people can express their views and gain an audience. Yet unless we find a way of discriminating between communication sources - we understand where fake news emanates from and it is pernicious - we will lose one tyranny of hegemonic control and replace it with something potentially inchoate and perhaps more dangerous if it is stealthily taking over our lives.

            "answer_text": "Technology, when used as a channel for linguistic data, offers a language user a series of \u201caffordances\u201d and \u201cconstraints\u201d. \u201cAffordances\u201d mean that technology eases communication when compared with traditional face-to-face discourse in some ways (e.g. the fact that the interlocutor is not co-present reduces the fear of saying certain things); \u201cconstraints\u201d means that technology makes some aspects more difficult (e.g. because the interlocutor is not present, body and facial expression cannot be seen and felt).
