            "answer_text": "Possibly\u2026 it all depends.  Straight razors are typically very sharp, which allows them to provide an incredibly close shave, but they only belong in the hands of trained, master barbers \u2013 trust me:  most men need LOTS of practice to shave correctly (i.e. wound-free) with these.  A typical four or five blade cartridge that you can purchase at your local grocery store for your razor, can often provide as close of a shave, but here\u2019s the key:  shave first with the grain, then against the grain.  You\u2019ll want to use pre-shave oil first, and re-lather with your shaving cream between shaving with the grain and starting to shave against the grain. This is a very short answer on a topic I could spend a lot more explaining given the company I run (Kennedy\u2019s All-American Barber Club), but I hope this helps some. ",

            "answer_text": "Straight razors provide a great shave, but is it better than what you can get if you know what you're doing with a double edge safety razor? Probably not. Is it more enjoyable? Absolutely. I've been shaving with a straight razor every day for well over a year and the learning curve, while short, is there. Anyone can learn it and get smooth, irritation and blood free shaves with practice. It takes about a month of daily shaving to get comfortable and about a 100 shaves to begin to get shaves as close as with a DE. Royal Shave is a great shaving website, I've used them myself, but also check out Whipped Dog Straight Razor Shaving Equipment for a cheaper way to discover whether straights are for you. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Chris on this one. If used properly, it definitely gives the closest shave of any shave tool. Also taking into account the economics of shaving, the initial investment in a straight razor will seem high but, if taken care of correctly, it will last for generations. And always make sure to strop a straight razor before shaving, as this aligns and warms the blade to give it a slightly sharper edge. One thing I do have to disagree with about Chris' answer is the shaving with or against the grain. I think this will vary from person to person. Some will find that shaving against the grain will cause extreme irritation - so it just might not work for everyone. -Kristie. http://www.royalshave.com/ ",

But it is not nearly as enjoyable. A disposable or cartridge shave is more like trying to make a road trip as quick as possible (which has its appropriate times and places) versus taking a scenic route and enjoying the drive. You'll get where you're going both ways, but one way will likely produce a happier journey. ",

You probably are paying more attention to what you\u2019re doing, spending time to prep beforehand, and taking your time actually doing the shaving.

I opted initially for Straight Razors because of the burn SE razors left behind, but lately I have been finding some nooks and crannies that SE razors are just better equipped, not to mention safer to get at. My take in the end is, why do we need to choose or just pick one? Both are great! Straight Razors are great for me because I can vary the the pressure of the blade going to cut the whiskers and all and all because of the huge ecosystem that it brings together with it, it's much more fun, however I always keep my Safety Razors around for that whole face clean and smooth feeling.
