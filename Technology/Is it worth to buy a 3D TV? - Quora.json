            "answer_text": "There are a couple of things to bear in mind before going ahead with buying a 3D TV.  3D technology is still in its developing phase as far as private entertainment is concerned.  It is no doubt offering a great technology as of now with 3D technology from TVs, to projectors to even some smartphones.  3D TV means you can view a 3D sourced content on TV, so if you do not have a 3D source then you cannot watch 3D content.  What I mean to say is if you want to watch a 3D movie, you need a 3D blue ray player.  Almost all 3D TVs are SMART meaning you can run internet services on TV, so you could source 3D clippings from Youtube.  However you should realize that 3D data is very voluminous and you could have buffering issues when you watch a 3D youtube clipping.  So you would need a high speed internet at home or you may want to download it offline and then watch it to avoid buffering.  Thanks to the Youtube Offline feature added recently.  Also 3D movies are still very expensive, costing anywhere between 700 to 1500 a movie disc.  So 3D is only good for those who can afford to buy a 3d blu ray disc.  Also in India there is still no 3D content broadcast via cable.  Moreover one has to go for at least a 50 plus inch TV to enjoy such features.  Watching 3D on a small TV may not be very enjoyable, bigger the TV, better the experience.   So to sum up 3D TV is good if :1) One has high speed internet at home to avoid buffering of 3D online data.2) One doesnt mind spending over Rs 1000 to buy a single 3d blue ray disc3) One doesnt mind buying a bigger display 3D TV for a better visual experience.

            "answer_text": "Good technologies die off if not well marketed. This is what happened to 3DTV. If you can get you hands on one and wish to exploit this feature then try using external software encoders by connecting a pc to your 3DTV. I recently stumbled across this feature in a software application by Cyberlink called PowerDVD nearly seven years after buying a 3DTV. The encoding was on a more realistic level as you would expect of stereoscopic 3D captured material. Much better then the default encoding by Samsung built into the Tv. I could take standard HD camera footage and photographs with my Canon Dslr and camcorder and view this at much higher level of depth and realism using this external encoder. If you in the market for a new tv and if 3D cinema appeals to you then grab the remaining few 3D Tvs that maybe available and amplify the experience using PowerDVD. ",
