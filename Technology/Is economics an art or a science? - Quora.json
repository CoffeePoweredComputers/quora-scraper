            "answer_text": "It is philosophy. \u201cEconomics is philosophy. Philosophy is the search of knowledge, or the love of wisdom. Physics is searching knowledge, and so is Economics. Did Adam Smith himself not also start from studying philosophy? Hence, Economics is philosophy. But Economics is more secular than any other branches of philosophy. That is why someone, like Robert Heilbroner, claimed that Economics is an earthly philosophy. \u201d See the Series Preface of Amazon.com: Solving the Interest Rate Mystery (Laissez Faire Economics Book 48) eBook: Hak Choi: Kindle Store ",

            "answer_text": "It is definitely a social science.  Defining art is profoundly difficult, I would be open to arguments therefore that it might be an art. But it is unavoidably a science, a social science to be specific.  Science is the systematic collection and organisation of knowledge via the formation and testing of hypotheses. A social science is the application of the scientific method to society and the interaction of people. ",
