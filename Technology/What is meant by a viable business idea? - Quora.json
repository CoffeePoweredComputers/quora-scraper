            "answer_text": "I am currently reading Peter Thiels Zero to One which is all about this, Im going to reference a few things from his writings. Basically a viable business idea is one that will suceed and dominate it\u2019s market. Alphabet(Google) Dominates the online advertising market and the search engine market Amazon controlled the online book market nearly making bookstores absolute Henry Ford revolutionized transportation and then dominated the industry for a while. What\u2019s so alike about these companies or people that set themselves apart from the failures. They created something new, they invented their own market or dominated one with little competition. You may be saying, \u201cHey why make a company in a market worth $1Mil when the car industry is worth billions!\u201d Well do the math, you may control .5 percent of the car industry but that means you are earning $5Mil not including production costs and upkeep for your buisness. Thats not even saying you will be crushed by the massivd corperations that control the market. However if you start off in a smaller market or create you\u2019re going to have a lot of control and presence. You can even expand in the market. The idea here is not to shadow and follow the giants, theyre idea of sucess may have worked for them when their market of operations was small and ready to be worked. Now you will fail and flownder. Creating your own market or targeting a small one will increase your success. ",
