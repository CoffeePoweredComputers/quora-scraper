A calm environment, in a historic property, preferably in a remote area, as far from the madding IT crowd, end users, project managers as the HR budget allows. (Also decision makers who think kicking things will fix software glitches.) Peace, tranquility, and nothing more technical than a candle and a box of matches, the odd door latch or a water closet to cope with. (After they have been forcibly separated from their smartphones, smart watches, tablets, obviously. And in some extreme cases, Neuromancer type implants have been surgically removed).  Please note this is not the retreat in question, despite inescapably small windows in the chill-out tower. (Careful study of the image reveals what looks a lot like a 5G antenna on the roof.) ",

Even knocking flakes off a rock to make a biface is a technology: you have to know exactly how to do it right. I couldn't and I bet you couldn't either. So what technology did you have in mind? Steam engines? Most of the country doesn't use that technology any more, so maybe that's your answer. Steam power, out of use everywhere except a few working museums. ",
