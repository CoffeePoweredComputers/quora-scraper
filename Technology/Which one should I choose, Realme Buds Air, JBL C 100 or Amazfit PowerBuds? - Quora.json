            "answer_text": "Hey. I was wondering for the exact same question a few months ago. And I did find an answer after experimenting with all the products. I would let you know everything that I found out. I chose the JBL C100TWS, after testing all of them. I am a singer by hobby, and music for me is something very religious. So everything in this review would be completely honest, and it is my first hand personal experience. REALME BUDS AIR: They were launched at a price of 3999INR and since then, they have been termed the \u201clow-budget airpods\u201d. Pros: Good quality soundDecent builtPacked with features: wireless charging, wear detectionYou get the popular airpods designThe low latency gaming mode is definitely really helpfulTouch gestures are really resposnsiveCons: The sound stage is a bit narrow to my liking. You might not be able to differentiate between instruments. This might not affect most people, but then I am very picky when it comes to sound quality.(SOUND nQUALITY is HOW GOOD A DEVICE CAN PRODUCE A PARTICULAR FREQUENCY AND SOUND STAGE IS HOW MANY DIFFERENT SOUNDS CAN THE DEVICE ACTUALLY PRODUCE)The battery life. They claim that it would last upto 3 hours on a single charge but the earbuds themselves do no laat for more than around 2/2 and a half hours. This is not good because, in some cases, you might sit down to watch a movie or an episode of your favourite series but then you don't have enough battery.If you have all the cool features but you don't have enough power to use them for a decent time, it is not worth the money according to me. Again, if the sound quality and battery doesn't bother you, REALME BUDS AIR might be the best option to go for. JBL C100TWS They might be available at a price of 3999INR. Pros: Really good sound quality(the bass is punchy, lows, highs and mids are absolutely clear)Simplistic and a decent built(I have dropped them a couple of times, and have experienced no issues so far, touch wood!)Very decent battery life(they can last for around 4 to 5 hours on a single charge)Clearly differentiated sound stage. You can hear each and every instrument separately.You get button controls, which is considered somewhat simplerCons: Absence of a low-latency mode, not suitable for gamingNo type-c port, no wireless chargingAverage call qualityAvailability through flash saleYes there are these cons in the device but for someone who loves listening to music, JBL C100TWS is a really great option.

            "answer_text": "I say it is totally dependent on your choice. If you choose to have airpods look and feel, wireless charging capability, descent sound quality, a low battery life, low latency mode go for the Realme Buds Air.If you want a snug fit, descent wound, all rounder go for the JBL C100 TWSI would personally not recommend you the Amazfit Powerbuds as they are heavy in weight,and amazfit didn't mainly concentrate about sound in these powerbuds.If you want a descent looking pair of earbuds with features like ANC, wireless charging, 24 hours music playback just go for the Oppo Enco W51. They are just awesome for the price. With the same specs Realme is launching their Buds Air Pro on October 7th.",
