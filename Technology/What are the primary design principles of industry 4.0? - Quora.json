            "answer_text": "1.Inter-operability: Objects, machines and people need to be able to communicate through the Internet of Things and the Internet of People. This is the most essential principle that truly makes a factory a smart one. 2.Virtualization: CPSs must be able to simulate and create a virtual copy of the real world. CPSs must also be able to monitor objects existing in the surrounding environment. Simply put, there must be a virtual copy of everything. 3.Decentralization: The ability of CPSs to work independently. This gives room for customized products and problem solving. This also creates a more flexible environment for production. In cases of failure or having conflicting goals, the issue is delegated to a higher level. However, even with such technologies implemented, the need for quality assurance remains a necessity on the entire process 4.Real-Time Capability: A smart factory needs to be able to collect real time data, store or analyze it, and make decisions according to new findings. Smart objects must be able to identify the defect and re-delegate tasks to other operating machines. This also contributes greatly to the flexibility and the optimization of production. 5.Service-Orientation: Production must be customer-oriented. People and smart objects/devices must be able to connect efficiently through the Internet of Services to create products based on the customer\u2019s specifications. This is where the Internet of Services becomes essential. 6. Modularity: In a dynamic market, a Smart Factory\u2019s ability to adapt to a new market is essential. In a typical case, it would probably take a week for an average company to study the market and change its production accordingly. On the other hand, smart factories must be able to adapt fast and smoothly to seasonal changes and market trends.Submit ",
