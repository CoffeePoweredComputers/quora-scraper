            "answer_text": "Kotlin can stand on its own: No need to learn Java first. Kotlin is a newer language that takes advantage of some technology that was first developed for Java, but that technology is also used for other languages (like Scala and a version of Python) and those languages don\u2019t require learning Java first either. That said, the common underlying technology means that you can easily use Java libraries from Kotlin. The documentation for those libraries may assume Java client code (because Java is still much more popular than Kotlin at this time), and in that sense understanding Java could be useful in your use of Kotlin. However, that\u2019s unlikely to be an issue during the initial learning stages with Kotlin. ",

            "answer_text": "It will help you understand how some of the features are implemented and some of the performance implications that entails, but other than that, learning Java is far from required. Kotlin is somewhat more complicated by nature, however, it is much less loaded with boilerplate, thus I would say it is not all that much more difficult to learn than Java. They share a lot of concepts, but so do many other languages. There is one caveat though: a lot of current code bases are written in Java, therefore, it is very likely you will have to deal with it even if you primarily develop using Kotlin. From that point of view, learning Java is still very useful. ",

            "answer_text": "In the Android world there are many thousands of apps written in Java. In most companies, that isn\u2019t going to get converted over to Kotlin anytime soon. It\u2019s working code after all. And if it gets re-written in Kotlin, new bugs will be accidentally introduced. This will be true for years. So if you want to have full career in Android development, you need to know both. There\u2019s more things out there showing Java examples and teaching than Kotlin, so from that view it makes sense to learn Java first. But technically either language can be learned first. ",
