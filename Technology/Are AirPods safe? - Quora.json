            "answer_text": "Lol, no they won\u2019t cause brain tumors. They can be a bit uncomfortable for my taste, but they won\u2019t give you a terminal sickness. Overall, yes, airpods are safe, or as safe as any other headphone. And if it\u2019s the bluetooth signal she\u2019s worried about, cell phones, microwaves, and some older TV\u2019s give off more dangerous radiation then bluetooth ever could. If anyone in your family uses a cell phone, they are pushing more rads into their brain then the headphones could or will. Hell, I\u2019ll go on a whim and say the sun more dangerous then airpods! Sit in direct sun too long with no protection, I bet you\u2019ll get a nasty burn and that long term could lead to melanoma. Breathing exhaust in traffic a lot more hazardous to ones health then wearing airpods! In all, I get peoples worry to an extent. The world is a scary place and everyone wants to try and minimize risk to, well everything it seems these days. But what is life without risk? Not that there\u2019s really risk to wearing headphones beyond the idea you could get hit by a car or something because one can\u2019t hear what\u2019s going on, but that could happen with any headset. To the point, if airpods caused cancer, I\u2019m pretty sure there would be some sort of governing body that would smack them down really fast. And for all the kids I see wearing airpods, not one to my knowledge has gotten brain cancer. but people will believe what they want and ignore facts anymore, so, take a risk or not, up too you. ",

            "answer_text": "Whoever told you this is trying to take advantage of gullible people. You definitely shouldn\u2019t listen to them. I\u2019ve seen people asking slight variations of this question, usually mentioning cancer, for the past few weeks, and I have to wonder: where are they hearing this from? I sure would love for just one of you to tell the rest of us where you heard this silly idea. No. The Bluetooth radio waves emitted by AirPods aren\u2019t bad for your health. These are not strong frequencies and they do not cause cancer. In comparison the sun emits much, much stronger radio waves that bombard this planet and is much more likely to cause cancer. In fact many people do get skin cancer from exposure to sunlight. So if you are supposedly worried about getting cancer from inanimate objects you should avoid sunlight long before you worry about using Bluetooth headphones. ",

If you can\u2019t hear a siren, horn, announcements on airplanes, or the P.A. system on the train (or your bus driver) calling out the stops, the volume is too loud. Any concern about Bluetooth being a brain tumor hazard is pure woo-woo junk science, promulgated by the likes of those who insist bras and antiperspirants cause breast cancer. ",

The vast majority of the time the headset is acting just as a receiver,aand getting a tiny signal. The only time it transmits is say when you touch your ears to select next track. You are probably in greater risk of impacted ear wax!. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey, I stumbled across this! No, they won\u2019t cause Brain Damage. Unless somehow a volt of electricity surges through the AirPods themselves and surge through your ear, into your brain, thus most likely cooking your brain, send you into temporary or permanent paralysis or even putting you into a coma. But the surge would be so low it most likely wouldn\u2019t do that. But AirPods were made so this wouldn\u2019t happen, and the chance of you actually just getting shocked without hurting you is so low I wouldn\u2019t count the chance. Most of my information is probably incorrect, but you wanted an answer. ",
