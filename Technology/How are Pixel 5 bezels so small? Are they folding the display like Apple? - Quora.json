This clever, albeit complicated and expensive procedure has a positive effect on the aesthetic value and allows to minimize the bottom frame All indicates that Google used exactly the same procedure. It is true that the company does not boast about it directly, but in official specification I came across a mention of using \u201cflexible OLED\u201d. Pixel 5 has neither a folded screen nor curved edges, so the treatment with the controller seems to be the only sensible explanation for the use of a flexible pane ",
