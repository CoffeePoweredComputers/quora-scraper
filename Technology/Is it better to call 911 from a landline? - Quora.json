            "answer_text": "Is it better to call 911 from a landline? YES. Land lines are all in a database. Cell data has to be TRIANGULATED or a GPS fix. This largely depends on the 911 centers capability and access to the E911 system. Enhanced 911 is not active or working in every center. Irving TX I was reporting a car that was stalled on a RAMP adjacent to me and the 911 operator was able to PING my location from my Cell phones Military GPS chip. Dallas TX there was a similar situation and I called 911 and they could NOT locate my location via GPS or Triangulation. Dallas City is millions of population larger then Irving and Irving has the system that you would think that Dallas would have working today. Dallas just upgraded its 911 center from using old RELAY switching from the 60s Telecommunications to a hybrid Digital, This is something that most every city has done back in the late 90s and has updated again leaving Dallas in the dark ages still. Land Lines are still in the DATABASE and can be looked up regardless unlike Cell phones that have to COMMUNICATE Through a tower. GPS is a receive only technology that sends the LOCATION via the call to the 911 center using Cell Towers. If the Center can not receive that data they then have to use a less accurate Triangulation method and if that does not work you DIE! Cell Phone Tower Triangulation - Cell Tower Triangulation ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, yes. If you have the choice, use the landline. The reason is that the landline is registered at a fixed location. Ideally, the location should come up immediately as the call is answered at a 911 dispatch center. To clarify, by landline I\u2019m talking about copper wire and going through a telco. If you are considering a landline to be cable/fiber/VOIP service, it may or may not be as accurate. The location should come up as to where it is registered but there may or may not be issues with E911 service and compatibility. Cellular service will be the least accurate because they will be relying on triangulation of signals from three of the closest cell towers. Even if they are able to use with GPS signal, it still may not be accurate. If you are using WiFi calling on a cell phone, most likely they will use the address you registered as the default when enabling your WiFi calling. ",
