            "answer_text": "its already been revealed so no, it has the same 3 cameras from the 11 pro max but theres a new sensor detecting system that will improve OIS (Optical Image Stabilizing) meaning when youre recording videos if the OIS is good it would barely shake around so stabilizing the video. this is an actual sensor and not in the camera itself which its gonna be interesting but the cameras are gonna be improved, better night photos, more light in darker pictures on the face, improved aperture so its gonna adapt more light in general photos. plus the LiDar scanner which is gonna be awesome for high end depth photos or virtual reality.
