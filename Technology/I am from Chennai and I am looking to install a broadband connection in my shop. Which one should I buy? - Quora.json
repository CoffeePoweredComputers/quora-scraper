            "answer_text": "The BSNL Broadband is the most effective.One might argue that Airtel is better but i have some experiences from the floods that struck Chennai some months ago and i assure you that BSNL is most effective as a broad band.Connections of BSNL were the ones which were reestablished the fastest after the floods.The main problem is GETTING the connection.Since it is a governmental organization; you might have to give a few bribes or get to know some influential people; but once you get hold of those kind of people; your job is half done if you don't care about the money you are to spend to get the connection.

            "answer_text": "ACT generally offers higher speeds but for a shop I don't think only internet is that much useful.  Airtel offers 50gb fup limit and also unlimited local and STD calls using landline for 999 + tax which is pretty good. I don't know about the speed offered by Airtel though. If your priority is high speed internet then ACT is the best but if you want reliable internet with unlimited calls then go for Airtel. I myself use ACT and I can say that it is very fast and movies get downloaded in minutes when it used to take something around 1hour when I was using BSNL. ",
