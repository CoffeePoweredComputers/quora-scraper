            "answer_text": "Adamantium is a harder, more resistant material. Think of it as Iron when everything else is Aluminum. It resists warping so much that the only way to work it is to engage it while it\u2019s in a molten or near molten state! The amount of stress and strength it would take to bend or snap a piece of\u2026 say, adamantium rebar is almost ridiculous and even Thor or the Hulk would have trouble managing it. It\u2019s that resistant to distortion and bending. Unfortunately, it\u2019s that same inflexibility which makes it destructible (not easily, mind you). That which cannot bend will break when under enough stress \u2014 it just requires a ludicrously high amount of stress to break adamantium (kind of why it\u2019s called that). Vibranium is literally on a different scale. Completely different. As in, cannot actually be compared. It\u2019s like asking if Usain Bolt is a superior athlete to Michael Jordan. Adamantium is strong because it takes a lot to bend it. That\u2019s literally all there is to it. Vibranium is a lot more complex. Vibranium is strong because it bends so incredibly easily, but invariably returns to its original shape when the pressure is gone. If Adamantium is like Super-Iron, and thus will eventually give way when finally overstressed, Vibranium is like an unsnappable rubber band \u2014 it\u2019ll just give and give and give as long as you pour energy into it, until the energy it\u2019s stored overpowers the energy you\u2019re putting into it, which results in a MASSIVE explosion of raw kinetic energy that would reduce Isaac Newton to highly impressed yet terrified tears. This is why Captain America\u2019s shield REFLECTS bullets rather than simply stopping them dead in their tracks like a conventional shield: it\u2019s actually gathering and redirecting the bullet\u2019s kinetic energy according to the shape of the shield\u2019s surface rather that absorbing and dispersing that energy. And it\u2019s why Black Panther\u2019s suit in the movie can make an EARTH SHATTERING KABOOM if hit with enough force (\u201cDELETE THAT FOOTAGE!\u201d). Captain America\u2019s shield is actually made of both. Most of the base construction is Vibranium, which gives it its startling kinetic properties, and it\u2019s fortified with an early, experimental Adamantium alloy that grants it just enough rigidity that it can\u2019t be bent back enough to expose or harm Cap. So in the end, Vibranium is probably \u201cstronger\u201d, just because the amount of abuse you\u2019d have to give it to permanently compromise its structure after being cast would be so great that the resultant explosion would realistically atomize the vibranium along with whatever was vaguely nearby. Adamantium would give long before that point. If you survive such an explosion, or it just plain doesn\u2019t occur when the Vibranium snaps\u2026 congratulations. You\u2019re the favorite character of whoever is writing your comic book and they\u2019ve sacrificed the rules for Rule of Drama. ",

            "answer_text": "Adamantium is definitely the strongest metal of the two but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s necessarily the best to use in all circumstance. As you\u2019re probably aware one of the key things that vibranium does is absorbs almost any impact or vibration that is directed against it so, defensively, it can be considered the better to use than adamantium. But, as I say, it\u2019s only almost all impacts and the defensive properties of vibranium can be overcome if it\u2019s sufficient force or sharpness used against it. For example, the Black Panther\u2019s suit is made using a vibranium weave in the comics just like it is in the films and during fights between Black Panther and Wolverine, Wolverine\u2019s adamantium claws have been shown to be able to slice through it and draw blood;  During the Black Panther film as well there was a scene where Shuri had specifically mentioned to T\u2019Challa that he shouldn\u2019t consider his suit completely indestructible and warned him that too much impact(s) against it could eventually overload it and that was the main reason why his upgraded suit had the capability of redirecting the energy of the impacts and expelling it as concussive blasts. But if the question is being asked in order to find out what the strongest metal full stop in the Marvel universe is then the overall strongest is no doubt adamantine. That\u2019s what Hercules\u2019 Mace is made from and Amadeus Cho explains it\u2019s properties to Wolverine pretty well here;  There\u2019s since been a retcon that when adamantium was originally created it was done because the inventor was actually trying to find and recreate the process that makes adamantine so if you take that and put it into Layman\u2019s Terms then adamantine is stronger than adamantium due to being \u201cGodlier\u201d than it. Also, it\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s even a superior form of vibranium than normal vibranium (usually referred to as Wakandan Vibranium) and that\u2019s Antarctic Vibranium or, as it\u2019s more commonly known as, Anti-Metal. That shares the same properties as Wakandan vibranium but it can also cause a chemical reaction when it interacts with other metals and causes the other metal to melt, basically. Hence the \u201cAnti-Metal\u201d name it has. Misty Knight\u2019s prosthetic arm is made of it;   So, as that shows, Antarctic vibranium is definitely a superior version of Wakandan vibranium and can even \u201cmelt\u201d adamantium. In the comics, Black Panther\u2019s claws in his suit are made from the Antarctic variation of vibranium to be more effective against armoured opponents. It seems that, in the MCU, the claws on his suit are just standard Wakandan vibranium, though. But, for the original question, adamantium is the stronger of the two and I was only adding the other two examples in case the question was asking for what is considered the strongest (or most effective) type of Marvel metal to use? Hope that helps, anyway. ",
