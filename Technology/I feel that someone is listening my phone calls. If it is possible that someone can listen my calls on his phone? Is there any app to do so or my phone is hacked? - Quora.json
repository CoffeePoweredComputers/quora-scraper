            "answer_text": "Okay so I seen your request and I said to myself there has to be a reason why you believe someone is listening on your phone conversations I somehow don't feel as though it's out of being paranoid There are no apps that can be installed on your phone . Unfortunately there are a lot of companies you give permission to that allows them to have access to your phone and a lot of things you do on your phone a lot of apps that you download asks you if they can have access to your phone and it all depends upon which company it is that's asking if it's a telecommunications company they'll even ask you to have permission to your microphone You need to go through your phone and look at all the permissions that you gave to certain companies and the companies that you gave permissions to that ask if they are allowed to use your microphone I would delete those companies because technically they can use your microphone as a listening device but a lot of those companies also use your microphone to let you ask questions or Google things using your microphone or an app that you can use to talk into that would let you voice text ",
