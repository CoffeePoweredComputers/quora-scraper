            "answer_text": "How is RNA able to replicate itself? Short answer: Neither DNA nor RNA are capable of \u201cself-replication\u201d (can not \u201creplicate itself\u201d). The only case of \u201cRNA replication\u201d (a misnomer) taking place in cell nuclei is the transcription of RNA (from DNA) to messenger RNA (mRNA), performed by RNA polymerases. DNA, in turn, is a passive macromolecule \u2014 on its own, DNA does nothing \u2014 it has only one function: to safely store the digital DNA code of the genome. In order to replicate DNA, several different, closely cooperating RNA and supporting protein molecules (enzymes) are required, one prominent such is DNA polymerase. Some RNA structures \u2014 and their functions \u2014 are listed here (several are used for DNA replication, none of them for \u201cRNA replication\u201d):  RNA Types (table source: www.the-scientist.com article The RNA Age: A Primer).

What purpose do they serve?What function does DNA serve before it is transcribed and used to code for proteins? Why isn't mRNA formed straight away?

            "answer_text": "How is RNA able to replicate itself? RNA can not replicate itself outside of a living cell. The most stripped down RNA pathogens are viroids, infectious particle smaller than any of the known viruses - loops of infectious RNA that do not code for any proteins, they are just RNA genomes that on entering a suitable pant cell will trigger the host enzymes to copy them. There are two known viroid families: Pospiviroidae which replicate in the nucleus and Avsunviroidae which replicate in the chloroplasts. Classification of the Pospiviroidae based on their structural hallmarks International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)  ",
