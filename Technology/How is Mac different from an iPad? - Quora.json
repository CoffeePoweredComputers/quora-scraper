            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. A MacBook is a laptop computer that uses OS X. It uses keyboard entry and cursor moment via a mouse or trackpad. It runs applications designed to run on OS X. It can also run Windows programs using Virtual Machines (such as Parallels or Fusion), or it can boot directly into Windows via Boot Camp. An iPad is a tablet that uses iOS. iOS is different from OS X in that it does not use a cursor, but instead employs a touch screen for direct input. It also has an onscreen keyboard for inputing text as necessary (external keyboards are also supported via Bluetooth or Apple's new smart connector on the iPad Pros). While you can do many of the same things on both devices (email, web surfing, FaceBook, etc.), the way you use each is distinctly different due to their different operating systems.  ",
