            "answer_text": "You won't. Don't try. I, like many, have had some success, but I was lucky and it took a long time to get there. I wrote an answer that became somewhat popular detailing a fictitious war. (Jon Davis's answer to If every state of the USA declared war against each other, which would win?) A little less than two years later, I was contacted by Emmy Award winning producer Josh C. Kline. From there we signed an agreement that didn't exactly break the bank that gave Kline permission to take the story to production companies in hopes that it would be made into a Short Run TV show or movie. There wasn't a lot of money in that first transaction and the most valuable item I recieved for my efforts was an epic framed still from my favorite movie, 300. If nothing else comes from that project, which is usually the case, I am still stoked about the framed still hanging in my living room. And that is what you should expect in working hard for the benefit of a company that shares content you create. You are \"competing\" against millions of other content creators to \"produce\" content that captures attention. I used to try very hard to compete in this way. (Jon Davis's answer to What does a good answer on Quora look like? What does it mean to \"be helpful\"?) Now, having grown a bit, I don't attempt to game the system anymore. Sometimes, I will invest in writing an answer well, and still utilize some practical writing tips to the get traffic so that people will see what I've produced. If I worked hard on something, I am going to try to get you to see it. Basically, though, I will only do that if there is something I wish every single person on the site would see, rather than just the person asking the question. That, in my opinion is how someone on this site finds success. Note that I didn't say \"gets rich\". I say \"finds success\". They are very different things. I have found success here by putting in a great deal of effort into a few answers that I feel are extremely important, or entertaining, and that I feel few people are equipped to answer as I am. I also have found experience by adding to those few noteworthy answers with another thousand or so small answers. These answers have added value to those followers who are genuinely interested in topics I write in, but that aren't worth a 3,000 word essay. Nearly three years after my first answer, I still try to continuing doing just that, add value to others by sharing what I know. In doing so, I have met countless people who have shared with me their support, appreciation, and encouragement. These people have let me know how my reflections, knowledge, and points of view have taught them, changed their way of thinking on the military and veterans, and sometimes even grew them in ways I could not have predicted. Some of them, such as Scott Lowe, Nick Layon, Ariel Williams, Dan Holliday, Graeme Shimmin, Tracey Bryan and Robert Frost, as well as far too many others, I've connected with and who mean more to me than just another clever person on this site providing me interesting content. Many of them have pushed me on to do greater things and continue to improve the content I put out. By putting myself out there, I have met people. By meeting people I have had opportunities given to me, and by following those opportunities, I have gained success. In the last six months, I have been invited to several opportunities mostly, like I said, because of the relationships I have made by being a contributor at Quora. I have been asked to write at a few different online outlets catering to military and veteran communities, have appeared in my first official byline at Newsweek (that's not been through the Quora partnership program by the way), have appeared on the podcast for the website Art of Charm, written my first non fiction novella and am knee deep in my full length novel based off one of my favorite Quora answers yet that I hope to start releasing soon. All of these successes have happened outside of Quora, but none would have happened if not for the relationships built inside of it. I also know of others who have had their own success stories. Oliver Emberton apparently got a book deal from one of his answers and others like David S. Rose have written very successful books based off their works on Quora. Anecdotally, I am sure that there are many successful stories from these halls, but I would honestly doubt that even these content creators would say their time spent on Quora was a good investment for the money's sake. If you've noticed closely, none of these activities actually translates into financial wealth or even security. They gain you a lot of influence, but don't fix a leaky roof. Quora isn't going to help you fix the roof. I am happy that there are websites out there that can, though. I have gained some funding through the website Patreon. Patreon allows contributors to submit their creative works for the public and your fans and followers, \"patrons\", to donate every time you put out a piece of content with no obligations on either end. If you really want to write and share, as well as try to recoup some of the time lost, this is definitely a great tool to do so which I highly recommend to anyone serious about their writing. It is also a great way to connect with your greatest fans and followers, those dedicated enough to ensuring you keep on creating content they appreciate. If you have followed me before, you've probably noticed my little banner at the bottom of most of my large answers (like this one) that point to Patreon. It's a nice way to let people know how they can show their appreciation for work I've given them. Don't think this will get you rich either. On a good month, I might make a few pieces that are up to snuff enough to feel that I should submit it for money from my followers. If you do go this way, expect to be spending a lot of time shamelessly marketing yourself with little return for many months. By the way, did I mention that everything I write for all of you is completely free? Wouldn't it be nice to say \"good job for all that work\" at least in the same way you tip the barista who gave you your coffee? Here's that link again: Support Jon Davis creating Short Stories and Articles in Military, Sci-Fi and Life. All kidding aside and having said all that, besides networking opportunities and utilizing other sites, Quora doesn't help make people money. That isn't what they do. They don't pay contributors. They don't give stock to the people who generate their traffic. It just isn't part of the model of social media like this one. You're not going to make money just by writing well on Quora, and when I say that you can't make money from Quora, know that I know what I am talking about. I am a top 200 writer on a site with tens of millions of users, 3 time Quora Top Writer and I even used to work there. Once, I was the office manage for Quora and, at that time, I made a lot of money. I learned everything there was to know about Quora: how their traffic worked, patterns behind user behavior, how to use the system, how to get seen, how to growth hack, and had intimate relationships with the builders of the website. I learned about social media from the people who built sites like Facebook, Twitter and Google. I even worked directly under Marc Bodnick. But that wasn't a successful way to make money either. The truth was, I didn't possess the skillset for that role, nor the ambition to deal with the challenges that came with it. More so than that, in seeing the path ahead of me, I'm not sure the destination I was moving toward was the one I wanted. In hindsight, while I enjoyed working for people like Marc and was daily floored by the brilliance of the engineers who built the site, my heart wasn't in the work I did and I eventually failed. I made many great friends there, and left on good terms, but working at Quora just wasn't for me. I just wanted to write. Now, I've found balance and truly enjoy what I do. I've become a teacher (now I actually make money, very little of it) and in the few hours I have left to myself, write answers like what you see here, as well as stories, posts, essays, and other contributions throughout the web. I suppose teaching, the sharing of knowledge, is what drove me to contributing to Quora in the first place, but the point is, it is still my day job. Writing, in its many forms, is what I do on the side. It's what I enjoy. It's what I have to do and simply can't stop. After three years and an adventure impossible to imagine, I've enjoyed some opportunities that many would consider successful. Maybe another three years from now, I will luck out and become successful by other people's standards. As of now, I still measure success in the number of people who see what I have to say, even if, because of many of the limitations in Quora, that now takes place outside of the site. What writers on Quora need to do is to focus on communicating a message you want others to learn from. It's great if this act entertains you and adds value to your life while adding value to others', as well. If your priority is money, though, trust someone who has invested countless hours and three years to writing, mostly right here, Quora is not the place to invest your time or your talent for that goal.

            "answer_text": "Okay straight up. Let me lay it out there on how you can actually use Quora to make money. My credentials? I\u2019ve been making money online for a few years now. I considered myself a writer more than anything, but because I do it online, I\u2019m by default a blogger, internet marketer and entrepreneur. There\u2019s a shit ton of information out there on how to make money online in general, so I hope to make it super simple and easy to understand here. Let\u2019s go! The practical stuff- . Building a list In internet marketing/online businesses/being an entrepreneur online, the MOST fundamental and legit way to conduct your business is to build a list. What is a list? It\u2019s an email list. It\u2019s your subscribers base. You know how some websites ask for your name and email so you can sign up for their newsletter? Yup. A list is your database. And database is always an asset. Hence, this is why it\u2019s the most legit way to conduct your business. You fucking own it! And here\u2019s a little fruit for thought: Asking people to sign up for your newsletter is by far the fucking lousiest incentive in the world. It sucks ass. It\u2019s stupid. A mere newsletter is garbage. You gotta offer them something juicier. I have a free book right here: 12 Things Happy People Don\u2019t Give a Fuck About! This is called a dedicated squeeze page, meaning you have only ONE thing to do on that page and that is to sign up for my free book. This is to break free from distractions. Most companies\u2019 websites have a shit ton of clutter and only offer a shitty newsletter, that is why their sign-up rate is horrible. . Making money with your list So after you build your list, you make money off it by sending them shit to buy. You can do this with affiliate products (in which you sell other people\u2019s shit and make a commission), your own products you create or offer them a service. That\u2019s it! Build list- Send them shit- Make money It\u2019s that simple. An email list is always and always will be the highest converting method to making money online. Why? Because everybody says so. I mean it. Google it and you will know. From experience, I can also vouch for that. And as said, a list is your database, your asset. You own it. Every business needs an asset. . How you use Quora to make money How do you use Quora to make money then? How does all of this link to Quora? Quora is a huge ass network that boasts a lot of viewers. By using Quora, you\u2019re hence leveraging on them. So you come here, create an account, answer questions, link back to your free incentive (like my free book, again), build that list, and then send them shit to buy. That\u2019s it. Simple. That\u2019s how you ultimately make money with Quora as a legit business for the long-term. The mindset stuff- This is obviously a lot easier said than done Look man, learning how to make money online is extremely easy. In today\u2019s day and age, you can read shit up online easily. But doing it is fucking hard. Taking action will always be hard. And unfortunately, I dare say that most people today are being preyed upon. There\u2019re many businesses out there wherein their business is to teach people how to create a business. It\u2019s not as simple as that. Think about it, if it works so well, why the hell would you teach? Why would they teach you ONLY? They\u2019re making off you, that\u2019s why. That\u2019s all they care about. That is why you need to build your mindset in order to know how to make money online, or with Quora. Here\u2019s my take on this: . You need balls From what I\u2019ve been observing, a lot of people on Quora are very against the idea of using Quora to make money. They argue that self-promotion is bad, is selling, is trolling, is whatever. But well, newsflash, a lot of people are also not rich, not entrepreneurs and not making money with a business. If you want to stand out, it\u2019s time to gather your balls, ignore the haters and bravely do shit to further your ambitions. I\u2019ve been told that I am an aggressive marketer on Quora. I probably am. ALL my answers will link back to my free book. And like duh, I am fucking profane as fuck. That\u2019s how I stand out. But I really don\u2019t give a fuck if you hate it. Your hate is not my problem. It\u2019s yours. So do you want to like everybody? Or do you want to stand out with your fucking awesome ambitions and rewards? . You need consistency to eliminate the newbie effect The problem with the ease and accessibility to learn shit online is that it makes you THINK that you can do the same. But that is a lie. It\u2019s extremely to read this answer of mine now and think \u201cWow! Okay. Let me try what Alden is saying. Since it works for him, it should therefore work for me.\u201d That\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s the newbie in you making you think that way. That is why so many people today think that online marketing is just a matter of \u201cDo this shit and it will work.\u201d Think about it\u2026 how many people have said: \u201cInstagram? Yeah! Let me just post pretty pictures everyday and I will create a following easily!\u201d \u201cFacebook page? Yeah! Let me just update it everyday with pictures, funny links and shit and I will get more likes!\u201d \u201cBlog? Let me just write some list post and it should go viral, just like that other website which keeps going viral.\u201d \u201cQuora? It\u2019s only a matter of answering random questions and linking back to my squeeze page!\u201d Nah. What you need is CONSISTENCY. Work EVERYDAY. Be consistent. Do it because you know it\u2019s important. If you\u2019re passionate, it\u2019s that easier because you love it that much more. Be consistent, and eventually you will get there. I personally write here on Quora everyday. Heck, I am on holiday now and I writing this shit out in my hotel room. . You need to add real value In which you give out content to truly help people. Look at my answers. Love it or hate it, I write them from the heart and I know it helps people. Value, art and quality are all subjective indeed. You need not care what others think of your work, especially if they\u2019re haters, but as said, you need to be consistent. You need to be honest. You SHOULD be passionate too. A newbie doesn\u2019t add real value. The newbie effect is always making them think like, \u201cI am just applying this because I read about it online. The results should come too because I read that it works.\u201d And when it doesn\u2019t work, they give up. That\u2019s the thing about business. Heck, that the\u2019s thing about life: If you are just working to expect some tangible result, you\u2019re in for a huge disappointment. The successful people in life have insane clarity of who they are and what they want. That drives the shit out of them to do work with passion, honesty and consistency. That is how you don\u2019t give up. . You SHOULD have passion I decided to create a point on passion. Noticed I said SHOULD have passion. I will not say you must have passion, like a bunch of people out there like to advocate. Straight up man, passion is a fucking overrated idea today. Passion is not the magical fart from a unicorn\u2019s ass that is going to solve all your damn problems. Passion is, at its essence, a feeling. And feelings fade. You\u2019re bound to feel tired and shit. If you always feeling \u2018high\u2019 everyday supposedly from passion, I suspect that you\u2019re on drugs then. But passion is that awesome because it\u2019s a fundamental aspect of you, your life and your business. It can drive you over the long-term. It lets you, be you. It\u2019s hence best to create a business based on your passion, but don\u2019t expect it to be an inspirational ride where you\u2019re happy everyday. I use Quora as a way of marketing because I fucking love to write. So many people have told me like, dude you should be on YouTube or Instagram. That\u2019s so popular today and it\u2019s trendy! I don\u2019t give a fuck how popular it is. I am not a picture or video guy. To do that would make me create crappy content and people will see through it. If I give out shit, then there\u2019s no way I will stand out, much less succeed in business. So that\u2019s it! How do you make money on Quora? Come here. Write real, valuable shit. Link back to your free book or whatever. Build that database/asset. Send them cool shit to buy. Sounds easy. But not done easily. Consistency man. Consistency! Good luck. And of course, here\u2019s me doing the work right here baby: Get my free book, 12 Things Happy People Don\u2019t Give a Fuck About! ",

            "answer_text": "To make money from Quora you need to... Solve other people's problems! Here's How It Works Say you are a website developer and you help people fix issues with their website for a fee. In order to find people with issues, you need to go to the categories related to your topic. It's where your potential client hangs out. However, you can't get people by being overly promotional in your answer. What you can do is start a blog related to your topic. Search Quora for problems that have commercial value. The question must be popular and ideally has large followers. Create a blog post, a very useful one at that to answer the question. Once that's done, return to Quora then start answering the question. Your goal is to provide enough value within your answer. Then give hint there's more to learn if they want to go one step further. All they have to do is visit your link. One the website make sure there's an opt-in form to capture their emails. Anyone who visited from Quora is very targeted people which will respond to your content more than your average visitors. Find Popular Questions With Problems to Solve You can also make money by selling affiliate offers from your website. Go to ClickBank or any other affiliate website and find a product that solves a particular problem or teaches people something. For example, you want to teach people how to get traffic to their blog, look for the exact product that teaches people to get traffic. Create a blog post how that product helped you or other people. You can't skip this. If you can talk from your own personal experience, it's even better. Go to Quora, find popular questions that are highly relevant to your blog post. If you can't find one, you can ask the question yourself. The ask one of your friends, to answer the questions. Of course, you are the one who wrote the answers! Includes your links within your answer. It's absolutely crucial your answer doesn't appear promotional. Rinse and repeat for other products Conclusion Whatever you do, the key is to be very helpful with your answer. The good news is, there's no need to re-invent the wheel. Just copy whatever works, rinse and repeat. I\u2019m aware the second one may not be the best way to make money if you are answering your own question but for many reason. But you never know until you try (not that I\u2019ve tried it!) While I won't guarantee that you will make money, getting some targeted visitors to your blog or website will definitely improve your chance of making money from Quora. Just remember, to make money, you need to solve other people's problem. That\u2019s my friend you you can use Quora to make money. ",

Let us understand. What is really Quora Partner Program?How does it work?Quora Partner Program is a by invitation only programwhere Quora invites authors and other people to ask interesting questions.

Well, the question arises what really people want. What matters to you?? Knowledge or Money?? As far as I know, the purpose of Quora is as follows: \u201c Quora is a platform for acquiring knowledge through the medium of Questions and Answers. \u201c So, rather than asking these. You should focus on acquiring knowledge. It will definitely help you. But people are behind money, is the reason why they are asking questions. As far as my knowledge is concerned, Quora Partner Program is invite-only. You can't apply to join it, you just need to use the site and get invited. People who are invited can't invite other people as of yet, I don't know if they'll add referrals or anything in the future. Well, as I know, There is no limit to the money you can make from the Quora partner program. That's the first question in their FAQ, and it's plainly stated. As long as you can ask questions that meet their minimum standards and get answers that meet their quality bar, you'll get paid. You should try to follow certain rules that will definitely help you to get invitation by QPP. They are as follows: The content of your Question and answer must be Original.You should ask Questions and Answers regularly.Don't write for impress but to express your thoughts.You should be decent in your words.You should be the active member of the Quora.Don't write for views or uovotes.Hope, this will really help you. If you try to follow this, you will definitely get invitation. \u201c God sees the truth, But waits. \u201c ",

            "answer_text": "Today I will bare open all tricks I have used to make money from Quora for my startup and myself, and I can tell you this, the number is in 7 digits (INR) during the past 18 months. Beginning this answer with a Quote - \u201cMoney flows in the direction of value\u201d When I started writing on Quora, making money was never my intention. I was very desperate to find good ways to market my startup. There are different ways in which I have been able to monetize, some by intent and some by accident. This answer entails all my experience from marketing on Quora and otherwise.   Method 1 - Writing answers that add value 8 months and 52 answers later, Nothing happened. There was no movement, none at all. I was losing patience and almost on the verge of quitting when one of my answers took off. Like really took off. I was ecstatic with the response. Never had I witnessed 1000 views, this one was 1000 upvotes and climbing. Something I had not expected was the huge number of enquiries that started pouring in from people who were looking for gifts, the majority coming from Quora. I kept writing, and slowly with time, we saw an increase in the number of website visitors coming from Quora. The following image is a snapshot from my Google Analytics dashboard, all the spikes you see are some of my Quora answers performing really well.  Here\u2019s what I learned - People are curious - How many times have you checked someone\u2019s profile because their answer really impressed you?People will trust you - Readers who visit your website/profile after reading your answer will tend to trust youPeople will take action - If you or your business offers a solution that appeals to the web visitor\u2019s problems, they will be willing to make a purchaseI am happy to share that we have helped 724+ Quorans find gifts for their loved ones for occasions like weddings, anniversaries, birthdays and more. We also had the opportunity to work with some very popular brands because someone in their team would read my answers, and later approach us to craft gifts for their teams, clients, and leads,  Add value, and opportunities and money will follow.  Method 2 - Quora ADs Writing answers, and all is good, but the process was slow and very dependent on variable factors. It was however established, that Quorans were more likely to try out something new when it came to gifting. I just needed to figure out how to run and optimize Quora ADs. Although we were advertising on Facebook, Instagram and Google, I thought I\u2019d give Quora ADs a shot and dedicated a test budget of $100. I kept optimizing the campaigns, and with time I saw great returns on the investment. $800 worth of advertising has resulted in sales worth over $12,200 and counting. I cannot share the duration during which this was spent, but I hope this gives you a fair idea.  Something I learned too late in my startup journey - \u201cYou need to spend money to make money\u201d  Method 3 - Consultation Projects 151 answers, and 2 million content views later, I received a very unique email. The founder of a company wanted my help in devising a strategy for her business. I have always loved brainstorming on marketing ideas, and I thought this would be a good mental exercise. 3 months later, they saw some incredible results, I was surprised when I was paid for this. I never asked for it, but it felt really good when this happened. With time, several other opportunities knocked doors and since then I have helped 12 brands and 4 freelancers build optimized Quora strategies. The money that I have made from my consulting projects goes in Paying for my Education loan EMI, which was earlier paid for by dadInvesting some money in SIP every monthBuying Health and Life insurance Method 4 - Quora Partner Program Quora rewards users for asking questions, and Quorans are paid a certain proportion of the money generated by advertising shown for the respective question. Our favorite Sean has been kind to share his earnings from the program -  Although I haven\u2019t been able to make much using the Partner Program, there are a bunch of Quorans who are being handsomely paid.  I will end this answer with the quote - \u201cMoney flows in the direction of value\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "TL;DR \"Yes\" Is Quora profitable? \"No\", says Marc Bodnick, and he should know. But I can't help myself going to the other end of the scale. Yes. Profit comes about when you have income, and you have costs, then you subtract one from the other. A venture is called \"profitable\" when the figure is positive. Quora (product) has only had costs, and no income. This gives a negative profit figure, which is why Marc tells us there's no profit. But hang on. We forgot one thing.  Enter stage left, the heroes of the story... Assets! Assets are things that consist of money or can be exchanged for money, and every company has some of them - even Quora! Quora has a brand which has value. It has a .com with 3.8 million visits a day. It has a ton of information (Intellectual Property) that has value. All of these things have value, therefore are Assets, and I would have thought they more than compensate for Quora's costs. So now we have profit, right? Ah, no. What's that sound?  Smoke and trapdoors reveal the villain... Liquidity! Booh! Just when we thought the hero had saved the day and our Maiden in Distress (sorry Marc, that's you for the purposes of this analogy!) had been rescued and lived happily ever after, along comes the Villain with a curve ball we didn't see coming. Assets have to be Liquid to turn up on the balance sheet! Huh? Even though Quora has assets (things with value), that value is only worth as much as people are willing to pay for it. In other words, we need to value it and shift it. If an asset can't be easily and quickly turned into money, it's not Liquid, and therefore can't show up in our profit equation. These assets are called Fixed assets. The fixed asset is like the rich old auntie in every Charles Dickens (author) story that doesn't release her riches until the very last page! More booh! But that's not all bad. While Quora might not be profitable, it might still be Valuable. Value is a measure of the total assets (liquid and fixed) against Liabilities (money we spent or owe). Therefore Quora is extremely valuable as eventually it could be sold for far more money than anyone invested in it! Hoorah! So there is a happy ending.  People are leaving their seats and heading home. But there's an epilogue. Stick around for this won't you? There's a big secret even our Maiden might not have fully appreciated. Quora members are liquid assets. Shhhh. (Image Credits: Batman and Robin - Public domain; Villain - J.J. at the English Language WikiPedia; The End, From Animal Tales, by Feodor Rojankovsky, 1944.)

            "answer_text": "Quora stands out of social media \"crowd\" because the user is the one who starts the conversation, and businesses respond to the query. No annoyance, no interruption. It is also quite personal since you have to fill in information like your job title or education to be treated as an expert. From a marketer's standpoint, you can get valuable information about prospects just from their profiles. Also, the simple \"question and answer\" form makes it gain more and more popularity. In just one last year, Quora monthly users grew from 400 to 500 million.  Another benefit of Quora is that Google and Bing show its answers in the results pages. 75% of Quora's traffic comes from search engines. Moreover, Google displays the best-ranked Quora answers related to the search query in featured snippets. In this way, your advice (and brand mention) may reach a bigger audience. GAME PLAN FRO QUORA: Optimize your profile. A profile is vital because it's what users see first before reading your answer. So make sure your bio and picture help to build trust. Pick an image that would present you as a smart and friendly professional, include outstanding accomplishments in the outline. Besides that, add your professional expertise and company name in the Credentials & Highlights section and indicate a list of \"Know About\" topics.Target the right questions. Most of the traffic to Quora comes from search engines - Google in particular. You should do the research and lookup for questions containing the right keywords targeting a specific search query related to your product. It doesn't even matter if the question is an old one. It's the position on Google that matters. If this question is well-ranked on SERP, your reply will attract more views. Also, when a new answer is added to a question, people who follow it (or the topic) will get that question highlighted in their feeds.Craft your answers. Apply all the attention to writing genuinely relevant answers. If your answers are helping and providing value for the audience, you will get more people trusting your authority and your business brand. Provide long-form comprehensive answers to get them ranked better on Quora. Mind your links, insert them only when it is appropriate and necessary. If your answer is stuffed with keywords and links, it will instill no trust and earn no upvotes. It can even bring big\" L\" to your Quora marketing. If Quora moderators consider your answers spammy and notice any violation, your account will be banned.Provide valuable and transparent answers, plus avoid \u201cdirty tricks\u201d - that\u2019s how it works! Good luck\ud83c\udfaf ",

            "answer_text": "People ask me that almost every day, so I created Tips for Quora Partners to explain how I, and others, manage to achieve good earnings and create high quality content. Tips was originally a blog, but it has now been converted into a Quora Space. New Spaces require an activation authorization from Quora, and while I wait for that, I can\u2019t add new content, but there is plenty there to read in the mean time. I can share one thing right now. A lot of people who work for the Partner Program and who struggle to earn fail because of self-inflicted wounds, mostly due to not reading and comprehending the contents of the blog thoroughly. Many people also fail to read the instructions that Quora provides. People write to me all the time asking for trouble-shooting help, and while many requests are quite reasonable, and I\u2019m happy to answer, many also reveal difficulty in following instructions. Of course, I have a responsibility to make Tips clear and easy to understand, but be assured I do my best. I always welcome suggestions. There are cases where the program is simply not a good match for an individual\u2019s talents. But the majority of people can succeed in the program to at least a reasonable degree, like making an extra $50\u2013100/week, if they are willing to do the required learning. Some people can do substantially better. I think now is an exciting time to be in the program, and that it is about to improve in important and exciting ways. I am seeing progress toward fixing various problems that have made the program less enjoyable. I feel very upbeat. But everyone should know that it takes time to master the program, and even then, I myself am always learning and improving even as I near my one year anniversary. When Tips becomes active again, there will be plenty of exciting new content and guidance, but it won\u2019t be sufficient on its own\u2014it\u2019s still necessary to read the existing material. Always remember that the program is not a slot machine, nor a goldmine. It is a serious job with a lot of hidden responsibilities and demands. It\u2019s not for everyone, and for the people who do best and write the best content, it is often a labor of love. Anyone who wants to follow Tips should watch my personal profile for updates about when it re-activates. ",

            "answer_text": "This is an uphill battle, for a few reasons. First, and most directly, Quora has decided to financially support the question askers, rather than the question answerers. Spellcheck says that isn\u2019t a word, but let\u2019s press onwards. To me, this makes very little sense, and I would have loved to be a fly on the wall in that meeting. What moron proposed that idea? I\u2019ve been here for three months and change, and even I can see QPP has been a huge flop. Ask yourself: Is there a shortage of questions on this site?Or is there a shortage of high quality answers?I would argue that it is without a doubt the second one-or at least, the site would benefit from having more of the latter rather than the former. I get 30-50+ questions a day. Most are unanswerable because they are so asinine. \u201cWhich gyms and workout facilities have the best New Year\u2019s sign up specials/discounts in Houston, Katy, Pearland, Woodlands, Midtown, and League City areas?\u201d That\u2019s a real question I got today. Someone is potentially getting paid to ask that! If you incentivize something, you get more of it-quality and lack thereof. Why they decided to incentivize more questions is utterly beyond me. There\u2019s no shortage of questions. Most questions I see have 10\u201320 answers, and 90% are garbage. Total refuse. Either short-perhaps 5\u201320 words-or just wrong. Or cancerous on the eyes. There\u2019s no shortage of bad answers. Do you think people will keep coming to Quora when this is the status quo? Readers don\u2019t care how many answers there are. They certainly don\u2019t care how many questions there are. They are here for great writing. Second, they are quite strict with people linking off-platform. You can grow your Instagram or website (check my bio, I don\u2019t have the balls to link it directly in this post haha) through here, but it is quite slow. If I get 100,000 views on an answer with a push off platform, I might get 20\u201350 followers. Gotta love that .05% conversion rate. People just won\u2019t click-which is understandable, but it makes it difficult to make money. Third, you cannot put referral links in a post. I kind of get this one-as to a certain extent it does take away from the writing. It just sucks working with a company, telling them that you get millions of views, but later having to tell them that they\u2019re going to see none of that traffic, because you don\u2019t want to get banned. One of the reasons that Instagram IS growing while Quora is\u2026maybe growing?\u2026is that Instagram actually supports it\u2019s content creators-or at least gets out of the way and lets them do their thing. Fourth, your followers do not see what you post in many circumstances. Following someone on Quora is NOT the same as on other social media platforms. Your feed is NOT made up of who you are following. It\u2019s made up of whatever Quora decides your feed should be-and recently, that\u2019s mostly advertisements. As a content creator, this means that the content that I produce is viewed far less by the people that matter to me-my followers-than on other platforms. Fifth, moderation policy. It\u2019s worse and worse, and constantly having to defend my answers from jealous people downvoting them is time that could be better spent growing my business-or writing. It\u2019s heavyhanded and I know plenty of great writers who have left because of it. Some come back. Sixth, people want advice for free. They are on Quora for free information, you are writing on Quora, and so they just see you as an extension of that-not as a person or as a professional. They don\u2019t realize that you have living costs and time is the most precious commodity out there. And often\u2026I do give advice for free. Hundreds of times. Maybe thousands by this point. But this question isn\u2019t about that-it\u2019s about how to make money. I have written training and diet plans for people-which is picking up. I\u2019ve also had people just send money via PayPal because they enjoyed my answers and had a big enough heart to go out of their way to show appreciation, but that type of generosity is quite rare. Bottom line? Quora will do what is best for Quora, NOT Quoraans, even if long term it is platform suicide. If you intend to support yourself on Quora, keep in mind that it\u2019s a lot more difficult than you think. It\u2019s a jumping off point\u2026  \u2026and it\u2019s a long leap to success.

For example, a company looking to compete with Uber might ask, \u201cWhat are Uber\u2019s biggest flaws?\u201d Maybe a company that was recently a victim of a hack sponsors the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best cybersecurity software for a 200-person company?\u201d Ideally, this incentivizes the experts and closet geniuses to come out of the woodwork and blow the minds of CEOs everywhere with their unique insights. Just like with all questions on Quora, answers to these sponsored questions are completely public, so everyone benefits \u2014 not just the sponsor. The Quora answer ranking system \u2013 upvotes and downvotes \u2013 still applies. When the company sponsoring the question chooses the winning answer, whoever wrote it has the option of keeping the money or donating it to charity (right now the two options are Stand Up To Cancer and GiveDirectly).  Now that is pretty awesome. People\u2026helping people (companies)\u2026helping people. One big concern Hopefully this changes moving forward, but as of now sponsors who put up the money and pick the winners are able to remain anonymous. Why, Quora? This makes zero sense. What\u2019s stopping Marlboro from anonymously sponsoring the question, \u201cIs smoking really that bad for your health?\u201d and making the answer that says \u201cNo\u201d the winner? What\u2019s stopping me from anonymously sponsoring, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best startup conference in the entire universe?!\u201d and selecting \u201cHustle Con, duh!\u201d as the winner? I could even create a separate Quora profile and write that answer myself, could I not? Marc Bodnick, who leads Quora\u2019s business team, is aware that anonymity has killed plenty of apps, but vows to \u201cremain vigilant to ensure you can trust Quora to keep Knowledge Prizes clean, even if you don\u2019t know who\u2019s funding them.\u201d Or just let people know who\u2019s funding them\u2026? Go home, Marc, you\u2019re drunk. This could be a game-changer Aside from this whole anonymity nonsense, I think this is a genius idea. The internet is full of answers and ideas, but so much knowledge remains offline, locked in our own heads. Now, Quora\u2019s giving people the incentive they might need to share that knowledge. Plus, even if the money aspect were to be removed, this is still a product that caters directly to the type of person who frequents the site. How so? Well, Quora users \u2013 up to this point at least \u2013 have not been driven by a potential financial reward. Rather, they\u2019ve been motivated by the desire to publicly share their insights and genuinely help a person \u2013 or people. Now that companies will essentially be saying \u201cthis is important to us\u201d anytime they decide to sponsor a question, those same users are going to be even more motivated. Just imagine having the potential to genuinely help your favorite company. Lyft needs help scaling? I love Lyft! Let\u2019s see if my knowledge in this area can help them. That\u2019s an awesome feeling, whether or not you\u2019re selected as the winner. Is this going to replace consulting? Of course not. I was exaggerating. Can you actually get rich off of this? Not unless you\u2019re writing next-level answers at the same rate that the dude on the left is getting buckets:  But could it help create a \u201cmicro-consulting\u201d industry for the future? Absolutely. Knowledge Prizes is still in beta, but here are a handful of sponsored questions you can answer today: What technological changes will create the most opportunities for new startups over the next 2-3 years?What does Twitter need to do to restart growth and reactivate its massive dormant user base?Will Slack succeed with large enterprises?Go get that money.

            "answer_text": " DISCLAIMERI have made money thanks to Quora. However, PLEASE read these disclaimers, warnings & important bits first. NEVER ADVERTISE EXPLICITLYI have NEVER advertised myself or my services explicitly. I\u2019ve never sent people spammy messages or unsolicited messages asking them to subscribe to me or my services. I have received messages from people advertising their services. But I haven\u2019t resorted to this strategy.NEVER MISLEAD PEOPLEI have NEVER misled people by telling them false statements about me or my background.TELL THE TRUTHI have let people EXPLICITLY know up front that I am on Quora to promote my brand and not for charitable causes (i.e. to help or change the world for free). And how do I do this? By encouraging them to ask me questions, by sharing my Quora answers on their Social Media & by asking their friends to follow me on Quora (if they loved my answers).SELFLESS SERVICEI have always answered all questions without any indication that people should pay me or subscribe to any of my social media platforms.STATE YOUR TERMS & CONDITIONSI have been very truthful about saying that I prefer they ask me Questions on Quora as that builds my online credibility and brand. However, if anyone still insists that they want my services on a ONE-TO-ONE basis where they want me to talk to them for one hour or write them an email of 1,000 words with a strategy, solution or guidance - that is chargeable.QUORA RULES ARE PARAMOUNTPlease ensure you NEVER break any rules of Quora. Please read and re-read the rules of Quora so that you do not get flagged for a violation.ILLEGAL STUFF = NO!DO NOT sell, offer or provide anything that is illegal or not allowed.WHEN IN DOUBT - ASKIf in doubt - please contact the Quora Moderation TeamSo how did I earn money on Quora? I spend 8 hours to 16 hours answering questions on QuoraI ensure every question I answer I give truly my best contentSome of the questions I spend even 3 days just to research and answer. That\u2019s what it takes to produce my quality 3,000 - 8,000 word answers.Each answer I write - is 100% complete and authentic. I never hold anything information back in my answers.I always ensure I follow the BNBR policy. (I did make many mistakes in the past)I always ensure I ignore rude commentsI always ensure I block or report trolls or abusive members.The ONLY and ONLY explicit advertisement I have - is in my bio section, I make sure my bio is detailed containing all the honest information about my business and my lifeI share my personal phone number and also my private email addressFor those people who send me email requests or phone requests to provide them more time, more service and more expertise - I inform them that:1) I prefer that they ask me the question on Quora which I will do it FOR FREE2) And if the are happy with my service - to talk about me to their friends3) However, One-To-One services - is a Premium service which I charge for4) And if they are still interested in my One-To-One Premium Services - it a chargeable service.I always encourage people to opt for the FREE service - which is asking me a Question on Quora with my name \u2018Loy Machedo\u2019 on it. And once they have asked me the question - to send me the link - which is where I answer it. The only drawback of this strategy is that only me and this user gets to see the answer - no one else as it is user specific.If however, users STILL insist that they want Privacy, Secrecy, Attention, My Personal Time, Effort, Space & Expertise - I guide them to website where they are able to see the list of options I offer. Here they can choose what they want.There are some people who ask me for a FREE service. And if I feel they have good connections - I give them a $500 service for FREE in exchange for a referral.DRAWBACKS OF THIS STRATEGY LONG JOURNEYIt has been 5 months since I joined Quora and I have answered 3,000 answers. And on an average day - I spend 8 to 16 hours on Quora per day - while every other alternate day - I spend on my other Social Media Platforms. So my conversion rate is 1 good customer for every 3,000 answers. So not an easy task!TOUGH STATISTICSThe conversion rate to get $25 (my minimum rate) is 1 good customer after connecting with nearly 1,000 people on Quora.TIME + MONEY + EFFORT = FREEIt is very very very time consuming. Sometimes my day starts at 2am writing answers on Quora. So while others are sleeping - I am busy working. And all this - for FREE on Quora.THE HORRIBLE SIDE OF FAMEI get spammed heavily both on my phone & email by trolls, trouble makers and especially children. If you are popular - you will receive at least 100 emails, messages & texts from trouble makers. You will not believe how horrible it is to clean up your inbox and phone. I wake up in the morning to nearly 1,000+ notifications!SOME PEOPLE NEVER UNDERSTANDMajority of the users even after informing them the terms & conditions STILL ask for FREE by sharing their sad storiesMISUSING YOUR TRUSTPeople have shared my details online to groups stating I am a prostitute looking for sex and fun. And some of them call you from fake numbers and then threaten you or waste your time with nonsense.UNNECESSARY ENEMIESYou will make more enemies than friends as everyone will expect you to give them FREE content and FREE help - especially since you give FREE answers online. And on top of that - they will be rude and obnoxious with you.IT IS ALL ABOUT LUCKIt is all about luck. You can go on for 3 months and not have a single inquiry.END OF THE DAY - THE BIGGEST SHOCKERThe possibility and probability of a popular Quoran losing his account is exceptionally high. You can lose your account and everything you have worked for - by just one small mistake.FINAL THOUGHTSSo before you do decide to opt for a strategy on Quora, in Summary keep this in mind: It has been 5 long months since I joined Quora.I\u2019ve written quality answers to 3,000 questions on QuoraOut of the 1,000+ emails, messages & texts I have received per day, I have made sure that I answered the relevant ones - which I have to dedicate one entire day to.Focusing on Quora led to a decline and elimination of my other online activitiesI am still learning how to use QuoraI am still doing my best to contribute MORE than what I receiveIt has not been an easy ride.You have to be exceptionally focused, dedicated, obsessed, committed and explicit about your strategy. That involves telling people the truth openly. And this can make you very unpopular.Many users have unsubscribed from me or even trolled me for the simple reason that I was honest enough to let them know I am on Quora to promote my brand. For some strange and funny reason some people believe that everyone on Quora should be there giving world-class content and hours and hours of work - for free.However, the focus should NOT be to be loved by the whole world but by the few who are willing to accept that you are a professional and if they want more (Your Personal and Professional Time, Effort & Expertise) they should go through your private channel.End of the day the Universal truth is this - All the Professionals like myself who are online and who make money online - take this job very seriously with ethics, morals and standards. And if we were to violate these standards - we simply cannot survive. There are no shortcuts to making money - no \u201cget-rich-quick\u201d easy schemes. If you want to succeed - you have to FIRST GIVE VALUE IN ORDER TO GET VALUE. Ultimately this is the reason and only reason professionals like me have survived, thrived and succeeded.Hope this helps.
