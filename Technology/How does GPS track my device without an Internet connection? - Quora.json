            "answer_text": "GPS Satellite constellation consists of 24 satellites positioned in six earth-centered orbital planes with four operation satellites and a spare satellite slot in each orbital plane that send out radio beacons to devices that can receive and process them. Based on the time of beacon reception and position of the satellites (downloaded almanac data) the device determines its own position relative to planet Earth. In Theory only three satellites are actually required in order to give a rough position. The technology is basically signal strength measurement and some basic trigonometry. There is no communication back to GPS satellites from your phone. Google Maps has a feature called geocaching. It automatically determines the most frequented areas and caches the map images locally on the device. Your position on the map is updated by computing the above mentioned position of the data and its signal strength. And IoT is M2M on steroids. More about that latter. ",

            "answer_text": "Your phone isn't just a hand held computer. It also has a little known capacity for sending and receiving messages. Now, imagine you are in the middle of a field with a person that runs 1m/s constantly, let him be named beep. You also have 4 friends with very good watches, style points so the way. Let them be known as North, south, b East and West. You send beep to North, then south, then East, then West. From the time it takes for him to get to then then back to you, you can work out where you are on any sized field. Isn't that neat. Your phone does this with em waves so the speed they run at is the speed of light. The earth is a ducking sphere so instead of sending the message to 4 friends on known positions on earth, you use satalites in geostationary orbits (constantly above\u200b the same bit of ground and orbit the earth at the same speed that the earth rotates) ",
