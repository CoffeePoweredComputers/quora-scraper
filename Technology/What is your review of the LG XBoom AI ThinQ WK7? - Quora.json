            "answer_text": "This product marks the company\u2019s first step into the ever-growing smart speaker market. And the company has managed to have things going right for itself with this product. Let\u2019s look into the features of the LG BOOM AI Thinq WK7 to get a clearer picture and understanding of this smart speaker. Before we begin, let\u2019s get over the most important part. The price of the XBoom AI ThinQ Wk7 is capped at Rs. 17,999 IN India. The BOOM AI Thinq WK7 comes in the normative cylindrical shape. If you had to understand the size of this speaker, it would be easier to compare the size of the same with some other speaker such as the Amazon Echo 2. It is bigger, chunkier than the amazon, however it is less chunky than the Apple HomePod. The design of the speaker is relatively simpler than other smart speakers than are available in the markets. It has a simple, very uncluttered look to it. The top part of the speaker features touch-sensitive controls for volume and playback, and it also houses the touch-sensitive Google Assistant button. Along with these, the top part also has a button for the user to swap between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections.  According to company claims, WK7 is the first smart speaker to use the Android Things platform, which, again according to claims will boost the user experience and allow developers to make the most of the platform\u2019s competencies. A key thing to note is that it falls under the company\u2019s brand of AI products, and is powered by Google Assistant. The speaker also comes with built-in Chromecast. One of the second firsts for LG is that it teamed up with Meridian- the world\u2019s leading high-resolution audio brand for clearer, more balanced sound for the users to experience and enjoy. LG also brings what it calls the Clear Vocal and Enhanced Bass. This is to make the sound more prominent and boost the level and impact of bass frequencies. Considering the fact that this is the first time for the company into the smart speaker segment, they fared very well and there is no doubt about it. While we still wouldn\u2019t call it the world-leading smart speaker, however, it surely is on its way. ",

            "answer_text": "Smart speakers are becoming quite the product choice this year for manufacturers and brands. Numerous companies have recently released their own Smart speakers. Honestly speaking consumers at this point have a lot more options with Smart Speakers than they did a couple of years ago. LG also decided to join this consumer demand and launched their first smart speaker - the LG XBoom AI ThinQ WK7. It has a price tag of around 28k.  Specifications and features of the LG XBoom AI ThinQ WK7 It comes in a cylindrical body and its dimensions are 135*210.7*135 mm.The speaker grille wraps it all around the cylindrical shape in 360 degreeThis speaker is supposedly the first speaker to have Google\u2019s new Android Things platform integrated within it. This will allow users to ask Google for information, place calls as well as control other smart devices around the house.The top surface of the speaker carries the volume and function button. The latter connects the device to Wifi and bluetooth.There is also a button for the microphone on the upper side.The bottom of the speaker has a micro USB charging port.It comes with in-built Google Assistant, Chromecast and Meridian technology. These are some of the specs of this new LG smart speaker. The highlight of this device will obviously be the inclusion of the Google Android Things platforms but it also comes with decent features in other aspects as well. My review is positive with the LG XBoom AI ThinQ WK7. It has a sturdy built which is much needed in our chaotic lives, impressive sound quality and good bluetooth strength as well. The fact that it can also control other Smart Home devices is an added benefit. I would recommend this to users who are looking for an upgrade in their home smart service aspects.
