            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to address this from a largely cultural standpoint, because aside from implementation and maintenance costs, there aren\u2019t any real downsides to industrial IT. I\u2019ll keep it short because they are related:Pros Ever easier access to ever increasing amounts of information.A person with a smartphone has access to the collected knowledge of the human race in the palm of their hand. Even 30 years ago you\u2019d\u2019ve been deemed a bit mad to suggest such a thing was possible. This is largely a pro because people become more educated over time, which leads to regions on Earth becoming more oriented on Freedom and Democracy than in previous ages. Cons It\u2019s almost a full time job to separate the real facts and the factoids, demagoguery, and spin that are made up to get \u201cclicks\u201d or advance an agenda.It\u2019s very easy to get into \u201cinformation overload\u201d mode where using at your device is more important than interacting with house guests, family, and sometimes even walking down the street.The internet has the same problem radio had for the longest while, basically up until The War of the Worlds in 1938. Everything that was said on it was assumed to be true, mostly because of reinforcement bias. The news was on the magic talking box and it was factual, so everything that came out of it must be factual and truthful as well. Because of this, and humanity\u2019s basic characteristic that we don\u2019t question things that follow our beliefs as thoroughly as things that don\u2019t, it\u2019s very important and very difficult to get a clear picture of what is truthful and factual. Secondly, and we see this with the current generation of teenagers who cluster in groups as teenagers do and then stare at their phones for hours instead of joking and being social. Nevermind the expansion of texting whole conversations over minutes or hours instead making a 2 minute phone call and actually TALKING to the other person. Some other people might have more to add, but them\u2019s the basics. I would point out that the pros and cons are largely humanity\u2019s reaction to the tech than the tech itself. IT is a tool, like a hammer, it\u2019s only as dangerous or helpful as the intentions of the person using it. ",

            "answer_text": "Advantage: Information Technology powered by artificial intelligence makes life easier and increases productivity through break-through innovations. Here\u2019s a crazy example I\u2019ve imagined since the advent of self-driving cars: Imagine working a double shift (two jobs) and not having to worry about veering off the road because you are extremely tired. With your self-driving car technology, all you would need is a sleeping bag and the ability to \u201cmutter your destination\u201d to the navigation system. Disadvantage: We all are eventually going to be out of jobs. From mundane to eccentric tasks, nothing seems to be out of reach for AI. Even worse, we just maybe building an army that takes out the human race. I know this is a little extreme, but realistically, with all of our interconnected devices, a lot of things could go bunkers through the tweaking of a simple line of code.
