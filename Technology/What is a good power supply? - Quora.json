            "answer_text": "The question is spectacularly vague, but it does give me the chance to tell you about the best power supply I ever saw. Back in the 1970s I used to design TTL based computing systems. One of them was for fuel dispensing on filling stations, and it needed around 1200A at 9V (there was a 5V regulator on each PCB for the TTL levels). TTL is spectacularly power hungry. After several false starts we found that Farnell in Leeds would make us an \u201celectronic\u201d power supply - actually a primary switcher - based on their standard modules, and the cheapest option was the 1700A 9V unit. This worked out at half the cost of unregulated bridge rectifier supplies of similar output, because there was only one transformer, not a whole bunch of them. So that was a good power supply. I got called out to a breakdown at a sales exhibition once. The displays were flickering. Everything worked, but the displays were flickering. I got there and the 9V supply was 7.8V, The local 5 regulators for the TTL boards were just about coping, but the ones on the display board - the display was incandescent tubes and drew a lot of power - were right on the edge and occasionally shutting down. Thinking that the power supply needed adjusting up for some bizzare reason I opened it up. And found that there was an M10 bolt wedged across the output terminals, going some very interesting colours. I measured the current on the input. A bit of simple maths showed that there was something like 4000A on the output. That 1700A 9V power supply was still able to get up to 7.8V at 4000A. Without any component failures. A power supply that can sustain a voltage across an M10 bolt is undoubtedly a good power supply I removed the bolt, and everything went back to normal, and it worked for several years thereafter until the exhibition system was scrapped. I went back to the office and wrote to Farnell telling them that they had built a very good power supply indeed. ",

            "answer_text": "The Sun is a pretty good one, I think. Hydro electric power Dams, but to build one would require a lot of environmental impact studies. Nuclear, but how to deal with the spent rods? Natural gas, not bad, not bad, for now. Coal, dirty polluter and you have to rip up the land to get at it. Wind, a very PC solution these days but you\u2019d have to have millions of windmills to make a decent dent. Ocean waves? There\u2019s been some promising technology developed but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being done yet. ",
