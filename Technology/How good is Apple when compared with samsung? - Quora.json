            "answer_text": "I don't think what the question assumes is right Yes I agree apple was once that company were customers waited days in queues just to get hold of their product before anyone does.(even today but the level has come down drastically) The innovations and their perfections in minute things bought them their reputation.But i think after steve jobs , the company shifted its focus to other sectors and decided to monitise their reputation. I FEEL they are more reserved when it comes to implementing new technologies in their products but still when they do it they make sure they are the best at it. Now coming to samsung , right from galaxy s6 Samsung's flagships almost ticks all the essentials of a smartphone ,getting listed in best android phones every year.Adding to this their note lineup is explosive in shattering the market with stunning displays and camera performance with glass baked design ( Remember note 7 sry note friends ). To justify my point why apple isnt all that great ,let's take camera performance, though apple had headstart in everything they couldn't stop samsung from blasting out Dxomark scores. I sympathize on apples philosophy on optimising everything but what good does it do when you have age old hardware to optimise .The facetime front facing camera literally sucked until apple stepped up its mega pixel.( I too know megapixel doesn't mean great pictures nor scores ).What I said is to my knowledge average picture of how it was for the past 5 years. Let's talk display, all of you must of heard about infinity display right and apples retina display Apple was and is still adamant from changing 1080p to QHD display whereas samsung really rocks with awesome crispy pleasurable displays.okay steve jobs did say it's impossible to distinguish more than 440dpi for a naked human eye but really? Common its 2017,Keep QHD display and LCD 1080p display of apple side by side and my bet is that you would definitely know the difference. Apart from that we pay 700\u2013800$ and 1080p resolution is unacceptable whatever be the quality of the panel that we get.(I raised concerns about iphone 8 ,8plus and not about the iphone x ) So there's really this trend with apple that they never boast about their hardware instead advertise on what their ecosystem is capable of provinding,thats a plus point to mention about apple , in android every mid -premium range flagships have identical specs and the smartphone market is saturating , to differentiate from others what a company must do is improve its product line to provide better experience rather than just focusing on beasty hardware. In os segment apple has its ios which is really great on how well it's implemented with their hardware.samsung also has its tizen os but isn't ready taking risks using it in flagships ,they aren't to be blamed we users have fixated android as default operating system.And apple you can't just go around saying how well you drafted efficient ios, ios is optimised accepted because you use Swift program developed from scratch to program ios which makes it efficient. But android runs on emulator based on java and the developers need to look into the aspect of wider adaptation with different manufactures hardware so they just can't make hardware specific codes .To overcome this google has brought up its pixel lineup which represents android at its best .It's matter of years before android starts dominating the elite market where apple has dominant market share . Apple really needs some new innovative product lineups to continue its legacy where jobs left it. From my current knowledge and present product line up I would say samsung is better than apple . ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s compare few aspects of Samsung and Apple flagship phones and you can decide for yourself. It all depends on whether the product satisfies your day to day needs and whether you can afford to buy it. OS Updates - Apple is the undisputed leader in this aspect; it pushes OS updates for phones that are even four/five years old. The update might ruin/slow down the older phones but still Apple should be appreciated for pushing updates for such old phones. Samsung pushed one OS update for the current flagship with significant delays and the OS update is either delayed further or there is no update at all for the second year. Smooth Operation - Apple ensures OS and hardware integrate properly and runs smoothly. Samsung isn\u2019t the owner of Android but it has to commit to integration of hardware and software and most Samsung phones are slower than Nexus phones which cost at least $150 lesser. Stock OS - Apple runs on stock OS and optimizes iOS for every phone that is supported. Samsung puts in loads and loads of features/skins on top of stock Android and while the hardware could be superior to iPhone and can run Android better; the skins do slow the phone down to a large extent. Camera - Samsung S7 has the camera that excels in smartphone photography and can instantly focus and take awesome low light photographs. iPhone isn\u2019t far behind but takes extra time to focus and doesn\u2019t have excellent low light photography as the S7 (this of course excludes the camera of iPhone 7 Plus which isn\u2019t reviewed thoroughly yet). An average user wouldn\u2019t see much of a difference between the two though unless using both side by side. Variety - Apple just focuses on the top end but Samsung covers phones ranging from entry level to flagships. It\u2019s just that Apple is focused on premium products. Product Range - While we have just seen smartphone comparisons so far Samsung does manufacture a variety of products ranging from smartphone displays to TVs, batteries to full fledged PCs, home appliances; Apple just sticks to iPods, iPads, iPhones, Macs, Apple TV, etc. Price - Samsung has entry level products in all segments and can cost very less but Apple has only high end products which cost a premium.Samsung might give someone a smartphone experience at less than one tenth of the cost of iPhone; not everyone can afford an iPhone or Apple product though. Manufacturing - Samsung can manufacture everything it needs to build a product but Apple has to outsource it to Fox Conn. Apple also depends on Samsung for processors and displays for iPhone, etc. ",
