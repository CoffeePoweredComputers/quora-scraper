            "answer_text": "You probably shouldn\u2019t ask me but I\u2019m up for a challenge! :) If you\u2019re looking for business ideas, look no farther than your own mind. Expose yourself to as much knowledge and learning from reading and experience. Look for your opportunities while going about your day to day. One thing to look for is this. If you find yourself ever saying \u201cthere has to be a better way\u201d about something, then write that idea down. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good idea, but it\u2019s an idea and you should look at it for a few minutes to determine whether or not there may be the kernel of a business or product in that idea. Back to your question. Starting a new tech site. That could be just about anything. Many people are seeking to be the next great thing, which is great, if you have a truly new and unique idea. If you do, then build that idea in a site and market it. Many other ideas may not be as profound or earth shattering as the next Amazon, Google, Facebook, Instagram, et al but they could still make you some money which could then be the springboard for your next idea. In the end, I don\u2019t have any suggestions for a new tech site. But I suspect that you do, or will soon as you approach the world with an inquisitive mind , asking, how can I make this better? ",

            "answer_text": "I would recommend following points Develop your website using latest technologies like react.js or angular 4, sass, node.js or firebase.Website should be well designed and take care of its responsivenessWork on SEOAvoid using wordpress, it will be slow once your data increase and not scalable at allDo test your website before going live, to avoid any bugs to end usersIf you are going to hire freelancers, hire a team. Dont hire two different freelancers and make them work together. It wont work and make your job to manage quite difficult.If you are a developer, use already developed frameworks like antd react etc it will make your development alot fasterPrepare complete requirement document and wireframes before looking for any one to work on your project. It will save alot of your and developers time.Once you have website, be prepared to do market it on social platforms by yourselfAlways go for .com domain nameIf any other points comes in my mind, will add more.
