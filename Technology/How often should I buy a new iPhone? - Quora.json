            "answer_text": "You should learn to use Android unless you like paying 1100 dollars plus per phone . My One plus 5T only costed me 600 dollars with shipping included.You only really need to replace your smartphone when it breaks. Although when it falls out of support and can no longer handle the latest operating system. 2\u20133 years is when most people replace their phone. I would never use an iPhone personally because it's way to limited in more ways than one.You are restricted and can't use certain apps like Kodi and Mobdro without jailbreaking. On Android you can decide what to install including non market non approved apps. You can use custom kernels and operating systems. This is only optional but on Android you can still get the latest operating system and patches on non supported phones this way. You don't need to use the operating system that came with the phone. If you subscribe to Apple music you can now use iTunes on Android.Apple let's you update outdated phones but it will make the phone lag and be unusable at a certain point when the phone becomes unable to handle it. At least the Android vendors stop forcing it down.Apple was forcing their ota down and thus messing up your battery planned obsolecence. This was called battery gate.Iphone no longer supports headphone jacks. With Android each model is different and which models support it vary from phone to phone. Some models support removable storage and batteries. If the model you choose doesn't make sure to buy the phone with enough battery and storage in the beginning. If you want your phone to really be yours and control everything in it choose Android. If you don't mind your rights and privileges to your own device taken from you you can sick with apple.If you don't mind then charging ridiculous prices and not even including the latest screen technology also. Apple is an insult to my intelligence and not being in their prison walled garden I will never desire to be.Apple is pathetic. They just released dual SIM support this year in XS Max. One plus has had dual SIM support since one plus one. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. No stranger on Quora knows you better than you. It\u2019s not up to us to tell you when to buy a new phone, and you should be able to figure this out for yourself: you buy a new iPhone when you either want or need a new iPhone. It really isn\u2019t any harder than that. How do you know when you need a new iPhone? You will know you need a new iPhone when something goes wrong with your old iPhone. If nothing goes wrong with your old iPhone, you may decide it\u2019s time to get a new iPhone when the battery life gets bad enough to bother you. Of course, you could just get a new battery for your iPhone for about $80, which would be a lot cheaper than a new iPhone. You may also decide you need a new iPhone when things seem to happen a lot slower than they used to. This typically happens when either storage gets too full (which you might remedy by getting rid of stuff), or when the new features in the current version of iOS simply are overwhelming the processor in the older phone. But only you can decide when you think that is happening. Everyone\u2019s tolerance for that is different. In terms of just wanting a new iPhone, only you can make that determination. ",
