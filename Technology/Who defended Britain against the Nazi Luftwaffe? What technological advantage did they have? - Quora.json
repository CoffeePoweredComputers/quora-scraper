            "answer_text": "The Royal Air Force defended against the Luftwaffe. They had fighter aircraft what were compareable to the German fighters of the time, and they had the advantage of an air defence system that utilized radar, sound and visual reports and regional fighter controllers. The Spitfire was the equal to the Messerschmit BF109 and the Hawker Hurricane as a terrific bomber buster. The Luftwaffe lost 25% of its air fleet over England, some 1900 aircraft and many of their best and experienced pilots as well. In the end. the Luftwaffe had to switch to night bombing because they were losinig so many aircraft. The real secret to the RAF success was the Air Defence System the RAF employed. The had Radar stations, and sound location systems as well as visual spotters on the ground. All this information was passed to a master station and then was passed to regional centres which dispatched the fighters in their control. Even if the Germans did manage to knock out one or two radar stations, it really didn\u2019t make that much of a difference, the RAF Air Defence System used other methods as well. ",

            "answer_text": "The Royal Air Force defended Britain from the German Luftwaffe. So did many other including Air Raid Wardens, the Royal Observer Corp, the Home Guard and others. The technological advantage that they had over the Luftwaffe was radar. It gave advance warning of incoming air raids. The warnings gave enough time for fighters to get into the air to intercept the bombers, if it was decided that the situation warranted it. This was the first time in the war that the Luftwaffe had face organised opposition. Eventually, it appeared to the average Luftwaffe air crew that every time they went on a raid that there would be the Spitfires and Hurricanes of the RAF waiting for them so morale amongst the Luftwaffe did suffer.
