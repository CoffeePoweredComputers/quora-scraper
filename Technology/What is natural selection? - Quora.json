            "answer_text": "It is essential to understand natural selection because it is a critical component to understanding evolution. Natural selection is when a species or population changes over time to their advantage in their environment [1]. In nature there are four different selection types, each favoring specific populations by their phenotypes.  1. Stabilizing SelectionThis type of selection chooses the \"intermediate forms\" and eliminates the extreme forms within a population.  Ex: Human babies that are 6-8 pounds have a higher likelihood of survival as opposed to smaller and larger babies. Babies that are 5 pounds or less tend to be more susceptible to infectious diseases, and babies bigger than 9 pounds are too big to exit the vaginal canal resulting in pain or death for the mother during childbirth. [1] [2]    Premature Baby [3]    Healthy Baby [4]    Larger Baby [5]  2. Directional Selection\"One phenotype replaces another in the gene pool\" due to environmental pressures [1].  Ex: Before the industrial revolution the peppered moth population in London was roughly 98% white and 2% black. Because of the light colored trees, the phenotypes for light traits were more favorable for the white moths until smoke and soot was introduced in their environment due to the industrial revolution. The newly darkened environment allowed predators to easily find the moths with lighter traits which caused their numbers to decline. It became easier for the black moths to survive and reproduce thereby increasing their population. By 1900 the black peppered moth population rose to 95% of the total peppered moth population. [2]    Peppered Moths [6]  3. Disruptive SelectionThis is the opposite of stabilizing selection where the extreme traits are more favorable than the intermediate trait. Disruptive selection may lead to speciation or the formation of two species coming from one common ancestor.  Ex: Lets say there's an environment where there is dark soil but white rocks and is colonized by mice with two different fur variations; black fur and white fur. Mice with white fur will be camouflaged on the lightly colored rocks and will stay in that part of the environment. If a black mouse were to enter this part of the environment, then they will be easily found and eaten by predators and vice-versa for a white mouse in dark soil. [1]    Black and White Mice [7] And finally..... 4. Sexual Selection This form of selection benefits populations in terms of reproduction. Phenotypical traits are selected specifically for acquiring a mate.  Ex: Male peacocks who have larger tail feathers are able to attract peahens more easily than peacocks with smaller tail feathers.

            "answer_text": "Natural Selection is effectively the differential reproductive success of individuals.  Certain phenotypes have different fitnesses in a given environment, and natural selection is the process by which these fitnesses determine the \"winners\".  The \"winners\" will have better reproductive success, and their traits (phenotypes) will be preferentially transmitted to the next generation. Perhaps to make an attempt at an analogy, think about natural selection like you choosing your favorite color.  This favorite color is the preferred trait, the trait that is being selected for, and you will select for it in, say, clothes.  Many of your clothing items will have this color, and if you ever decide that your favorite color is something different, your wardrobe will become more and more dominated by that favorite color, and you get the idea. The problem with that analogy is that the trait that is selected for is not \"chosen\" per se.  You do not \"choose\" that a longer beak on a Galapagos finch will confer a feeding advantage.  Rather, it happens that in a specific environment (some of the Galapagos Islands, but not others) a longer beak will help the finch feed more easily, and thus live longer, having more chance to reproduce. For the most part, traits that are naturally selected for confer a reproductive advantage in one way or another, even in species that do not sexually reproduce. To rephrase all of this, Natural Selection is the differential reproductive success of individuals due to advantages conferred by a trait, and the increased occurrence of the trait over time (more individuals in later generations which have that trait).
