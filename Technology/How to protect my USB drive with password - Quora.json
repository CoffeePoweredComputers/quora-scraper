            "answer_text": "There are different approaches you can take to password protect a USB drive. You can choose to encrypt the entire USB drive or password protect specific folders or files on the USB drive. Here are the easiest ways to password protect or encrypt files and folders on a USB flash drive. Method 1. Encrypt USB Drive by WINRAR With the WINRAR software, you can compile the contents of your USB drive and encrypt them in a password-protected folder. WINRAR is a piece of software that allows you to compress files and also encrypt them. Files encrypted with WINRAR have the extension \u2018.rar\u2019. Step 1 Download WINRAR Step 2 Prepare the files to encrypt Plug your USB flash drive to your computer and decide on the files or folders you want to secure. If you want to password-protect all the files in your USB drive, it is a good idea to put them all into one folder, and then encrypt the folder.  Step 3 Encrypt the prepared folder Once all your files are now in a single folder, right-click the folder and select \u2018Add to archive\u2019.  A pop-up window will be displayed. In the \u2018General\u2019 tab, you can set a new name for the encrypted folder from the \u2018Archive name\u2019 textbox. Select \u2018RAR\u2019 as the archive format and click \u2018Set password\u2019. A pop-up window will be displayed. Enter your desired password in the textbox and reenter it in the verification box. Click on the checkbox that says \u2018Encrypt file names\u2019, then click \u2018OK\u2019. An archive file with the \u2018.rar\u2019 file extension will be created. This is your encrypted data. Method 2. Password Protect Individual Data on a USB Drive You may choose to password-protect only individual files on your USB drive and not an entire folder. If your file is a Word document or any other Microsoft Office file, you can set up password protection for the file right inside Microsoft Word or the file\u2019s corresponding Microsoft application.  To password protect a Word document, open the file in Microsoft Word and click \u2018File\u2019. On the \u2018Info\u2019 tab, you\u2019ll see the option to \u2018Protect Document\u2019. Click the option and select \u2018Encrypt with Password\u2019. You can follow this procedure for other Microsoft office files. Method 3. Use Rohos Mini Drive to Encrypt a Part of the USB Rohos Mini Drive is a tool that you can use to create a secret encrypted container of your files on your USB drive. Step 1 Download Rohos Mini Step 2 Navigate to your USB drive Once installed to your PC, click the Rohos Mini icon to run the program. A window will be displayed. Click \u2018Encrypt USB drive\u2019. A pop-up window will be displayed. Click on \u2018Change\u2019 and scroll to select your USB drive.  Step 3 Enter a password Once your USB drive has been identified by the program, two textboxes will be displayed. Enter a new password to your secret partition in the displayed text boxes, then reenter the password to verify it. Click \u2018Create a disk\u2019 to begin the encryption. You\u2019ll get a display message once the encrypted partition has been successfully created and you can start adding files to the password-protected portion of your USB drive. Method 4. Use BitLocker to Encrypt the Whole Drive BitLocker is a Microsoft program and it is available to Windows users. Once you encrypt your USB drive with BitLocker, your data is secured and can only be accessed with a valid password. To get started with password-protecting your USB stick with BitLocker, read-through and follow the easy steps outlined below.  An easy way to determine if BitLocker is installed on your Windows operating system is to type \u2018BitLocker\u2019 in your Window\u2019s search bar. If you get a display window that says \u2018Manage BitLocker\u2019, that means you have BitLocker installed in your computer. Step 2 Plug your USB stick Plug your USB stick to your computer and ensure that your system recognizes it. Step 3 Turn on BitLocker From the search bar, search for BitLocker, and from the results click \u2018Manage BitLocker\u2019. Once you are in the BitLocker encryption window, head over to the tab \u2018Removable data drives - BitLocker To Go\u2019 at the bottom of the page and browse through to find your plugged-in USB drive. Once you see your plugged-in USB drive, enable BitLocker for your USB drive by clicking \u2018Turn on BitLocker\u2019.  Step 4 Set password Once BitLocker is turned on, you\u2019ll receive a prompt to choose how to unlock your USB drive. To password-protect your USB stick using BitLocker, you should select \u2018Use password to unlock the drive\u2019 from the prompt displayed. Enter your desired password in the textbox provided and reenter it for verification. Ensure you don\u2019t forget your password. Step 5 Encrypt your USB drive Once you have verified your password, a prompt will be displayed asking you to choose how much of your drive you want to encrypt. ",
