            "answer_text": "Not very different. Early TV wasn't really much of a game changer. We didn't go from No TV to Game of Thrones. There was a long transition period in between where people started to work out how to use the medium and whether it was even worth spending money on.  TV wasn't considered a sure fire hit when it was first launched.  Early TV was nicknamed \"Radio with pictures\" mainly because programming involved taking what worked on radio and putting it on the TV. Budgets weren't large because viewership wasn't huge enough to warrant massive sponsorship. There wasn't a feeling that those who didn't have TV were missing out on a massive cultural revolution. This feeling was compounded by the fact that the introduction of TV coincided with the outbreak of World War Two which interrupted its development for a number of years. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I'm sure there wasn't much of a change at first, but once the television became popar, more and more families tended to keep to themselves as they were encouraged to stay home and watch television. Then the television programming and advertisements taught people that children could be distracted by TV instead of out and about getting into trouble. The television had only given more reason for people to stay indoors, now look at modern life... Many kids stare at the tv all day and when the working parent(s) come home, they also watch the television to relax. (Sorry I couldn't be more informative, but this is all I know for certain). ",
