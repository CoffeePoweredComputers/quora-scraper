            "answer_text": "Yes. Absolutely. Wouldn\u2019t think twice. 5G cellular is a consumer scam. 5G, believe it or not, is not about your phone having better, or faster internet. Putting 5G in phones is about reducing the 4G presence on the 5G networks so that devices like smart cars can talk to each other at low latency, high speed. In such a way, when once smart car needs to apply the brakes, all the smart cars behind it will know the brakes are being applied before the brake lights even come on. It\u2019s about smart enabling all types of devices throughout the neighborhood. And the biggest, dirtiest secret about 5G, is that range is horrible. Once you are on 5G, to achieve those high speed, you have to be on the highest frequency networks, giving you around 200 feet range from the tower, with the fastest of those speed being within feet of the tower. The infrastructure for such technology is not available, and like my never be rolled out in the next 5 years. The only place such technology exists are in the small pilot test areas of a few metropolis networks. When absolutely everyone is off 4G, and migrated to 5G, speeds will improve slightly. This commercial is mostly right.. technically not wrong, but slightly deceiving \u2014 the T-Mobile 5G runs on 600MHz, but their 4G already runs on 800MHz, so only slightly better reach in-doors. And the cost of which is much slower bandwidth, with less active users per area until performance is impacted. The speed capability of 60MHz 5G is actually less than 800 MHz used for 4G. The goal from T-Mobile appears to be convert users, then convert the band space.  5G networks, with no users on them, perform only about 50% faster than 4G on a theoretical maximum performance network. Once you flood the spectrum with more users, speeds go down. Here's the Real Truth About Verizon's 5G Network Then there is the health issue. The towers may be too far from your body to have any radiation that can hurt you, but the other end of that is on your phone, right next to your face. The higher frequency 5G is being challenged by many for their health risks, partial because of the fear of the unknown, and partially because of the logical conclusion of what happens when you pump so many electromagnetic particles at such a high frequency, and with so much power as to make it functional.. you are going to put this device in you pocket, or next to you head, and we have not yet actually performed any sort of real scientific tests to determine if they really are as dangerous as some extremists claim. And finally there is timing\u2026 by the time all this gets sorted out, it won\u2019t matter if the iPhone 12 has 5G, they won\u2019t even exist anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi.. I\u2019m kinda confused with this one\u2026 The iphone doesn\u2019t work that way. The cellular phones never worked that way\u20264G and 5G are the current wireless services being provided by the various communications giants\u2026Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T, etc\u2026 Its possible some apps will not work correctly, if you are in an area, not being served by 5G. The iphones will access the services being offered, by these wireless providers, with the apps you have programmed into the phone. You and your friends share and enjoy the wireless services being offered, being offered thru the phone, but the services are not being originated by the phone. I hope this helps..the iPhone 12 will probably have a better OLED, maybe a size a weight change, and maybe better Pixel camera\u2026I really don\u2019t know\u2026usually the iphone makes changes to appease, what the consumer is wanting at the time\u2026 I still have a Star Trek phone, working with 4G, and I am happy with what I have. Good Luck Dave ",
