            "answer_text": "Kotlin is for sure better than Java in many ways if you compare programming syntax related, logic implementation, loops and more\u2026 I am also a Android Developer, but after Kotlin i got to know the code which tooks about and hours of time and with thousands of lines and its complexity in Java it tooks only minutes and simple to do in Kotlin If you are familier with javascript and simple programming languages Kotlin would not be tough for you to learn\u2026. you can research on the web and can simply compare both Java and Kotlin. What I recommend you is just go for Kotlin it is very simple and while you are learning Kotlin you can simply convert your Java files to Kotlin without higher knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "It is easier to switch from Java to Kotlin.Kotlin includes smart extension functions to help developers build clean APIs.It has null in its type system. Nullability problems are a common pain point in Java. Since Android often uses null to represent the absence of a value. Kotlin solves it by placing null directly in its type system.Kotlin is more concise than Java. It means fewer opportunities for errors.Adopting Kotlin does not cost anything.Kotlin is compatible with all Java libraries and frameworks, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and can be integrated with Grade or Maven build systems.",
