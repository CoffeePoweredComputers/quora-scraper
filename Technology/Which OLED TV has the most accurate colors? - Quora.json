            "answer_text": "The most accurate OLED TV is a calibrated one. Straight out of the box, it is unlikely to be anywhere near what is possible with any particular TV, OLED of not. Of course, the colour of the room and any extraneous light also affect your perception of the colours on the TV. Even if you have fixed all these factors, once you are looking at an over-the-air transmission, you are doomed. The transmission will most likely not be accurate due to signal compression. I once tried a rough calibration of my cheap TV. My wife pronounced it too dark, as she prefers viewing in a lit room. Who am I to argue, as few thing actually are worth paying full attention to the cinematography. ",
