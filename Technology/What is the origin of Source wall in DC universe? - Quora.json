            "answer_text": "The origin of the Source Wall wasn\u2019t really clear until recently. Krona, an Oan scientist, created a machine which would allow him to take a peek during the moment of creation. In doing so, he saw a hand depositing the \u201cspeck\u201d that would create the entire cosmos. His machine exploded at that instant which somehow destroyed his universe, shattering it into multiple universes, creating the multiverse we know, but this isn\u2019t the first multiverse.  We now know that the \u201chand\u201d which Krona saw belongs to Perpetua, the mother of the Anti-Monitor, Monitor, and World Forger. She is responsible for the creation of the first multiverse. Now before we go further, we have to understand who is at the top of the cosmic order in the DC Multiverse. It\u2019s the Source. Some may say Presence which may be just the same thing or an aspect of the Source or vice versa. In reality, the Source represents the collective consciousness of all the authors of the DC Multiverse in the real world including Jerry Siegel, the author of Superman and also the guy who created the character, the Presence. The Source is the spring from which all life sprang forth and is all the energy that is and ever will be in the DC Multiverse.  Over 20 billion years ago, the Source created the \u201cSuper Celestials\u201d which includes Perpetua, whose purpose was to create multiverses. To moderate the Super Celestials, the Source had also created \u201cJudges\u201d who would judge each iteration of the multiverse and destroy it if it was deemed inadequate. This is analogous to Marvel comics where the \u201cJudge\u201d is the Living Tribunal and the Source is the Fulcrum, Super Celestials are Celestials, and the Presence is the One Above All. Perpetua had three sons: Monitor (function is to prevent crisis and oversee development of civilizations) Anti-Monitor (function is to keep the boundaries of creation devoid of life) World Forger (function is to create life). Perpetua didn\u2019t want to take the chance of facing cosmic judgment, losing her own children to be erased by the Source if her multiverse was deemed unworthy. She was really just being a protective mother. So she took matters into her own hands and in order to defeat the Judges, her Siblings, and even the Source itself, Perpetua devised a plan where she would use the seven hidden energies of creation - Speed Force, Still Force, Life Force, Death Force, Sage Force, Strength Force, and the Invisible Emotional Spectrum (Ultraviolet) and create a large army that nobody would be able to stop. The Monitor found out and told his brothers who did not want to be destroyed by the Source for their mother\u2019s actions. Hence, the Monitor used a Cosmic Tuning Fork to tell the Judges of the Source what his mother was up to. As soon as Perpetua found out that her sons betrayed her, she used her army to attack them, but one of the judges - The Raptor, defeated her entire army and then created the Source Wall to imprison her along with six of the seven forces (excluding Speed Force).  The Source Wall separated the known DC Multiverse from the Source. Due to the creation of the Source Wall, the Anti-Monitor had no real purpose anymore since the Source Wall separated life from the anti-matter universe ensuring it would already be devoid of life. Hence, the Anti-Monitor didn\u2019t have anything to do for eternity which caused him to be angry at his brother, the Monitor who gets to observe the rise and fall of civilization, which is less boring. This is why the Anti-Monitor became evil.  Note there are 52 universes shown in this map but originally, there were actually an infinite number of parallel universes. During Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Anti-Monitor destroyed most of them, leaving only one. That one reality was too unstable so it split into 52 parallel universes, each vibrating at a different frequency. This started the New 52. There's also only 1 source wall that occupies the same space in all universes but with different frequencies. The space between universes is called \u201cBleed\u201d and travel between universes weakens the Source Wall each time which is why the Monitors don\u2019t like it.  Later on, the DC heroes use Element X or the tenth metal to break an opening in the Source Wall. This leads to the jailers of Perpetua, the Omega Titans (Mystery, Entropy, Wisdom and Wonder), to awaken. The Omega Titans fail to repair the Source Wall and Perpetua eventually destroys the entire wall. She is freed now but weakened after destroying the wall. This also caused breaking of the Force Barrier which now gives access to the rest of the seven Forces, not just Speed. Also, all of Perpetua\u2019s siblings (Super Celestials), might come and punish the DC Heroes for breaking the Source Wall and freeing Perpetua. ",
