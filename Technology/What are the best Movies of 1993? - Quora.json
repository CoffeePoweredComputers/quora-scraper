            "answer_text": "  True Romance it has to be for me, with most of my other favorites already mentioned in the answers.  The back story of the movie itself is interesting, Tony Scott the director, meets a video store clerk in 1992, who offers him 2 scripts, there was one which he wanted to direct and he kept that to himself.  The video store clerk was a certain Quentin Tarantino and that movie was Reservoir Dogs.   Actually Tony Scott was pretty much an A List director by then with Top Gun, Days of Thunder but compared to his brother Ridley Scott, he was seen as more of a studio hack, good for making summer blockbusters, while his brother was doing stuff like Alien, Blade Runner.  In fact many critics, to date credit Tarantino for the script, more than Scott's direction. Quite unfair, IMO, as Scott adapted it well to screen, though making changes from the original. This was the most unlikely Tony Scott movie ever, closer to Tarantino, Ritchie, and that is why I often credit him for not following the beaten studio path. Be it the \"Sicilians spawned by Niggers\" monologue or the staccato, rapid fire dialoge, the free use of profanity or the rather raw, violent action, the movie in many ways bears the Tarantino influence.  The movie takes the traditional romance and turns it upside down, the hero Clarence( Christian Slater) is a gauche, clumsy guy whose idea of a date with a female is a Donny Chibba triple feature. The heroine Alabama( Patricia Arquette) is an eccentric, nutty hooker, often living in her own world.  Basically it is the oddball couple that makes True Romance such a great movie, the chemistry between them is fabulous.   And then you have the whole bunch of whacked out characters    Gary Oldman as Alabama's nasty pimp.   Dennis Hopper as the hero's Dad, his scene with Christopher Walken is pure gold.   \"I am the anti Christ, you got me in a vendetta kind of mood\"- Christopher Walken as the gangster Vincenzo Cocotti.   Michael Rapaport as a wannabe Hollywood star.   And Brad Pitt as a worthless junkie. If not for anything, I would rate this as one of my favorites, just due to this scene.   ",

            "answer_text": "Dazed and Confused by Richard Linklater  The first time I saw this movie, it was randomly on cable and I decided to watch it not knowing what is was about. The opening scene, with \u201cSweet Emotion\u201d playing, lightly introduces almost every major character doing their thing whether that be smoking cigs and weed, rolling joints, playing cards/dice and talking to girls. Its the last day of school of the year and everyone is ready to party. It immediately became one of my favorite opening scenes for a film. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrtQ5ulOcKY (I could not upload the intro scene and this link says the video is unavailable for some reason but its on youtube if you would like to watch it.) Dazed and Confused does not have a concrete plot but that is another reason why its so appealing. It is just a bunch of high schoolers doing what they do at the start of summer vacation with no responsibilities. I did not grow up in the 70s, but regardless this movie does bring nostalgic feelings to me, especially the drinking and partying in the neighborhood woods. The soundtrack is perfectly used throughout the film and it helps create the fun and easy going atmosphere the movie presents. This movie also introduced many young actors that would go on to having very successful movie careers. Ben Affleck, Jason London, Anthony Rapp, Adam Goldberg, Milla Jovovich, Cole Hauser, Matthew McConaughey, Joey Lauren Adams, Parker Posey, Rory Cochrane There are so many quality characters depicted in this movie. Each one is crucial to the movies appeal and almost everyone goes through a journey of their own. You got the jock football players  Nerds who go out of their comfort zone to try and have a fun night  Stoners (But basically every character smokes weed)  Incoming freshman  Haze loving upperclass students   And last but not least, the older guy (Matthew McConaughey as Wooderson) who still preys on and hangs with the high schoolers  ",
