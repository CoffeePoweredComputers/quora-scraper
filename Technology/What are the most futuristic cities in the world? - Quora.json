            "answer_text": "I'd say Hong Kong would rate pretty highly, if not the most technology infused city on the planet.  I've been to a plenty of high-tech places including Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore, San Francisco, Shanghai, Seattle, and many others but I don't think any of them quite match-up to Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, your cellphone is possibly the most valuable thing you can have with you.  There are so many hidden walkways, tunnels, stores, alleys and the like that even Google Maps can confuse you because you'll never know if you'd need to go on the overpass or street level to reach your destination.  It's one of the cities where I actually need to read Internet forums on the streets just to get where I'm going.  With that said, it's totally navigable even when you don't speak a lick of Mandarin/Cantonese. You also probably would find almost everyone glued to their screen in Hong Kong.  This is not specific to Hong Kong, but possibly because Hong Kong is more densely populated, I get the impression that more people are glued to the screen compared to the other cities.  Also, perhaps because your view is obstructed by concrete most of the time, I can understand the urge to look at the screen, which is way more interesting than the view once you get used to the city. In comparison, cities like the 'technologically advanced' San Francisco is way more down to Earth on street level.  Having lived there for about four years, I never got the 'high-tech' impression other than everyone has a yelp sticker and the billboards on bus stops are interactive.  Which might seem 'high-tech' for people who have never been to any other high-tech cities but if that's the measure of high-tech then Bali is high-tech.  No, seriously, go to Kuta beach and you can pretty much find everything that exists in San Francisco including a Bubba Gump restaurant. Singapore is the same case as San Francisco.  I've also lived there for a full year but it's really Hong Kong-lite.  I survived there without a smartphone and their biggest tech place is probably the CBD, which doesn't hold a candle to Hong Kong's Mong Kok, Tsim Tsa Tsui, Causeway Bay, or Central.  It's also a city where I find that you can only find the charm once you have removed yourself from technology.  I've walked aimlessly in Singapore a lot and sometimes I'm surprised at usual sights like their Botanical Garden, which I accidentally stumbled onto when walking from Orchard, also passing the ultra-cool, 1984-esque US embassy there.  Before this, I had been to the Botanical Garden once while on a city tour but discovering it by myself was one of the greatest discoveries I've ever made in any city. Tokyo and Seoul, I can't really say much because though I've navigated through both cities and rode on their respective subway systems, I haven't really been able to go to most of the places.  That said, from observing the people there, I'd say they're slightly-above Singapore level tech-wise.  Tokyo and Seoul are also easily navigable without a cellphone, as I didn't have coverage there outside of Wi-Fis, I was still able to go to most places.  Tokyo for one, is pretty high-tech and probably would be very close to Hong Kong level.  But the people seem to be more aware of their surroundings more and seem to be less glued to their phones.  Kind of understandable because pedestrian traffic in Tokyo is among the craziest in the world. Shanghai is a new city, you can see all sorts of crazy buildings there.  Tech wise though, I can't say because I've only really traveled around by car there.  It felt more like Beijing though or any other Chinese cities like Shenzen, Xiamen, etc. rather than high-tech.  Hope I don't offend anybody but the people there seem to be more 'traditional' as in, they're like everyone else in the less cutting-edge cities like Seattle for example.  Seattle is also a fun city because I've found real family values there than any other places I've been to.  Some say that Seattle is high-tech because of Microsoft or Boeing but I didn't have the impression that people are really glued to their phones there, at least not to Asia's level. Last city I'll mention in-depth here is Vancouver, the Canadian one.  Vancouver BC, at first glance, is futuristic because of clean lines and skyscrapers you see when you cross that bridge into downtown.  But, this is exactly the same view you'll get if you go into San Francisco from the Bay Bridge.  Also, like San Francisco, people there are more down to Earth on street level, everyone has yelp or something stickers, and the buses are way better than MUNI.  It's WAY paler in comparison to Singapore tech-wise.  Vancouver BC is a bigger San Francisco and most everything is similar, including their society-tech integration. All in all, I've always said to people that Asian cities are literally in the future and not just time difference wise.  So far, I think that claim is still valid, as I visit more and more places in both hemispheres.  I believe that in order for a city to be futuristic, it's not just the technology they have that matters.  Their fascination, dependence, and integration to them matter more. Which is why no European cities are mentioned here.  Sure, I've been to London, Paris, Brussels, Frankfurt, Munich, Rome, etc. but though they all have the technology, they don't seem to be almost half-cyborgs like East Asians are.  Likewise, this is the case in Dubai, Qatar, and other middle-eastern cities.  Their cities can look as futuristic as possible but as long as their people don't seem to be integrated to tech as much, they'll always be at San Francisco level at most to me. ",

            "answer_text": "A futuristic city would be judged on several factors. First and primarily would be the \u201clook\u201d of the architecture. Then the comfort, efficiency and advanced functions of that particular city. So, according to these criteria: #1. Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Unquestionably the most futuristic looking city on Earth. #2. Shanghai, China #3. London, England #4. Las Vegas, Nevada. Which definitely resembles a \u201cfuturistic\u201d night-time Adult Amusement Park. You simply have to see it at night. #5. Seoul, South Korea. There are many other cities in the world that have many futuristic elements. However, overall, they all tend to look like various versions of New York City. One would expect New York City to have the world\u2019s most exciting architecture, However, due to the 8 year delay in American architectural construction that began in 2008; no regular city in the US actually has the overall \u201clook\u201d of the future. Moreover, New York, a former icon of city architecture, appears to have become far too conservative to build what should be the most exciting architecture of our times. America has definitely removed itself as the great urban innovator. ",
