            "answer_text": "This is a great question because home automation is a very fast moving sector of the economy and I think that we are at the beginning of the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in home automation. A controller is a hub that co-ordinates and controls all of the smart devices in a home or office that use the \u201csame language\u201d or protocol and then allows them to connect to the Internet via our Wi-Fi router. Two of the most popular languages have been Z Wave and Zigbee. A controller looks much like our Wi-Fi routers although generally they are a bit smaller. Now, if you had asked this question a few years ago, without a doubt, many people would have responded to your question by chatting about Wink and SmartThings. And so, to partially answer your question, I would say that up until the last couple of years, the most common controllers were almost certainly Wink or SmartThings. These two companies make two of the biggest selling smart hubs or controllers that were controlled via a free app that you downloaded onto your phone or your tablet. And these apps provided a user with a phenomenal level of control over individual devices or groups of devices. They were, and still are, in many instances great pieces of software. They were very easy and intuitive to use because we could control them completely via our touch screens and as we know from our friends\u2019 constant interaction with their smartphones, touch is a much more user friendly way of interaction than the older model of using a keyboard and mouse! The next big thing that I am referring to is \u201cvoice control\u201d. Earlier, I said that using a touch screen is much easier than using a keyboard and mouse. Well, using your voice is even easier and faster than touch. The biggest series of devices in this new \u201cvoice control\u201d market are the Amazon Echos. These are interactive speakers with a built in speakers and microphone. Central to this system is a digital assistant or a \u201cvoice\u201d called Alexa. A newer rival in the voice control market to Echo, is Google Home. Home is also an interactive speaker with a digital assistant, called \u201cGoogle Assistant\u201d- yes, catchy I know. These interactive speakers are also becoming smart hubs much like Wink and SmartThings. But, whereas Wink and SmartThings are can only be controlled via an app, an Echo or Google Home can be controlled by using your voice or using an app. This next generation of control is very much in its infancy still because the number of voice commands that you can use to control a device is much more limited than the number of commands that are available by using an app. ",
