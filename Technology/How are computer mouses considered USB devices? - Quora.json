            "answer_text": "I have, in my box of old parts, several mice that connect to the PS/2 mouse port of old computer motherboards. They are not USB devices. I also have mice that have nine-pin RS-232 (serial) connectors. They are not USB devices either. Although I don\u2019t have one, many people use mice that connect to a host computer via Bluetooth radio. These are not USB devices either, albeit the Bluetooth interface, if not built-in, may very well be connected to the computer via USB. USB (Universal Serial Bus) is a general purpose communications port. It allows connecting mass storage devices, human interface devices, and other things. If a mouse happens to have a USB interface, it is a USB device. If it doesn\u2019t, it isn\u2019t. Simple as that. Mice are not in any way special in this regard; the same statement applies to other external peripherals that may or may not use USB for connecting to the host computer: Keyboards, external hard drives, cellular data sticks, memory sticks, sound adapters, UPS (uninterruptible power supply) units, you name it (which is why this interface is called \u201cuniversal\u201d). Many devices use USB because it is a convenient choice for equipment designers and users alike; some don\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "USB stands for Universal Serial Bus. It was deliberately designed to be very general purpose, to allow connection of almost any device you can imagine. But the the first purpose was to replace the mess of ports on the original PC: keyboard, mouse, printer, audio, COM ports, and replace them with a single connection. The use for storage such as thumb drives came later. The mouse and keyboard actually have special sections in the USB standard because they may be needed during booting. The storage section, used by thumb drives, actually borrows an older standard, SCSI. ",
