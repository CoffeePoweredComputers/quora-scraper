            "answer_text": "The Micromax is about to instantly release the three modern smartphones next month, and the same is confirmed by the company's official Twitter handle. It has launched its previous smartphone named iOne Note with premium features at a reasonable price of Rs. 8199/- in October 2019. And before, N11 and N12 mobile phone in 2018 with much hype. The rise of Micromax can be a reason for the active anti-China movement in India after the galwan land issue. Micromax has not disclosed whether the company will import the key parts from China like old times or build from scratch. Their tweet mentioned the hashtags #MadebyIndia and #MadeforIndia and by this, I believe they will operate the previous way of selling the Chinese phone with its branding. All 3 smartphones will come under the 10K segment to challenge the Chinese makers and develop a robust presence in the budget category which Micromax was in 2014.  We are about to know its manufacturing, marketing, and selling price next month. Follow me on Quora, blog, and other social media to stay updated on smartphone technology and marketing news. \u200bSourabh Nandwana ",
