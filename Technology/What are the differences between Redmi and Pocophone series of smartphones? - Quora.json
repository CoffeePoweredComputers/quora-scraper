            "answer_text": "Mi Phones Mi phones consist of Xiaomi\u2019s premium smartphones. These devices will usually be slimmer, modern-looking and will always be constructed out of metal to deliver that premium look and feel. They will also pack in the latest hardware and will be the only devices to feature a USB Type-C port. Xiaomi\u2019s current range of Mi devices includes the premium Mi Mix 2, the Mi A2 (the successor to the Mi A1) and the Mi Max 2 (which should hopefully see a successor soon in Mi Max 3). Redmi Phones Redmi phones usually consist of value for money devices from Xiaomi. These are the brand\u2019s bread and butter and usually make up all those big sales figures that you hear about when Xiaomi breaks sales records. Currently, the Redmi range, includes the Redmi Note 5 Pro, the Redmi Note 5, the Redmi 6 Pro, the Redmi 6, Redmi 6A and the Redmi Y2. POCO Last but definitely not the least, is another recently launched sub-brand by Xiaomi called Poco. Poco is a performance-oriented brand that seems to be a successful blend of the Mi and the Redmi lineup. Poco\u2019s first smartphone called the F1, delivers top notch hardware specifications in a well-assembled package that is priced at Rs 20,999. The Poco F1 at launch became the only mid-range device to feature a top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC (usually found in premium smartphones upwards of Rs 35,000) in the Rs 20,000 price range.

            "answer_text": "Xiaomi has two separate brands Redmi & Poco Redmi is the brand which has transitioned itself from a budget oriented brand to now premium brand just like how Mi ( series ) is for Xiaomi i.e Mi 9 & Mi 10, all these are premium offering from Xiaomi. POCO on the other hand is a mid-range premium brand from Xiaomi even though it is now an independent brand. POCO offers flagship performance at much lower cost. eg - POCO F1 Prime example is how OnePlus started it's journey being from the flagship killer offering flagship specs at much lower price to now a Flagship itself. So POCO is a budget Flagship brand where as Redmi is now transitioning into Premium offering too. hope it helps :) ",
