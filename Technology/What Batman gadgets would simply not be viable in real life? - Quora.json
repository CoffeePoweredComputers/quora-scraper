His grappling hook is too small, his batmobile is pretty unrealistic in most incarnations. But seriously: The batarang seems mundane enough but he has several incarnations that are BEYOND RIDICULOUS  On his wall we can see a batarang with a flash bulb and another with a bomb. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s ridiculous. That item he\u2019s revealing? The BATARANG X.  Yup\u2026. he fires it off and rides it through the night. Just\u2026 no\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I find the grappling gun to be ridiculous. Whether it\u2019s the films or the comics, Batman performs feats that would be dangerous to execute, and cause permanent damage to his body. Of course, it\u2019s comic book physics so I ignore it. The other thing is any kind of knockout gas in his utility belt. Medically speaking, you have to know what the target\u2019s weight, health (asthma for example) and other factors) before you can dose someone. Otherwise it\u2019s hit and miss. Recall the Russian rescue operation where they took out people holding hostages in a theater. The Russians gassed everyone then had to administer some sort of countermeasure and hostages still died. What happens when an attorney goes to federal prison? Check out my book about prison life Laughing All the Way to the Bank (Robbery): My Education in Con College. ",
