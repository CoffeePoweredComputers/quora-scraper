            "answer_text": "Rome was invaded by barbarians, they killed off most of the people that knew how to make, do and build things. When you wipe out the government you wipe out schools, universities and learning sites, without these you fall into a dark age. That is what happened. It stayed lost because too many people were just trying to survive. Isaac Newton and other great scholars were from wealthy families, they did not have to scrape to survive, so they could sit, relax and think. Poor people don\u2019t have time to sit under an apple tree and discover gravity, they are too busy eking out a living just trying to survive. When poor people do sit under an apple tree they are thinking about where their next meal is coming from not thinking about the discovery of gravity. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology exists to fulfill a need. Remove the need and there is no reason to keep the technology. Do we need wooden wheelwrights today? In most parts of the world, no, so the technology for making wood carriage wheels is relegated to books. In Roman times, most of the technology in daily use was not registered in books, so when it ceased to be used with the fall of the Empire and reduction of commerce, the knowledge on how a lot of things were done was lost and had to be rediscovered when the need for them resurfaced, with the growth of commerce and population in European countries.
