            "answer_text": "No, archaeological evidence show that they actually lived shorter lives on average. Even by the first century, the average lifespan of a commoner was around fifty years. The biblical accounts of amazingly long lifespans should be read with caution. Throughout biblical \u2018history\u2019, notice that not even one ancestor of the Israelites ever died as a result of war, accident, misadventure or illness, although these were quite common risks in ancient times. But very long lifespans made it easier for tradents to remember the legends they had to pass down orally before they were eventually committed to writing, since there were fewer heroes to remember. Genesis is noted for its use of numerology in defining the lifespans of its heroes, with the magic number 17 being of particular importance. Take the Patriarchs for example: Abraham lived to 175 (5 X 5 X 7)Isaac lived to 180 (6 X 6 X 5)Jacob lived to 147 (7 X 7 X 3)Each lifespan involves a perfect square (5, 6, then 7 in a numeric series),The third factor also forms a series (7, 5, 3)In each case the sum of the factors is 17.Furthering the above formulas, Genesis says Sarah lived to 127 years, which is the sum of these consecutive square numbers plus 17. We can see that is not evidence of long lives, but of numerology. ",

People in Mesopotamia and Egypt were already settling into permanent, agricultural-based societies. Urban areas start springing up: people specialize in particular careers, the wealthy boys go to school, people pay taxes to their kings, and social status in the community becomes more important than where to find food. Our earliest examples of writing systems won't appear for about five hundred years; however, the idea of drawing as a form of communication was there. Metalworking was showing new techniques by now in the form of bronze and tin alloys. This is all localized to the fertile crescent and Indus River Valley, though. Humans had expanded to everywhere on earth except New Zealand, and most areas were still migrating with their food and using stone and wood tools. ",

They lived in little rectangular houses such as those discovered in stone, at Skara Brae. They did hunt as well and had man-high longbows with deadly flint arrowheads. Some of the arrowheads had one long barb for maximum blood loss in the prey. Animals were sheep, cattle and pigs. They made pottery of various types. People built huge long barrows, sometimes with stone chambers, to house the bones of dead Ancestors or dug out bank and ditch ritual monuments which were shortly after filled with cremation pits (the first phase at Stonehenge.) They wore scraped leather skins and furs but by 4500 BC when the big stone circles were going up, they were also weaving. Many also would have had canoes/logboats for river travel. ",

Was their proximity to the Garden of Eden somehow responsible for their wellbeing? Are modern day humans no better than decaying remnants of a once glorious past? Nothing can lead a person to believe there is any truth to this preposterous notion other than an idea. But this is no ordinary idea. We all have ideas. Some we are naturally disposed to cherish, others we ignore with an attitude of indifference and occasionally disdain. The idea that humans lived longer once upon a time appeals to our weaker natures because we love the idea of permanence. When was the last time we had an upsurge of senior citizens, I ask you, sir?

            "answer_text": "At first, when we started to make sense of physics, it was better to work in groups. Unity was a HUGE part of how we evolved. When man first made fire, although small in numbers, the first men were gathering a small group of sticks, and then they started messing with rocks, accidentally coming across some flammable substance, it lit a fire. This was our first understanding of physics. Even before words were made, making eye contact with someone or making a noise was a plea for help, or simply calling at the discovery of something new. Using caves to survive the harsh winters by the fire, they collaborated in tribes to small groups to traverse the terrains for food, going from cave to cave to keep themselves warm by the fire. This is just my take. Those times are more of a simple way of life, led by our first ancestors in utopia working with one another, they flourished better than our economy today. Thats just my take on this question, it sounds accurate, and I could be wrong, but to my honest opinion, I believe this is how we got here. ",

But remember, most children died at a very young age (lowering the average tremendously with each death), women died in childbirth, men died when hunting. But if you survived all that, you could live as long as we do now. (There was one fossil found - sorry, I never saved any link to any article about it, maybe someone else on Quora has one - of a woman who had such severe arthritis in her shoulders that she couldn\u2019t possibly have fed herself for the last 10 years of her life. They estimated her age at death to be in her 70s. 30,000 years ago or so. So life could be long, and people could be kind, even back then.) ",
