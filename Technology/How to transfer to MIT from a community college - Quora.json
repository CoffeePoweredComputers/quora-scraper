            "answer_text": "At the simplest level, getting into MIT is always the same, in practice it is probably slightly harder for a transfer student.  But the criteria are the same,  Tran Nguyen's answer is spot on I will try and reduce it a little. First and foremost MIT admissions needs to be convinced that you have the ability to do the work: GPA and test scores need to be high enough, but once this criteria is met, it is the least important part (hence lots of perfect SAT people not getting admitted).   The important stuff is demonstrating passion and motivation.  MIT wants people who are passionate about something and have demonstrated that in some meaningful way.  Anything that shows your motivation and drive and intelligence (in practice, in whatever area you are passionate) will be great.  Anything that looks like resume fluffing (for example, don't do lots of things that you think look good, do what you care about and do it well).  As to coming from a Community College, in theory this does not matter to MIT one bit, in practice you might find it more difficult to convince MIT admissions of your ability to do the work, depending on the classes available and the teachers you can get to write you recommendations.   But if you are passionate about something and have done something then there should be people in your life who have seen it and can write about you.  Transferring to or taking classes at a 4 year school that offers more challenging classes may be a better route if your community college does not challenge you academically. ",

Before Applying | MIT Admissions (transfer students) MIT has spent an inordinate amount of time making their admissions web site for freshman applicants and transfer applicants as complete as possible. Indeed, read All of the Blogs that are written by MIT admissions staff and students at that site. In general: There are exceeding Few slots for transfer students each year because so few MIT students leave before graduatingYou will provide as much if not more information that a freshman applicant would. You will provide a complete High School transcript and take all of the standardized tests, and you will need a complete transcript from your community college, and several letters of recommendationMIT will be looking to see that you are an active Leader and do several extracurricular activities at the community college, with supporting letters of recommendation.In general you should be one of the best students that Community College has ever had the pleasure to teachAdditionally, it is highly likely you will repeat sophomore year at MITAll the best.
