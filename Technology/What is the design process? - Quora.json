            "answer_text": "The creative process varies from person to person. I normally follow this path: Define the problem that you wish to solve. What is it that by solving a problem for a client that you wish to achieve. Greater awareness of a product or service? Cutting costs? More presence on a retail shelf at a store? Projection of a brand in a positive light? Damage control? More sales? I would then research as much as I can about the problem. I would do a visual audit of the client\u2019s competitors. What makes their product or service work? What can I learn from them? How do I differentiate my client\u2019s brand from the pack? Who is the top dog in this particular category, and what must I do to position my client\u2019s product or service to compete favorably? Then I would begin the actual conceptual and creative process. I would gather as much related material as a resource and inspiration, and refer to it often. I would go online to gather information. I would go to the library. I order as many books on the subject as possible. Remember that no one creates in a vacuum. I would do sketches and thumbnails, at least a 100 or more. When I had employees, I\u2019d assign them the same project and we would independently work from different ends to reach mutual satisfactory solutions. Most importantly, don\u2019t rush the creative process. I have worked on problems for years and rethought and revised many of my initial designs. Good design requires objective thought. We have to be brave enough to let go of our paradigms. There is no certain look or style that is absolutely essential to solving a design problem. Then, I build the project in one or more of the design applications I have on my laptop, following my hand-drawn sketches and layouts. Again, I am always revising, always improving. The most important quality a designer must possess is a non-emotional attachment to each project. Projects can drag on forever and never get finished. If you are a seasoned designer, you should know when you are done. If it takes you a whole day to do a business card design, you shouldn\u2019t be in this profession. As a designer, you should know when you have arrived at the end. ",

            "answer_text": "The process could be varient according to designer's way of thinking and sense of creativity. Hense I am describing these 7 steps of design pocess from my way: Brief: The main part or foundation of any kind of design is client Brief. It is the 1st step to start thinking for creative word by word, helps to using type of resource suitable for process, calculate time investment and quality of a design to target people.Reserch and Brainstorming: The thought process and designer's intense creative sense of choosing colours & types with respect to layout or placement of contents as per client's need and based on his history of branding trends.Concept: A design concept is based on the client\u2019s brief and designer's understanding. This is the overall look for a design appearance. It could be 3\u20134 different types of concept as per need of brief and a client's nature of choosing.Idea: Developement of this is backbone of design and the identity of a brand in the sellers targeted market and audiences. A sketch could be with idea which is the combination of brainstorming, ideation, thought process and designer's intense creative sense of colours & types.Draft: The first Draft of design is the visible face of brief which is cexecuted with the idea. This is series of revision to describe a brand or a product in design form to present a client.Approval: A Designer's effort is invalid as per client's brief unless client understand & approved the presented design and idea. If it get approved then half of designer's work done here only.The final design: With clients suggestion after some minor revisions the design is ready to release. It is the last step to finish a project and a final face of design with client's need.If any edits please suggest, welcome. Thanks for asking, keep Reading and Happy. ",

            "answer_text": "The first step in the design process is the Design Brief, this is where the designer writes out his specifications for the product, including deadlines and budget.The second step in the design process is the research stage, where you put together a list of raw materials that could be of use, and document their features.The third step in the design process is initial ideas, where you compile a list of appropriate ideas, that fit the design brief.The fourth step in the design process is final ideas, this is where you twiddle down your initial ideas to 2\u20133 great ideas. It is at this stage that prototypes tend to me made and used as a point of comparison. Prototypes aren\u2019t build with exact dimensions or the same materials as the final product, but they will create a strong sense of how the final design would work.The fifth step in the design process is the evaluation of your final ideas, where you determine which one you want to go with and why it is better than your other idea.The sixth step in the design process is sourcing the raw materials for the product and piecing it together, with a great deal of accuracy.The seventh and final step in the design process is to package the product that you have made, and submit it to your project manager.Hope this helped!!

            "answer_text": "The answer depends partly on your definition of \u201cdesign\u201d, but a broad expression of a formal design process may be expressed as simply as; Express -> Test -> Cycle. A parallel framework, grounded in learning theory, might be; Feel -> Think -> Do (Repeat). Two popular frameworks which unpack these further are the STEM / Scientific Process; Ask, Imagine, Plan, Create and Improve (Repeat) and the Design Thinking framework; Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test. These frameworks are centered on creation in the sense of invention of a useful product, service, or process with intent to commercialize it. They assume that the area of overlap between Art, Technology and Business is a sweet spot for sustainable innovation. Note however that the dictionary definition of design is broader, considering it as both an activity and an artifact of an activity. ",
