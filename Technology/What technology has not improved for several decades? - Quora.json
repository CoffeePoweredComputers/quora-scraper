            "answer_text": "Sewing needle  The first form of sewing was probably tying together animal skins using thorns and sharpened rocks as needles, with animal sinew or plant material as thread . A point that might be from a bone needle dates to 61,000 years ago and was discovered in Sibudu Cave, South Africa. Iron sewing needles were found at the Oppidum of Manching, dating to the third century BC. The next major break-through in needle-making was the arrival of high-quality steel-making technology from China in the tenth century. This technology later extended to Germany and France, although not significantly in England. England began creating needles in 1639 at Redditch[1].  Paper Clip  The first patent for a bent wire paper clip was awarded in the United States to Samuel B. Fay, in 1867. This clip was originally intended primarily for attaching tickets to fabric, although the patent recognized that it could be used to attach papers together[2].  Safety Pin  American mechanic Walter Hunt is the inventor of the safety pin. It included a clasp that covered the point and kept it from opening, and a circular twist at the bend to act as a spring and hold it in place. Charles Rowley (Birmingham, England) independently patented a similar safety pin in October 1849[3].  Spoon  Preserved examples of various forms of spoons used by the ancient Egyptians include those composed of ivory, flint, slate and wood; many of them carved with religious symbols. The earliest English reference appears to be in a will of 1259. The modern form, with the tip of the bowl narrower than the base and the rounded end of the handle turned down, came into use about 1760[4].
