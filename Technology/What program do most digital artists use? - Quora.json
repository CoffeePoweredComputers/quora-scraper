            "answer_text": "It really depends on what type of digital art you are trying to create. I tend to stick with the Adobe suite of products because they all seamlessly connect with each other. There are open source versions of some of other programs and even free ones, but I have found that they tend to be lacking in some of the functionality that I need. Adobe Photoshop is primarily used for all types of image manipulation, photo retouching, and general digital photography image adjustments. For vector art, Adobe Illustrator is the go to for industry standard graphic design. Adobe Indesign is best for multi-page layouts and is pretty much the same as Adobe Illustrator with it\u2019s functionality and interface. Adobe After Effects is the industry standard for all types of motion graphics, animation, special visual effects and digital compositing for chromakey. For digital video production and editing, I like to use Sony Vegas Pro 15.0 and have started using Adobe Premiere. You can import any files that have been created in other Adobe platforms as well. For digital music soundtrack scoring, I use Cubase 7.5 64 bit, primarily for recording using VST plugins and a Midi keyboard interface. I also like using Sony Vegas 15 pro to slice and dice my audio once the midi tracks have been recorded for all of my soundtrack scores. You can layer the individual midi track WAV files and then slide the audio tracks around to achieve some really cool results you can\u2019t get from just playing the music straight into a multi track recorder. So, as you can see, there are multiple programs you can use to create all forms of digital art, but it depends on what media you need and how it is being used for your final output. ",

            "answer_text": "The one program most digital artists use is more than likely Adobe Photoshop. Adobe Illustrator is also highly used. The reason for this is these programs are the industry standards, therefore the digital artist needs to be familiar with them. There are other programs that can produce the same quality, but since they are not the standard, they are used less so. It also depends on what the artist is concentrating on, i.e. digital painting or vector graphics. There are cheaper alternatives to Adobe if budget is a factor, and some of them are free! For instance, Coreldraw is a cheaper suite of programs that performs quite well and often used in the sign industry. Some very good free programs are Krita and Medibang(you just have to register) for digital painting and Krita even allows you to create 2D animations and use Adobe brushes. Another good free program(you just have to register) is Autodesk Sketchbook. There are also a bunch of 3d programs you can gain access to on the web if that is your area of interest, and a lot of them are free as well, although I am less familiar with them. With all these choices, it ultimately depends on the area of digital art you wish to focus on and your budget. ",
