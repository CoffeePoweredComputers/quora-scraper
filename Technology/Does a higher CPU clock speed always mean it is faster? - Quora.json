            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Does a higher CPU clock speed always mean it is faster? Unless restricted by some other internal hardware, the same architecture of CPU should deliver better performance at higher clock speed. Architecture is important. The now defunct Cyrix CPU delivered better performance over its equivalent Intel and AMD counterparts at the same clock speeds, because the internal architecture was completely different and it was capable of performing similar tasks in fewer clock cycles. Such variances were also noticed in the early days of the IBM PC. The 8088 ran at 4.77 MHz, but WordStar was one of the best examples of software that ran faster on slower CPUs like the Z80 or the 6502. This wasn\u2019t entirely the fault of the 8088, but overall design of the PC which required the CPU to perform extra work because of the introduction of the BIOS layer. When comparing CPUs only, clock speed should no longer be used as the comparison factor. FLOPs (Floating Point Operations per second) delivers far more useful information than just Hz. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. This whole \u201cmore clock speed equals more speed\u201d myth was busted decades ago by AMD when they released CPUs that actually clocked at lower frequencies than Intel\u2019s chips yet they still outperformed. An actual example in my own experience: I had an AMD FX-8350 clocked at 4 GHz\u2026 and later got an Intel Core i7\u20136700 clocked at 3.4 GHz. The 6700 was leaps and bounds faster than the 8350. It\u2019s not the clock speed that\u2019s important nearly as much as how much the CPU can get done during each clock cycle. The only time clock speed directly applies to performance is when you\u2019re dealing with the same chip or chips within the same microarchitecture. At that point increasing the clock speed WILL directly correspond to an increase in performance. But when it comes to comparing two different CPUs clock speed is not a good measure for performance. This is why it\u2019s a good idea when benchmarking to actually match CPUs spec-for-spec as much as possible. ",
