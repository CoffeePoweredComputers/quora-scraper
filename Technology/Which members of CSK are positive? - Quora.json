            "answer_text": "BCCI and CSK have decided to keep the infected patients name private to keep their security and remove media attention from them and stress them out which is actually great. However, in the press release, CSK and BCCI only told out of the infected patient the is an India medium-fast bowlers. CSK has 3 of them KM Asif, Deepak Chahar, and Shardul Takur. Out of these 3, Deepak Chahar was the one who was not seen since the bio-bubble beginning and many people are saying Deepak Chahar. It is safe to say it is Deepak Chahar although it is not confirmed he is the most certain one. We have to wait for the player recovery for the team and BCCI to officially announce. Also, the player and remaining infected were reportedly got it in the Chennai camp. And the second player who tested positive the team refused to release any info on them. Thank you! ",
