            "answer_text": "By patent search software, I am assuming your mean patent search database. Unfortunately, there is no definite answer to this question, as the choice of the database is dependent on a lot of aspects. Let us have a look at a few of these aspects:1) Search Interface: This is one of the most crucial elements of a patent search database. A database with no matter how great content, is actually useless in case it does not have a good interface. For beginners, a Boolean search interface is a must. However, for professional searching, you should always chose a database that has command line interface as well. Personally speaking, I like PatBase (from Minesoft) for this aspect of the database. 2) Coverage: In case you are performing a US only or UP/EP/WO search, this aspect is constant to all databases. However, in case you are looking at searching in Asian Languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean; you should always check the coverage of the database for these regions. As far as my understanding goes Orbit and WIPS databases have the best coverage for these regions 3) Data Export and Sanity: There are a lot of searchers, who prefer to export data and they do their analysis, for such type of cases you may want a database that exports results in a user friendly format and provides the export fast. A lot of databases take your export request and then send the data over an email with a link to download. However, if you are searching in run time, then this may be really frustrating. One particular good database for this is Thomson Innovation by TR. 4) Speed: You would not believe how my this impacts your searches. Even a second's delay in display of results can lead to hours of productive time lost. Just multiply 1 second by 2500 results that you may want to scan in a day. Therefore, look for a database whose servers are either very powerful or are co-located with your geographical region. 5) Display Interface: The way you would want to get your results displayed is also a critical feature. For example, in case you are searching for a Mechanical invention, you may want to have the figure/ images displayed to you along side the text. However, in case you are searching in chemistry, you would ideally like a powerful highlighter tool. There can be many more factors that can be used to decide a good database. So in case you are confused, then go with what the industry generally uses such as Orbit/ TI/ PatBase. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the answer depends on the expertise of the user. If you are not an experienced IP professional, then I wouldn\u2019t go much past the simple United States Patent and Trademark Office, WIPO, Espacenet, and/or FreePatentsOnline search (keeping good documentation of the keywords and results, of course). I don\u2019t think paying for a subscription based software for non-professional users makes sense from a variety of perspectives. If you are an experienced IP professional, then it depends on how you will be using the search results. If you will be delivering the results to clients, then it\u2019LP be a balance of subscription cost and how fancy you\u2019d like to get with the reports as far as things like graphics and maps. If you are going to be using the results as the basis for a non-infringement opinion or to try to find invalidating prior art, then it becomes a user\u2019s own preference decision, as such efforts are a bit more of an art than a science. Hope this helps. ",
