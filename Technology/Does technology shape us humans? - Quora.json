            "answer_text": "Yes, since it changes how we behave. Ghost vibrations are a perfect example: people who have their phone in the same pocket most of the time, can eventually begin to feel ghost vibrations (i.e. the feel a vibration even though the phone isn\u2019t in the pocket). The theory, if I understand it correctly, is that we put such value to the notifications that our brain associates notifications as something important enough to spend extra energy listening for. A false positive is better than a false negative, hence ghost vibrations - created by technology. Then there\u2019s the argument that it\u2019s not the technology but our relation to it, which complicates the matter: is it really the technology, or just our relationship to it? ",

            "answer_text": "In some way, the high tech shaped us drastically. Our life is much easier than a few years ago due to the high tech systems and items to accommodate our life. On the other hand, some concern of our behavior changes that we expect to have the easy way and when it doesn\u2019t happen, we get upset easily and don\u2019t know what to do if computer brakes down. I am still worry about North Korea what and how they manipulate the world\u2026 ",
