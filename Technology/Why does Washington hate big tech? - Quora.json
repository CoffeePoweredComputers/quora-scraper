            "answer_text": "Why did you ask a question with an implied and unproven assumption? It gives the reader the impression that you have already limited the answers you could get. Even if your assumption is correct, all the people to whom that prejudicial format is obvious will already be predisposed to disagree with you on the basis of a poorly formed question. And it sort of wrecks your opportunity to get a variety of answers. My own impression is that Washing loves, on average, to bash big tech for political gain, loves to hear from big tech when it supports their views, and loves to get the economic benefit and taxes of big tech. So it\u2019s likely not a simple or black-and-white situation. ",
