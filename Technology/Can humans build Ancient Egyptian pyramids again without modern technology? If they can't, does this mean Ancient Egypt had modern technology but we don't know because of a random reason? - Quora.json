            "answer_text": "We know more or less how the Egyptians (and various other peoples around the world) built their pyramids. We\u2019ve got a variety of evidence from historical texts from various societies on quarrying, masonry, and transporting heavy objects to archaeological evidence from Egypt consistent with the use of those techniques to modern experimental evidence that these techniques are plausible. Can we do it? Define \u201ccan.\u201d We know how it was done, more or less, but we\u2019d be terrible at doing it because it involves skills we don\u2019t really use. It\u2019s a bit like I know how a sculptor works and how they do what they do, but if you asked me to make a statue, it\u2019d be remarkably ugly because I haven\u2019t developed that particular skill set. We could eventually quarry enough reasonably good blocks of stone, but it would take a while to get there because we\u2019ve replaced old hand-tool techniques for quarrying stone with skill sets built around modern tools. We could eventually move them into place, but it would take time to come up to speed with techniques involving the use of sleds and rollers instead of techniques involving cranes and trucks. And, of course, we\u2019d never do this because it would be mind-bogglingly expensive. The Egyptians used a work force of thousands of people for a couple of decades to build the Great Pyramid. It would probably take us longer because we have to get used to working that way. Who\u2019s going to pay for that in this day and age? So, then, building ancient-style pyramids is hard work, made vastly harder if you limit yourself to ancient-style techniques. Could it be done? Probably. Would it be done? Never. ",

            "answer_text": " I don\u2019t think that we could construct these using modern techniques. I get into very heated debates over this and it usually comes from the fact that most people are just not aware of the Giza Pyramid\u2019s features. They seem to think that it\u2019s a bunch of blocks stacked on each other to form a four-side structure. They have very little appreciation for the precision involved in its construction regarding not just it\u2019s location on the Earth, which could not have been positioned by accident, but also it\u2019s orientation to true north and the fact that it actually has 9 sides (including the bottom). The 8 side up top appear as four sides unless viewed from above or at specific times of the day to see the shadows. Each of the blocks weighs several tons. TONS. This is the part that most people don\u2019t seem to understand. - precision alone using our most advanced techniques would be difficult to achieve today using modern technology but when you take into account the mass that each of the blocks had, it becomes clear how difficult they would\u2019ve been to position so precisely. and in such a way so as to avoid sinking over the centuries. I always feel the need to say that I don\u2019t think aliens built the pyramids. I think humans did. If it was the Egyptians, I don\u2019t think they did it alone.. They had help from someone that knew a lot more about building than they did. Again\u2026I\u2019m not thinking aliens here lol. We don\u2019t really know how the pyramids were built, which is why all attempts to duplicate their construction using ancient techniques have failed. ",

            "answer_text": "Can modern people build the pyramids without modern technology? Can you travel from New York City to Los Angles without modern technology? Yes you can. All you have to do is open up your front door and start walking. It\u2019s three thousand miles away, so if you walk 30 miles a day it will only take you a couple of months. You don\u2019t have to drive or fly. Except why would you walk across the continent? How do you feed yourself during this walk? Where do you sleep at night? Can you wear modern shoes? How in shape are you? You can travel across the continent without using modern technology, it would just be a difficult, lengthy, uncertain, and costly undertaking, and for what purpose? The pyramids were not technically difficult to construct. All they did was cut out blocks of stone, transport them to the pyramid site, and stack them up, over and over and over. Just like walking across the continent is not a difficult job, it just takes walking 30 miles every day for months and months. The only thing difficult about building a pyramid is that they had to keep thousands and thousands of workers at the task for decades. That\u2019s the real difficult part, the social organization and surplus required to keep people performing this unproductive task for years. And at the end of the task, they had constructed an artificial mountain. And that\u2019s good for what exactly? It\u2019s good for marveling at, imagining the sheer amount of human effort that went into constructing this thing. Just like if you walked across the continent, I\u2019d marvel at the sheer amount of effort that went into your unproductive task. The Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas is the third largest pyramid in the world. It was constructed by modern techniques. The difference between the Luxor Hotel and the Great Pyramid is that one is a giant pile of rocks, the other is a luxury hotel and casino. People built the Luxor Hotel because they thought they could make money. People built the Great Pyramid as a tomb to honor the Pharaoh. How many people do you know who are interested in cutting and stacking stone blocks by hand in the desert to construct a gigantic tomb for their living God-King? Two? Three? Before you can construct a pyramid using ancient techniques you better find thousands of these people, and ask them if they\u2019ve got a couple of decades free. If all you want to know is if people can quarry stone blocks using ancient techniques, move stone blocks using ancient techniques, and lift stone blocks using ancient techniques, they surely can do those things. People sometimes do that for fun, as an experiment. But they don\u2019t usually move thousands of these blocks, because they\u2019ve got jobs and other hobbies, and it might be fun for a weekend to assist in a project like this, but not dedicating decades of their lives. But as I said before, the impressive thing about the pyramids isn\u2019t that ancient people could quarry a stone block, move a stone block, and lift a stone block. That\u2019s easy. The impressive thing is doing that two million times. That\u2019s hard. ",
