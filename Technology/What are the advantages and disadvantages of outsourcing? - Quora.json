            "answer_text": "I am working for an outsourcing company, thus, I will provide the info from the opposite site of the barrier.You don\u2019t have to outsource unless you are willing to. First things first - if you choose the trustworthy company, it will save you lots of headache, my advice is - use the credible references. Outsourcing allows management to defer the details to a specialized company. Removing the details, permits management to focus on the larger issues within the organization. Typically, the specialized company that handles the outsourced IT work boasts technological capabilities superior to the organization. Organizations view outsourcing as a cost-effective means to expand into other countries and new markets. Advantages of outsourcing You can focus on what you do bestYou may save moneyPerhaps the biggest driver pushing business owners to outsource is the prospect of saving money on payroll costs; there are significant cost savings to be had in that regard. But bringing on an outside vendor may require more money than you expect.You may reduce riskSay you choose to hire an in-house IT person, and you ask that employee to migrate your website to your own server. But the server crashes and the hours tick by as your employee works to fix it. Meanwhile, your customers can\u2019t place online orders.A team\u2019s worth of experienceIf you decide to hire an IT employee, that one person likely won\u2019t have the breadth of experience that an outside vendor\u2019s team can bring (assuming you choose to outsource with a company rather than a solo expert).Outsourcing IT reduces or completely eradicates direct communication between organizations and clients. Limited communication impedes the relationship building process, which may lead to the overall dissatisfaction of the organization and client. The outsourcing organization loses complete control over all areas of the company. Project implementation timelines may suffer as a result. If the organization terminates the agreement with the outsourced entity, confidential, sensitive information becomes jeopardized. You may have to wait for serviceIf you\u2019ve got an expert on staff, that person can respond immediately to a computer crash or other tech emergency. If you\u2019ve outsourced your IT, you\u2019ll be getting in line.Unexpected costsAn outside expert can help you assess your technology needs, but there\u2019s also the risk that they encourage you to over-invest in technology.Loss of controlA third-party vendor may encourage you to purchase systems or products for which they have expertise. Soon enough, you\u2019re so reliant on that vendor that extricating yourself is risky.Security risksFor some companies, outsourcing may entail the risk of sharing proprietary data. I strongly advise to sign a solid NDA.",

            "answer_text": "Outsourcing has been there for a while now and it becomes more and more popular these days. Companies prefer to outsource development, accounting, customer service and many other tasks. Modern startups outsource more functions than what they keep in house at times. Therefore here\u2019s a list of outsourcing pros and cons to help you consider the options. Advantages Outsourcing helps founders concentrate on business development instead of handling all the miscellaneous business processes. The main advantages of outsourcing in my opinion are: High quality - outsource service normally specialise in one particular area they have expertise and experience at.Cutting costs - outsource service cost 2 times less than in-house on average. Plus normally you only pay for the amount of work done, no hidden fees and bonuses.Saving time - once you hire an outsource firm, they normally take care of everything trying to make running the business as easy as possible.Flexibility - outsourcing allows to be flexible with changing needs.Disadvantages The biggest reason why a company would want to keep functions in-house is control. There some risks a company can face with outsourcing here: Communication - one of the biggest issues with outsourcing is finding partners that can speak your language.Cultural difference - outsource employees can be difficult to communicate with due to cultural differencesProduct knowledge - foreign employees removed from the corporate base can be not familiar enough with your company's products and services.Although, any of these issues can be mitigated by choosing the right outsource partner.
