            "answer_text": "Of course you can use it.It won\u2019t run demanding games, but I doubt you want this machine for gaming.It will perform well enough for office tasks. You can\u2019t upgrade it with 2020 technology, use it as is. For example, replacing the processor with an Intel CPU of 2020 is not possible due to the CPU socket on it\u2019s motherboard (socket 1150).Socket wise, this CPU would fit :  Adding a GPU will probably require a better power supply and then I\u2019m not even thinking about the available space in the case.

            "answer_text": "It depends on your usage but if you want to do gaming or video editing ,it will not be suitable.Always prefer ssd rather than hdd as boot time is slow in hdd.the gpu is also not upto the mark ,it is better to go for nvidia or amd rather than Intel and a higher ram variant. But since your question was that whether you cannot use it or not , you can definitely use it for browsing,streaming,making word document ,ppt, excel etc i.e. any light usage . ",
