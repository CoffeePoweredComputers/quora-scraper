            "answer_text": "More precisely, how did it, because that telescope is no longer functioning. It detected these planets by by looking for transits, mini-eclipses caused by their crossing in front of their stars in our line of sight to them. For doing so, it needed to look at a large number of stars almost continuously for as long as it could, in the hope of seeing a transit. In its original mission, it looked at some 150,000 stars for around 3 years. ",

            "answer_text": "It detects exoplanets by luminosity. They observe a star for a long time and when a planet revolving the star comes in way of the star, it's luminosity decreases. We can then approximate the planet's size and radius of revolution by the luminosity difference and can know if a planet less in the Goldilocks zone or not. ",
