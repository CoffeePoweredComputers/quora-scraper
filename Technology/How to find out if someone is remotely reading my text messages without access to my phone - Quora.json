            "answer_text": "Finding out if they are viewing your texts is a lot more complicated than preventing them from doing so. Unless you catch them in the act there is no real way to know if they are viewing your messages. There may be clues though. I suspected an Ex of reading my texts because she made comments that alluded to facts I had only discussed with a person via texts. When I checked my Apple Device Manager, I discovered an old iPad I had given her son was still logged into my Apple ID and my texts could be viewed on that device by simply turning in the texts in the settings. So it is possible to view your texts without some government program or Court Order as some have alluded. If a person has access to a device you were previously signed onto, then they are able to view your texts on that device. An example would be an old phone you are still logged onto or as I mentioned, an iPad. They would only need to connect to the internet to gain access to your texts. With iOS, you have to approve the other device but once you have it will continue to receive your texts until you change the password to your Apple ID. If you are using WhatsApp it\u2019s as easy as knowing your login and password. They would simply log in to the App on their phone with your credentials and voila- see it all! If a person is devious and has the ability to tamper with your device, they could also forward the texts.[1] Really Scary huh!? It is possible to track a phone and view texts remotely. There are services which allow nefarious individuals to spy on you if they are willing to pay! This is very scary!! The best way to avoid this is to change your Apple ID often. Log out of all devices you no longer use- View and remove your associated devices in iTunes For Android- Timothy Wingerter's answer to How do I remove unused device from Android Device Manager tool? In WhatsApp (or any texting app) change your password. If the other person is viewing your texts, it will end. Don\u2019t trust anyone with your phone alone. I had a friend that allowed her boyfriend to get her a new phone. He told her he traded in her old phone. A few months later she did \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d and her old phone was at his house. He explained that he didn\u2019t want her to know they wouldn\u2019t take the old phone back and he paid full price. She excepted his explanation but as I told her, why was it still logged into her Apple ID, charged and online at his house? He explained that he was using it to play music when she confronted him with more questions and it led to them breaking up because she began to remember texts disappearing from her lock screen at times. And another strange comment he made about not having alcohol at her Father\u2019s retirement party when she knew she had never discussed it with him but had had the conversation via text with her sister. Change your password to everything whenever you feel suspicious. Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Android, Apple ID, and etc. all need to be changed regularly regardless but if you have suspicions change them immediately. That\u2019s how you know! If your gut tells you someone is reading your private messages, act on it. If you have to, go trade in your phone and get another number. That\u2019s the only 100% way to curtail it if someone has gotten to your phone. Footnotes[1] How to send, receive texts on two Android phones from a single number | ZDNet",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019d like to know how to tell if your cell phone is tapped or detect a keylogger on your iPhone, it doesn\u2019t mean you should be an expert, all you need to know are just several indicators. Many people notice that their phone suddenly lights up, shuts down, or makes random beeping noises. From time to time, all cell phones can do strange things. However, if you notice these activities frequently, that might mean that you have a spy app on your cell phone. If you find your data usage has suddenly gone up, the chances are that a hacking program is tracking your \u0441ellphone. Well, you may hear background noise, beeping, echoes, or listen to another voice speaking apart from yours and the person you are talking to. If your \u0441ell phone is being monitored by surveillance software, then you are likely to hear such sounds. Unexpected text messages with incoherent symbols are yet another plausible sign that your phone is being tapped. Spy software often uses secret coded messages to collect your data usage. However, keep in mind that your phone battery power life diminishes over time. So, even if you notice an increase in battery drain, it doesn\u2019t always mean that you\u2019re being spied on. Increased battery temperature, even when your phone is idle, can point to hacking software that is operating silently in the background. Thoroughly check the list and look for anything that has the word \u2018\u2019spy\u2019\u2019 in its name, or something that has a weird malware-like name. If found, delete it. Another considerable preventative measure is to use spywareapplications atgmailcom to limit app permissions to install other software from unknown sources. If everything else seems to have failed, then resetting the smartphone to factory settings might be the last way to remove spy apps. It will ensure that all unwanted monitoring software is gone from your cell phone. if you notice an app on your mobile phone, and you have performed any jailbreak, that means that you\u2019re likely being spied on. Always keep your phone\u2019s operating system and firmware up to date. Companies keep up with all the threats, and they simultaneously release updates and patches that will ensure that hackers and other malicious actors don\u2019t exploit your devices. I hope this article was helpful finding how your phone activities is being monitored remotely. ",
