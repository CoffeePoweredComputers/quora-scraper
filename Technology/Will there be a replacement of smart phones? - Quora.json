            "answer_text": "In 2019, a bit more than a decade after the smartphone went \u201cmainstream\u201d, it is hard to see what could displace/replace the smartphone for most people over the next 10\u201315 years. I don\u2019t consider things like folding smartphones, transparent smartphones, full-size-wrist-phones, etc to be replacements. If these come to market and take over it is more fashion than a fundamental shift. Other hopeful technologies such as Google Glass, Tablets, e-books, and Smartwatches have failed to keep pace, and even if the technologies are growing, they are growing slowly and mostly augment rather than replace smartphones. Technologies that could replace the smartphone fall into broad categories: ubiquitous computing, implants and rejection. First, potentially every surface in public and private could become a cloud-connected display. Then people could carry a small card or even have a chip under the skin that would link the nearby computing surfaces into their unique cloud persona. This would allow ambient computing anywhere there is adequate surface service. I can see something like this happening progressively since people could still carry a smartphone but it would dynamically connect to any computing surface in their immediate vicinity without having to actually use the smartphone. This is starting to be possible already with Microsoft, Google and Apple creating desktop/laptop links to cell phones, but there is a lot more room for improvement in this technology. Secondly, there is the idea of embedding network connectivity, computation and display technologies inside clothes and/or the human body. These already exist in a crude fashion with bone conduction headphones, cochlear implants, pacemakers, smart contacts, direct optic nerve stimulation, etc. I suspect that these technologies will continue to improve slowly in their current markets as assistive medical devices. Eventually, once sufficiently improved, they will jump to the mass market. The introduction of a visual/audio internal smartphone could take the world by storm similarly to how amazing the first iPhone with its capacitive touchscreen swamped the pre-existing palm/blackberry/sidekick smartphone market. Perhaps even longer term, a variant of the ubiquitous computing infrastructure could be something like Smartdust - Wikipedia. Conceptually you could manage a swarm of nanobots that could reconfigure into any needed physical configuration. These nanobots could be ambient or personal or a combination. A \u201csmartphone\u201d could become a swarm of nanobots that could reconfigure into a large display or a keyboard. Perhaps they could link up with other nanobots in the environment to create chairs, scooters and whatever is wanted. This is getting pretty science-fiction and even if possible is several decades away. The third category of smartphone replacements I called \u201crejection\u201d. Maybe there will be a widespread rejection of smartphone technology. People could decide or be forced to quit using smartphones by issues with privacy, security or perhaps a terrorist action or societal collapse. If a significant enough societal shock took place people would be willing to give up the convenience of a single device that does everything and return to a small set of more focused devices like a GPS, gaming system, web-browser, etc. I don\u2019t think this is very likely. People have become amazingly dependent on smartphone and mobile technologies for navigation, transport, entertainment, news, dating, socializing, and shopping. At this point in civilization it would take a major technological breakdown for smartphones to be rejected by a large percentage of the population. Time will tell \u2014 maybe this answer will seem very silly in 5 years, but I don\u2019t think anything will replace the smartphone before 2035. Remember even though smartphones can duplicate many features of the personal computer as well as having many unique features, the PC is still a common device in 2019. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Smartphones will become obsolete. In this generation imagining a world without smartphones is pretty much impossible. Smartphones are now used for almost everything from making a call, sending sms, taking pictures to shopping and making financial transactions. Because of our fast progress in technology, soon smartphones will become obsolete, but they won\u2019t just vanish in thin air. The evolution may sound thrilling or even scary but it won\u2019t happen quickly. It\u2019s easy to dismiss smartphone innovation as dead. In fact, one in two people think the smartphone itself will be obsolete within five years, according to an Ericsson survey of 100,000 people globally released at the end of 2015.[1] Now, the question is what will take over smartphones? I believe that soon smartphones will morph into wearable Artificial Intelligence (AI) devices and Augmented Reality (AR) devices like Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens. Yes, wearable devices like:- Pair of glasses (Google Glasses [2] , Microsoft HoloLens[3] )Bracelets- that we swipe down and it projects on our arm.Cool, right? The good news is Microsoft and Google have even started working on these projects and have achieved a great height of success till now. Soon we will have our personal JARVIS . But we gotta wait as we know evolution does not happen overnight, it takes time. As of now these products are expensive as hell but in foreseeable future when they will take over the market their prices will drop and become affordable.
