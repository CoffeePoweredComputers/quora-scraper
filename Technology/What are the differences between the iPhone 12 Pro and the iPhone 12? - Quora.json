            "answer_text": "Both the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro look pretty much the same.The basic iPhone is made from aircraft-grade aluminum, while the Pro variant is made from stainless steel. The main difference is the cameras - iPhone 12 has a dual camera (wide-angle module and ultra-wide, both 12 megapixels), while the iPhone 12 Pro has a triple camera (wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto, all 12 megapixels) with a LiDAR sensor (laser rangefinder, useful for augmented reality applications). Here is a detailed overview of their feature from a professional photographer's point of view:  The amount of RAM is different - the iPhone 12 has only 4 GB of RAM, while the iPhone 12 Pro has 6 GB. A simple iPhone can be purchased with 64, 128, or 256 GB of flash memory. iPhone 12 Pro comes with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming that this question is about the next generation of iPhones. The actual names of those phones hasn\u2019t been verified yet, so it could well be called the iPhone 12 line or even the iPhone 11s line. No data about the features have been released, nor has any pricing info. And we don\u2019t know what you will want or need for a new phone, or your budget. All that we \u201cknow\u201d about these phones is based on unverified pre-release leaks. Even if it was verified, some of the details could be subject to change. And even if all of it is accurate and won\u2019t change, your needs or budget could change between now and whether you buy your next phone. Based on all that, it\u2019s much too early to say what phone you should get, or if you should get one at all. You\u2019ll be in a much better position to know then based on your own needs and desires, not based on guesses by strangers on the Internet about what you want or need. ",
