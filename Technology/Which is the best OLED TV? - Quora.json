            "answer_text": "I\u2019m currently in the buying cycle for a new television. The best (only) OLED TVs I\u2019ve seen are from LG\u2014but are they worth the extra money? At a local retailer, I recently saw an LG OLED next to a Samsung LCD of the same size. I don\u2019t remember the exact size, but they were as big as twin beds. Both displayed the same video feed, which apparently intended to show off dynamic range (light to dark ability), something OLED supposed to be is good at. (I think it was LG\u2019s demo video.) The LG had an amazing picture. The Samsung had an amazing picture. I did see minor visual differences. The LG had very slightly better detail in dark objects, but light objects\u2014like the fabric texture of a white shirt\u2014looked a tiny bit better on the Samsung. LED panel makers have learned all sorts of tricks for extending dynamic range. At first, I couldn\u2019t decide which wonderful picture was best\u2014but the Samsung suddenly looked better when I noticed that it was over $1,000 cheaper. The amazing thing about modern TVs is how uniformly great the pictures are. If you head straight to the cheapest one in the store\u2014it may have (by picky modern standards) not as good dynamic range and noticeable judder (things jiggle slightly when the camera pans)\u2014but they all have sharp images and acceptable to spectacular color. When I shopped for TVs back in the vacuum tube days, a wall of TVs would show quite a bit of variation, and the best and worst were very different. Conclusion: I like the LG TVs, but my next TV will be either a Samsung or a Sony. Update: I bought a Samsung QLED TV, and have been very satisfied with it\u2014sharp, excellent color, and good HDR.
