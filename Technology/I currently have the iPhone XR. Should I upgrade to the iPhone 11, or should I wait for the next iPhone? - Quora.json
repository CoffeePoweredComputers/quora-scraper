            "answer_text": "The Huawei P30 Pro is an ideal substitute for the iPhone 11. It offers more performance and a better camera than the iPhone 11 for the same price, or less, than the cost of an iPhone 11 Pro. If you prefer the iPhone because of its operating system, iCloud integration or some other reason other than the fact that it's an iPhone (status symbol), the Huawei P30 Pro uses an intuitive UI based on the Android operating system, offers Google Drive integration (similar to iCloud for cloud storage of generated media like pictures and videos, and files like spreadsheets or text documents) and basically outperforms the iPhone 11 in every way that matters. Or you can check out other options similar to the Huawei P30 Pro that will perform just as well for around the same price as the P30 Pro. ",
