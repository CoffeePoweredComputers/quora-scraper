            "answer_text": "They are not. They can perform some (limited tasks) better then a human, which is currently limited to image tagging and playing computer games. Ask them to undertake a mundane task like tie a shoelace they can\u2019t do it. They will become better at many more tasks (driving and so on). Whether all these different skills can be but together is not known. Nor is instructing a machine to perform a useful general task known, (but things like Alexa hint it may be), Robot tidy my room, Robot make me an omelette, Robot buy a present for X and take it around. I think this is likely in the next twenty five years. Whether they will ever be able to better theorise the laws of the Universe and inventive things is not known. Here is what an AI called deep dream painted, it looks slightly deranged to me. What do you think? A dog\u2019s dinner, literally. People pay money for these prints, maybe machines are more intelligent than us.  ",

It is often smarter than I am. The calculator gives me trig answers to calculations I could not otherwise resolve. My ORCAD electronics package is smarter in many ways than I am. My Excel I use for my inventory of parts has a far better memory than I do. Do those things count? ",
