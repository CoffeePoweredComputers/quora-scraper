            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! =) Learning the principles might take a little while. It\u2019s mostly about asking yourself questions and learning to be open to the fact that not all the answers will be all that flattering. Now, what does take time is getting to know yourself. The fact that we\u2019re constantly evolving, changing, and adjusting makes it a life long pursuit. It\u2019s a project with no other end than the fact that sooner or later we die. What I think you\u2019re trying to get at is a fixed number of years it usually takes before we reach the point at where we stop kidding ourselves and get rid of the pretense that we\u2019re something we\u2019re not. Unfortunately I can\u2019t give you one. All I can tell from my own experience and that of others is that it can be accelerated by constantly challenging and exposing yourself to people and ideas that go against your preconceived notions of who you are and the way in which you view the world. For me questions, books, and meditation are a massive part of the equation.  There\u2019s a lot of pain involved as well. There\u2019ve been times when I\u2019ve cried or experienced panic attacks. Yes, those wonderful bouts of not being able to breathe and feeling like I\u2019m dying, because the feeling of \u201cWho am I?!\u201d came washing over me. One thing that sticks out is when questioned myself about why I was constantly trying to be such a goody-two-shoes, when I suddenly realized I was just trying to be the man I wished my biological father had been. Realizing that I wasn\u2019t doing it out of my own free will made me question many decisions in my life, and it resulted in some serious weeping. Fortunately those are just passing emotions, but you might want to be prepared to face those moments. They might be a part of your process. If they\u2019re not, it\u2019s OK too. It isn\u2019t meant to be a badge of honor. Everyone needs to deal with their own set of issues when discovering themselves.  While I\u2019m never going to be finished I feel that the initial part of my journey took me from about the age of 16 to somewhere around 25\u201327. At 16 was when I seriously started questioning myself and my beliefs. Then it took me a decade to come to the moment where I felt I had a solid handle on what triggers me, when, where, and why. Also, the first couple of years my development was pretty quick. Then around 20 I hit what felt like a plateau which lasted for 2\u20133 years. After that it took me another 4\u20135 years before I reached a small sense of \u201cmastery\u201d. Now, this is just my journey so far. There\u2019s still a lot to go through for me. Also, this isn\u2019t meant to serve as some blue print of what it\u2019s like for everyone. Take the lessons and ideas people share, see what\u2019s applicable to your life, and put the rest aside for now. My very best wishes for your journey. Have a kick-ass \u20a2eative day! =) ",

            "answer_text": "A2A Self-Awareness is always there, it is ever present. Ask yourself the simplistic question - Am I awake? Now look at the knowing that I am awake. That knowing is Self-Awareness for how could it be anything else. We take ourselves to be separate and look for something outside of us to be called Self, something deep and mysterious. But all along it is us, that simple knowing. Stare or hold the feeling \u201cI\u201d long enough and you will find nothing else but the simple knowing of Awareness is Awareness of Awareness or Knowing of Awareness. So there it only takes a minute. Now drop the recognition you are a separate \u201cI\u201d and you are simple Knowing. ",
