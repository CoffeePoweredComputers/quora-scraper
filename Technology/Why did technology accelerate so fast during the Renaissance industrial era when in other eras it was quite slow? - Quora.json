            "answer_text": "During the Renaissance, the human Ego was elevated to the center of the universe instead of God. Ad maiorem Dei gloriam was replaced by Ad maiorem Meus gloriam (Sorry for my poor Latin). It was during the Renaissance that Western Europe began to vigorously develop technologies and sciences to help control nature. Francis Bacon expressed a new ideal for knowledge with the words: \"Human knowledge and human power meet in one; for where the cause is not known the effect cannot be produced. Nature to be commanded must be obeyed ...\" The purpose of all actual knowledge is to find rules and means of possessing and ruling nature. That\u2019s where it all started and developed at a rapid pace. Now this idea of Me ruling nature instead of God is an essential core in global culture. ",
