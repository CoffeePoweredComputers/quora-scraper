            "answer_text": "As a Butler myself, I feel that there are a large array of services a butler provides - Anything from serving the welcome beverage, unpacking cases, shoeshine, arranging for housekeeping staff to tend to guest rooms at preferred times, arranging sightseeing, serving food and beverages, collect and return laundry, arrange airport transfers, tickets for a movie/concert, or any specific guest needs. Butlers are trained to satisfy guest requests and do all that i possible in their limits, at times, gaining approvals from the managers for certain special requests. In most hotels, a Butler is a blend of a couple of roles as the floors that provide butler service, have only 1 or 2 specific butlers attend to a particular guest, so that there is familiarity and guest needs are taken care of to the entirety. Ideally you can call a butler a blend of a personal assistant, waiter, concierge, at times manservant or housekeeping man, secretary, valet etc. ",
