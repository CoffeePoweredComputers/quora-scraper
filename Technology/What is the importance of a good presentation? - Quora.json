            "answer_text": "Creating a great presentation that will be impactful to your audience has more to do with its purpose rather than its delivery. Sure, you can include amazing images, breathtaking video and audio, or the best design templates that money can buy. You can even be the most skilled speaker on the planet! But if you do not know why you are delivering the presentation or if you do not have an adequate understanding of your audience, then you will fail on many points on the Presentations agenda. To help you to move things along in creating your presentation, here are some questions you should answer to enrich the process: Who is the audience I am delivering this presentation to? Are they new to the subject I will speak about, or are they subject matter experts?What will be the main topic or thesis of my presentation? What will be its supporting details?What is my Call to Action at the end of my presentation? What would I want my audience to do after hearing what I have to say?I have several resources on our blog on Visme, of which I founded to empower everyone to visually present and communicate to audiences effectively. I hope they will help you as much as they have helped me. ",

If you presentation is bad you will probably fail to communicate something really important for you and your audience. Vice versa - if your presentation is good you will succeed in communicating your message and achieve your goal. It is really as simple as that. ",
