            "answer_text": "To me it would be anything that piques your interest. A few areas I\u2019ve collected over the years have been US and world coins, world paper currency and rocks & minerals. I started collecting coins when I was 12. When I was in my 20\u2019s, I began selling them at a profit and kept it up until a few years ago. I sold off most of the common material buy kept all the high grade attractive US & world coins for myself as a collection. Today they\u2019re worth a lot more than I paid for them. My rock & minerals collection started in the late 1990\u2019s. I began collecting fossils and minerals in some of Austin\u2019s creeks and when my wife & I took road trips we\u2019d stop at places out west and bring home interesting rocks found along the way. A lot of these now reside in our xeriscaped rock garden in front of the house which my wife designed. I have a large display of the better items inside our home. Crystals, semiprecious stones and various minerals in their raw state are much more beautiful than cut stones. ",

            "answer_text": "Memories. You see most of the things we collect tend to fade away. We either lose interest in them or they just lose their value but memories, experience tends to stay longer. And it\u2019s strange how they only become richer as time passes. Memories that you cherish remain solid in your mind, no matter how many unpleasant things were attached to those memories. As Silk Spectre puts it, \u2018Everyday the future looks a little bit darker. But the past, even the grimy parts of it, well, it just keeps on getting brighter all the time\u2019. SO, go on. Collect memories, experiences because when you are old and dying (or dying young for that matter). no amount of cards or marbles or antiques or paintings or coins will give you the peace you need then. But the smell of the rain, the touch of warm skin, the taste of a fine coffee or a calm of a sunset beach walk would help you smile in your moment of the end and you will die knowing that you lived one hell of a life.
