            "answer_text": "With the update of iOS 13, there are many different changes that may excite Apple fans. With every update, the system fluency has been greatly improved. As we know, the \u201cdark mode\u201d changes the volume UI display, and the App store lifts download restrictions. Of course, every update will eliminate some models and cannot be updated again. The following are the iOS versions supported by iPhone models over the years. We can see how long Apple support iPhones.  In terms of the number of iOS versions, the previous version supports 3 generations of updates and gradually 4th and 5th generations. Currently, the most updated version supports iPhone 5s. From the perspective of time, the more versions, the longer the maintenance time. The iPhone 4s is five years, and the iPhone 5s is six years. The conclusion is quite unexpected. In this sense, can you say that the iPhone 5S is the most durable one? ",

            "answer_text": "Although there\u2019s an ongoing \u2018war\u2019 between iOS and Android. Both operating systems have their own advantages and appeal to user preferences in their own beneficial ways, but one thing that Android lacks is software support. Across the board, Android devices stop getting software upgrades after 2\u20133 years. However, Apple is keeping its smartphones supported for twice as long. Apple offer some of the lengthiest support of all manufacturers, as the iPhone 6S was released back in September 2015 and is the oldest device on the list that runs on the latest iOS 13. All devices released after September 2015 received the update.  Apple doesn\u2019t follow a certain pattern of dropping software after the device gets 4 or 5 years old for example. It mainly depends on the hardware the device packs inside and whether the processor, battery life, RAM and internal storage will be able to handle new iOS features and performance improvements. Let\u2019s take the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 8 as an example. Specifications wise, both have pretty powerful processors and same amount of RAM. Theoretically, as long as the iPhone 8 receives software support, the iPhone 7 will as well. ",
