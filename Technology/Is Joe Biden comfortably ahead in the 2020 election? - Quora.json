            "answer_text": "Not really, now that in person voting has started in several states Biden\u2019s lead has shrunk to just 5% on the latest polling.(Hillary Clinton had a 6.5% lead in the same poll and the same date in 2016) Polls oversample Democrats by 16\u201320% mostly because they call during business hours between 9am and 5pm when working class Trump voters aren\u2019t even home so Biden must maintain that average in every swing state to actually win and he doesn\u2019t have it. I\u2019ll make my prediction now. The first single digit polls are coming in for Biden and while the fake polls are still faking numbers to cash in on the \u201cLemming Effect\u201d while simultaneously putting out a bunch of articles about how \u201cpolling is difficult\u201d \u201cshy Trump voters\u201d and how this election could be \u201cstolen\u201d just like they did in 2016. The next phase will be gloating by the pollsters who got it right and a quick corrections to general polling so they don\u2019t look like Nate Silver of 538 just 10 days before election day. The final phase will be Trump taking the majority of electoral votes and Democrats whining about the unfairness of the Electoral College because they think Cali-Yorkistan \u201cknows what\u2019s best\u201d for a potato farmer in Idaho or a rancher in Oklahoma or a machinist in Pennsylvania or a welder in Wisconsin.  The map on the bottom is factual and pretty much what we\u2019ll see again in 2020. The oversimplified map at the top is the kind of crap put out my mainstream media and doesn\u2019t really tell the true tale. Trump supporters are in person voters, they aren\u2019t that scared of a virus with a 99.6% survivability and more Trump voters are still working during COVID than Dem voters and are not at home during the day to be polled by phone. November 3rd will be a veritable bloodbath because polling locations will be jammed with Trump supporters from open to close just like 2016 because it will be the only time they can get away from work to actually vote.

            "answer_text": "Is Joe Biden comfortably ahead in the 2020 election? No. Not at all. Because four more years of a President Trump would be so incomprehensible disastrous for our country, I will not feel completely comfortable until Joseph Biden has said his oath of office and private citizen Trump has landed in the non-extradition \u201cshithole country\u201d of his choice. Between now and then, too much could go wrong. The election will be lost if those who support Biden get complacent and don\u2019t actually cast their ballots.As we learned in 2016, a clear win in the popular vote doesn\u2019t always translate into a win in the Electoral College.Republicans are using every tool at their disposal to disenfranchise those they suspect won\u2019t be sufficiently subservient to the Mango Mussolini.Republicans are taking steps legal and illegal to keep mail-in ballots from being counted, and mail-in ballots are more likely to be Biden ballots, since Trump and his science-denying thralls prefer not to take safety precautions that would protect other people while inconveniencing them.Trump has never committed to a peaceful transition of power if he loses this election. Even if Trump does eventually concede, it is almost certain that some of his fanatical supporters won\u2019t. The 2016 election offers us a cautionary model. Few of those of us who voted for Clinton had the intense devotion to her that we find in Trump\u2019s base. Still, there were protests against Trump\u2019s election and inauguration that sometimes did turn violent. I can\u2019t bear to think about the reactions from Trump\u2019s more fanatical and very well-armed supporters even if Trump does concede.So no. Nothing is comfortable about Biden\u2019s current significant lead. ",
