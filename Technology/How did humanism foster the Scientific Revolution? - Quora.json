            "answer_text": "Wikipedia accurately defines humanism as \u201c\u2026.A philosophical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively. The meaning of the term humanism has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it. The term was coined by theologian Friedrich Niethammer at the beginning of the 19th century to refer to a system of education based on the study of classical literature (\"classical humanism\"). Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human freedom and progress. It views humans as solely responsible for the promotion and development of individuals and emphasizes a concern for man in relation to the world. In modern times, humanist movements are typically non-religious movements aligned with secularism, and today humanism may refer to a nontheistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world.\u201d Humanism has its biblical roots in Genesis, when God created the Human according to His image and likeness, i.e., having self-consciousness intelligence and free will. The Human was entrusted to \u201cdominate\u201d the earth, which biblical scholars interpret as acting in the way God acted in the first 6 Days of Creation, wherein at the end of each Cay of Creation, God saw that what He had done was \u201cgood\u201d. In handing the earth ( and the Universe) to the Human, God expected him to continue the work of creation and that it should also be \u201cgood\u201d. This \u201cgood\u201d includes development of the earth along the humanistic lines of technology, science, social justice, elimination of poverty, arts, etc. Rev. 21:4 describes the end of the human effort as a state where there will be no more crying, no more pain and suffering, no more sighing. This is the true meaning of humanism. ",
