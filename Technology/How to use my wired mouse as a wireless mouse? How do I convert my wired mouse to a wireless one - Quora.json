            "answer_text": "So. Please ignore the other answer. There is no need to be a master electrician to do this, and only requires a little patience. You can find a ton of guides on reddit and YouTube, and the process is as simple as unscrewing your mouse, unplugging the cable connector from the motherboard, plugging in the motherboard connector from the wireless adapter, Tapeing the adapter to the shell, and screwing it back up. Tada! Super simple, no need to do anything scary or mod the mouse beyond belief. I would recommend you read a more detailed guide on how to do this before trying yourself, but there is no need to be scared at the simple prospect of making your mouse wireless. Hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t really. Even if you found a wireless USB-USB adaptor (these probably exist) it\u2019d still be attached to the end of the USB cable, meaning your mouse is still effectively wired\u2026 Without extensive modding by someone skilled in electronics, this isn\u2019t going to happen. There are mice that are dual wired/wireless spec (my old razer naga epic being an example) But said mice had wireless functionality built-in from the start. ",
