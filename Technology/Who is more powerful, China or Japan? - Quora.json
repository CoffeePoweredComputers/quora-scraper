            "answer_text": "Ignorance and nationalism abound I see! First, let's satisfy everyone and admit that both countries are major powers, especially in economic terms. Second, we should cover that the answer to this question depends on how you qualify it- do you mean economically? Militarily? Weight in international affairs? Are we looking at each country just by themselves, or in alliance with other powers? Are we measuring power in the region or on a global scale? Economically, China has now overtaken Japan (since 2010), and is a growing, still rising power. On the other hand, Japan has been experiencing stagnation and deflation for the past twenty years or so (dubbed the 'Lost Decades') for the past twenty years or so, ever since the collapse of the 'Bubble' economy in the early 1990s. Despite 'Abenomics' and efforts to 'revive' Japan, the era of 'Japan as No. 1' is unimaginable in the future. Of course, standard of living wise, Japan as a developed nation is miles ahead of China as a developing nation. Nominal GDP 2014 (USD million)1\t United States\t17,418,9252\t China\t10,380,3803\t Japan\t4,616,335 Purchasing Power Parity 2014 (USD billion)1\t China\t17,617.32\t United States\t17,418.93\t India\t7,375.94\t Japan\t4,750.8    Technologically, Japan has been a stronghold of innovation for the past fifty years or so, but China is rapidly catching up. A trend dubbed 'Galapagosisation' is also crippling Japanese technological competitiveness overseas, with too many Japanese manufacturers focusing excessively on their domestic market. This has led to former world-brands like Sony and Panasonic to give way to Chinese and South Korean companies. You may have heard recently about another electronics giant going down: Sharp Shares Plunge Ahead of Restructuring. In comparison, Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Lenovo are doing pretty well and poised to do better.  Militarily, there's no question about it. China has the 2nd largest military expenditure in the world at $216 billion (Stockholm International Peace Institute estimate for 2015), whilst Japan is hamstrung by 1) the 'Peace Clause' (Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution) which bans standing armed forces, 2) a self-imposed low ceiling of military spending (around 1% in the 70s, currently at a record of $42 billion, or 2.8%) and 3) popular sentiment which does not want Japan to re-arm or to get involved in military affairs overseas. China also has nuclear weapons, Japan does not.   Of course, the variable in this is that Japan is the United States' key ally in the Asia-Pacific, and firmly under the (nuclear) umbrella of US defense. Okinawa is a major military base for the US forces (second-largest for the air forces). If the two countries were to go to war, the US wouldn't just sit back and watch. Obama says US will defend Japan in island dispute with China With regards to foreign affairs and diplomacy, it's a bit more even handed. China has the upper hand with the permanent seat in the UN Security Council, and as a rising power it's getting a lot of attention from the world right now. However, with its problems regarding human rights, territorial conflicts, lack of democratic values and engagement with North Korea (essentially propping up the regime) also diminishes its influence as a power and authority, both globally and regionally. With the founding of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank however, it looks like China's influence in the world is only going to increase.  Japan has had a better record, as a major donor to the UN, participating in peacekeeping efforts and sending humanitarian assistance and creating initiatives like the Asian Development Bank. It also wields a lot of influence in South East Asia, which has been the primary beneficiary of Japanese ODA. However, Japanese efforts are majorly hampered by their inability to contribute significantly in a military manner to global peacekeeping. In the First Gulf War for instance, Japan sent $13 billion for the war effort but didn't commit troops. This was seen as throwing money at the problem (mocked as 'chequebook diplomacy') rather than true engagement, and Kuwait famously did not thank Japan in the aftermath of the war. Since then Japan has become more 'active' in engagement with global affairs, but problems of insularity persist, and how much they can truly do with Article 9 in place remains in question. Prime Minister Abe is currently looking to revise the constitution for the first time, which may serve as the first step to Japan becoming a 'normal country' (one that can deploy troops overseas and engage in collective self defense).   Within the region, Japan's increasing shift towards the right in recent years has considerably worsened its relations with neighbouring countries (mainly South Korea and China) and its role in the region is becoming increasingly prohibited. Whilst Chinese attitudes have also ruffled feathers, middle powers in the region (Japan, India and South Korea, for whom China are the largest trading partners) are too economically dependent on Chinese trade to try and isolate or balance against China.  All in all, China is the stronger power, and for a while at least, will continue to rise in its significance and influence. The more appropriate question to ask, if at all, is whether China will rise to be the G2, along with the United States. ",

China also possesses a stronger military force( this might be controversial for some people, so please refer to other military-related topics ) Japan is also heavily dependent on the U.S., whereas China as a whole is more independent.
