            "answer_text": "If you're trying to decide on a career path, you might be better served by looking to yourself and what interests you. You should make decisions based on what you like, rather than wondering which one has \"scope for the future\" If you're trying to compare the two, the answer is not so simple. This is because comparing cloud computing to big data analytics are two very different things. What we define as \"scope\" for these two terms differ within their specific contexts. Big data refers to the huge quantities of data we have. Big data analytics is the process of understanding this large amount of information. This means that big data's scope in the future will revolve around extracting knowledge from a large amount of information we have access to. Cloud computing, on the other hand, refers to a platform. This platform is often used to access computer facilities, such as data storage, or used to run programs and applications over the internet. This means that the scope of cloud computing isn't concerned with what information gets delivered, so much as how the information gets delivered. Cloud computing and big data are far from being in competition. A good demonstration is Enterprise Application Software (EAS). This kind of software is developed with the needs of an organization in mind, as opposed to individual users. EAS handles the \"big data\" of an entire corporation or organization and delivers services to the users through cloud computing.

            "answer_text": "Big Data and Cloud Computing is indispensable to the business world today. Big Data provides keen business insights. Cloud Computing makes it possible to store this data and ensure that it is easily accessible. It is like storage space available virtually to the users. In fact, these two terms are increasingly being viewed as one. Such huge data sets cannot do without cloud storage. At the same time this kind of data is colossal business for the cloud. And together they provide a treasure trove of job opportunities for all those who are interested in the field. If you are planning a career then this field would undoubtedly be a good choice. Just as the cloud is growing steadily, we are also noticing an explosion of information across the web. Social media is a completely different world, where both marketers and common users generate loads of data every day. Organizations and institutions are also creating data on a daily basis, which can eventually become difficult to manage. Take a look at these statistics on Big Data generation in the last five years: 2.5 quintillion bytes (2.3 Trillion Gigabytes) of data are created every day.40 zettabytes (43 Trillion Gigabytes) of data will be created by 2020.Most companies in the US have at least 100 Terabytes (100,000 Gigabytes) of stored data.These high volumes of data present a challenge to the cloud environment. How to manage and secure the essence of this data rather than just stacking it? It seems like cloud computing and big data are an ideal combination for this. Together, they provide a solution which is both scalable and accommodating for big data and business analytics. The analytics advantage is going to be a huge benefit in today\u2019s world. Imagine all the information resources which will become easily accessible. Every field of life can benefit from this information. Here to Stay: Newer technologies have made it possible to analyze extremely large and varied data sets with increased sophistication for instance Apache Hadoop. This is creating much value for organizations and assisting in business growth. The convenience of accessibility and cost effectiveness provided by cloud technology in handling these huge amounts of data has ensured that Big Data and Cloud Computing is here to stay. Wide Usage: According to the International Data Corporation the worldwide market for Big Data Analytics was around $ 125 billion in 2015. Building customers is essentially a data job. It is expected that in 2016 more and more businesses will come to understand this important fact. Data analytics is being used in a range of industries like banking, media and communications, transportation, health care, entertainment, retail and wholesale, education, insurance and so on. This is a worldwide phenomenon since such data can be accessed anywhere with Cloud Computing. There are no geographical barriers in doing so. Growing Demand: With growth in use of these technologies the demand for trained professionals is growing too. Cloud provides secure, convenient and less expensive virtual storage for colossal amounts of data. Technical business and financial skills, project management acumen, training in data integration and analysis as well as knowledge about how to provide security for all this data are essential for any professional interested in a career in cloud technology. Business world today cannot do without these professionally qualified individuals. Now all this data on the cloud is of no use unless it is analyzed by someone. Skills to analyze these datasets are thus much in demand. Information Technology professionals trained in data analysis can harness the power of Big Data for companies and are much sought after. Data scientists and Analytics consultants are the need of the hour. As per the graph depicting job trends in Indeed and other job sites, job opportunities for Data Analytics and Cloud Computing are on a steady rise equally. Less Supply: The world over demand for professionals so trained is very high and supply does not match the demand. There is a skill gap which needs to be filled. India has the maximum number of professionals in Big Data and Cloud Computing but still there are many jobs available in the arena as the world is outsourcing to us. The demand for individuals trained in these skills is projected to rise further in times to come. Salary: In comparison starting salary for Big Data analysts as a beginner would be comparatively higher than a Cloud Computing expert. However on a later stages, they would be equally in demand and in terms of cost to a company. Variety of Roles: There are a variety of job profiles in the arena of Big Data and Cloud Computing. You can take your pick according to your talent and interest. Some of the options in the field of Big Data are Data Analytics Business Consultant, Analytics Architect, Data Engineer, Solution Architect, Data Analyst, Analytics Associate, Business Intelligence and Analytics Consultant, Metrics and Analytics Specialist. Cloud Computing too has many options to offer. These are Cloud Software Engineer, Project Manager, Business Analyst, Cloud Network Architect/Planner, Product Manager, Cloud Developer/Programmer, Consultant, Cloud Systems Engineer, Systems Administrator and Network Engineer. So the world is lying in wait for all the Big Data and Cloud Computing professionals. This is the ideal time to walk on this career path. Success and wealth will be a dream, come true with the right qualifications and training in the arena!! Both of the fields are equally challenging and highly in demand for atleast a decade or more. Me as a person working in the field of cloud computing closely, would be inclined towards that, but that doesn't make Big Data opportunities any lesser attractive. I would suggest that you check on tools and knowledge required on both fields and choose on topic which suits you more. There is no way we can compare these two fields on the basis of scope, since both are growing and future lies in both. Hope this helps. ",
