However, this is just a common use among many type of business. But, the use of AI totally depends on what kind of business you are running.

If it\u2019s not your country then it\u2019s most likely a fraud. AI can alert and block your card.

So you can use it in a creative way to aid in your business. Don\u2019t forget you\u2019ll need to collect tons of data first and you\u2019ll require data scientists to do all the maths for you. ",
