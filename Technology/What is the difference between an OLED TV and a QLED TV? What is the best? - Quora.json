            "answer_text": "TV tech can be confusing. Especially with hard-to-understand technology that all sounds similar and so many acronyms to remember. If you\u2019re in the market for a new TV then knowing the difference between these acronyms could very well influence your purchase. Although it may seem like there's new TV tech vocabulary to learn every week, the OLED vs QLED rivalry is shaping up to be the central question for premium TV buyers nowadays. So what do these names mean? And which one is right for you? First up, let\u2019s take a look at OLED - In an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) TV the display is made up of organic compounds that light up when fed electricity and shut down without it. OLED TV displays are a kind of spiritual successor to the plasma TV. There is no chunky LCD backlight so consoles are lighter and thinner. Since light is emitted on a pixel-by-pixel basis, bright whites or colored pixels can appear next to blacks without being impacted. Pros of OLED - Lighter and thinnerBetter Response time, input lag, and refresh rateSome QLED TVs have improved in terms of viewing angle, with anti-reflective layers helping, but OLED maintains a clear advantage.More convincing blacks.Cons of OLED - Limited screen sizesExpensiveHigher risk of picture burn-inSmaller lifespanMuted brightness.What is QLED? First, there were LCD TVs, then LED TVs, now there are QLED TVs \u2013 each is a step up from the one before. QLED stands for Quantum Light-Emitting Diode. In non-geek-speak, that means a QLED TV is just like a regular LED TV, except it uses tiny nano particles called quantum dots to super-charge its brightness and color. The experience is more cinematic with vivid, precise colors and enhanced brightness. The experience is more cinematic with vivid, precise colors and enhanced brightness. Pros of QLED - QLED TVs have a considerable advantage when it comes to brightness.More lifelike color.Brilliant whitesVariety of screen sizesMore size OptionsCons of QLED - Overly brightLess viewing angleSlower refresh rateNot as slimSo, Which is better? OLED or QLED? There is always a confusion in the battle of QLED Vs OLED TVs but, both of these technologies are impressive in their own ways, whether you buy a QLED or OLED TV can depend on a few factors. If you watch a lot of high action sports or movies then OLED is believed to be the superior technology. But you\u2019ll probably pay more for it because OLED TVs tend to be on the larger size e.g. over 60 inches. So if you have a small room then a TV of this size doesn\u2019t make much sense. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok long story short, OLED comprises Microscopic LEDs similar to what we see in indoor LED lights etc. these microscopic LEDs produce both light and colour to create an image that we can view. LCDs are different from OLEDs as they can only produce colour, behind the LCD panel lies the \u2018Backlight\u2019 that illuminates the pixels that the panel produces by shining a white light though it in the process creating an image that we can view. Quantum Dot or QLED TVs as Samsung likes to call them, is basically an LCD on steroids or rather a better more refined version of an LCD. It still requires a backlight to illuminate the panel from behind to work, but due to advancements in technology, it can produce more vibrant and true to life colours when compared to traditional LCD/LED TVs. One last point, since OLEDs don\u2019t require a backlight and can illuminate themselves so they can have \u2018infinite contrast ratio\u2019(Brightest point/Darkest Point), since if a part of the picture is \u2018black\u2019 that perticular part of the OLED screen can be turned off, effectively creating perfect \u2018black\u2019 colour. Whereas if a traditional LCD were to recreate the same image, the darkest part of the image(black colour) would be the \u2018Darkest possible grey\u2019, as the LCD can create black colour, but since it can\u2019t illuminate the pixels itself, the black colour lit up by the White backlight creates the Dark Grey and hence lower Contrast ratio.
