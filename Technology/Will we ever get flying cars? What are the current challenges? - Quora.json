            "answer_text": "Will we ever get flying cars? What are the current challenges? We may see wide-spread use of flying cars someday, but it\u2019s a long way off. In my opinion, it\u2019s way off and may never happen. A few things to consider: There are no \u201cfender-benders\u201d in the air. Mid-air collisions are almost invariably fatal, which is why so much of air traffic control procedures revolves around keeping traffic separated. Proper traffic separation among aircraft is challenging enough these days \u2014 I frankly don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible if you add hundreds of thousands or millions of flying cars.The air traffic control system we have today absolutely cannot accommodate the increase in traffic that flying cars would represent. Expect a huge increase in taxes to fundamentally change the ATC infrastructure, or expect huge user fees.If it ever comes, the Age of Flying Cars may be short-lived. Try to imagine the first time two flying cars collide (killing everyone onboard, of course) then plummet to Earth in two separate balls of flaming wreckage, and wipe out two families in their homes, as well as setting fire to six other houses. Now imagine this happening, say, once a week.The manufacturer\u2019s liability on flying cars is going to be enormous. The last figure I heard is that about a quarter of the cost of a small plane is the manufacturer\u2019s liability insurance. It\u2019s going to be far worse for flying cars, because unless you expect every driver to get a pilot\u2019s license (a long, expensive process), the flying cars are going to be highly automated, which means that when they fail, it\u2019s harder to put all the blame exclusively on the driver.With cars, the trend is to make them greener and greener. Electric cars are all the rage. By comparison, flying cars are much browner (or whatever the opposite of \u201cgreen\u201d is). Electric aircraft are barely a curiosity, which leaves us with flying cars that use internal combustion engines. Airplane engines tend to be dirtier than car engines, because in an airplane reliability has to be the top priority. You keep the engine simple and dependable, even if that means far higher emissions. It\u2019s going to have to be the same way with flying cars. Lose an engine in a flying car, and you don\u2019t just pull over to the side of the road \u2014 loss of life will likely follow.Headline: \u201cFlying car hits Airbus A380. 600 dead, 50 still missing.\u201d It\u2019s just a matter of time. Consider: Above: Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 182 right after a Cessna 172 hit it. A C172 is a 4-seater, about the same size as what we\u2019d expect for a flying car. The accident killed all 135 people aboard the airliner, both of the people aboard the C172, and seven people on the ground, and injured nine people on the ground. 22 homes were destroyed or damaged. Development of a practical flying car involves so much more than just building a car that can get off the ground. It\u2019s a recipe for disaster, and anyone who is serious about building a flying car will have to figure out how to keep it from becoming a disaster. Marianne Kooiman has a great answer that address some of these points and more \u2014 be sure to read it: Marianne Kooiman's answer to Will we ever get flying cars? What are the current challenges?

            "answer_text": "Because a car is not an airplane. We already have things that fly in the sky. You can get one today. But why don\u2019t we call that thing a car? For the same reason we don\u2019t call boats \u201cwater cars\u201d. The requirements for a water craft are different than the requirements for a land craft which are different than the requirements for an aircraft. Can you build an amphibious vehicle that can travel on both land and water? Of course you can, and such things are built all the time. The problem for an amphibious vehicle is that it\u2019s both a crappy car and a crappy boat at the same time. When it\u2019s on land all the features that allow it to travel in water are useless, when it\u2019s in the water all the features that allow it to travel on land are useless. And so these vehicles are mainly confined to military and other specialty applications, where the user expects both frequent water travel and frequent land travel on the same trip. But if you want an amphibious car, you can go right ahead and buy one off the shelf. Now, why am I bringing this up? Because if you want a really good car, you\u2019re not going to buy an amphibious car. If you want a really good boat, you\u2019re not going to buy an amphibious car. In fact, for almost any civilian applications you\u2019re better off and will save money buying a good car and a good trailer and a good boat than you would by buying an amphibious car. It turns out that the requirements for an aircraft are even more exacting than the requirements for a watercraft. We\u2019ve had boats for thousands of years. When was the airplane invented again? It takes a lot to get a metal contraption off the ground, especially if the requirement is that can hold a human being and return them to the ground in one piece. So what exactly is a \u201cflying car\u201d? Is it thing that looks like a car, but can fly? Not actually possible by the laws of physics, unless you\u2019ve just invented antigravity. So the only thing that people can mean by \u201cflying car\u201d is an aircraft that you can also drive on the street. Except\u2026.why do you want a roadable aircraft again? You can fly, so why do you need to drive? And if you\u2019re building a flying machine, every ounce that you put into making it roadworthy is an ounce that makes it a shittier aircraft. And since a common consequence of making a mistake with an aircraft is plummeting to a fiery death, maybe if you\u2019re making a flying machine you want to focus on the flying part. So you can have a vehicle that can fly, you can get one today. There are even a few flying vehicles that can drive on the roads, sort of. But a roadable aircraft is a very crappy car, and a very very crappy aircraft. You\u2019d be much better off not dying if you got a decent aircraft and a decent car instead. Wait, you don\u2019t want an aircraft? You want a flying car? Dude, what exactly is a \u201cflying car\u201d then? A vehicle that is as safe as a car, as roomy as a car, as easy to pilot as a car, as cheap as a car, but that can fly through the air? There is no such thing. All those flying cars you saw in science fiction in the 1950s? Those guys looked at the technical advances of the Wright Brothers in 1903, the aircraft of World War I, the interwar aircraft, the aircraft of World War II, and then the postwar aircraft of the early Cold War, and figured that the curve was just going to go up and up until by 2020 the average family car would be capable of flying to Pluto over a weekend. But that didn\u2019t happen. It turns out that rather than an exponential curve, advances in aircraft design followed a sigmoid curve. And by the time we reached the 1960s aircraft design had essentially reached a plateau. Instead of revolutionary advances happening one after another as had been seen in the first half of the 20th century, the second half would show small incremental improvements. From the Wright Flyer the in 1903 to the Boeing 747 was 60 years. The aircraft of 2020 are better than the aircraft of 1960, but today\u2019s aircraft don\u2019t make the 747 look like the Wright Flyer. The flying cars of science fiction were based on the idea that we still had many more revolutionary advances in aircraft technology ahead of us. Nuclear power, control over gravity, or other advances in physics would in the near future make the supersonic jets of the 1960s look like toys. Instead the jets of the 1960s look pretty much like the jets of 2020. All the advances in flight technology that have happened since the 60s have been in secondary fields like materials science, industrial design, computers and sensors. The basic physics of moving a metal contraption through the air hasn\u2019t changed. And that is why you don\u2019t have the flying car you were promised by Hugo Gernsback. You can have a blimp. You can have a helicopter. You can have an autogyro. You can have an airplane. You can have a VTOL airplane. You can even have a human piloted rocket if you don\u2019t care whether you live or die. But you aren\u2019t going to want to drive any of those things down the street to park in front of your suburban ranch house. And if you get one, it will only have evolutionary improvements compared to the aircraft you could get in the 1960s. ",
