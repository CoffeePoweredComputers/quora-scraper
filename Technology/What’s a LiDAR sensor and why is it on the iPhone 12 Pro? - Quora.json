            "answer_text": " LiDAR is not a new thing it is taken in a scanning system many times before. Apple also uses the LiDAR before in their iPad pro 2020. But this is the first time that Apple uses this in their smartphone. But the question here is how it actually works and what difference is it going to make in a smartphone device. And the answer is very basic, LiDAR Stands for Light Detection and Ranging and is used to measures the distance, position, height, and shape of an object. The working process of LiDAR is very simple It emits the light waves and then these waves bounce back from the object. And that way the scanner knows the distance, position, and all the other properties of an object in the surrounding. And in iPhone 12 the LiDAR helps you in AR modes so the additional generated information in photos looks more real and fits accurately. And because the LiDAR scanner works in dark the low lighting photos are more improved in the iPhone 12. And the focus on objects is easy while clicking the low lighting photos. ",

            "answer_text": "The job of Lidar sensor which stands for (Light Detection and Ranging) is to 'map' the area surrounding it by measuring distances of objects via reflecting light rays. It is present on the iphone 12 pro because the manufacturer claims that this sensor will enhance the autofocusing capabilities of the iphone 12 pro and will make it 6 times faster in low light as compared to normal camera and will enhance the overall low-light photography of the smartphone. I hope it helps. Thank you. ",
