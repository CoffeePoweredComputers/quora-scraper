            "answer_text": "Length is a function of purpose Presentations can be too long or too short. The popular adage that shorter is better is flawed. An audience has no problem watching a Shakespeare play that might last anything from 1 to 2 hours. Some operas are between four and six hours long. Context is everything. If you don\u2019t like plays, or long operas, you won\u2019t go and watch them. The presentation must fit the purpose. With this in mind I offer the following guidelines. Ask your host. If you have been booked to speak for 20 minutes, speak for 20 minutes. If your host will not give you a definitive answer, ask them what the audience typically seem to prefer.Audience expectations. What are they used to? If they are expecting a 45 minute talk and you give them 20 minutes they may feel cheated.Format. If your presentation is a didactic lecture, the length will depend upon the amount of material you are expected to communicate and your skill at engaging your audience while speaking. However, if your presentation is broken up with audio, visuals and/or audience interaction, you will be speaking less and the length will depend more on your skills as an all-round presenter. Where are you strong and weak regarding your presentation skills?Setting. Is the venue likely to be very hot and stuffy? Very cold? In more extreme conditions you would do well to consider speaking more briefly. The attention of your audience will be compromised.Situation. Will your audience be tired? Are you speaking just after lunch? On the other hand, have they just been hyped up by a previous presentation? The length of your presentation could well be influenced by the mood of your listeners.Your aim should be less to speak for a particular length of time, but more to be effective in communicating what is truly important. In general, do this in as short a time as possible. God bless, Malcolm Teaching Tips here. ",

            "answer_text": "Length of a presentation depends on the agenda of the presentation but still I would suggest to keep it not more than 20 minutes because thats the average attention span of an individual. Presentations with a shorter length are more concise and focused. Since they get to the point, make the point and summarise the point. Some of the benefits of a shorter presentation are listed below : There\u2019s more attention on you.Your audience can focus on your content.There\u2019s more time for questions.Your audience has time for discussion.Try and follow minimalistic approach where less is more \u2013 The 10/20/30 Rule of PowerPoint by Guy Kawasaki ( 10 slides, 20 Minutes, 30 Point Font ). Hope this answers your question. ",
