            "answer_text": "if he's not consistent texting you, calling you, and asking you out for proper dates, he's using you. Depending on your age, say you're in college, a date can mean a coffee at Starbucks. Of course, smile and say thank you and don't be a demanding shrew who feels entitled to a $200 dinner on a first date. Always have enough cash in hand to pay your way and get a cab home if need be. If he doesn't pay, don't make a scene or else you'll develop a reputation as a gold digger in your circles. Simply smile, pay for your portion, wish him a polite goodbye, and drop him. If a guy is truly interested in you, he'll happily pay for the date.If he goes weeks MIA and then randomly texts (usually at night) because he wants a booty call. Delete his number.If he asks for dirty pics. delete and block him asapIf he is inconsistent (see #1). No one is \u201ctoo busy\u201d to send a text. He is soooooo busy he doesn't have five seconds to send a text? Yeah I don't think so. When a guy likes you, he somehow makes time for a gal he likes.5. If he's been taking you out on a handful of dates for 1\u20132 months, you should know exactly where you stand with him. Does he call you his girlfriend? If he is hopping on one foot to the other, nervously bouncing around and unable to answer the question, he's using you and likely doing the same to other women. Drop him. 6. If he doesn't formally introduce you to his family and friends after a certain time period or doesn't want to meet your family. This is shorter time for Americans and longer for Indians, for example. But use your judgment. 7. If he doesn't do anything romantic for your birthday or Valentine's Day. If you're in college, a box of candy and some flowers should suffice. If you're 30, he needs to do that and take you out somewhere and do something special. If he completely ignores either occasion, he's an ass and you need to tell him \u201cI'm sorry but this isn't working out\u201d. 8. If he cheats, he's out. No going back. No sorry no tears etc. Ways to avoid being used\u2026don't respond to night time texts. Delete and block any guy who asks for nudes. Drop any guy who wants a text message pen pal buddy. Don't get intimate too quickly. Drop any guy who doesn't pay for dates; the dates need not be lavish but if he doesn't have $15 to buy you a sandwich is he really in a position to have a girlfriend? Let him be the one to pursue. In the beginning, let him be the one to call or to travel to see you 2/3\u20133/4 of the time. Once the relationship is established, then it can be more equal. Don't move in with him until you're officially engaged. People something more when they have to work for it. Don't be a bitch but don't be too easy to get either. The way I'd sum this up is \u201ca girl should be hard to get but easy to be with\u201d. Don't accept a last minute date. You're busy and need at least two day in advance notice to keep him on his toes. Once on the date, however, be pleasant to be with; don't order the most expensive entree on the menu, don't complain about the place, smile at him, be polite and engaging, say please and thank you, and be gracious. Pick your fights wisely. Before starting a fight ask yourself if it's worth it. Is it REALLY a big deal that he got you lillies when he should know that you like roses? Hey, at least he got you flowers! Perhaps he insinuated that your hairstyle isn't to his liking. cmon! Give him a break. This does not mean you're a doormat. If he insults you or does something not ok, absolutely confront him.",

            "answer_text": "People are often trying to take advantage of you and it\u2019s not always a \u201cbad thing\u201d. People do things that work to THEIR advantage and for THEIR benefit. True altruism is rare. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Murphy\u2019s Bar,\u201d your friend says. Is it because he wants you to have fun or because he happens to like that bar, needs a drink, wants company or a wing man and so on? If he picks up a girl there and you\u2019re left alone at the bar, have you been taken advantage of? Maybe. Were you harmed? Probably not. It\u2019s not a \u201che wins, I lose\u201d situation. Where people try to create a lose-win scenario such that you lose and they win is the problem. This is what you see when people try to manipulate you into doing something you don\u2019t want to do so that they benefit. This can be for any outcome, from their entertainment in humiliating you to separating you from your money to getting you to do something they don\u2019t want to do. Tom Sawyer suckered his friends into painting the fence for him in the famous book. Anyone who tries to question your manhood, cajole, threaten, humiliate or beg you into doing something you don\u2019t want to do is usually doing it for their benefit - not yours. Sometimes they want you to pull the tail of the tiger so they can watch you be punished or humiliated. Sometimes they want you to participate in some activity to \u201cspread the blame\u201d or even bolster their own courage. However, sometimes, they are being altruistic and want you to step out of your comfort zone and grow. So even then you have to consider the outcome and the motivation. One of the things I often say on Quora is that one of the best things about being an adult is that you don\u2019t need a reason to do or not do something. If someone is trying to cajole you into doing something you don\u2019t want to do, simply saying \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it\u201d is sufficient reason. They will plead for you to argue so they can knock down your arguments and do what THEY want you to do. But you don\u2019t need to argue. You just need to say \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d The other thing you can do is walk away. When people are trying to manipulate you and are heckling you into doing their bidding you need only walk away. Developing friends, lovers, colleagues, customers and so forth is the result of a built-up trust relationship. You observe people\u2019s behavior over time and you extend trust based on the results of that behavior. When you first meet someone you extend them \u201ctrust credit\u201d, that is, the basic trust that includes not shooting/stabbing them on sight and believing they won\u2019t do the same to you. You\u2019re extending them trust they haven\u2019t earned on credit. Their subsequent behavior allows them to either pay off that trust credit - or for you to revoke it and never turn your back on them or trust them or anything they say. We are doing this all the time. The clerk at the 7/11 is forced to extend trust credit to every stranger that walks in the door and he extends as little as his minimum wage pay allows because sooner or later he is going to be betrayed by a guy with a gun who wants to take advantage of him and rob the register. However, another customer who comes in day after day and purchases the same pack of cigarettes may get a rather large trust-credit such that the clerk might ask him to \u201cwatch the store while I take a leak\u201d. He is taking a risk based on his observation of behavior over time. People who enter into romantic relationships sometimes fail to do their due-diligence in the observation behavior. Their hormones or desperation or desire cause them to make a crack-observation about someone and offer them, with no good reason, their entire trust credit line. Those people are usually betrayed. On the other hand, there are people who talk the talk and walk the walk just long enough to get that credit extended long enough to convince their mark to give up the thing they seek, be it sex, money, submission, whatever. They are \u201ccon men\u201d and this happens a great deal. So-called \u201cpick-up artists\u201d are people who are adept at getting others to trust them quickly for the purpose of having sex and then running away. In reality, nothing is ever lost by patience in a real relationship and people who say things like \u201cIf you really loved me you would\u2026\u201d or \u201cI know we just met but I feel so right, so strongly about you\u2026 if only we could\u2026\u201d are saying it to close the deal and get what they want. In building trust one watches how a partner acts in a variety of situations. How does he treat the receptionist? The car valet? The waitress? His mother? A store clerk who makes a mistake? Someone who cuts him off in traffic? A babbling mentally handicapped person? A homeless beggar on the street? A stray cat? A noisy child? There are no perfect people but how someone treats all these varieties is probably how he will treat you when the newness is gone. People don\u2019t often change their behavior. They do what they\u2019ve always done so they can get what they always got, at least for this moment. Even if it\u2019s a losing strategy in the long run. There is an expression that goes, \u201cIt\u2019s better to be sometimes cheated than not to trust.\u201d This means that to move forward in life you have to take a risk. You have to decide to extend your \u201ctrust credit line\u201d further than you might want to, even risk getting hurt, because the alternative is to live a life of fear and that\u2019s no good either. You have to risk to make progress and often that means trusting. Sometimes you can only find out if someone is trustworthy by trusting them. You take the risk, maybe on the basis of a thousand unconscious observations; maybe on the basis that someone you trust trusted them. You have to do this or you would never leave the house. You would always be in terror of being cheated. In the end you are often getting taken advantage of when you feel badly about yourself or the outcome and don\u2019t see any good coming your way. Sometimes it\u2019s as small as a telemarketer soliciting donations for a fake charity or one that keeps 90 percent of the proceeds; there you can at least feel good that you meant well. Or it can be as large as someone who manipulates you so they can cheat on you, even after being with you for some time, for their own selfish ends. You were fooled and it\u2019s not your fault. People often don\u2019t remember what you say but they always remember how you made them feel. If you feel good about yourself, about what you\u2019ve done, about the other person then you were not taken advantage of - even if you were - because you gained something of value, be it esteem, joy, experience, fun or comradeship. How you feel about the transaction often determines if you are being conned or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Think about if that person has ever specifically wanted something from you. They'd bring it up every so often. Sometimes subtly sneak it into conversations. Maybe even guilt you into doing it for them. Have you felt guilty after they asked for something and you didn't give it, even if it was justifiable and reasonable for you to not give in?Once you've given them something, physical or non-physical, you feel like you've lost something. You often think about taking it back or never have given it at all, and ruminate over what could have been done differently.They show little to no compassion or concern for you. You may shower them in attention and empathy, but in the end, they never ask how you are doing, what you've been doing, or just aren't that interested in you until you have something they want. They'll often switch subjects when you start to talk about yourself or things pertaining to yourself, or stare off into the distance, or even just leave. Bottom line is: they don't care, and it's not that obvious if you're infatuated/care about them until you begin to think about it.They stop talking after you've given them what they want. The calls, texts, everything just stops. Sometimes they'll text or call again when they want something again. They're pretty much professionals at taking advantage. Most of the people who take advantage of others have just grown up doing this and are pretty used to it, they usually think nothing of it. In their mind, you are just an object or obstacle in their path to get what they want, and if they want it bad enough, they'll pull out all the tricks. Remember, they've done this before. They'll be really convincing at the time and they'll probably leave you thinking, \u201cis it right to question them?\u201dMake a list of your doubts and worries about them. Sometimes writing things out can help you clear your mind of all those jumbled, racing thoughts, and get down to the facts. Write about times they seemed sketchy or weird, write every little detail that stands out. Then, slowly, just begin to narrow it down. Remember that people are imperfect, and everyone has their flaws, but when their imperfections begin to impact you negatively, you have every right to take a step back and set boundaries. Begin to realise that people only treat you how you let them. Begin to step back from giving away pieces of yourself to people who will only stomp on them. Begin to see these behaviors, recognize when others expect things out of you and ask yourself, \u201cis this a reasonable expectation?\u201d before you bend over backwards.Prevent it. Stop and think before doing things for others. If you have to think for more than a minute, you're probably putting yourself in a situation to be taken advantage of. Simply say no. That's your right. You may think about yourself as a bitch afterwards, but being a bitch in someone's mind is better than living with heartache and hurt.Value yourself more. Realise that you are worth much more than you think. Find confidence in yourself, start loving yourself. People are much more likely to take advantage of a person who is insecure or in a bad state of mind than a person who is confident and loves themselves. It's sad, but true. I speak from experience. People really don't mess with me now as much as they did when I was in the dumps. Just like the lions, the predators look for the weakest prey for a fulfilling and easy meal. Sometimes, finding confidence and self love requires counselling, therapy methods, and medications. All of it with be worth it in the end. Don\u2019t give up on yourself, don't beat yourself down. Keep moving forward. Be hesitant in giving things to people who don't care about you. Look for the signs, always be aware. Every experience is a learning experience. As long as you continue to move forward, everything will be ok in the end.You must be strong. It is ok to take time to feel your emotions and process them. But if you let your past shape your personality and control your future, you will only experience hurt much longer than you have to. Your future belongs to you.",

            "answer_text": "He will often be the one deciding things for you both to do, or get you to do what he wants. When it comes to intimacy such as sex then he may try to show interest and want to meet you and play on your feelings by using charm and playing the \u201cnice gentleman\u201dwhen his main intention is to try to have sex with you, and when it\u2019s done and he\u2019s satisfied, he may not contact you or show you so much interest until he feels the need for more sex. He may \u201cwine and dine\u201d you, buy you gifts, court you in different ways, all for the reason to get what he is really after -whats between your legs, and then show less interest or have less contact through phone calls, text messaging and social media afterwards. If you don\u2019t know him that well or even after a couple of moments of contacting you, if some of the first words he says to you or in the first conversations mentions anything related to your body, that it\u2019s sexy in different ways, then this is a pretty clear indication worth thinking about, about what he is really after and the only reason why he is having any kind of contact with you at all. He can be playing on your feelings by pretending to like you. He can tell you sweet things that will \u201ctickle your ears\u201d or make you feel like he is interested and tries to make you feel special, these tactics are quite common when trying to get someone in bed with them. There are many ways men can try to use someone, but sex can be the most common thing that they are after when they use someone. If you are wealthy then that is also something they will target. They can be charming and seem like the perfect guy and seem sincere, but they are doing it for their own selfish gain. Some may use people just so they have a place to live for the time being until they get things sorted out, and when they do, they\u2019ll dump you and leave. If you are in some kind of position in a business or if you are involved in something that he also wants to be a part of, then men (as well as women) will also target you just to get to where they want to be in those areas or positions where they\u2019ll profit somehow.

            "answer_text": "If they are clever enough, you won't now until they've already done the job and left!  Since taking advantage of people is generally done with craftiness and concealing both motives and methods, it's just plain not easy.  And once they've started (say, someone sells you siding for your home, then they say you have dry rot and need a whole new wall first, and they know JUST THE PERSON who can re-do your wall)... well, you can see that the question is more likely, \"How can I detect craftiness and dishonesty so I don't get taken advantage of in the first place?\"   Second opinions rate high on this list.  Red-flag emotional appeals (\"I need the money from making this sale to get my wife a doctor's appointment...\") are worth less than the cost of a red flag. References MUST be followed up on, and insisted upon, and don't be afraid to do some checking on your own (naturally, a deceiver will give you people in his camp).   Good actors are not just found on the stage; there are people who can get you to feel like you have known them all your life, without really telling you a single valid thing about themselves. You must decide, say, if someone habitually asks you for money or assistance of some sort, if you wish to give your money away totally freely - simply out of love for humanity, regardless of whether the appeal is genuine or a big lie.  If you wish to do so, you are freed from being taken advantage of, because you, not your emotions, are in control.  SubmitIn general, if you feel your emotions swishing from pro to con about the thing, it is likely your are being taken advantage of, or are about to be a victim. 85% of all people, said one survey I read but do not know where I read it, are completely trustworthy with money and your loved ones.  But 15% can do a huge stinking heap of damage:(  So how do you \"know\"?  Well, you actually make an educated guess -- but don't discount your native feelings, and if you're going to be a fall guy, be so because you can really be happy being taken advantage of. ",

The questions was a bit too general/vague. It matters why the person feels their man is not interested\u2026 Their situation/circumstance. But here you go. He will almost never initiate first contacts. (Text, Email, Goodmorning, Call)Discussions/interactions will be impersonal or vague. He will seem rushed or hurried when you initiate with him (he will be distant).Interactions will be brief, infrequent and have specific objectives (lets meet to have sex, to do \u201cX\u201d, or go here). Lacking spontaneous/random feelHe wont ask \u201cabout you\u201d. Questions like: \u2018What do you think\u2019, \u2018how do you feel\u2019, \u2018how did that make you feel\u2019 or \u201cWHY do you think that\u201d.\u2014These are important personal questions anyone who cares knows.Often he will talk to you at specific or predetermined times (mechanical). He will call/txt at same times (quick/brief). They wont be spontaneous. This is because he does it when on a break because he feels he needs to. Not because he wants to.\u2014 He will have you call only at specific times or request you call him on schedule always (He is doing \u201cmore important things\u201d) Make sense?He won\u2019t touch you a lot, break the personal space barrier outside of sex. Kissing will be limited too outside of specific times. Hold hands almost never, his hand on your back; neck; hip or butt in public - NEVERA male who cares about works to earn your trust, respects you, is open to you and talks. You feel good talking to them and ask them thing/for help or advice (it is hardwired/natural). You ask your man for support. A male who does not like you rarely gives advice or has this with you.His compliments while great are very sexual. Often seemed a bit forced and the same type, \u201cI love your X, Y, Z\u201d over and over. You get the most compliments before sex/intimacyHe is not vulnerable to you. You are his girl/woman. He should ask for your help, love or support. He should let you make him feel better (non sexual) or take care of him. Just means guys who use you push you. They don\u2019t seek your support, love or opinion.Finally one of the biggest: While society says we should not be. Men are shy, insecure or embarrassed. Sometimes we say / ask the wrong things or don\u2019t ask the right ones. BUT if he is using you. Rarely will he talk about what you like intimately (sex). Rarely will he want to find out what turns you on. You usually feel it, he is not putting your needs first or thinking about them (physical, emotional or intellectual). He says the right things when intimate. He gets what he wants and goes within 60 min.",

            "answer_text": "Right off, you answered it yourself. The difference between a BOY and a MAN is if they are using you or not. Being good in bed or fathering children doesn\u2019t make a boy a man any more than having a penis does. So, if he\u2019s a boy, he\u2019s using you. Taking advantage. What do YOU get out of it? Great sex? Nah. He gets that too. Do you buy him clothes? Food? Beer? Cigarettes? If you seem to be giving all the time, and he\u2019s taking, then you\u2019re getting the short end of the deal. Even a poor man can give you something. Maybe he can\u2019t take you everywhere or do things, but he can show he\u2019s thinking about you. Do things you want to do, or try. He could buy you flower or pick them, it\u2019s the thought here. But, if he only does things in public, where others can see, that\u2019s different. If you\u2019re pretty, you can be arm candy. In my experience, most boys, even at 40, are using women. Their wife, at home, is for sex when they need it, cooking, cleaning, and raising kids. Their mistress or girlfriend is to show off with, prove they can still handle women in bed, play you, and maybe even get you to shower them (!) with gifts. It used to be the other way around. A relationship is a two way street. Give AND take. If one of you is doing all the taking and the other all the giving, it isn\u2019t a relationship. I hate to say it, but women tend to be right on this. Every man who hits on you is after sex. Using you to that end. The only difference is if he cares about you past this or not. Always be careful until you KNOW where he stands. And, often, that only happens after years of being married without him cheating on you. ",

You find yourself shrinking in their presence. 10- When you text them, they either don\u2019t reply or take a very long time to reply - with no reason shared to show a bit of concern for your feelings with their tardiness. In and of itself - that\u2019s not always a big deal. BUT THEN - when you stand in front of them and texts come in to them from others - you watch them respond immediately over and over \u2026 YEAH \u2026 you are not even kind of a priority in this person\u2019s life. Why keep giving this person your time and resources? They are showing you all you need to know. Drop these kinds of people like a bad habit. ",

They don\u2019t start casual conversation with you often but once in a while when they need you to do something in favor for them.They say \u201cThank You\u201d to all the things you have done for them but never offer anything in return. Sometimes you help someone without any expectation of something back. However, it doesn\u2019t mean \u201cThank You\u201d is enough to make the relationship stay in harmony.They pay close attention to what you own and keep asking if they can have or try it someday such as your beautiful dress, your fancy sport car, or expensive watch. Of course, people may show admiration toward your valuable stuffs, but they usually give out the compliments and move on rather than asking if they can have a try.They start to ask more than what you\u2019ve already given them without concerning about your irritation. Remember those people who like to take advantage of others are usually lacking of self-respect. Therefore, they like to focus on how to get more from your materials and ignore your feeling.They make you feel like you are the only one that can help them to get out of their own problems. They keep complaining about their own misery such as no job, no money, no one helping them and ask if you can offer help. If you don\u2019t, they will start to blame that you\u2019re not a good friend, you leave them struggled without any help and so on.They are interested in sharing only some information that they think you can help them. It is acceptable in acquaintance relationship, but not in good friendship or romantic relationship. For example, your boyfriend can ask if you want to pay 50/50 for the new treadmill so both of you can share it but never tell you anything about his new car purchase or work promotion. ",

            "answer_text": "If you suspect the person is taking advantage of you, then they probably are. These kinds of doubts arise when the other person is doing something that sets off little warning bells. Examine the relationship, and see what is causing you to wonder about them. A person can take advantage of you in different ways: material, physical, emotional. Are you handing over a lot of money, expensive gifts, paying the other person\u2019s bills? Is the other person treating you like a servant? Expecting you to cater to their needs and make them happy, as if it\u2019s your job? Is the other person manipulating you sexually and misleading you? Is everything in the relationship pretty one-sided, with you being the one giving and the other person being the one who takes? If so, yes, the person is taking advantage of you. Do you have a high position, connections, social prestige, power that the other person is using to climb up the ladder and get ahead? Do you suspect that\u2019s the primary reason the person wants to be with you? Would you be together if you didn\u2019t have so much to offer? The way to avoid this is to set clear boundaries. Give what you are happy to give, and don\u2019t give more than that. Expect some gratitude for favors you do. Expect the other person to treat you with the same courtesy and concern that you show toward them. Expect the relationship to be one of give and take. Don\u2019t try to buy another person\u2019s affection or respect by constantly giving things, doing things, sacrificing in order to make the other person like you. People need to like you for who you are, not what you give them or do for them. ",

            "answer_text": "In the long run, the lie will be unsustainable, and the truth will out. But by then you have been emotionally drained and hurt. What we want to know is how to find out immediately, before the damage is done. Problem is, there are many personality types, and bringing them together \u201cRandomly\u201d makes a score of different possibilities. I shall narrow the possibilities to a few generally common types, and then I will surprise you with an unexpected ending. The term \u201cCon man\u201d is known to refer to dishonesty. Of course, it is a contraction for \u201cConfidence man\u201d. The confidence man wins your trust and good faith by being a skillful actor and liar. Since a confidence man most often targets personality types that are dependent and trusting, it is quite easy for them to take advantage. In this case a vulnerable woman may not be able to make a determination on her own. I would recommend the women who know that they are too trusting in others, develop a support network with girlfriends and ask for their assistance in evaluating the gentleman. Arrange for a group activity with the ladies intention of determining The gentleman's intentions. Then come to a consensus of opinions and advice and trust your friends. Another personality type is the follower. The follower looks to a man to be in charge and control of the relationship and is happy to demure to the man's decision-making. In this case there will be some measured degree of difficulty in assessing the gentleman's intentions. It would be possible to simply review you're romantic needs and then take a vow or make a pact, that you will focus on the gentleman's behavior and diminish your own emotional responses for a temporary Period of time to allow yourself to make the assessment. Should this be to problematic, then follow the advice from the first personality type and get support from some sisters. One last type is the self confident and practical type who has a good chance of making the determination by careful observation. Things to look for would be little contradictions that indicate a false nature, it complex story to justify a suspicious situation, indicating a lie, and a gentleman who presents one face to people, but privately expresses Contrary indications. And now for the surprise ending. Romantic marriages as we know them in western culture have a rate of failure that is much higher then another kind of marriage more common in Eastern European countries and South American countries. The arranged marriage has a much higher success rate then the western romantic marriage. A common occurrence in an arranged marriage, is that the newlyweds do not love each other. But when questioned about their feelings it is also a common answer that they soon grow to love one another. The arranged marriage is not without love it just develops. So my surprise recommendation for preventing being taken advantage of by a scoundrel is this: determine a number of persons that you trust or possibly love and ask them to make marriage recommendations for you. The reason arranged marriages work so well is because those who arrange them know the personalities and wants and desires of the people involved. Trust those who love you and know you to steer you in the right direction. The truth shall set you free. ",

            "answer_text": "You feel guilty for thinking about your needs when you are in the presence of the people taking advantage of you cause they have manipulated you in such a way like showing disappointment when you put forward your reasonable needs.The person only comes to you when they need you help and otherwise not reciprocate when you need their help or not even keep contact with you other than the time they need your help. At times these people can even talk negatively behind your back.If you have refused the person for something they might keep on insisting or getting after you to do something or even blackmail you (do this if you are my friend) or get angry if you refuse to comply with them or behave passive aggressively with you. Some might even use labeling to convince you to do something like they may say don't be such a boring person or you are scared/timid person or you are not cool.In order to avoid this firstly if you have a gut instinct that these people are not good don't ignore it. Secondly set healthy boundaries like think of what behavior is acceptable and unacceptable to you and stick to your those things. When you disagree to do something be firm about it and stick to refusing it don't change you mind if they try to persuade you to do something. Because if you give in once chances are they will keep on using various strategies to continue to convert your no to a yes, and the next time it would be for bigger requests. Disappointment is another thing they will show often to change your mind often initially when you set a boundry. Don't let that change your mind. If you consistently set boundaries firmly (by firm I am not trying to say be rude or anything instead you need to be polite but firm) they will eventually adjust with it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, and this came from the experiences of getting taken advantage of. I used to be a really nice guy and still am to an extent (although more careful), and I was always willing to help someone if I felt they needed it. This could range from small amounts of money to letting someone stay over my house to giving rides, etc. When someone is taking advantage of me it can be a bit obvious, because those that don\u2019t take advantage of my kindness behave differently. Those who take advantage will usually not compensate you, an example is giving someone a ride and they don\u2019t give you gas money, or even think to offer it. On the other hand, my friends would have offered the gas money and appreciated the favor. Like someone else has said, the best way to know if you\u2019re being taken advantage of is saying \u201cno\u201d and seeing how they react. A normal person would take the no and leave it at that, and they may be disappointed. But someone who is taking advantage will be upset that you didn\u2019t do what they wanted, and will try many methods to convince you to do something. Guilt and pity are common tactics, and sometimes they\u2019ll claim they did something for you (which could be exaggerated or simply fabricated), therefore you have an obligation to them. This is a form of manipulation. Try to tally the amount of favors you\u2019ve done for them and the amount they\u2019ve done for you. If the gap is large that tells you something. And if their behavior tends to be more hostile and selfish instead of appreciative, you\u2019re being taken advantage of. ",

Does he respect what you share with him, even if he may not agree with some things, so you make an emotional safe place for both of you to really get to know each other without fear of criticism or being put down? Secondly, is he proud to be out in public with you, not afraid to hold your hand and show other forms of normal public affection? Is he excited for you to meet the other people in his life, like his parents, siblings, friends, etc.? Third, is he reliable, such as if he cancels plans with you, does that only happen for very good reasons? If it seems to be habitual, that's a good sign that you aren't someone he respects. Never, ever let someone be your priority when for them you are merely an option\u2026 you deserve better! If you've been with him a reasonable amount of time, and this isn't happening, I'd say that he's not the fella for you and you should move on\u2026 natures abhors a vacuum, and you won't meet Mr. Right if you're spending any time or energy on Mr. Wrong.

Example: you meet a new person and they have a T-shirt you would almost kill for. You immediately plot a way to get them to give you the T-shirt. OR sometimes people take advantage of someone for the hellof it. Like most people I\u2019ve done some crappy things in my life but the one that bothers me the most was one time when I took advantage of someone in eighth grade. It was someone without any friends, and I pretended to like them just so I could walk away and make them feel bad. To this day, I wish I could remember the guy\u2019s name, it has haunted me for years. Since that day, I totally try not to do anything like that. So if you were a geeky guy in junior high in August Georgia who was really into Mandel\u2019s pea experiments and finally met someone who could share your interest\u2026.who seemed to make friends and then totally walk away laughing\u2026.I\u2019m sorry.

They don\u2019t have the nerve to talk to you in person even after all the help you\u2019ve given. Sometimes when you say you can help with such and such, they want to jump at the opportunity so quick you know something is up. A red flag lights up in the back of your mind. Of course , the kind guy that you are, you ignore the signs because you think this person can be a good real friend. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t want to help them. You would of done it anyways. Just sucks that they bail after they got help. And your left alone thinking, why did i help such and such. Every time i help someone, i get the short stick. Sooo goes another tally that tells you good deeds waste your time and goes no where. Then you lost your desire to help others in the future just cuz people aren\u2019t grateful for your help. ",

Friends trying to feed me to their dog, friends who stole my toys, friends who convinced me that bullies wanted to just \u201ctalk things over\u201d and who then went on to steal more of my and my brothers things. Classmates who would try to get me to do their homework for them, give them rides and girls who loved to have me give them massages, fix their cars, make them food and help thier families. I'm pretty good at recognizing it now. Another phrase for taking advantage of somebody is \u201cusing them\u201d. This is distinctly different from people who are investing in a relationship with you. Investing is a mutual thing. You put in something with the hope that it grows, when it grows you grow. When you part ways both of you are better. Users dont care about your growth. They don't care about your needs. So to find out which is which ask for some help. Make it small, make it commensurate with requests you've recieved from them. If they balk, if they make excuses and they continue to do so well you have your answer. Theyre using you. ",

They very skillfully manipulate your feelings. They are too sincere. They know just how to gain your sympathy.  They always have a perfect answer to questions you ask. They want you to act right now (because they know that if you think about it, you will realize that they are taking advantage of you).  Tell them you need to think about it, and see how they react. The signs are always there, but you might not see them until you've had some time to put together the pieces. Tell them you have a personal policy to not give immediate answers. ",

And you wouldn\u2019t be asking this unless it was happening.* The problem is your reluctance to see it (denial) because it means you would have to do something about it, and you are too afraid of rocking the boat relationship-wise. You fear that if you ask for fairness and to be treated with respect, you will just get dumped. I can tell you from concrete experience, it is better to stand up for yourself and get dumped. You will feel bad about the breakup, but you will feel much better about yourself and your ability to take care of yourself When a guy is taking good care of you and being respectful, you would NEVER think to wonder if you are being used. I also have experience with this. The difference is night and day. Having experienced being treated with respect and love, now I would NEVER tolerate being used. That guy would be gone so fast, his head would still be spinning a week later. ",

            "answer_text": "Using someone for your own personal gain. Typically the person being used doesn't realize it (not at first at least) and the one using realizes that they wouldn't. This is very common in \u201cfriendships.\u201d For example: Jack goes up to Tom and ask \u201cHey. Wanna be my friend?\u201d Tom accepts. One day Jack says to Tom \u201cHey Tom, I forgot my lunch money. Can you spot me? I promise I will pay you back.\u201d Tom thinks sure, I will help my friend. But this happens again and again and again without Tom ever being reimbursed. Tom may realize it eventually and tell him that he can't give him money anymore and chances are Jack would tell him he's a bad friend and never talk to Tom again but really there was no friendship, just Jack using Tom. Some more examples are: An addict, beggar, or bum telling you some fictional story to score some money.A guy telling a girl he loves her just to get in her pants.Someone making up lies or excuses to their \u201cfriend\u201d so they will do their homework for them.",

They may use or \u201cborrow\u201d money, or expect you to pay for everything if you have money, for another example. They may try to use you sexually, if you allow it. I think the fact that you\u2019re asking this question is a red flag. I think the answer is to have boundaries and say no. Also, notice what he does and does not do for you. A person who takes advantage of others is usually a taker, not a giver. It should be mutual give & take. Does he thank you for nice things you do, or does he expect it? Go with your intuition and set boundaries, say no, or run. That\u2019s just my opinion. ",

Often when a person feels used is because they have given of themselves and feel unappreciated. Or they have given of themselves disproportionately. In either case, the person has consciously or unconsciously allowed themselves to be taken advantage of. Sometimes it's because of wanting to be liked. Sometimes it's because of low self-esteem. Best solution is to give of yourself freely and honestly, but only to the extent that you choose. Learn how to say \u2018no\u2019. ",

Are they over dramatic or emotional (could be emotionally manipulating you)? Are they cold and not there for you emotionally but then asks for so much from you? If you find yourself putting a lot more effort for the other person than they are for you, then maybe you should be honest with them in a non-confronting way first to see what they say.

All partners are seeking advantage, it\u2019s why we live in the idioms we do ( a dashing lord to an untouched beauty, from an youthful energy to the mature and knowledgeable) all these relations have an element of advantage taking. So on that level, if his lips are moving he\u2019s seeking advantage. As you are, here gathering evidence to either absolve yourself or to mount an attack on the advantage seeker. It seems what your asking is when does seeking advantage become nefarious manipulation? My answer is about balance. If two dramatic liars have a tempestuous relationship I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that, but if one of those is with a meek \u201chero\u201d personality, they will continually be the victim. So that\u2019s my line. So it depends on the girl/guy. But that said: if you see a girl say no and a guy not listening\u2026 deal with that right there loudly and publicly. ",

He won't call, always be late, not even show up and probably want just sex from a relationship. He'll treat you bad. Some guys do this in degrees. It starts subtle at first. Forgets to call or text. May flirt with other girls. Wont take you out. Won't talk to you when you try to sort out the relationship. One big sign is that you are MISERABLE!!! A guy who cares wouldn't want you to be unhappy. Just leave if you feel you are used\u2026cause you probably are!!! Guys aren't that busy. They'll make time for someone they like/love. Good Luck! ",

You do a friend a favor without being concerned about reciprocity because doing favors is part of friendship. But if the requests keep coming and take up a significant part of your available time without your being compensated - either in money or in offering/or doing a return favor - then the relationship feels unbalanced by taking up time that could be used for work, relaxation, family time, social occasions. I think it\u2019s largely about time, as in the saying \u201cyour time is a non-renewable resource\u201d, because money or some other resource can always be replaced, but your time, once it is spent, cannot.

You have to be the type who\u2019s really cautious or observant when meeting people even if it\u2019s just from a small talk or common gestures. Based on my experience, most of the people who likes to take advantage of someone are one-sided, they lack of empathy and they often sugar-coat their words. Some would say that they are afraid of commitment and they do not trust people very well may it be about the information they have or the capabilities of the person. ",

He won't be around for long term. -If he only wants to sleep with you, but not interested in having a relationship; he's using you. -If he only wants to come over at night.. -I also know a guy that said he takes girls out to fancy restaurants just to get laid and gets mad if he doesn't get what he wants after spending a lot of money.

And the best way \u2013 consult the situation with your friends, family, mentors, or anyone whom you are close to. Those that care about you will tell you honestly what they think of your situation.

Simplistically, being taken for granted is not being asked if you want to do something. But it can be very nice if your partner plans something without your knowledge, thinking you will like it. And getting it right. My girlfriend once tried to reminisce with me about our holiday in Austria together. I pointed out that I had never been there. She thought harder and realised that she had been with a previous boyfriend. Now, should I be pleased that I was such a part of her life that her time with this previous boyfriend was forgotten or annoyed that she took it for granted that it was me ? I decided to be happy that I was the generic boyfriend. ",

Simple as that. But then again, maybe you have a tinge of paranoia because you have very low self-esteem. Either way, if you feel you want to continue this relationship, do it with the mindset that you are \u201cexploring\u201d it rather than committing to it. You can\u2019t be used if you continued the relationship mindful of the possible outcomes and that it was your choice. I have to mention that as part of your awareness, you should be familiar with the signs of an abusive relationship so that you can get out and get help. ",

I wouldn\u2019t say he's \u201cplaying you,\u201d but i do think that maybe things have begun to change in your relationship and you guys may find yourself at a distance. You should consider confronting him when there\u2019s a right time and see what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s almost been a year of dating, and if he\u2019s always busy and never has time for you anymore it\u2019s best to bring it up and hopefully discuss where your relationship is at. A lot of the time no one is the same as they once were in the beginning of a relationship, whether it\u2019s good or not and since you feel like he\u2019s changed that\u2019s something else you might want to bring up too. You aren't being played, you\u2019re just having a bump in the road and it\u2019s best to follow your gut instead of being pulled along constantly questioning whether or not your relationship is still as strong, you deserve more than that. Goodluck! I hope everything works out for the best. ",

Passing the buck isn\u2019t unusual, but that doesn\u2019t make it right. Don\u2019t let employers abuse you. Stand up for yourself and if they continue, find another job that will appreciate your efforts. ",
