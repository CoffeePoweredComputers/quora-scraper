            "answer_text": "Yes, teaching would be an excellent use of video conferencing if properly planned and administered. How to make it successful depends on your creative abilities. I am certain that others are thinking about the idea also. I cannot give you specifics on how to make teaching a successful endeavor for conferencing, but will try to give you a few ideas that should be useful. Narrow the scope of what you want to teach. For example, your question is very broad to just ask about teaching in general. If you had phrased the question as \u201cCan we use video conferencing for teaching math, or teaching fine arts, you would get a different and more specific answer. You were probably wanting a broad answer and I only use that as an example. Teaching mathematics would be a straightforward use, but teaching people how to act, or how to paint, or how to be a good photographer would certainly seem to be a bit more difficult. So, if you do plan to give teaching a try on video conferencing, please try to narrow the subject. Limit the number of people for an online conference. It\u2019s difficult to keep the class engaged on the subject and this is especially true when using video. Introduce the participants. The camera doesn\u2019t show every speaker throughout the meeting. This means that part of your sign-up requirement includes a very brief profile so you can properly introduce them. Have a specific goal. What should participants expect to accomplish that will be helpful to them in their career development or lifestyle. What are your expectations of each attendee and what should they expect to learn at the conference? Break up the monotony. People get bored in class, especially if they feel they are all alone and just staring at their computer. Have a little small talk at the beginning and sprinkled throughout the session. A bit of humor will cause people to laugh out loud even when they are by themselves and will do wonders for the learning environment. Give participants things to do and expect them to make a contribution. Nothing too heavy, but things that are easy but meaningful will lighten up the conference and give people a feeling of accomplishment as well as keeping them alert. General: 1. Have a theme and definitely have an agenda and stick with it. 2. Be absolutely certain that you have a planned end time as well as the start time. 3. Consider having one or two guest speakers. 4. Set time limits for questions and answers at the beginning and do not allow someone to just ramble. Keep it moving! 5. Consider having a notetaker and think about whether to distribute a brief summary to participants after the conference. 6. Ask participants if their name can be shared or disclosed. 7.Create and share the meeting agenda in advance of the call that includes: Why you are meeting.\u00b7 who is attending the meeting?\u00b7 when is the meeting?\u00b7 Keep the call concise and on point and moving along.

            "answer_text": "Yes, sure! Use a video conferencing tool that allow you the following - Ability to share your screen so that you can use something like PowerPoint to teach your topic, and also do screencasting if necessary.Record the session as an MP4 video (on your computer and/or in cloud) which you can then share with your students once the video conferencing is over.Allow students to chat with you online in real time to ask questions.Doesn\u2019t limit your class up to a fixed time (say 40 mins or 1 hour, etc.)Allow / disallow your students to appear on video and/or speakWhen there are no classes, you can use the same tool to record video lessons for use as reference for your students. All the best. ",
