            "answer_text": "According to the leak the OnePlus 7 Pro will come in three variants - 6GB RAM + 128GBstorage, 8GB RAM+256GB storage and 12GB RAM+256GB storage. The leak suggests that the OnePlus 7 Pro 8GB RAM model will cost 749/$749 while the 12GB+256GB storage variant will cost 819/$819. The price of the 6GB RAM model of the phone is still unknown. However, considering the price of the 8GB RAM model of the phone, we expect the pricing of the OnePlus 7 Pro 6GB RAM to be way lesser - could be somewhere around $600. Adding to the pricing and the variants the some one says that these prices are for the European market and may differ as per markets.  The price we expect about something ~700$ dollar. That something good. A lot of rumours and leaks about the OnePlus 7 Pro. Rumours and leaks suggest that the OnePlus 7 Pro will come with a 6.7-inchsAMOLED curved display with a QHD+ resolution and smooth refresh rate of 90Hz. They also suggest that the phone will come with 5G support along with a Snapdragon 855 chipset. The Pro model is also tipped to come with a pop-up selfie camera and a triple camera setup with a 48MP primary camera. Similar to the OnePlus 6T McLaren edition, we expect a 40W fast charge support and a larger battery for the OnePlus 7 Pro, considering this phone will be a flagship by OnePlus and not a flagship killer One plus is all time my best choice because they take care our phones security and updates like apple ,, Mmmm THAN APPLE.
