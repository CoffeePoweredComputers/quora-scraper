            "answer_text": "Hi there, If you\u2019re searching for technology icons, here are the steps to follow: Brainstorm List all the words that relate to \u201ctechnology\u201d. This could include machines, artificial intelligence, robots, gadgets, electronics, circuits, gadgets. I think Jane Jacobs has already shared a general visual representation of most of the things related to technology. Do A Search Once you have your list, head to websites such as Icon Finder, Glyphicons and Flaticon and use the search bar to type in the different words from your list. You\u2019ll see a ton of options, which you can use where ever you like because they\u2019re downloadable. Hope this helped. Cheers, Aamina Suleman ",
