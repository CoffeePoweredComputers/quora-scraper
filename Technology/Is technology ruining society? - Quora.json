            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll take \u201csociety\u201d to also mean \u201cculture\u201c and our political organization. First agriculture (we were told) changed culture. Then industry changed culture along with art and the printing press. Cities were built. War destroyed them and There was discovery of new lands and people. This changed culture profoundly. The people of the world merged together And cultures were killed and died. Steamships and airplanes, cars and trains, Canada\u2019s, telegrams, telephones, radio, radar televisions, facsimiles computers impacted thought. Spiritually there was regression and progression. Now information technology is changing our culture rapidly. Most of all wireless communication. we saw people on their phones when we were able to go to restaurants or assemble in public at sporting events or before concerts, at the beach or wherever there was cell service. We used to see young people texting in libraries. Relationships are different. We are not prisoners of propinquity. Our relationships have no physical boundaries. We aren\u2019t restricted to time zones. When we used to someone\u2019s house Alexa might answer a question in error. Yes information seems to be instantly available. The thought comes to our head and Wikipedia gives the superficial supposedly in depth government approved answer. No more waiting for inter library loan and fingering through library card files. We can work remotely now. That changes not only our job, but also our work relationships and office politics. What could have been a pressure cooker may have had a relief valve put on it. when we return to work, we will be contact traced and tracked. We will be measured for excessive body heat and breathing. The scan could also pick up metal. Some vaccines will have internal tattoo arrays which can be read which contain information. Some may have really nano RFID tags. Apps may be used to read our cell phone data and contact tracing data saved on their. Our clothing may contain RFID tags which can further track us. This is all to protect us. It will efficiently sort the vaccinated from the unvaccinated and the infected from those who are clear and approved. It will all be about where you have been what you\u2019ve done and who you have met. This will be used to give you access to ensure that you are clean and safe. This could be incorporated into a social credit score. This could help decide who is worthy of admission to work, or to college, or to the ball game. ",

            "answer_text": "Hahahahahahahahha \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Thank you for that, not a lot of laughing material floating around nowadays. Our society, as you think of it, IS technology. If you remove all the current human technology from \u201csociety\u201d all you would have is a massive number of naked, socially dependent primates who are mostly unable to figure out how to survive in the true natural wilds that we haven\u2019t experienced for centuries. You could repopulate the surface of the earth with megafauna, reduce our numbers to \u201cpre-technology\u201d human population, and watch us run around and try to reinvent technology as quickly as possible in order to escape the hard realities of a wild, naturalistic life\u2026and end up more or less where we currently are right now after some given amount of time. The people who don\u2019t want to use technology and participate in modern society are free to leave, and they do so pretty regularly, it\u2019s just not a very common sentiment. Most people like being warm, clothed, fed, free of disease and not having to figure out how to do all that manually for yourself all the time. We love having safe water treatment and sanitation, very cheap electricity available everywhere, a global travel network that can essentially put us anywhere on the surface of the earth in 48 hours\u2026these aren\u2019t things that are \u201cruining\u201d society, these are the foundation of said society. What do you imagine we would accomplish cold, starving, naked and wet hiding in a cave from a group of much stronger and scarier predators? What kind of \u201csociety\u201d would that be? My guess, not much of one at all. ",
