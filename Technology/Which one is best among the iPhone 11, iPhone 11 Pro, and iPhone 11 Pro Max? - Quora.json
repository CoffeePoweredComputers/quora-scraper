No matter which one you get, you will have almost the same experience. Get iPhone 11 if you do not want to destroy your bank. Its size is good, specs and features are also good and it is cheap. iPhone 11 Pro has the triple camera and is expensive (US $1,099) than the iPhone 11 with all the similar specs. iPhone 11 Pro Max is the bigger one with the matt finish. Get this model if you have the budget and if you want all the specs one notch higher. It is the most expensive one (64 GB variant for $1,099, 256 GB variant $1,249 and 512 GB variant $1,449). ",
