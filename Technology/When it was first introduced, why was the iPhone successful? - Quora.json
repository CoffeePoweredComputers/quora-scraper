            "answer_text": "The iPhone was an instant success because it was a game changer \u2014 in one handheld device you were no longer restricted to it being \u201cjust a phone\u201d but instead you were holding a general-purpose and powerful computer capable of being so much more than being just a phone. This was immediately obvious even with the restricted set of applications which Apple first provided, even with the cripplingly slow EDGE data communications option, with the single provider (AT&T), and even without a general-purpose App store through which you could buy and install 3rd party applications. I read somewhere that Google was about to come out with their own cell phone operating system within weeks of the Apple announcement, but on seeing the iPhone presented by Steve Jobs, the person in charge at Google went to his people and told them he was pulling their own announcement, and he told them all to back up and re-think what they were offering. He wasn\u2019t willing to come to market with a non-competitive choice, and realized they would have to \u201cup their game\u201d if they wanted to compete in the new world which the iPhone had created. I\u2019ll give Google credit here (assuming what I read is correct, and this is not an apocryphal story justifying after-the-fact what happened) \u2014 that was absolutely the right move, and has resulted in Google being Apple\u2019s only real competitor in the smartphone operating system world.

Rewatch the original presentation on YouTube and keep this in mind: People cheering at the \u201clarge multitouch display\u201d and scrolling through a list of songs are not doing so because they\u2019re blindly in love with Apple, or because Apple is proving it can match the competition. It\u2019s because what Apple is showing off is completely new. ",
