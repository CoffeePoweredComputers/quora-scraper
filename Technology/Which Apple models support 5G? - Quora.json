            "answer_text": "Apple has announced the iPhone 12, its first 5G iPhone. Every model of iPhone 12, from the iPhone 12 mini to the iPhone 12 Pro Max, supports 5G bands from low frequency to mmWave.  If you have any iPhone prior to the iPhone 12, you do not have 5G. There has been a lot of confusion about this. Apple says the iPhone 12 supports more 5G frequencies than any other smartphone at the time of its launch. In the U.S., all models support mmWave in addition to sub-6GHz bands, and Apple says it has done a lot of engineering work and testing with carriers to provide the best possible experience. Outside the U.S., the iPhone 12 models are limited to the sub-6GHz frequencies. ",
