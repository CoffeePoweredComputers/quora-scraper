            "answer_text": "\u201cFirewall: a wall or partition designed to inhibit or prevent the spread of fire.\u201d Source: Google DictionaryOkay, so I know that\u2019s not the definition that you are looking for. That is what a firewall is in building. However, I mentioned it because it is useful to understand where that term comes from and why it is called a firewall. Just as a real firewall protects one unit from being destroyed when another is burning a firewall protects you. Only it is to protect your computer from online threats. Viruses, malware, and other hacking threats. It provides a barrier that they have to work to get across. It\u2019s not infallible but it is still a good thing. You should have the firewalls turned on: both on your computer and your router. It is a good thing! NOTE: There are many different kinds of firewalls including dedicated units such as Sonicwalls. Some are better than others. With dedicated firewalls being at the top. However, most people do not need a Sonicwall. What is built into your equipment is enough. Unless someone really doesn\u2019t like you or you do stupid things. So, be careful and stay smart. Keep that firewall on. ",

            "answer_text": "A firewall is a barrier or shield that is intended to protect your PC, network, or phone from the data-based malware dangers that exist on the Internet. Data is exchanged between your computer and servers and routers in cyberspace, and firewalls monitor this data for any malware. A good firewall should immediately identify not only the infected host but the endpoint user and be able to isolate compromised systems until they are cleaned up. Often there are complaints from IT managers regarding their firewall\u2019s purchase after it fails to perform certain tasks. Please check our firewall buyer\u2019s guide to see what capabilities and features to consider when purchasing a firewall. Next Gen Firewall buyer's guide Hope this will help you! ",
