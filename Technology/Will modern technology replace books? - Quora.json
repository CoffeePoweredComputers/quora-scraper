            "answer_text": "Books will mostly not be replaced, for the following reasons: Convenience. This seems a little bit counterintuitive--shouldn't devices be more convenient to bring around than their counterparts in print? However, we should bear in mind that devices can run out of battery and are ultimately dependent on energy; books aren't. This makes books especially valuable in situations in which electronic devices become a burden, such as on airplanes or in open-book examinations during which the use of electronic devices is not allowed.Cost. In general, books are less expensive than devices. The value of this is especially significant in libraries. Although many libraries today stock ebooks, this is usually treated as complementary to the physical hardcopy.Ease of reading. Books are less taxing on the eye than digital screens. Granted, advances* in modern technology has allowed for reading on screens that are less glaring, but scrolling a mouse or swiping a screen simply feels different to many readers, myself included. This also applies to many textbooks, especially for subjects in which diagrams and drawings are important, such as large geographical maps or huge detailed drawings of the human body. Some of the other answers have also mentioned this factor as an anecdote.I will probably update this list as I think of more points. Many of the other answers here are excellent too! *Disclaimer: I am not promoting the use of Amazon's Kindle. This is merely an example to prove my point. In fact, I do not often use electronic devices in place of books; I favour the latter quite a fair bit. ",

            "answer_text": "For me it already has. I use a Kindle whenever I do reading in transit, otherwise I read internet articles, read Wikipedia pages and watch YouTube videos on my computer, or read news on my phone. There are many who romanticize books for the \u201cfeel of the pages\u201d, the \u201csmell\u201d, the fact you don\u2019t have to charge them, and other things related to status and a general cultural respect for the concept of books. I don\u2019t share this opinion: I find them incredibly uncomfortable to hold and sitting in one place for hours reading one proves a challenge for this reason (I don\u2019t experience this same discomfort with a Kindle), you can only carry as many books as you have space in your bag whereas I can carry potentially hundreds, they can easily get damaged if it rains, charging isn\u2019t as much of an issue as you think as my Kindle can last WEEKS on a charge, and I really don\u2019t give a shit about the \u201csmell\u201d or \u201cfeel\u201d. Nevertheless, I\u2019m in a minority. As of yet, books are hanging on in there. There are however some technologies that have the potential to end them forever: OLED  Flexible dsiplays will make e-books \u201cfeel\u201d more like traditional books. When you combine this with: 5G  You will then be able to download books anywhere really quickly. The big benefit that e-readers already have is that, because you don\u2019t have to buy a physical book, older or more amateur books can be downloaded for free. I got the complete works of Plato, Marx and several other philosophers for less than \u00a31 off of Amazon. The ultimate advances though that will DEFINITELY kill off the book is NEURALINK  With a brain-computer interface, the exact thoughts, intentions and feelings of an author (they wouldn\u2019t be called that at this point though) can be communicated directly between minds. This opens up the possibility for a whole new form of art as well as being a game-changer for education and journalism. Knowledge can literally be downloaded into people\u2019s brains in a similar way to how Neo downloads martial arts knowledge and expertise in The Matrix.  Collaboration can occur more quickly through direct brain communication than language. The other advance is VR  As this tends towards photorealism, we can directly experience the worlds that we would otherwise simply have to imagine if it was an author. People say that imagining from a book is better than watching passively from a film, but active experience will be incomparably more affecting than both. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think that ebooks will ever replace the printed books. Ebooks has its own pros and cons. While ebooks serve the purpose of accessing books anywhere and everywhere on the go, liberalising the imparting of knowledge and education across border and social difference, nonetheless it necessitates the presence of electricity all the while. So, it is still not unleashing a great potential for the poor and rural people in some parts of the developing countries where electricity is still not provided. Ebooks has its best application in research, I think. Through ebooks in an electronic device, one can very easily look up words and sentences without taking the huge load of physical books. While ebooks these days provide best value of money through many discounts in many online sites compared with the price of physical books, people are seen to prefer ebooks to physical books. However if one is reading a novel or a big voluminous book, one is still seen moving to a physical book because of the comfort and feel that it can provide. Certain common downer on the part of ebooks are that continuous reading of an ebook over an hour can cause very easily eye strain. However situation may be eased if one is using a dedicated ebook reader device such as KINDLE devices etc. What gives the advent of ebook an upper hand over the physical book is the easy access to many of great books of which most are accessible and downloadable free of cost. So we can in other words read a book even before we have purchased it. For me the bottom line remains like if one is planning to read a good novel then most probably he/she would be taking up a physical book instead of an ebook. But I would still say in terms of research activities that ebooks becomes a kind of boon to the researchers. So for me as well, physical books will continue to remain in the society despite fast growing technological advancement. ",

            "answer_text": "For ages, books were adored as huge amount of information. However, they are being replaced by their electronic \"copies\" which affect health problems as red-eyes and vision issues. Secondly, according to lectures of Howard Berg, who is the world's fastest reader, and to Spreeder website, e-books reduce the reading speed of readers to 25%, which makes them to sit in front of the monitor more and cause more health problems. Another good side of the real book is that you do not depend on the battery of electricity.On the other hand, real books are made of woods, which cause reducing of forests in the world and make the ecology worse. Moreover, real books take more place in your bag and, also, its quality goes down because of the usage, but e-books are compact and don't change after several usages. Thirdly, electronic information in the Internet is more and faster approachable than the real sources. For instance, one can google any specific information in seconds, rather than searching books in libraries and then scanning for the required information. Furthermore, more information can be found in the Internet, which would probably never be found as a book, or in a book. ",

We can adopt technology if it would have something much more better than books, since it doesn't matter where we read until we are able to catch the matter.

So the devices aren\u2019t a good substitute for how-to manuals on a workbench, in a garage or other place that is fine for a printed book, but risky for an expensive electronic device. So books will diminish in some circles, but not all and not uniformly around the world, and they will take about another 50-100 years to fade away completely.

Another reason books won\u2019t be obsolete, is the durable aspect of books. I have a book of poetry that is 67 years old. I\u2019m not sure the books on my Amazon Kindle Library are going to last that long. Finally, I would imagine that books will follow the trajectory of Vinyl LP\u2019s. At first they were replaced by 8-Tracks, Cassette Tapes, CD\u2019s, and now Streaming Services, and Smart Phone Memories. But the old Vinyl LP\u2019s are making a comeback and enthusiasts love them, and buy record players to play them. It has moved from the modern way to listen to music, to an old fashioned way that is pleasurable. I imagine in the future libraries will be places to find pleasure reading books the old fashioned way. ",

Although in the past I have enjoyed reading hard copies of books before the digital readers came out, I haven't purchased a hard copy in years. I got a Kindle years ago and use it all the time. Part of the reason why I haven't purchased a book is because there are no more book stores left. The Kindle makes it so easy to download a book and I enjoy the instant gratification of having a book to read immediately. I do think that hard copies will be obsolete.

This is because of overloading of brain. You always forget when you are saturated from work and you always lose books and other important documents. If all the books are in one tablet, then you will neber lose anything. Also, you can save the books on cloud incase they are not lost if the device is damaged. I am ready to accept e-books. ",
