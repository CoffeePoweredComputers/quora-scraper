            "answer_text": "How do you watch TV without a set-top box? This is really really easy. See of you have an antenna on your house. If you\u2019re not certain, they look something like this:  If you haven\u2019t, get one installed. Then connect it to your TV, switch on, and select \u201cFirst time installation\u201d or similar from the menu. It will take a few minutes to do its stuff, and then present you with a list of all the channels available in your area. (I\u2019m assuming you have a fairly new TV, less then say 15 years old. An old analogue-only set will still need a box). ",
