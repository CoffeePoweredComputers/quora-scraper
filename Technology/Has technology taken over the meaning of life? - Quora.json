            "answer_text": "Civilization evolves. In the hunter-gatherer culture, the center was survival, and people\u2019s relationship to the gods and spirits centered on awe and sustenance. In the agricultural era, based on farming, irrigation, and community, Mother God was emphasized, as God of harvest and nurture. In the Greek civilization, philosophy and idealism reigned, and Socrates hailed the \u201cTrue God\u201d whom he named Daemos. The Roman Empire was centered on law, order and might, with the Emperor as the Supreme Deity. Christianity took root in the Roman Empire as a religion of slaves but also aristocracy, emphasizing mercy and unselfishness. Islam began in Saudi Arabia and flourished in the Levant and North Africa first, uniting civilization under a strict moral order and obedience to Allah. The Frankish kingdoms took the Roman Catholic faith into a union of church and state in the feudal dark ages. Trade with China and the Middle East after the Crusades launched the Renaissance and the beginning of modern science and technology. The Spanish and Portuguese set out on missionary work to expand their empires for gold, glory and God. After King Henry VIII founded the Anglican Church, Elizabeth I defeated the Spanish Armada and made England the master of the seas. Colonial conquest, competition, colonization and wars took precedence over Christian values in the era of expansionism and imperialism. The USA was founded on a new ideal of God\u2019s nation, democracy, and Manifest Destiny, at the cost of the Native Americans. The American Empire had a mission to make the world safe for democracy from tyranny, absolute monarchy, and human rights abuse. Industrialism ceded way to technocracy and ultimately to management science. Technology seems to be a value unto itself, but its actual purpose is to serve art in the world of the heart. The world of the heart, based on God-centered family values, will usher in God\u2019s Kingdom in the era of ascendancy of the Pacific Rim nations. This will be the Golden Age for Korea, Japan, China, and those nations which cooperate with this new providence of the rising sun. Art and heart, served by science and technology, will be the core values in the future ideal world. ",
