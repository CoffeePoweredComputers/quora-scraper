            "answer_text": "In a word: Management Innovation isn't something you just decide to do, like a task throughout the day. Creativity needs to be encouraged, supported, and nurtured. You don't just say \u201cI\u2019m going to be creative from 2pm until 3pm on Wednesday\u201d: your brain needs time to get into the \u201cmood\u201d and get things going. Your workplace has to spark creative opportunities. People need time to be creative, to collaborate and share ideas, and know how they can make those ideas happen. While \u201cinnovation\u201d is frequently listed as a top priority for most companies, if you ask executives how much they actually spend on innovation/creativity per week/month/year, most of them can't answer. Most businesses are designed to be predictable and stable: not agile and innovative. They focus on what's urgent, not what's important, and their people are often drowning in busy work. Most executive can't even brainstorm properly (Hint - Its not what you do in a one-off hour long meeting, it's an iterative process.) Many can't facilitate a meeting or discussion properly either. It's horrifying. I was once stuck in a 3 day meeting with + 20 executives of a major corporation that turned into a Seinfeld episode: The discussion at the end of the 3rd day, was the same discussion that started the meeting on the first day. Nothing was decided, or determined. But the real killer is the ability to execute, which is something big bureaucratic companies do poorly. A moderate idea given to good leadership will go a long way, but bad leadership will kill a world class idea. I've seen this personally countless times. A brilliant engineer brings a great idea to management, and they mess the execution up so bad that it flops. Then, management blames the engineer when it doesn't work. That's a perfect way to kill all future innovation from an entire department right there.  Companies also kill innovation by instilling a culture of fear: no one wants to \u201cown\u201d anything for fear of being fired if it goes bad. All decisions are made by committee, as there is safety in numbers. They aren't \u201cplaying to win\u201d, they are playing not to lose (or get fired). This is why so many large companies just acquire other companies (often at a huge premium). They just can't innovate within their own four walls. If they're smart, they'll leave the new acquisition alone and support it from a distance. Entrepreneurs and innovators hate red tape and bureaucracy, and often stagnate and choke in slow moving organizations. And executives in slow moving organizations don't know how to manage at the pace that entrepreneurial and innovative companies need. So if you want innovation, you need to dedicate time and energy to it. Remove the obstacles, create opportunities for collaboration and idea sharing, allow people to make mistakes, create an internal incubator to support and nurture the idea to a minimum viable product, and most importantly- get the bureaucracy out of the way!  Hope this was helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "I love Bernie Klinder\u2019s answer to this question \u2014 it encapsulates so much of what it means to be innovative. I can\u2019t begin to count how many stupid meetings I\u2019ve been at that are \u2018brainstorming\u2019 or \u2018SWOT\u2019 or some other backwards approach to innovation, as if it\u2019s something that just drops out of the sky because you have a white board available to you. It results in people picking the best of the ideas that they hear (a clear case of sampling bias), and most of the ideas that come out of that meeting are either: a) crap; or (more often, in my experience) b) parroting whatever management wants to hear:  Here\u2019s the thing \u2014 that is literally all you can expect out of most employees at most companies And that\u2019s fair. And that\u2019s why you end up with this:  Most people are there to do their jobs, and when they have an innovation, it\u2019s in how to do their very specific job better. Sometimes, that is a solution that they can implement themselves. Most of us probably do this already \u2014 I did it earlier today by re-writing an Excel formula so that I could shave a few minutes off of a weekly analysis I do by getting it to pull data more efficiently (not more efficiently in terms of computational work, more efficiently in terms of me cutting and pasting csv files into the Excel sheet). Sometimes, it has to do with how we pay attention to various aspects of our products \u2014 yesterday, I had a meeting and we realized that a \u2018truism\u2019 about our products was, in fact, provably false, and it pointed to a clear path to correcting that truism. However, it also pointed to the management headache that would ensue if we tried to fix this all at once, and so it forced us into figuring out a way to change this perception incrementally. But neither of these things are what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about \u2018innovation.\u2019 When I use that word, I mean it in a very Peter Thiel-esque way: what is going to make life measurably better for my customers that we can actually do? This is a play on his 10x idea, which might be a reasonable threshold for a start-up, but is virtually impossible for a big company. Doing that work involves actually talking to your customers to find out what you need to do to make their lives better when using your product. This is one of those things that\u2019s obvious, but few companies do it constantly. There are literally hundreds of other ways that people take a path that\u2019s easier (e.g., asking people to come up with ideas on a whiteboard) than what should be done (e.g., sure, do the whiteboard, but then test and iterate on that\u2026 or even better, proactively ask customers what they want, all the time). And then, there\u2019s one other problem, and it\u2019s this: it\u2019s awfully hard to be a radical within an organization, and to get to true innovation, you need to be a radical. You need to not care that other people think your idea is stupid, and this is really hard when your peers may well be the ones in charge of your compensation / livelihood. As someone who has been \u2018that guy\u2019 in many more than one role, it makes you think that corporations simply aren\u2019t the right place for you\u2026 period (I can\u2019t count the number of times that I\u2019ve been referred to disparagingly as a \u2018cowboy\u2019 for just going off on my own to make something work\u2026 I dunno, I think being a cowboy is honorable work). In some cases, it\u2019s easier to leave the security of the paycheck behind just so you don\u2019t get questioned every minute about what you\u2019re doing and why you\u2019re doing it. And that is the heart of the problem for a lot of organizations \u2014 they\u2019re not really interested in hearing from the cowboys until things are too far gone for the cowboys to be helpful. It\u2019s why you get consultants that you pay a fortune to tell you how to fix your business, and then the advice is ignored. It\u2019s why super-talented employees always seem to have a \u2018side project\u2019 that they\u2019re working on so that they can get out of there. It\u2019s why I was able to make a living for about a decade buying companies that were in trouble and fixing them \u2014 it\u2019s not actually hard to look for the problems to fix to make your customer\u2019s lives better, it\u2019s just hard to do the work of making their lives better. And it\u2019s why smaller, nimble companies have an advantage \u2014 the CEO is literally sitting next to the person who does customer service if s/he\u2019s not doing it him/herself. And start-up CEOs know that you will do anything for that paying customer, because that customer is quite literally paying your bills. It\u2019s not an abstract thing, like me being one of the millions of Excel users \u2014 it\u2019s visceral, because if that customer leaves you, it hurts. When that hurt stops happening, I think oftentimes, innovation slows down and halts, too\u2026 except in companies that build structures to work around that exact issue. ",
