            "answer_text": "No. Unless you\u2019re using Gsync or similar, your screen refreshes at it\u2019s rate. 60hz, 120hz, 144hz. Lowering resolution should increase your RENDER rate, or FPS. That can synch with your monitor or not, causing small problems or not. Your system could see benefits. But running at your native resolution has benefits too. I prefer running at native resolution, and adjusting my graphics quality settings (draw distance, textures, shadows) to approach my refresh rate. I generally am at 1080p, high settings, 60fps 60hz on GTA V. I might hit 100fps or more walking around alone, and might stutter out at 30fps in a big pile of police driving into me. ",
