            "answer_text": "Fairly nice. It\u2019s missing An ABIA standardSupport for several architecturesbut overall it\u2019s a nice competitor to C++ and often C. The compiler is in better shape than it once was (it produces fast code). Cargo, the build tool which seems to be universally used, is pretty broken in a lot of ways but given that it\u2019s competing with C++ that might be fine. ",
