            "answer_text": "Third generation (1964-1971) computers used integrated circuits (but not microprocessors), instead of the discrete transistors in the second generation. Examples: IBM System/360, UNIVAC 1108, PDP-8/I, PDP-11/20 and PDP-11/45. However their peripherals were pretty much the same as the second generation. Mainframes of that era used reel-to-reel 9-track 1/2\u2033 tape drives for long-term data storage.  IBM 360/50 with tape drives in the background, and a rack of 9-track tapes in the foreground. Each could hold 45 MB of data on a 2400\u2032 reel! Instead of full size magnetic tape drives, minicomputers used smaller sized reels. DECtape drives were popular on PDP-8 and PDP-11 computers. Both mainframes and minicomputers of the third generation used core memory. Memory capacity ranged from 4 KB to 4 MB. ",
