            "answer_text": "Social Media is our modern crack epidemic. Let me explain. Often times, the saying \u201chistory repeats itself\u201d is only obvious in hindsight. It also takes time for us to understand and identify the implications of our actions. Since social media is still so new (10\u201312 years) and has really only ingratiated itself into society in the form that is currently, in the last 5 years or so, its going to take time to understand how these websites/apps affect us in various ways. i.e mentally, socially, etc. I like to compare social media to reality TV. When reality TV first started to become a prominent part of TV programming, viewers took what was happening in these shows for face value and believed it to be real. Fast-forward, everyone now knows reality TV is scripted, but many people still choose to indulge for entertainment purposes. It\u2019s like junk food. Social Media is very similar in that regard. A lot of people mistake what they see posted on Instagram or Twitter for being real when really it\u2019s just as scripted, and curated as any reality TV show. This is what turns me off to social media. The never ending need for validation and to present ourselves in certain ways to get attention and approval from people who don\u2019t even matter in real life. Also, constantly absorbing other people\u2019s moods, gossip, and any/everything else the algorithm feeds us in the 24/7 news cycle. It\u2019s all noise. My vision for the future of social media is less narcissistic & vain websites designed around constantly seeking attention, to micro-communities built around common interests. One example is Apple Music connect. It allows you to follow people (but there\u2019s is no follower count). The goal isn\u2019t to accumulate as many followers as you can, but rather connect with people you know to see what they are listening to and to share playlists. You only get to post one picture of yourself. There\u2019s is no bio or place to promote any of your products or services. It\u2019s just about the music. I enjoy that fact and hope more platforms emerge that are similar. ",

            "answer_text": "Undoubtedly AI is going to touch everything we do, but I suggested three ideas to consider in terms of impacting our careers. As futurist Kevin Kelly described in his wonderful book The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future, innovation in the future will be driven by applying a layer of AI to our everyday tasks. We need to begin considering that form of innovation on our jobs and in our companies.For this reason, AI is not going to arrive with a thud, but instead will sneak into our lives on cat\u2019s paws in millions of small ways. Everyday tasks will become faster, more accurate, more integrated, more personal.AI will usher in \u201cThe Age of Assistance.\u201d Companies will differentiate themselves by how cleverly they apply layers of AI to make their customer experiences more exciting and even entertaining.In fact, most analysts project that the majority of search activities will be conducted through products like Alexa and Google Home.Since much of what we do in the world of social media and content marketing is geared toward helping people find our products, this is a vital trend. When we ask Alexa to find an answer, we don\u2019t get a list of blog posts, videos, or research reports to choose from \u2026 we get the ANSWER. So this is a profound development for marketers. I asked a developer on IBM\u2019s Watson project how they regard content. After all, content is sort of the engine behind search results today. She said \u201cWe don\u2019t really think of it as content \u2026 we think of it as fuel for Watson.\u201d An interesting perspective, don\u2019t you think? We\u2019re now in the business of creating Watson Fuel. I don\u2019t foresee most households having multiple speaker systems. We won\u2019t want to develop our favorite routines on Alexa, for example, and then another set for Google Home. So we are on the cusp of a war for the very heart of eCommerce. The smart speaker system that prevails will be used in our homes, our cars, and our offices. An incredibly fascinating battle for the heart of eCommerce lies ahead! The number one topic at Social Media Marketing World was chatbots. There was an almost over-the-top, breathless hype about the subject. I\u2019m more rational in my view of this trend. The insiders actually developing this technology tell me that unless you\u2019re in a very high-transaction business (like hotels or airlines), reasonable chatbot applications are probably out of reach for most businesses for the next two years or so. Sort of reminds me of the days when every company thought it needed a smartphone app. Maybe, maybe not. However, I think the opportunity being overlooked by nearly everyone is what I call \u201cconversation marketing.\u201d I may not want to go online and chat with a Nike algorithm, but I would LOVE to engage with a Michael Jordan simulation chatbot! Chatbots will become our new celebrities and entertainers. Someday we\u2019ll probably have awards for the most fun chatbots. We\u2019ll have chatbot lists, and critics, and reviewers. While engagement may be in decline on other social channels, engagement will be red-hot on bots that can captivate and entertain us. And all the while, we can be storing customer information obtained through the chatbot conversations. That\u2019s the new conversation marketing on the horizon. ",
