            "answer_text": " Spoilers Ahead As per the family tree from season 3 Agnes Nielsen is the mother of Tronte Nielsen while the infinity symbol is the father. In the episode 4 of season 3 we found that Jonas and Martha\u2019s child is the origin of the infinity loop (the beginning and the end) which implies that the husband of Agnes Nielsen is the child of Martha and Jonas. The child of Martha and Jonas has no name, but he is the male character with the cleft palate. He is the beginning and the end. His only purpose is to keep everyone on their assigned track so that the loop can continue. There is no description or mention of their relations as such, but if we go by the family tree, then it seems like the most logical explanation. ",
