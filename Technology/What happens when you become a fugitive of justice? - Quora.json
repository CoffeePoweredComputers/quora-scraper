You\u2019ll hide in lonely desperation! You\u2019ll be forced to change your identity! You\u2019ll toil at many jobs! You\u2019ll search for a one-armed man you saw leave the scene of the crime! You\u2019ll run before the relentless pursuit of the police lieutenant obsessed with your capture! (Except in the movie, in which you\u2019ll run from the relentless pursuit of the deputy US marshal obsessed with your capture.) And, afterwards you\u2019ll work as a US Treasury agent and open up a private eye agency in San Diego. ",
