            "answer_text": "The short answer is that we did have modern technology - modern at the time. I had a PC in 1980: a Radio Shack TRS-80. It was almost useless by today\u2019s standards but I learned a lot from it. We also had: color TV, FAX machines, land-line telephones, VHS video and primitive video games (PAC Man). At work people had email - but very few had email at home. CompuServe was an early attempt to network people and their computers. Also, people had piles and piles of books, magazines and catalogs. ",

            "answer_text": "Because they had modern technology for the time, and there was less overpopulation, less crowding, less pollution, less depressing news, and people only got to see the private lives, vacations, and nice things of celebrities and people they knew instead of everyone at school or everyone in the world on social media so people were less depressed. The minimum wage was more when you properly adjust for inflation. Waiters and tipped employees are now getting paid about 1/4 of what they were paid the mid 80s when adjusted for inflation, and the price of college, rent, homes, and healthcare have all sky rocketed, and people now have to pay for cells phones amd wifi and other new expenses that were non-issues back then. The minimum wage income now is only actually worth about 1/9th, or 10% of what it was worth in the 80s. The data for the \u2018regular\u2019 minimum wage is not much better. ",
