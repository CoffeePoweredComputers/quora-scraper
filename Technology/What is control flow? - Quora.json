            "answer_text": "Control flow or more properly flow of control is the order in which various parts of a program are executed usually in response to conditional statements such as if statements but also may include unconditional changes in flows from for example, goto statements. Typical flows are  1) sequential in which statements are executed one after another2) loops where certain processes are iterated3) branches where flow is transferred based on an existing condition at time of execution. Typical control flow commands (from various compter languages) are gotoforwhiledoifelseifelseend ifswitchselect casecontinuebreaknextlooploopxenterleaveendreturnrepeatcallsubroutinemoduleblockfunctionjmpjumpjejnejg jgeja jaejljlejbjbejojnojzjnzjsjnsinterruptswapdupskippopdroprottuckpickrollredirect There are many more depending on the computer language and its syntax.
