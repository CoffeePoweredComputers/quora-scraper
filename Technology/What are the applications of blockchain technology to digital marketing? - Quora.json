            "answer_text": "Blockchain is most commonly used to store information about monetary transactions, particularly those related to cryptocurrencies. In fact, it\u2019s the technology that makes bitcoin and similar currencies function. It processes, records, and verifies bitcoin transactions. It is worth noting that a lot of the discussion surrounding blockchain is speculative. let\u2019s look at some ways it might be of use to digital marketers. Tracking Media Buys: Direct advertising online can involve keeping track of a lot of data. Blockchain technology can be used to connect media buyers and providers more directly. It can track transactions in a more efficient and reliable way, and even be used to manage multiple channels simultaneously. This offers a number of key benefits. Handling Social Impressions: Social media plays a key role in any digital marketing strategy. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s a field that can benefit immensely from a technology like blockchain. After all, running social media campaigns involves managing a lot of data, of various types and from multiple platforms.  Blockchain technology may most often be used to track financial transactions, but it\u2019s also useful for processing social transactions. A blockchain system can record and store information about your social campaigns in a way that makes it far easier to turn the data into meaningful results. Verifying Online Identities: One of the problems facing digital marketers is the growing prevalence of bots. Few platforms are immune to this issue; most social networks and other key sites are flooded with fake accounts that have no human presence behind them.  Those bot accounts can inflate many of the numbers you need to track. For example, a significant portion of your Twitter followers may be bot accounts, along with your ad impressions. This means you may not have the reach your analytics might suggest, and some of your advertising budget is probably being wasted on views and clicks made by robots. Lead Generation: Many marketing campaigns are run on incorrect data and with a lot of inconsistency. However, the use of blockchain development has helped the marketers get to the original source of the data. This ensures that first-hand information is tackled from the right individuals/sources.  So, these are some applications of blockchain which helps to redefine digital marketing. If you have some more applications, please comment below. ",

            "answer_text": "Representing an inconvertible decentralized distributed data ledger, blockchain can be used in plenty of industries, including digital marketing. Every business that sells goods, services, and (or) has a large base of users, know that an amazing user experience has crucial importance. When being aware of customer preferences, companies can launch personalized advertising campaigns that engage consumers and encourage them to make purchases. Retailers are those that are actively adopting innovative technologies. For the past several years, retail companies have integrated such things as beacons and sensors to collect customer data, for example, about their in-store behavior. This enables marketers to take a deep insight into user analytics, improve inventory management, and create successful marketing campaigns. \u201cBeacons allow retailers to know their target audience and use internal data for some peripheral customer insights,\u201d says Abhi Pitti, CEO of Nucleus Vision, a company that uses blockchain together with IoT to build real-time customer intelligence for brick-and-mortar stores. \u201cWhen we merge in the blockchain, all private databases such as banks, third-party apps on a mobile device, and credit card companies can open customer databases to share and monetize data with required customer authorizations recorded on a secured, incorruptible, transparent, chronological, distributed ledger\u201d.
