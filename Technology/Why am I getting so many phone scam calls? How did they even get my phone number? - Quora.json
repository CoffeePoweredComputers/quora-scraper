You signed up to a newspaper or club, maybe even your fav restaurant \u2026 they got your number, and so will everyone else. . You called your carrier for an upgrade \u2026. this is legally tricky, the service center may infact be a company contracted by your carrier, they have their own tos and privacy (hidden from public) because when you search your carrier, you get \u2018your carrier\u2019 you dont get the contracted company\u2026. they have a 1 2 3 agreement policy which does not require your written approval and works like this: 1 you called them 2 you requested a service from them 3 you completed the call to them once you pass all 3 of these, you are then legally allowing this company to do whatever they want with your number. (this was on a docu about cold calling centers and how they get peoples details and are legally allowed to share/sell that information). . Your friend or a random person used your number to fill in a competition form, they dont want spam, but they have no issues putting down a fake number which isnt theirs. . There are other ways, but these are the most common. ",

Inquire for bank account and you will start receiving call from loan department or insurance department. They transfer or send it .. Hope it helps ",
