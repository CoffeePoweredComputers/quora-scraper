            "answer_text": "Do you change over a SIM card before or after setting up a new phone? I've done it both ways. When I setup the phone first, without the SIM, I had to go back after I was all done and reset the network settings back to factory default to get cellular internet working. Of course, doing that that also clears all your remembered WiFi networks, so I had to re-join all those networks again. It\u2019s not a huge deal, just inconvenient. In other words, I found it slightly more adventageous to transfer the SIM before setting up the phone. ",

            "answer_text": "I put the SIM and any memory card I intend to use in as the first steps in the setting up after fully charging the battery, as the phone needs to know which network it is connecting to to optimise the setup for data and some messaging services. The optimisation can be done later, but doing so only saves a few seconds without having a working phone connection. ",
