            "answer_text": "Basic linear algebra is a pretty general requirement. With either a math or a physics major, you'll necessarily learn that. From there, the answer depends on your particular interest and will follow that interest. By that I mean that if you want to do algorithms, then you'll need the mathematical background necessary for complexity theory as well as for the applications of the particular algorithms. If you want to focus on crypto, then you'll need the math for that. If you're interested in quantum error correction, there is the math behind the various codes. ",

            "answer_text": "In the first year of studying quantum computing One must need a good hand in linear and abstract algebra which includes matrix manipulation as well. Group theory also helps. As I didn't do intense research work in the field so I don't have much idea what math exactly you need to master in.  And yes as I were involved in quantum repeaters' technology we needed some of nubmer theory also. As this is a field where more you study more you'll come to know what are the essential mathematical tools eventually. All the best. ",
