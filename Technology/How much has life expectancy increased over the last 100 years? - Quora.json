            "answer_text": "A hell lot! Life expectancy has increased from 34.1 years in 1913 to 72 years[1] in 2018 for the whole world. Let us see a graphical representation of life expectancy for all the continents and for the world as a whole from 1770 to 2015.  You can see that life expectancy was still at almost 29 years until the mid-nineteenth century,where it had been for the whole agricultural past of humankind, and then suddenly boom and it was increasing at an ever increasing rate. It has never stopped since and is still increasing. I think, it is one of the landmark achievements of science and human ingenuity. The other shocker is that the life expectancy has not only increased in the developed countries but throughout the world even in the poor countries of Sub-Saharan Africa although they took some more time to start. The biggest contribution to this increase of life expectancy was due to child mortality decrease. This was because children are fragile and because the death of child brings down the average more than the death of a 60 year old. Take a look at the chart below.  In all of the countries, the child mortality has decreased from more than 40%in 19th century to close to close to 4% now. That is a lot. Isn\u2019t it? The other factor that has contributed to increase in life expectancy is a decrease in maternal mortality[2] over the years. Have a look.  The rate for the entire world, after dropping almost half in just twenty five years, is now about 0.2%. Now, some of you may be thinking: Well, are we really living longer or we just surviving infancy in greater numbers? The answer, it seems, is that not only are we surviving infancy in greater numbers but we are actually living longer today than anytime in our past history. Here is a chart that shows life expectancy at different ages in UK at different times in the past.  As you can see, no matter how old you are you have more years ahead of you than people of your age did in the earlier centuries or decades. This is awe-inspiring, atleast to me. If it isn\u2019t to you, you better fuck-off! This achievement of human knowledge, I think, can\u2019t be put into words as you cannot fathom the tragedy a mother suffers when she losses her only child who is below 10. Multiply that by a million and you would, maybe, get an idea of how much suffering and tragedy has the humanking averted because of the increasing body of knowledge of science. As economic historian Johan Norberg put it, we tend to think that \u201cwe approach death by one year for every year we age, but the average person approached death by just seven months for every year they aged.\u201d Thank you.
