            "answer_text": "Introduce fiat currencies with demurrage and allow several \u2018central banks\u2019 to compete for business - may the best win. Also remove any protection of intellectual property or similar things, at least abolish long term protection from copying.. as this will be a block for competition. Similar things are - trades, with access limits or cab riders who have to get a license that is limited in number.I don\u2019t say remove technical skill or oversight or best practices.. don\u2019t get me wrong. Just remove market entry barriers, so you get perfect competition. Free market capitalism will drive the cost of any product via competition down to the marginal cost. That\u2019s what you want as an economic system for your participants. This will make everyone rich pretty much - according to his ability to work or trade or service. And yes, social weak are not cared for by this economic solution. That\u2019s were your political system needs to step in and collect some help from the population that is then given to the ones that can\u2019t help themselves. Unfortunately I have no idea how you solve this politically.The conservatives (incumbents) will not want to change from the status quo and the left will not be cheering you on either.And once you start tampering with the legal tender you will have any granny and pa against you, as you endanger their savings/retirements.. Your only hope to get something like this off the ground at least locally are grassroots organizations, like the Chiemgauer in Germany. Be aware that the central government of any country doesn\u2019t like this.. they will also try to shut this down, if it becomes too big or successful. Good luck. ",
