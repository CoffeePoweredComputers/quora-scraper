            "answer_text": "If I were a betting man: Similar look to the current model, sans optical drive. ( I really expect Apple to declare war on physical media this year ) I can see them putting a MBA style flash chip on my motherboard to boot from, complemented by a spinning drive.  Think a fatter take on the new MacBook Air with slightly upgraded guts, and a significant increase in battery size.  Small number of ports, maybe with LightPeak, but I don't expect to see USB 3.0 or HDMI.  I'd probably say sometime in February. ",
