            "answer_text": "I would say it depends on a few things.  The answer will be geared toward a normal average american with ideas of how a 3D printer may be awesome, but no business need pushing the decision.  A hobbyist or enthusiast perspective more so than a commercial or industrial perspective.  Will you be capable of understanding how to fix, repair, troubleshoot, and keep the printer going and tuning it in?   This alone can take some effort as well as some basic computer programming understanding, some electrical understanding and a touch of mechanical understanding.  Also, you will need time and patience and the willingness to put yourself and your firmware files our there on IRC to get help when you have problems you don't understand how to solve. If you are a fast learner and/or versatile jack of all trades type then comes the next question.  The first question just addressed the ability to build/operate/repair your 3D printer.  The second question set is geared towards its value or worth to you in a capacity that it prints things out.  Are you willing or able to learn 3D drafting or modeling software in order to make a print? Is the size and specifications of the items printed important?  To what degree of accuracy?   Will the time spent on designing the part, printing the part, redsigning the part (or adjusting the printer) and printing the part at least once more, if not several times more, still allow the printed part to hold value over other means of manufacture, or obtaining the wanted part? I feel that individuals coming from an artistic standpoint can possibly derive more value from the printer because the specifications may not be as important for printing figurines, or interesting jewelry, accessories, or the myriad of artistic capabilities. I also believe the printer holds more value to those that are already versed in the software (like SolidWorks) and are able to be very efficient with their time spent creating the 3d model and making any adjustments.   I think a similar way to look at the value of the printer is similar to a regular printer.  Having one does not allow you to more easily create an awesome novel, merely print novels you find written by others, or print your own after the hard work of writing it is complete. If you are not satisfied with others work to fit your needs, then you will need to create what you desire, and the 3d printer merely prints it out once it has been designed.  Many of the downloadable files are in STL format, for tinkering with the design after the fact is more difficult and limited to simply big scale changes like the scale of the print, not adjusting the size of a figurines nose.  Don't think I am preaching all doom and gloom.  Some projects can be rather simple, but as you progress you find even simple projects can be improved and enhanced along with your skill.  Such projects are great for learning the 3d design software you choose.  An example would be a simple 2 battery holder that would seem to be just a rectangle box.  Then you realize it would be nice to round some edges, add some Positive + and Negative - markings that are recessed.  Then you want to curve the box so the batteries nestle in nice.  Then you realize the curve can be hollowed from the outside to allow for a wiring path.  Soon enough you have a specialized battery holder that is clearly marked for an end user, and is capable of nesting some of the wiring allowing for a cleaner presentation and wire management. Feel free to ask more specific questions that more clearly indicate your use case.  ",

            "answer_text": "There are some really good answers here, but I\u2019d like to throw in a few things. As the answer is like Mikan and other wrote, complicated. There are newer printers that are pretty much unbox and run. Lulzbot Mini, Zortrax are examples. They\u2019re not cheap, but with their specialized slicing software, it doesn\u2019t take much effort to get parts. To me, the pre-cursor to the question really is, \u201cwhat do I plan to do with it\u201d If you can answer that with something that makes sense for what you do, then it may very well be worth it. They are not for the typical consumer who is not in the design or development world and think they\u2019re just going to download models from thingverse and print them. That gets old very fast. On the other hand, if you regularly build things, are modifying parts from Home Depot for a project, have your own mini mill, and are willing to learn some software, then 3D printing as the world thinks of it (small, home based FDM machine) can be extremely handy. I regularly build custom brackets, repair parts, and other things for around the house. Filament isn\u2019t as big of a cost as you might think. The newer filaments can be costly, but print in standard ABS, PLA or PETg, and you can get rolls for $25 unless you are in a proprietary machine like the Zortrax. If you are a product designer like I am, then a printer (or 3) is an essential way to cost-effectively prototype your designs without going to a service like Shapeways or 3Dsystems quickparts. I will often times tell my clients that part of the design fee is for \u201cfirst-off\u201d prototypes. Not the prettiest parts, but essential to proof of concept before spending serious dollars on a professional print service. Now, as for fixing them. Some of the best companies that are making the printers have excellent customer service, and will work with you to figure out the problem. There are also large communities of \u201cmakers\u201d that came before you that will help fix, and probably upgrade your machine. Lastly, if all you need is the occasional part printed, use 3D hubs to find local printers to your area manned by people who are enthusiasts in the field. I have my printers on there, and I get jobs from people who need a part made, that don\u2019t want the hassle of dealing with a printer themselves, but also cannot afford the professional services. And if you would like a breakdown of some of the primary technologies out there, I have a free email course I wrote just to help people understand the terminology, costs, and options out there in the home space as well as professional systems. 3dprinting-email landing - Catz Design Farm ",
