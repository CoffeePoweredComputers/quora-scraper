            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say if you have 40k to spend on a smartphone then save your 10 grands and buy the 30k ONE PLUS 3T. It's an amazing device with FLAGSHIP level SPECIFICATIONS. There is nothing which comes even close to beat this piece of perfectly crafted uni body metal design. CAMERA The camera clicks some amazing pictures in daylight, has good Color reproduction, the dynamic range is also on the higher side.The videos that you record are very stable although sometimes the focus tends to lose the subject and it may go haywire.But most of the times the footage that comes out are amazing. IF YOU MAY!. So to conclude you can say that it is a nice camera . SCREEN With the gorgeous 5.5inch AMOLED display it gives you pure and deep blacks , colors pop out and with the love for popping colors among us (the Indians) it seriously packs a punch. This is the closest one can get to the AMAZING PANELS that SAMSUNG provides in their smartphones. The full HD 1080p display may lack those extra pixels which other Flagships may provide you but then there is hardly any content that can utilize those insane amount of pixels\u2026.. So i\u2019d always prefer some additional battery instead of those added pixels. PERFORMANCE With 6GB of DDR4 RAM and Snapdragon 821 proc. under the hood there is hardly anything you can complain about. Apps run smooth and so does the transition within the apps. Gaming is a pleasure on this device 3-D games run smoothly without any lag.There is some occasional heating here and there but at the end of the day it\u2019s something you will feel proud about. LOOK and FEEL What can i say about the amazing Uni-Body metal design that the One Plus team has put up. It hardly differs from its predecessor the mighty ONE PLUS 3.Yeah you can say that it takes inspiration from the HTC ONE but then HTC ONE was a very nicely built device. IF YOU MAY! BATTERY Well what can i say about this amazing piece of technology implemented in this device. DASH CHARGING is one of the very few things that made 2016 a year to remember , well only after Di Caprio winning an OSCAR (finally!! :P ) and Leicester winning the Premier League (surprisingly!!). In short the battery is amazing and it will easily last for the better part of your day( you may even end up using it for the second day , if you are one those light users..) and even if for some reason it dies half way down your day then you always have that amazing FAST Oh SORRY! DASH CHARGING which will instantly fill up your device with juice to last for another 4\u20135 hours in just 20\u201325 minutes. So BOTTOM-LINE Do Not read any further , GO AND BUY IT NOW!!!!!!
