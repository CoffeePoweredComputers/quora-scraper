            "answer_text": "Here is a list of some cool technological advancements i bumped into. DNA Hacking- J. Craig Venter, the bio-entrepreneur whose company helped map the genome, reached a new milestone in 2010 when he built the world's first synthetic, self-replicating chromosome. He loaded some homemade synthetic DNA into a bacterial cell and watched it grow and divide according to computer-generated As, Ts, Gs and Cs. By his own reckoning, he had created \"life.\" Geoengineering- Geoengineering uses science and technology to \"hack\" the planet back into shape. Since global warming is the biggest threat, scientists are proposing creatively creepy (and very expensive) ways to artificially cool the atmosphere by either blocking the sun's rays or sucking up excess CO2. Robots Designed to Kill- It is a prediction for the year 2033 and one we can basically count on happening is the anonymous robot. While these robots could certainly spare a lot of human life, the fact that they will identify targets and kill them without any human input, is somewhat of a scary thought(P.S might end up evolving like skynet). Artificially Intelligent Personal Assistants- These personal assistants will know the very intimate details of our very lives, including our range of behavior and personal preferences. They can write an e-mail or book an appointment for us. Pillows To Replay Dreams- The piece of technology comes down to a pillow, which, through its conducting fibers, will monitor all of the brain\u2019s electrical activity. This monitoring of electrical brain activity also means that it might be possible to replay dreams on a computer screen. Implantable Mobile Devices- The location of such a device could potentially be one\u2019s arm or even one\u2019s head, and have among their various practicalities things such as never losing our phones and the ability to monitor our health. Exoskeletons- These exoskeletons will be made out of artificial muscles that are five times stronger than our current muscles. In addition, the technology inserted into the exoskeletons could make humans be endowed with super powers like increased strength, speed, memory or night vision. Some predict that these will make a very popular line of active wear, in addition to serving the elderly and the military. Telepresence- Researchers at the university of california's institute for telecommunications and information technology (calit2) in san diego are using super-high-definition projectors, wall-size screens, and extreme internet connections to relay images and sounds that are barely distinguishable from reality. In the future, this may enable full \"telepresence,\" the illusion that another person is physically present when he or she is actually in another location. Tritium batteries- After years of advances in battery technology, many of our mobile gadgets still peter out before sunset on any given day. Several high-profile efforts are under way to fix this pesky problem, but one of the least pursued and yet most profound developments in energy technology is the battery that virtually never needs a recharge. Known as the betabattery, this little powerhouse could provide continuous power for years. Razer Project Valerie- Razer's Project Valerie concept is a laptop that adds two foldable displays that expand out from the primary screen in the center. Each display is 17 inches diagonally and supports 4K resolution, and Razer says they can be used independently or together as one giant display. Intel's Credit Card-Sized Computer- Intel\u2019s Compute Card, which is about the size of a credit card, is a mini-computer designed to be easily inserted into smart devices. The idea is to make upgrading gadgets like smart refrigerators, interactive retail kiosks, and connected security cameras as easy as swapping out one component. This prevents the need to buy an entirely new system once new standards in connectivity or faster processors are released. The computer includes essentially all of the same aspects of a standard-sized computer, including a processor, memory, storage, and wireless tech. Google Glass- Google Glass is a wearable, voice-controlled Android device that resembles a pair of eyeglasses and displays information directly in the user's field of vision. Google Glass offers an augmented reality experience by using visual, audio and location-based inputs to provide relevant information. Honda\u2019s self-balancing motorcycle- Honda showed off its new Riding Assistant Technology that keeps your bike balanced when it\u2019s moving at speeds less than three miles per hour. The tech will even work when the rider isn\u2019t onboard, meaning you never have to worry about your bike falling over on its side ever again. Internet-connected toothbrush- The Kolibree toothbrush claims to be the world's first Internet-connected toothbrush. It analyzes your brushing and lets you track your habits over time through an app for Android and iOS devices. The toothbrush contains a sensor that tracks the areas of your mouth that you're brushing, and will let you know what sections might need a little more attention. Puzzlebox Orbit- The Puzzlebox Orbit is a Brain-Controlled Helicopter i.e., a mini helicopter you control with your mind. And the infinitely long list goes on\u2026.. ",

            "answer_text": "Entire data of the world can be stored in 4 grams of DNA. A gram of DNA can store 455 exabytes of data. An exabyte has one billion gigabytes. The world\u2019s data is around 1.8 zettabytes, and a zettabyte has 1,000 exabytes. So yes, all the world\u2019s data can be stored in a DNA hard drive the size of a teaspoon. Computation can not be done without generating heat. Rolf Landauer discovered in 1961 that every bit destroyed generates at least kTln2 joules of heat, where k is Boltzmann constant and T is absolute temperature. Microsoft wants to put their cloud data center under water. Project Natick is aimed at building and running a data center submerged in the ocean which can make data centers efficient and eco-friendly solving the biggest problem of keeping them cool. Only 8% of the world's currency is in physical form, the rest exist on computer only.WiFi Was Created By A Composer And Film Star . One of the most commonly used forms of accessing the internet is wireless connectivity, also knows as WiFi. Unlike what most people think, the concept of Wifi was created by Hollywood film star Hedy Lamarr. Her mathematical background and friendship with composer George Antheil created the very foundation of WiFi connectivity we use today. Their objective during World War II was to allow torpedo radio signals to hop between frequencies to avoid jamming. One of the broadcast standards derived from this concept is WiFi.Scientists can now use deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to store and retrieve images. Videos, images, emails and other digital data up to 10,000 gigabytes in size can be stored in a smear of DNA.The most dangerous virus ever created in the form of a worm is called ILOVEYOU. It attacked by replicating itself and crashing systems. It first arrived through e-mail messages as a love letter from a secret admirer. Once the email was opened and the attachment is clicked on, the virus spread fast.In February 2009, Google tweeted for the first time ever on Twitter. The tweet was \u201cI\u2019m 01100110 01100101 01100101 01101100 01101001 01101110 01100111 00100000 01101100 01110101 01100011 01101011 01111001 00001010.\u201d When translated from binary into English, the tweet says \u201cI\u2019m feeling lucky.\u201dTo combat global warming, scientists are proposing creative ways to artificially cool the atmosphere by either blocking the sun\u2019s rays or sucking up excess CO2. The plan is to \u201chack\u201d the planet back into shape.LinkedIn, Youtube, Yelp, and SpaceX were all founded by PayPal . They are collectively known as PayPal Mafia. Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman are members of this mafia. ",
