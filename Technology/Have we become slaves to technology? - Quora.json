            "answer_text": "No we still have not.  Human sensory perceptions and inferences are far too advanced. What the previous generation calls as human touch is very different from what current generation calls it. It's still human touch.  We cannot live without electricity but that does not mean human touch is lost. But that statement underestimates the importance of the invention of electricity. It's a necessary part of human life. It has made lives better. Then comes this huge self righteous talks about how ancient people had better lives without rhyme or rationale. We will truly become \"slaves\" of technology when machines take over the world and start ruling us - a sneak peek of which we have seen in The Matrix and other such flicks. There is this huge judgment on social media and higher gods of the Internet looking down upon lower beings of the Internet. Technology is seen as synonymous with smart phones.  Though it is true that most people who own smart phones want to see the world through its camera, the basis of the desire is human experience. Humans want their experience to be recorded, shared, relived and retrospected. When technology aids that, it seems as though we have fallen prey to it, but if there were a way the brain is able to telepathically whatsapp or Facebook it's experience to a bunch of common minds, we would have done it already. At the basis of every habit or phenomenon which changes human dynamics, there is always alternate thought. Technology has a long way to go to completely seep into our lives. The goal is to get machines to do mundane activities and let humans focus on better things. For eg, it is highly possible that your refrigerator will automatically sense what items need to be ordered from the grocery store and get it for you. But going to the grocery store is a human experience which is now discounted. People meet each other in a grocery store. It will then be interesting to watch what new experiences humans will substitute that time for, or did they just miss the love of their life by not visiting these social hubs or will technology aid them to find a perfect match? These things are yet to happen and it will be interesting to watch the change in human dynamics. Facebook and all social media platforms are bringing people together today. There is this self righteous judgment on them today but at the heart of it they have helped people connect, and reflect a collective resonation of brain vomit. Today social media and latching on to a smart phone is purely a human choice - not a necessity. More and more humans are making that choice. It is far more easier to click a button and support digital India than go to an underprivileged village in India and fund/setup a free wifi zone there. But at the same time collective brain vomit tells us about what's trending in human minds today - no doubt. I come across people who want to have zero connect with their profile on the Internet. They aren't there on Linked In, on Facebook, on Twitter. Nowhere. But the big question is are they missing out? The truth is yes. More people have started realising this truth and have now made an attempt to start a small profile in some corner. It's amusing and astounding at the same time. We are heading towards a direction where our day to day survival will be in the hands of machines. A machine will drive us to work. A machine will order our food. A machine will tell us what to do with life. We aren't there yet. We don't know if we will be and its too soon to tell if it's good or bad. It is not easy to make a slave out of the human brain.  That said we must with immediate effect stop judgment of people with smart phones and posting food pics in social media. They are equally living their life as someone who doesn't. Life experience is very relative. Just like how we moved on with electricity being part of our lives, we will we able to adapt to technology playing a major part in our lives. We will adapt and move on. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes we are.  \u201cAs people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate.\u201d   As the quotation says nowadays people rely more and more on technology rather than their own brains to solve an issue. I strongly agree to the point. There can be a matter of fact that these growing technologies are also the invention of great human brains. But they help to solve the problem more easily than humans. If this condition persists then the work given to the human brain decreases. In the future we are like mere robots doing any work without thinking.     As per the fact it states that\" most of the humans only use 10% of their brain\" so his IQ level is very low. If he starts using his brain his IQ level will be immense and unbeatable even when the opponent is going be a robot.      Most of the people lack self confidence among themselves and they trust on technology to resolve their issues and problems. They don\u2019t seek methods to boost up their confidence level and think and solve their problems. They rely on the easiest method as possible such as technology. By a good technological growth we can call our country a developing one. But what about the people living in that country? A question should arise in our heart.\" ARE THEY DEVELOPING OR DIMINISHING?\" If each and every citizen of our country thinks of this situation then they will not fall into this trap.    But time is flying; we have already fallen into the hands of the robots. Surely there will be a war between robots and humans at the end. Robotic world is about to begin, we people are going to be their slaves for ever.Could you imagine a situation worse than this? Of  course not.    There is good proverb which says \"  A stitch in time saves nine\". That\u2019s a good way to go, we adhere to the proverb and do the easiest and best thing as possible without even thinking.    So let\u2019s take a situation, if a guy creates a puzzle and he wants his friends to use his brain and find out the answer for that puzzle. And u know what we people do. As simple as that drop the question in the net and there you go , you have the answer for the puzzle and that guy appreciates that you are a genius without knowing the reason behind the answer. And his friend feels proud? what a cheater!!! Is it good? think for a second. And you keep on doing like this all the time. Suddenly at some point of time he takes you to a quiz competition thinking that you are a genius and at that time you tell the truth and lose the game. What will your friend think ABOUT YOU at that time.       ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE YOUR BRAIN TO A SO CALLED ELECTRONIC DEVICE OR USE IT FOR YOURSELF AND SAVE YOUR LIFE??                                       \"Think Twice and Act Wise\" ",

In place of HUMAN BEINGS Technology have took place in every where in home, schools, colleges and specially in offices. Now a days every work is done through technology from waking up to sleeping time that\u2019s why the human brains IQ is not much progressive and one the other hand we can say\u2026.. Technology is much more prominent in life, HOW? very simple\u2026 because human brains is developing these technologies for human safety for human welfare every technologies is being develop for the world purpose. Rankethon Education is the only Education which is dealing with the ROBOTICS and ROBOT we all know that is use to the work more than 10 peoples work at one time it\u2019s a machine so we trust it adore it more than a Human. Rankethon Team proving student a better place to learn techniques and how to develop this kind of features for the future so that the student can easily evaluate their skills. Rankethon Giving Invention to ROBOTIC field and it is necessary too if for chance human sometime can\u2019t do that work which ROBOT can easily do that piece of work in a simple way out. So it is necessities that technology have that power and a human slave or as assistance. In both case human have that capability to do a research on such situations. SO, Rankethon Education is making it life easier to live in future with ROBOTICS. Technology have took place but it is for betterment of life time consuming..and life too. Overall the conclusion took out that we are making the slaves for future generation\u2026. Technology have taken place but for betterment.

            "answer_text": "Early man invented fire, agriculture, the wheel, pottery etc. These are also technologies. It is human nature to discover and invent something new. After the industrial revolution, we have changed extensively. Now we are doing most of the things different from our ancestors. Inventions are good things. Inventing and discovering new things proves that we humans are interested in life and want to make it easier and sophisticated. The Recent advancement in communication and technological sectors like mobile, automobile etc have helped us tremendously. This shows our positive and progressive behavior. As every coin has two sides same is the case with technology. It depends on users that how much they use it. Now technology has become part and parcel of our lives. We can see kids who should go to the playground for their entertainment but they prefer to stay with their smartphones. The young generation is over obsessed with technology especially mobile phones. That's why nowadays it is really easy to find people suffering from many lifestyle diseases which are really harmful to us. It is said that excess of something is really harmful and we need to understand this. If this thing continues we will see the trend becoming opposite instead of we using technology, technology will be using us. ",

Since taking this job I am surprised as to how many people I see walk into the Cafe without ever making a human interaction. Both hands are held upright holding diligently onto a device, usually an Iphone or Samsung Phone. The person will then place their order and while waiting for the food to cook will scroll on the screen using their thumb in a very Facebook like manner. Most of the people don\u2019t comment they just read the news or memes of their friends or friends of their friends. I think the reason behind this \u201cZombie Apocalypse\u201d is that technology has made it easier to interact with those that you have already proven a mutual interest with. No longer do you have to make small talk with someone with completely different world views than yourself. Part of me thinks that this is a disappointing trend for our current generation. The other part of me that suffers from social anxiety does like the quiet time though. ",
