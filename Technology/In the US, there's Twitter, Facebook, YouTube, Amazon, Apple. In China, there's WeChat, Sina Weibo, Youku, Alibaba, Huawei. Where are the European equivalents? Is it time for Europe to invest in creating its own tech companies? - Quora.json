            "answer_text": "IMO, all these proprietary services are a bad thing. We used to have something approaching \u2018social media\u2019 using open protocols and the user chose their own \u2018app\u2019 to utilise those protocols/APIs and present the user with differing UIs. Now, everything is proprietary and pretty much locked in (to one degree or another); and the result is that every user is now subject to the politics of the various countries that control the corporations. To put it mildly, it was better before. Anyway, Europe had plenty of tech companies, but they were stomped all over (read: squashed and/or bought out) by aggressive American companies, and then disappeared mostly. I might also point out that the USA, China and Europe are not equivalent entities (two nations and a geopolitical continent of sorts), and they aren\u2019t even the only ones\u2026what about the Indian subcontinent, and them down under, for example? Are they invisible or somehow don\u2019t count? ",
