            "answer_text": "Well the advantages of single blade razor over a multi-blade are many. The improved shave quality, the improved skin and face conditioning, the improved appearance of your face and skin, the knowledge that you are producing less waste and using less money to achieve superior results.  These are bad for the environment The disadvantages are really only a few and most of these disappear after a short while. A disadvantage is the fact that you are going to have to TOTALLY relearn how to shave. Yes, everything you thought you knew about shaving is COMPLETELY wrong when using a DE Safety razor. This part of DE shaving is the part that causes most to give up. Because most who try it for the first time also do NO research into the proper technique of DE razor shaving.  DE shaving looks similar to modern cartridge shaving but the appearances are deceptive. The DE razor requires that the razor be used with NO pressure on the face and the stroke used is much shorter than the modern cartridge. Early attempts at DE shaving for me were painful and sometimes bloody. But the motivation to learn and master this new skill kept me at it.  Once the stroke and pressure are relearned and you are enjoying some success at this new way of shaving the real learning begins. Because DE shaving is very nuanced and varied. Changing the brand of blade used in the razor may cause a significant change in the results. Some razors work better and some you have to be more careful with.  GOOD video Adjusting the angle at which one holds the razor to the face also changes the closeness or smoothness of the shave. And then there is the whole thing about the lather that you can use.  There are hundreds if not thousands of variations and improvements that you can discover. Having been in this for almost two years I can say that my shaves are VASTLY superior to anything I ever achieved in cartridge shaving. Check out some online shaving forums like;Badgerandblade.comand some YouTube videos on how to start traditional shaving and you will soon see the benefits and advantages. ",

            "answer_text": "I use an old-style safety razor that opens (to change the blade) by twisting the bottom of the handle. It is a new version of the old style - just bought it a couple of years ago. Before that I used an antique version of the same type. I lost the antique one in a house fire and still miss using it. The antique version I had was equipped with a collar onder the shaving head. The collar had a series of numbers - 1 to 9 - and was used to adjust the closeness level of the shave. Still, I prefer the newer, non-adjustable one to any cartridge or multiblade razor I have ever used and I used several before I realized how superior the older design really is. The older design, single blade rarely nicks me. Those cartridge razors always left me looking like I had gone five rounds with a porcupine - bleeding from several, tiny holes in my skin - and caused terrible razor rash while still not giving me as smooth a shave. I have kept a beard of one kind or another most of the time for probably the last twenty years, give or take, so I am mostly shaving my neck and shaping my beard. Another thing - while a good mug, shaving soap and brush can be nice I actually prefer shaving oil. I think it results in even fewer nicks, an even closer shave and you see the areas you are shaving better when they aren't obscured by lather or foam. I used to buy some that was inexpensive and had clove oil in it - clove can act as a minor pain blocker in case of nicks and it smells nice, IMO- but I haven't seen it in a while so I started making my own by mixing mineral oil and peppermint extract - I find strong peppermint extract to be bracing and it adds a pleasant smell. I always have to shake the mixture before use to emulsify the ingredients. Then simply put a few drops in the palm of one hand, add several drops of water, rub the hands together vigorously to mix it all up then rub it into the areas to be shaved. Maybe try it, sometime. ",
