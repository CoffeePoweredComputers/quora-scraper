            "answer_text": "When you force others to accept your beliefs. People have very different ways of life, different cultures, different moral values and upbringings. So differences in belief are due to priorities of the culture. Even if you believe something or some way is right, even if in your heart you know it is, you can't force another individual to accept it. And this is where alot of the tension comes from today. One group or groups have power over another to force them to accept their beliefs. Which makes void the freedom of speech/ religion. These are subtle undertones that set a precedence for further down the line. If you can force someone to accept a belief under the guise that it will stop \u201chate\u201d (or something to that affect), and get the public to willingly enforce it upon one another, you can dissolve the Bill of Rights. This is how we get laws like the Patriot Act. Where you are no longer guaranteed a fair trial under the \u201csuspicion\u201d of terrorism, which they will loosely define to fit any alternative opinion. When you make it illegal to discipline children to combat \u201cabuse\u201d, and if someone in the world influenced a child in a way adverse to the parent's beliefs, and the parents are punished because they are in disagreement, the precedence has been set that children are the property of the state, then by the law of syllogism all citizens are property of the state, are not lords of their own bodies and cannot own property because they are property. And all of this was facilitated by the citizens themselves, to have power one over another. ",

            "answer_text": "When does acceptance go too far? Let\u2019s see. Acceptance gone too far. Well, as long as it\u2019s your own acceptance, I can\u2019t see how it could - supposing that in addition to whatever offer, person, or aspect of reality you\u2019re primarily accepting, you accept the consequence of your acceptance. Otherwise, GROW UP. It\u2019s hand-in-hand! Caveat 1. I suppose the law. If what you accept is criminal, and you\u2019re like \u201cPfft! I don\u2019t mind\u201d - you may find there\u2019s some police jam associated with it down the road. Check your local ordinance. If you were supposed to report it and you didn\u2019t, that\u2019s afoul of one of the worst kinds: afoul of the law, if it comes out. However! Supposing you accept (in addition to whatever criminal act you\u2019d primarily accepted) the consequence of your acceptance, hey! I guess you\u2019re ready for anything then? Caveat 2. What if you accept things that harm you? That\u2019s\u2026kind of a dumb move, friend. Seek help from a pro, and I don\u2019t really mean a plumber (unless that\u2019s separately indicated). Seek advice and input from friends. Family, if any. Read a therapeutic book on assertive doings, and how they get done. Find help: it doesn\u2019t behoove you to accept what harms you. It can\u2019t! Whose behalf are you on? I mean, there\u2019s only so much I or anyone can do, here. If you do accept it, then you\u2019re the one responsible. To really accept anything is to accept responsibility. Don\u2019t worry too much about that, you can always reject or deny responsibility if someone brings it up later, but be aware also: they won\u2019t regard you as \u201cnot responsible\u201d thereby. They\u2019ll regard you as irresponsible. Do you care? I hate all the pressure in that last situation. QUIT IT! STOP HITTING YOURSELF or letting another! Please! It\u2019s a non-healthy behavioral option, and there are way better ways! So yeah. Those are ways acceptance may go to far, but the problematic part of it really is: if the person fully accepts the consequences of their acceptance, there\u2019s precious little you or I can do. Unless it\u2019s a minor child (look into it!). An adult is entitled to attempt any act not a crime. Entitled to choose, even choose risk. And while liable to law, we\u2019ve covered that already. Bottom line: Self-control doesn\u2019t work on others. Neither does morality: it is to ease and brighten your consequence of being. Acceptance? Is something only you can do for you. You are your own. No one is owed you. Not your attention, not your company, not your greater gifts of self, and not your acceptance. We are free of offer and free of decline. Whoever we decline, we deprive them of nothing that was theirs, thereby. So we are free. Free of gift and free of plea, appeal, request! We are free to reject, and free to accept. And it\u2019s really up to you doing it. No one else has standing, there. Not where you stand. You own that space. You are homo sapiens sapiens, equal in moral authority to any one; equal in dignity and human worth to every one. Accept it. You have every choice. ",
