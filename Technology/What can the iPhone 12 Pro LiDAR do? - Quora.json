            "answer_text": "The LiDAR sensor on the Iphone 12 Pro/Max basically fires out infrared rays(not visible to us humans) which helps it to make kinda like a 3D map of its surroundings.This helps greatly in making Augmented Reality(AR) more realistic.Also,this can help in taking precise measurements of objects using the phone camera.However,the best thing this sensor can do is making portrait mode a lot better,especially in harsh lighting conditions,providing better background blur/bokeh effect. Thats all.Hope this helps! ",
