            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t as the HDMI port in most laptops work only as output and not as an input. So you\u2019ll be able to extend from one laptop, but won\u2019t be able to receive it on the other laptop. But projecting wirelessly from one screen to another is possible. But lag and latency due to various factors will make working a little hard, but yes, you can watch videos and do some low intensity work. ",
