            "answer_text": "No. Weapons are not permitted on school campuses. Technically, fighting on school campus, even in self-defense, is not permitted. When you enrolled as a student, you and your parent/guardian signed a document stating that you'd abide by the school's rules. Breaking any of these rules will get you into trouble such as suspension and/or expulsion. It will go on your record as well, so any future colleges and employers will be able to see what you've done. I strongly recommend NOT stabbing another student, whether attacked or not. Dude, use your brain, and don't even bring a knife onto campus. ",

            "answer_text": "Self-defence always has to be proportional. If you stab someone, injuring or killing them, and your defence in court is \u2018But he hit me first!\u2019 I don\u2019t think the judge and jury will look very kindly on you. Plus you\u2019ll have to spend the rest of your life (much of which might well be in jail) living with the fact that you seriously injured or killed someone. I\u2019m sure your school doesn\u2019t allow knives to be carried. Don\u2019t carry a knife. It\u2019s as simple as that. ",
