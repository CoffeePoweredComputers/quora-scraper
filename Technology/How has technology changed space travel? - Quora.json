            "answer_text": "One cool advance has been the advent of the 3-D printer. If something goes wrong on the space station, and they don\u2019t have adequate equipment onboard, they could potentially have something 3d-printed to be used in space travel.   It won\u2019t just be to print tools, they could also be able to 3-d print special parts to be used on the spacecraft. And if you think about it, as 3d printing advances, this could open up a whole new doorway to assisting people who are living in space, or even, living on another planet. We essentially have the ability to email objects into space. ",

            "answer_text": "In a word: slowly. SpaceX on the surface seems to be making leaps and bounds forward, but it\u2019s really just mildly refining technology that\u2019s decades old and using bits of new tech to make old ideas \u2014 such as soft landing first stages \u2014 into reality. They and other companies are making a better pace than NASA, thanks to not being trapped in tradition and bureaucracy, true, but really they\u2019re just getting us to where we would be if NASA hadn\u2019t been shackled politically. One real advance has been in materials, but the one I\u2019m especially thinking of isn\u2019t ready for use out in space yet: NASA\u2019s RFX1, based originally on HDPE, is a plastic that beats aluminum both as radiation shield and in strength, wieght for weight, which offers promise for decent ships to get to Mars. That will be a game changer, not drastically but noticeably. ",
