            "answer_text": "For a lot of companies in a lot of industry sectors, it's turned out that the Internet has eaten everybody's lunch, and no one has figured out how to get lunch from the Internet.  (via The Free Dictionary) Never mind financial printing. Never mind the Internet. Let's travel back to the late 1980s -- the DTP (desktop publishing -- or as we printers call it, dipshit publishing) was already on a collision course with the printing world. Before the Internet and DTP, anything that needed page makeup and bulk numbers just had to go through a printing company (of any kind). It's an inescapable fact of life. Even for bulk photocopies, it's the printer that usually had the high-speed, high-output copying machines. Yes, we printers used to do all the extremely useful stuff that nearly every useless airhead brands as useless stuff we used to do in the old days. Printing used to be craft; now it's crap. FINANCIAL PRINTING IS WHAT?  (via FC Services) No, we're not Wall Street Guys. We're not bankers and the like. We're printers, and sometimes we even feel like those stupid desktop printers too. For those who might wonder, financial printer is just another name for security printer. It's just terminology. A security printer who specialises in printing IPO prospectuses, annual reports and similar is a \"financial printer.\" A security printer remains a \"security printer\" when he prints banknotes, legislation, bank forms, cheques, and assorted government bumpf like landing cards, tax return forms, etc. It's just like the \"bible printer\" -- just a book printer who specialises in bibles. I've printed confidential or secret non-financial publications for international NGOs and other public bodies before, so in their eyes I'm a security printer who happens to also be a financial printer. I mean, none of the things a financial printer does is any different from what a commercial printer does. The difference is working routines, and that's largely invisible even to other printers. The financial printer (who is a security printer) works with extremely tight deadlines, security protocols, the authorities breathing down his neck, and the material getting \"amended\" all the time -- aspects that 99% of commercial printers don't have to contend with on a daily or even hourly basis. And we only charge marginally higher than commercial printers for the [expletive] 'drama' we get from the bankers, lawyers, accountants and sundry cattle known as government regulators. ENVELOPE OF PROTECTION  (via Pascuzzi Law) The Internet's impact on financial printers hadn't been as bad as it had been on commercial printers (the great mass of ordinary printing companies). A large part of the \"protective envelope\" is that financial print is part of the legal reporting and disclosure requirements for listed companies. Listed companies are legally required to submit a litany of product and IPO prospectuses, quarterly and annual reports, transaction reports, stock ownership disclosures, schedules, public announcements, etc, to the regulatory authorities on a regular basis. These \"filings\" are for the public record. Regulatory authorities worldwide require the filings be in print form (the default) and anything else (i.e. online publication) as an add-on. Indeed, the regulatory framework requires the printing be done by a third party (hence us) and not by the underwriting banks or the listed companies themselves. Thing is, envelopes get ripped open too, and like condoms, they're disposed of after use too. THE INVISIBLE LUNCH-EATING MONSTER  (via Monster Lunch Box) The monster that ate financial printers' lunch isn't the Internet. It's electronic filing -- like the EDGAR filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). EDGAR started around 1993/94. Other countries have something similar from the same time. Even today, electronic filing is still largely additional to print filing. The fact that financial printers still get to handle most of the e-filing needs of listed companies is merely out of convenience since we handle their other financial printing needs anyway. Before the rise of e-filing, we'd typeset several rounds of surrealistic markups, output the final proofs, the whimsical client team finally signs off, the absent-minded regulators sign off, and then off to the presses! We print the crap, pack it, and deliver the crates to the regulators and/or banks. Of course, a week later the banks and regulators ring up and pay us to cart the crap away for pulping or the landfill. It all sounds incestuous, wasteful and inefficient described that way, but it's anything but in real life. There's a lot of labour, materials, transport, you name it, to upkeep lots of people's livelihoods across several different industry sectors. It's a lot less incestuous or wasteful than the food or garment sectors, I'll tell you that for less than 10 cents on the dollar. In the last 10 or 15 years, many countries' filing rules allow the companies to do their own e-filing, so the financial printer gets bypassed and sticks with the printed part. Unfortunately for us, the rules are extending the range of companies that need only e-filing and forgo print filing. So that slice of the print market is evaporating for us. We rue the day when e-filing is the default and optionalising print filing. LOVED BY EVERYONE ELSE, HATED BY US  (via PDF to Word Converter for Mac) In many ways, e-filing goes hand in hand with the PDF file. Indeed, a lot of commercial printers went belly-up as a direct result of the PDF. You can trust me on this because I've seen it with my own eyes everywhere over the years, thankyouverymuch. You don't even need to be imaginative to see the scenario. A lot of things that go into making a printed document or product used to be handled by brigades of secretarial typists and the printer. With the PDF, the final 'product' gets done by the singular person (or his singularly harried assistant) with the aid of various DTP or e-Pub software, and then output and circulated pretty much paperlessly. The soggy end of the world of electronic documentation is the paper-and-pulp sector, which is the world's most stratified (fragmented) industry sector. Problems in the paper-and-pulp side can wipe out the printing sector overnight. With the PDF, DTP and e-filing, the paper manufacturers and merchants weep with us printers, and we together lament the loss of bevies of smiling, cleavaged typists. For us financial printers, the PDF doesn't matter (officially anyway). We've got the e-filing and print filing (for now). For instance, the SEC's EDGAR filing right now requires plain text or HTML for official filings. PDFs are unofficial filings. LOSS OF LUNCH, PERIOD  (via The Cost Of A Free Lunch) Whether it's one or the other (or something else), the electronic racket is still ultimately loss of work and loss of income for us printers as a whole. The SEC claims ... err, states ... that e-filing helps transparency of dealings and protects the investor. We printers make no public opinion on the matter, which is another way of saying our private opinion is different (let's put it that way). There's not going to be a lot of investors when the investors themselves are running out of work and income. Then again, I'm not a Wall Street Guy, so it's none of my business, isn't it? Thanks for the A2A. You can take the above with a pinch of salt. We're taking arsenic instead. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A.  Robert Charles Lee has written what I would consider to be the authoritative answer -- he's in the business and everything he's written seems to be completely correct, from my personal experience.  I'll point out the irony that Robert is also in the IPO/corporate finance world in Hong Kong, as am I -- it's a small world.  One thing I'll note is that Hong Kong seems to be a bit behind the US and London in terms of the technology of the whole work-flow of financial disclosure and printing.  Even though it's a smaller world and seems like it ought to be easier to adopt technology in Hong Kong, the use of electronic filing feels to me to be ten or even 20 years behind Western markets.  The same is true with court filings and litigation procedures. \"The printer\" in the world of corporate finance is an institution that those outside it don't really know about or understand.  I think some of the functions of \"going to the printer\" for finance professionals are really important, in the sense that this step is an important milestone that forces all the stakeholders to focus on getting things right by a very specific date in a very specific way that produces a product that is very well understood.  If we really lose that almost ritualistic step, I think we may be sorry in the long run -- the quality of everybody's work may well suffer. ",
