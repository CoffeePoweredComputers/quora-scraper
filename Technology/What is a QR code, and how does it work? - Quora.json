What is a QR Code? QR code(quick response code) is the trademark for a type of matrix bar code or two-dimensional bar code.First designed for the automotive industry in Japan. A bar code is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes(numeric,alpha-numeric,byte/binary and kanji) to efficiently store data.  The QR code system became popular outside the automotive industry due to it's fast readability and greater storage capacity compared to standard UPC bar codes.Applications include product tracking, item identification, time tracking, document management,and general marketing. A QR code consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background,which can be read by an imagining device such as a camera and processed using Reed-Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. Some versions of QR Code symbols:  Ver1(21\u00d721)  Ver2(25\u00d725)  Ver3(29\u00d729)  Ver4(33\u00d733)  Ver10(57\u00d757)  Ver25(117\u00d7117)  Vr40(177\u00d7177) Modern History of QR Codes The QR code system was invented in 1994 by Denso http://Wave.It's purpose was to track vehicles during Q1manufacturing; it was designed to allow high-speed components scanning.

            "answer_text": "The idea behind a QR code is to create an image that can be scanned by any modern day Smartphone (with a QR code reader application) and translated into something more meaningful. QR codes are often used to contain web address information and links, but they can be used to direct Smartphone users to a multitude of other media too (e.g. videos, images etc). Obviously, that's all well and good, but what actually is the point of a QR code? Surely you can just type in a web address on your phone and visit the website that way? While that may be true, the point of a QR code is to simplify the process. Smartphone (or tablet PC) keyboards are tricky compared to desktop/laptop keyboards and most of the time, people simply can't be bothered to type in website addresses on their Smartphone. A QR code is used by marketers to simplify the process and therefore, entice more people into visiting a website or a piece of content. This is why marketers regularly place QR codes on banners, business cards, flyers, leaflets, posters and so forth. How Does A QR Code Work? Basically, a QR code works in the same way as a barcode at the supermarket. It is a machine-scannable image that can instantly be read using a Smartphone camera. Every QR code consists of a number of black squares and dots which represent certain pieces of information. When your Smartphone scans this code, it translate that information into something that can be easily understand by humans. Although that is the technical explanation of how a QR code works, something much more important to focus on is the fact that QR codes can be scanned at the touch of a button by the hundreds of millions of people around the world that use a Smartphone on a daily basis. This makes them great for marketers. If you've ever scanned a QR code with your Smartphone, you'll likely have noticed that they can be scanned extremely quickly (we're talking within a second-or-two here). This makes QR codes an extremely simple way to access stored information in an instant which in-turn, makes them a perfect solution to conversion-hungry marketers. ",
