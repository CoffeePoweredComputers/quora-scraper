            "answer_text": "The iMac 27\" retina 5K is the finest all in one computer known to man (or woman, for that matter).  Actually, until Apple updates the Mac Pro - the iMac is the finest computer, period. I have two of them - one is the latest 4Ghz version, and the other is almost as fast.  Both loaded with 32 Gb of memory and each with an auxilary second display, the Thunderbolt 27\".  (You will not get 5K resolution on the Thunderbolt auxilary, but 4K.) My belief is that one should always buy the latest and greatest when it comes to technology.  No matter what you buy, within a year there will be something better out, so that if you buy less than the fastest and greatest today, you are already one two maybe three or four! steps behind today, and will be five six seven eight maybe ten! steps behind in a year!  So do yourself a favor and get the best today, so that you will not be obsolescent for a good three years. Another reason to buy Mac is that even in 3 years when you sell your machine, you will get almost 50% of what you paid! MACs have the highest resale of any computers out there.  Try that! with a PC - in three years you'll be lucky to get 10% of the price paid on a PC - they depreciate mightily the moment you buy them. As well, Apple is QUALITY Are all PC computers junk like this HP 15-r210dx laptop I just got? AAPL is king. not junk like most all PCs. You mention the MBP.  Fantastic! I have one of those too, the latest 2.8 Ghz model, however the small screen of the MBP (even at 15\") and it slowness compared to the top iMac makes the iMac much better for the sort of stuff you are talking about. I use my iMacs for stock trading, word processing, website creation, internet work, Adobe Creative Suite etc.  MACs rule!  I am an original Apple developer and still get a discount on all my Apple goods, but even without a discount I would pay the price of Apple goods.  By the way, if you are a student you can get the student discount from the Apple Store. I recommend you get the latest MSFT Office for Mac 2016, and Adobe CS6.  You'll be set for most everything then. I also have Quark Express, Final Cut and programs like Quicken, MYOB and Quickbooks, but you might not need those. There is a beautiful program called Graphic Converter you might want to look into.  Available free online, just for MAC users! As well, while an iMac retina 5K might seem expensive, it really is not, compared to, for example the Mac Pro, and until a new version of the Mac Pro comes out, the iMac is the best MAC out there with benchmark speeds comparable to the Mac Pro.

            "answer_text": "If you can afford it and can make good use of it, definitely go for it. I have no doubts that it will be the best desktop computer you've ever used. The screen on the 27\u2033 iMac with Retina 5K display is killer. Like the best screen you've ever seen on anything. It's way better than a Retina MacBook Pro, and much better than a 4K TV. And with 27 inches of it, you will have a lot of screen real estate to do all kinds of tasks in a beautiful resolution. And even the base model has got a lot of power\u2014 definitely enough for the uses you mentioned. And unlike the current MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pros, you actually can upgrade the RAM yourself if you ever need to do so. If you want to save some money, or don't need all the power/size of the 27\u2033 iMac with Retina 5K display, I would recommend the 21.5\u2033 iMac with Retina 4K display\u2026 both of them are equally amazing. The 21.5\u2033 starts at $1499 with the 4K display, and the 27\u2033 starts at $1799 with the 5K display. I think both of those are a great deal if you need the screen real estate and power of either. Even if you don't need the screen size/power for what you'll be be doing, you will will be wowed by the display alone for that price. I've got the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display (Late 2014) and I love it. ",
