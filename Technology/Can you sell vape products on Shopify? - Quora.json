This is because Shopify payments does not support the sale of vape products. They\u2019ll shut down your store pretty quick if you\u2019re caught circumventing the rules. You\u2019ll want to find a third party payment gateway who works with high risk businesses selling vape products. Plenty of options out there. Good luck! ",

Generally, as long as the product is legal and your Shopify account does not have multiple high-risk issues (chargebacks, fraud, etc) they will allow you to sell vape products on the platform. However, their native payment gateway, Shopify Payments, will not be available to you as they prohibit tobacco/vape products. You\u2019ll need to find a third-party gateway that will allow you to process transactions for vape products.
