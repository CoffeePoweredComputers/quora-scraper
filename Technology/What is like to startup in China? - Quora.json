            "answer_text": "China is a country with a lot of energy. Everyone is keen to work hard and make success because they see everyone else doing the same. If you stay the same, others will get ahead of you. Basic costs in China can be quite low, with base salaries and cost of living very low. At the same time, even modest revenue can support a business with several staff. In addition, many people are making lots of money and so there are lots of people willing to invest with friends and family to get a business going.  The biggest problem is that salaries can be so low that people will jump ship to start their own business simply to make a living wage.  In addition foreigners and overseas returned Chinese are often so disrespectful of the locals, they will do what they can to sabotage a business (out of well deserved revenge). The other problem is that there is a gold rush mindset with waves of people turning up with money to invest, often undercutting existing businesses. ",
