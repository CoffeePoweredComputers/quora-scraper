            "answer_text": "I can only give an anecdotal example here, but my current phone is a Samsung S5 Mini that I\u2019ve had for more than five years now\u2026 it has an AMOLED display, and I haven\u2019t noticed any problems with it at all. It\u2019s still bright, no burn in, no colour cast, no missing pixels, and the flickering problem it had at low brightness settings when I first bought it was cured by an OS update. It\u2019s also proven to be an exceptionally rugged phone, especially in a slimline rubberised case, shrugging off the kind of impacts that led to my previous phone\u2019s (HTC Desire S) screen becoming noticeably cracked in short order. Until spring last year it was pristine, and it took an accident I then suffered, where I slipped and fell between the step onto a train and the station platform, landing very heavily against the train floor with the phone in my hand and the case open, to cause even the slightest of hairline fractures, that you can only really see or feel if you\u2019re trying to find it, and a slight crack to the cosmetic rear case. So if modern LCD based models can improve on that, then they must be essentially indestructible. ",

            "answer_text": "I have never heard of an LCD display such as IPS burning in. I did however hear numerous horror stories of OLED displays such as Samsung\u2019s Super AMOLED displays being burned in. There are some people who say that it takes a really long time to notice it. I never bought a phone or any other device with any kind of OLED or AMOLED display. I want one I can hold onto for as long as I want to without worrying about my phone\u2019s display self deteriorating. If you look on eBay for any Samsung phone it is mentioned in many listings that the display is burned in. That is something you may want to consider if you would prefer a device that is not prone to this built in defect. Any and all phones that come with OLED, AMOLED or Super AMOLED displays are technically defective as soon as they are manufactured just because of the inherent burn in issues with those display technologies. Samsung phones would be the best if they did not burn in. Burn in is the only real problem with them that I know of. ",

            "answer_text": "Given that it is an active technology with light being emitted at the pixel level, you can expect such displays will not last as long. (LCD screens are just filters with the light coming from a separate backlight.) However, it is also reasonable to expect that they will last long enough that their lifetime consideration does not deserve a great deal of weight in a purchase choice. You may also wish to take into consideration that the backlight for an LCD screen can also fail. ",

            "answer_text": "That's a biased and debatable question by many scientists and consumers. In my opinion, OLEDs are still in their infancy and have a few more years to become a more stable and reliable product than LCD. Some older LCDs were very poorly made, similar to early OLEDs, but LCDs quickly became more and more stable and better designed. Eventually OLEDs will completely replace LCDs. ",
