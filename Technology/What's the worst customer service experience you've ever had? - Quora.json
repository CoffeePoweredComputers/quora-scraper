            "answer_text": "Living in Germany. That sounds broad and vague, but I am constantly appalled at the level of customer service I receive here. Especially in restaurants. It\u2019s typical for a server to come to the table and ask for a drink order in a dry, emotionless tone. \u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d (or God forbid \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d) I can pretty much accept that servers, here, are really ordertakers and nothing more. Or I\u2019ve accepted it, really. What\u2019s harder to accept and even more appalling is a lack of customer service in American fast food chains. I was at a McDs a few months ago, and ordered for me and my kids. To insure that they got fresh burgers, I ordered their cheeseburgers with no onions but mine \u2026whatever, I like their onions. When the tray of food was finished, before I left the counter, I hefted my burger. It had obviously been under the heat lamp for a good 20\u201330 minutes. The bun was hard and crunchy. I pointed this out to the shift leader, and asked for another one. He picked it up and felt it through the wrapper and verbally disagreed with me. Again, in slow\u2026he told me that I was wrong. So he sets it down on the tray again. The manager on duty was nearby and noticed what was happening. He came over and asked if everything was ok. I repeated myself (this burger is old and hard, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s been under the heat lamp for almost a half hour and I\u2019d like a fresh one) then he too hefted my McDouble. Next he set it down and proclaimed, as well, that I was mistaken. I was speechless. Absolutely speechless. I\u2019ve been eating McDs for 37 years, that I can remember. Since before they came to be widespread in Germany. I spent a few years working in fast food, as a teen. And another 13 years in the restaurant business. I\u2019m well aware of McDs quality standards, and they were obviously not met on this occasion. I took my food and walked away. I won\u2019t return. I didn\u2019t bother asking for someone\u2019s name or phone number. There\u2019s no point. Customer service in Germany is a fucking joke. From time to time, however, I am surprised. I was at my favorite hardware store about 6 months ago buying tile for my bathroom. I was so impressed by the guy who helped me that I asked to speak to his supervisor when he returned a phone call. He couldn\u2019t help me there, though. He explained that he is the department head, and that he was just doing his job. I sung his accolades and asked that he pass my compliments along to his boss, because his service was outstanding. It really wasn\u2019t incredibly outstanding by my standards (rather good or better than average), but by German standards this guy was on a whole different level. ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2014I had many bad experiences\u2014however-there is one just comes to mind all the time. I think because it really got me by surprise. I was not expecting that response from the business owner\u2026.whom still seem hurt by my comment. Maybe I was rude when I said it. Here is the story\u2014Happened few years back. I have a favorite place I go and get pizza\u2014new York style pizza. I do love their pizza. That is the main reason I took our out of town guests to eat there when they asked for a place to have a nice lunch. We got there\u2014ordered few pizzas and pasta\u2014I think. This is a place in Tijuana-this restaurant\u2019s owner is an American citizen. Easy to tell just by his appearance and his strong accent when he speaks Spanish. My guests were from USA\u2014so, as the owner comes by our table\u2014he asked: \u201chow is the food\u201d? To which I responded: \u201cGood you asked, it is quite terrible.\u201d He then looked at me quite upset and asked what was the problem\u2014to which I responded, \u201call our food is quite salty\u2014Hard to eat it. Too much salt!.\u201d He simply did not respond and just took off, obviously upset. So, we try our best to eat what we could and then got ready to go, after we paid. When we were almost out of their patio\u2014he yelled at us: \u201cWho said the food was salty?\u201d I then turned around and said to him-\u201dAllow me to have my guests tell you, please\u201d. Then-one by one, all my two guests confirmed that in fact our food was very salty, everything. He then just turned around and stormed into his restaurant. No apologies, no comment, no nothing. Even though this event happened, I still go there and order their pizzas\u2014I love their veggie pizza\u2014I do think is the best of the best\u2014When is not too salty of course. And, while I am there, he does recognize me and never says anything to me\u2026.even though he is quite effusive with all of his other customers. I surprises me that\u2014when a customer asks for feedback\u2014he gets it and then-get upset about it. Instead of fixing the problem or at least looking into the problem. Number one problem with customer service\u2014ONLY when we see the issue from the customer\u2019s perspective\u2014we might be able to solve a problem. However\u2014if we somehow, take things personal, we will never learn and will continue making same mistakes. I hope one of these days someone else will also let him know\u2014sometimes, his food has too much salt\u2026and be able to correct that issue. I think he did\u2014as of lately, his pizzas has been quite good\u2014to my taste. ",
