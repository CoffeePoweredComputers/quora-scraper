            "answer_text": "I think for learning basic things in networking it would be better to follow the various websites available on internet today. But if u prefer to learn the networking for the career purpose then u must also start practicing the things like subnetting, ip address assigning. And theres a youtuber named jagvinder dhind, who constantly uploads vdoz about nwking, and fundamentals of computer troubleshooting. So do follow him also, since his vdos are full of animations but its ok.. Cause the way he explains the concept is easy to understand. ",
