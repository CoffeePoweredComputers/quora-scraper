            "answer_text": "> What will Elon Musk's Neuralink chip do to my brain? Will it make me a genius or something? It won\u2019t do a thing. Elon Musk is talking out of his ass, and people are falling for it. This is wishful thinking and \u201cthink of the possibilities!!!\u201d kind of thing. The dude wants reality to be a Cyberpunk world. We aren\u2019 there yet. In other words it is something like \u201cImagine the future where everybody is interconnected, where at speed of thought you can access any informational resource, control your home and communicate with people wirelessly, like a telepath! What if such future becomes possible?\u201d Sounds nice, right? However, this is total fiction, and a \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario. Eventually they might arrive at prototype which will react to commands spoken in your mind with 90% chance. As this was done before in 2011. Then they\u2019ll need to deal with medical approval, most likely. Then you\u2019ll arrive at unimpressive product that allows you to unlock your phone by thinking \u201cOk, Google\u201d instead of speaking it\u2026 at a mere cost of 300000$ you have to pay for the surgery which has a 10% chance of making you a vegetable, and it would have no further capabilities beyond that. Elon Musk describes his dream vision. The dream vision is cool, however, it does not correspond to an actual product. They don\u2019t have a product, as they didn\u2019t demonstrate anything. There\u2019s nothing. Only dream vision. The ability enhancing shadowrun chips that boosts your intelligence are long time away. They require deep brain understanding, which is likely to be achieved by Blue Brain folks and not Elon.  Regarding presentation itself:  Fun parts: \u201cTo cause no trauma (corrects himself) to cause minimal trauma\u201d\u201cit is wireless like bluetooth\u201dThey spent their entire time talking about wire inserting robots.And they did not demonstrate any product. The beginning and the end of the presentation is \u201cthink of the possibilities!\u201d Possibilities they have not implemented. At this point it is just a promise. That is not likely to come true. I also wonder how those tiny wires are going to survive any possible mechanical interference (i.e. whether brushing your hair would tear them due to movement of skin, interact with magnetic fields, or electric/static discharge. Wireless nature of the device is source of concern, especially the part where they talk about connecting to the phone, and not needing any programmer. It means this thing is hackable, and like I said, it is gonna be an operation that lets you turn on your phone. Kinda an overkill. The guy at the end pretty much says that while they can insert the needless, they have not yet decoded the movement, imply that the device requires fine tuning, plus is unable to distinguish between real, observed and thought movement. This is just great. Or rather \u201cgreat\u201d. So if we summarize it, they came up with a way to insert electrodes into human brain, but they have not decoded the signals, they have no products and the idea is to make the device wireless and easy to access. The joke about \u201cupdate it via blutooth\u201d is especially annoying, as this is the brain we\u2019re talking about. Very funny. I also wondered if Musk is well, as he stutters quite a lot. So, it is very unimpressive. To be more precise, the robot itself likely will have future use, but they don\u2019t have the brain computer interface they\u2019re promising. Or, they don\u2019t have a protocol for interacting with it, and they\u2019re promising to figure it out next year with human trials\u2026. Sigh. And with just that being displayed peole have their imagination running wild. I saw a deluge of questions fitting for cyberpunk age since the announcement\u2026. ",
