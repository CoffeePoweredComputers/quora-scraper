            "answer_text": "As a beginner you need to get a solid grip on any one of the programming languages according to your choice. C and Python should be the first choices. Try to learn about Computer Architecture, get solid knowledge on how the OS works. Get to know how the Internet works, and gain as much knowledge about networking and communication as possible. Finally, when you think you are ready, try to play around with hacking tools, use your innovation and immagination. Read tutorials about the topics that interests you. Install Kali Linux. It is one of the best distros available today for hacking and pentesting. Play around with tools. If you are not sure how to use them, read tutorials. (Don\u2019t forget youtube :D) Try writing your own scripts and code to interact with different network layers, different devices in a network. Try to gain solid knowledge on these topics to name a few - Metasploit, Wireshark, the Linux Terminal. Visit Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Linux Distribution or Offensive Security Training and Professional Services to get broad ideas. Learn Linux well. Very well cause you will need it. You can perform almost the same set of tasks on a Windows PC just as you would on a Linux machine. However, for these purposes Linux is much more preferred. It gives you total control over every aspect. You can also try for CCNA and CEH certifications. I hope this post has helped you or might help you in some ways to get started and there would be no limit to what you can achieve. Just stay curious. Lastly i just wanted to quote Abraham Lincoln \u201cGive me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.\u201d. You know what I mean ;) All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "That is  a really nice thing :DSo if you want to learn to hack professionally(or take hacking as your career)..you can join a school which teaches professional hacking.There are 4 schools in the world which teach professional hacking(mind it its a proper course).2 of the are in Unites states1 is in Israeland 1 is in AustraliaSo,the procedure to get admission is like they will take 1st test online (if u know programming,theyll give you some problem and ask you to solve it & if you dont have any experience in this field or dont know programming not a problem at all... then theyll give you some question/problems/puzzles to solve.)If you get selected then you will appear for the interview round where they will see how much passionate you are about these things and stuff. And after that finally you will get admission.The strength of the batch is pretty less like 30-50 students because they take less students as this field is tough and requires somewhat individual attention(many people leave in between as they cant handle  it.)but if you are passionate you will do it.Again I am also pretty interested in this field  but I have limited knowledge. what i know, i shared with you. Hope this helps :) ",
