Therefore, the year 2020 would be considered to a roller coaster ride for all the AI enthusiasts around the world. Some of the most common trends that we will likely to witness in the year 2020 would include: 1. The introduction of IoT into AI followed by Blockchain to work on decision making as well as essentials like scalability, security, and more. 2. AI to work in the media and entertainment industry with huge likeliness to develop stories, work on scriptwriting, etc. 3. AI will be extensively used in cybersecurity systems to prevent data breaches. 4. AI will get more common into self-driving vehicles as well as the manufacturing industry. 5. AI will turn real-time with all the virtual interactions for customer targeting. 6. Privacy protection, facial recognition, and AI assistants will grow. ",
