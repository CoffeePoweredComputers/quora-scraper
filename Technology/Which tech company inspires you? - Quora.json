Microsoft: Amazing business oriented applications and cloud services on offer with a premium price on offer. Even if you are a startup or a business giant, you need Microsoft products at points. Amazon: Data and cloud, it never serves what consumers need, it sells how consumers want! Google: Working on user data and bunch of free apps and OS on offer to play around, minimal approach and a data giant which is hard to beat. Also there are many more hit and flop companies which will teach you many things about what, how and why! Happy entrepreneurship to you! ",
