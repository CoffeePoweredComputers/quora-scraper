            "answer_text": "One of the most impressive achievements of the Romans is often overlooked - they knew how to build large-scale unsupported domes. I realise that being able to build \"unsupported domes\" (that is, a large dome that does not collapse without the use of internal columns to hold the weight of it) might sound trivial, but it really is not - that technology was lost for well over 1.500 years. In fact, the Pantheon (built in the second century A.D) held the distiction of having the largest unsupported dome in the world all the way up until... 1971! (It was eclipsed by the Superdome in New Orleans, in case you've wondered - oh, how the mighty have fallen...)Even more incredible, that dome is still around nearly 2,000 years later - and remember, up until very recently, no one even knew (and possibly, cared) how it was made, so it was never even renovated on any large scale! Somehow, I don't see the Superdome lasting for that long without proper care... which goes to show you that as far as Roman architecture went, you can hardly improve on perfection. ",

This fell out of use in western europe sometime after the 5th century, partly due to the lack of large scale building projects and partly due to loss of access to the kinds of volcanic ash needed to make good waterproof concrete.  Medieval builders used less sophisticated  slow setting mortars. The roman materials were revived in Italy the late middle ages, but a fully waterproof cement of Roman quality wasn't reproduced until the 1700's.
