            "answer_text": "You\u2019ll have to do it scrolling the feed I was trying to use Twitter\u2019s advanced search to create a way of viewing retweets only but couldn\u2019t seem to get one working. You can, however, scroll down someone\u2019s feed (providing they are a public account) and view all the retweets there. There doesn\u2019t appear to be a way of filtering by them though. However, if you\u2019ve got the tweet you want to view the retweets for search is more useful Say I wanted to read the retweets of this particular tweet \n Copy the link for the tweet - you can do this using the sharing icons at the bottomThen paste that URL straight into the search box This will let you read the tweets of everyone who has retweeted it. But for filtering specific accounts for retweets only, that\u2019s not possible without advanced function on Twitter. Let me know in the comments if you\u2019ve got a tool/query to find that and I\u2019ll be happy to feature it in this answer. ",
