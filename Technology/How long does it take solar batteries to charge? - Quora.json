            "answer_text": "Roughly the same time as it would take to charge any deep-cycle battery (e.g. marine battery, golf cart battery or leisure battery) of the same capacity and construction. To correctly charge a 100Ah golf cart battery from 50% DOD to full would take around 12 hours at 2.5A. With the same initial conditions, same construction (flooded, gel. AGM or VRLA) and same capacity, a solar battery would take almost exactly the same amount of time. ",
