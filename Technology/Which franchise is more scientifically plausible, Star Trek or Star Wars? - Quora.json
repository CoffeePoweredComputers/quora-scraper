            "answer_text": "As long as you understand that they\u2019re both very unrealistic: Star Trek is the more realistic, by a landslide, two miles to the foot, and a million. Star Trek has the occasional slip-up when the writers failed to look things up (\u201c\u2026standard hydrogen-oxygen atmosphere\u201d). They also had a number of what is commonly called \u201cenabling devices\u201d, like the warp drive and the transporters. But they did try to invent semi-plausible reasons why they worked, and reasons that were not in flat contradiction to established science, at that. We do not know that it\u2019s impossible to \u201cwarp space\u201d, we just have no reason whatsoever to believe it\u2019s possible. We know no reason why it should be impossible in principle to scan people atom by atom, take them apart, and put them back together, it\u2019s just that it seems impossibly complex (and whether they actually die in the process might be a metaphysical issue, but you\u2019re not taking me apart atom by atom to find out). So while nothing they do tech-wise is known to be impossible, none of it is actually known to be possible, and we have good reason to suspect most of it actually is impossible. But as far as convenient, Star Trek tries to avoid doing things which are known to be impossible, or at least try to invent plausible-sounding reasons as to why they have discovered that it is possible after all. Star Wars is Lord of the Rings IN SPACE. It\u2019s a fairy tale. Nothing makes sense, from a scientific viewpoint. They even have Orcs (stormtroopers), a Saruman (Darth Vader), and a Sauron (Palpatine). There are Space Dragons, and Space Magic Swords, and the Space Yeti is carrying around an actual Space Crossbow. Luke is nothing short of a wizard, and a disciple of what looks suspiciously like the Chinese Eight Immortals. They have Force Ghosts, and their magic is based on ancient Gnostic metaphysics and some vaguely Eastern philosophy. It\u2019s High Fantasy with spaceships. They\u2019re both enjoyable, but don\u2019t use them as an excuse to skip science class. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Hands down, Star Trek. When I worked for Apple, I had one of the best jobs in the world: I traveled around the country visiting developers of software useful to small business, helping them understand the Apple platform and getting them the help they needed to implement Apple\u2019s technologies in their software. One of my developers had recently hired a VP who, when getting to know the staff, noticed the head of development always asked the following question of software engineers interviewing for a job: Which do you prefer, Star Wars or Star Trek? The head of development told the VP that he only hired people who said \u201cStar Trek\u201d because Star Trek was all about man made accomplishments. Most of the time, when things go wrong, it is because of something man (or some alien race) built, or something that was beyond the comprehension of the crew but something they dealt with using man made tools. He went on to say that he didn\u2019t want engineers who believed software would somehow magically write or heal itself. The VP was concerned that the company was opening itself up to some kind of liable suit since it seemed like an odd to ask, so he went to every engineer working in the company at the time and asked them which they preferred. Each one said \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Then he found out that only a small percentage of people interviewed ever said \u201cStar Wars.\u201d Star Trek is about what man can do himself \u2014 the good and the bad. It is a reflection of who we are today viewed through a possible lens from the future. True, it is unlikely we will achieve Gene Roddenberry\u2019s vision of a utopian Federation of Planets and an existence without economic variance, but it isn\u2019t impossible, and the rest of Star Trek is really about human achievement, not mastering Jedi skills to overcome your adversary.
