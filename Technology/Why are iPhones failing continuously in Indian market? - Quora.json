            "answer_text": "I think that the main reason for the failure of iPhone are the taxes (Import and other types) which increase the price. When iPhone X was released in the US, they were sold for $1000 which was equal to \u20b960,000 but due to the taxes , it was being sold for an outrageous price of \u20b91,00,000 in India. I buy Apple products from Canada or US when I go there or ask my relatives to bring them for me. The current price of iPhone X in India is \u20b974,000 and the price in the US is $600 which is equal to \u20b940,000 or so now. The taxes that are applied might get heavily reduced once Apple opens it\u2019s stores in India which it can\u2019t until it doesn\u2019t obtain the resources from India ",

            "answer_text": "Price. The price is insanely high in India. Apple has simply multiplied the dollar price by 100 for India and bring price concious, buying phone for a lakh is not good deal. Those who are due hard fans, get it from abroad where is cheaper by 20%-30%. Others have changed to Android or but used iphones. ",
