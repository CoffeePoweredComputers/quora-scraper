            "answer_text": "When you particularly ask about the technology advancement, the trend now a days is IoT and artificial intelligence. IoT: Simply speaking, having control over \u2018everything\u2019 required using internet . For example ; A family having father ,mother and a kid. Both parents are damn busy with their office stufff. The kid is young that he may not be able to his work until he or she is asked to do. Once the parents couldn't able to make to home due to a hectic schedule. The kid arrives from school then, how will he be able to manage his work ? Any clue? Here comes the usage of IoT. As soon as he enters the home.The door is locked with the help of a smart phone which is with his parents. The refrigerator asks the kid to take his snacks , milk stuff,etc, and if the kid wanna eat quite a large quantity of chocolates for example, the parents monitor from their mob and warns him * _ *. The Television can be operated by their parents if the kid is too much on to TV as well :P. So, basically what I mean to tell inorder to understand IoT is, u have control over each thing using internet. The other advanced idea is Artificial Intelligence: Uhmm..Okay . Let me quote an example for this . How it works if u ask? For example: Let us take an example of a smart band. A professional x in a certain field meets many people each day. He can't remember each one name who meets him. This smart band is wore by x , whenever x meets a new person by greeting newone with a shakehand and the voice with which he was greeted by other person creates a profile of the newone. So , when ever x meets the newone someother time once again, then x's smart band gives a notification to x that this person name is Bla bla bla. This is how secondary intelligence,ie the artificial machine intelligence works. So, hope u understood how the ideas of tech adavcement works in a useful way with above examples. Hope, you would too get something new and a unique idea.. ",
