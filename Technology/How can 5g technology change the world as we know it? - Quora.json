            "answer_text": "5G networks were rolled out in 2019 and will expand rapidly in 2020.5G will connect everything and everyone.5G will underpin remote surgery, self-driving cars - and movies you can download in seconds.We live in a time when words meant to represent significant or unique ideas are so overused they have been trivialized. \u201cRevolutionary\u201d is such a word, a victim of hyperbolic marketing that has rendered meaningless a term meant to evoke profound change to our world. When everything is \u201crevolutionary,\u201d nothing is.  Yet here I am, unable to find an alternative as comprehensively descriptive of 5G and the infinite number of ways the newest generation of wireless technology will change our world. In fact, the revolution has already begun. The global deployment of 5G networks got a running start in 2019 and is set to rapidly expand beyond anything we expected a year ago. But the public understanding of 5G hasn\u2019t caught up. While 3G put the mobile Internet in your hand and 4G gave us mobile broadband \u2013 redefining how we interact with our world \u2013 5G will connect everything and everyone. The technologies within 5G were and continue to be designed to vastly expand network capacity so cars, utility grids, appliances, medical devices, industrial machinery, homes, cities, farms and more can all be connected. And 5G will reduce delays and improve reliability, thereby enabling mission-critical tasks such as remote surgery, self-driving cars and enhanced public safety, to make possible secure connections so lightning-fast that an entire movie can be downloaded in seconds. The faster smartphones and always-connected personal computers that consumers are already using on the initial 5G networks are just a hint of the transformations to come. While 3G and 4G technology were designed to put the world in our hands, 5G was and continues to be designed to take the hand out of the equation. The industries and areas of daily life already starting to be changed by 5G include: Private networks for factories and industrial facilities: This includes the 5G-enabled Internet of Things with many devices, sensors, applications and mobile connectivity all aimed at improving product quality, increasing productivity, lowering costs and enhancing safety in industrial workplaces. This new connectivity will include factories and facilities away from cities where remoteness and physical complexity hamper wireless connections.Agriculture: 5G technologies\u2019 promise of expanding and accelerating connectivity without sacrificing battery life will be particularly beneficial to farmers, and are already improving veterinary diagnostics, crop protection, reduction of fertilizer use and smart irrigation systems that conserve water. 5G is also expected to provide new solutions to the disparity between broadband Internet connections in cities and those in some rural areas, the geographical digital divide.Sustainability: 5G is being deployed to make energy and water use more efficient, while cities are preparing to use 5G to monitor air and water quality in real time, and connected-car technology is designed to minimize traffic jams and reduce emissions while improving safety.On-device artificial intelligence (AI): One example is how the combination of AI and 5G allows wearable medical devices and phones to work together in ways that are fast enough and smart enough to identify health problems detected by a wearable device and alert your doctor.Extended reality (XR): 5G technology is vastly increasing the video bandwidth for XR with powerful computing and minimal delays to, in essence, close the gap between the real and virtual worlds. Education, health care, retail, tourism, and manufacturing are just some of the fields expected to benefit.",

            "answer_text": "5G changing the world  There\u2019s a lot more to fifth-generation networks (5G) than the ability to download movies in a blink of an eye or shuttle gigabytes to and from your smartphone faster. The technology will spawn an intelligent ecosystem of connected devices, harvesting massive amounts of data that will change the way we live and work. It will be incredibly fast, stable and versatile. \u201cOur future is going to be \u2018data-centric\u2019,\u201c says Asha Keddy, Intel\u2019s Vice President and General Manger, Next Generation and Standards. \u201c5G will form our communications infrastructure in the same way that roads and power grids formed our industrial infrastructure.\u201c Along with data transfer speeds that are ten times faster than 4G, 5G brings reduced latency (the time it takes data to travel back and forth) and the ability to link far more people and things seamlessly at the same time. \u201cI like to refer to 5G as the \u2018special generation\u2019, because it shouldn\u2019t be compared with 4G or 3G, which were designed and deployed mainly for mobile,\u201d says Professor Rahim Tafazolli, director of the 5G Innovation Centre at the University of Surrey. \u201c5G will transform our lives. We will control our homes, our cars, everything from a single device, and productivity will increase as industry becomes increasingly automated.\u201d Emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), extended reality and blockchain will all see new uses with 5G, as well as combining in new ways, creating new value for businesses. \u201c5G will enable a fully connected, mobile, intelligent world,\u201d says Keddy. \u201cIt will touch every facet of our lives\u2014including how we can be safer, smarter, or react quicker. It will transform industries,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are now taking the power of connectivity and applying it to billions of things and to every industry.\u201d The Internet of Things: billions of devices 5G is designed for mass connectivity: around one million devices on a network per square kilometre. That opens up the possibility of huge numbers of things collecting, transmitting and sharing data via sensors. Estimates vary as to how many sensors there will be. A recent reportby Juniper Research, for example, said the figure is likely to exceed 50 billion by 2022. Prof Tafazolli predicts a world in which every person will be surrounded by at least one thousand sensors, whether at home, in the car or in the office. In this new, hyper-connected world, the concept of the \u2018smart city\u2019 should finally become a reality as cameras and sensors track traffic and pedestrian movements, environmental conditions, emergency services, utility networks and other information in order to optimise the city\u2019s operation. Streetlights will go on only when needed to save energy. Autonomous vehicles will become an everyday reality in a new era of connected mobility, as hundreds of onboard sensors turn cars into data centres on wheels. As drivers become passengers, they will have more time to work, relax or catch up with friends and family. But it\u2019s not just in the city that 5G will have a major impact. A glimpse of the future in the countryside can be seen in the west of England, where the 5G Rural First project is researching new developments in agritech. That means 5G-connected autonomous tractors and drones that can provide high-definition image analysis of crops, weeds and soil. Meanwhile, down at the dairy farm, sensors are fitted to cows\u2019 collars, measuring their health and fertility, so that when they step into one of the robotic milkers, the machine knows how much milk they should give. All of this sensor-collected data can be combined and analysed in the cloud, and then delivered back to farm staff as management support information in milliseconds. AI: machines making smart decisions Billions of devices create enormous amounts of data, but that data is of no real use until it\u2019s analysed. Modern data analytics do that job, but AI will take the process to a whole new level. \u201cWe talk about machine learning, but we\u2019re now getting to a point where 5G will enable device learning,\u201d says Dan Pitchford, co-founder of the AI Businesscontent portal. \u201cSo an autonomous vehicle, for example, becomes a platform that is improving over a period of time based on what it\u2019s seeing and doing. It will learn everything, from which routes tend to be congested at different times of day to how you like to be driven and even whether you stop at a coffee shop every morning. Anywhere there\u2019s a need for multiple devices to instantaneously communicate with each other and make decisions and learn from those decisions is where AI, 5G and IoT all tie together.\u201d In the factory, AI powered robots will learn on the job and from each other, and will also monitor and manage their own health, ordering spare parts in advance when required, leading to higher productivity and less unscheduled system downtime. At the University of Surrey, the potential for 5G and AI in home medical care is vividly demonstrated by a living lab for patients with dementia. A network of internet-enabled sensors, monitors and trackers can detect agitation and irritability, as well as changes in patients\u2019 health and daily routines. AI will also help to enable the 5G networks themselves. \u201cThe relationship between 5G and AI is really symbiotic,\u201d says Dritan Kaleshi, head of technology for 5G at innovation agency Digital Catapult. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about what 5G can do to enable AI as part of our future digital infrastructure, but also what AI can do to help manage the 5G networks, with their increased complexity.\u201d One example, says Kaleshi, would see AI allowing the presampling of sensor data on the periphery of a network, \u201calmost like the body works, where not all of the sensory data is sent to the brain for processing.\u201d Extended reality: that Star Wars moment The increased connectivity and reduced latency of 5G will have a major impact on both augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). AR is already used as an informational overlay in industrial and training contexts, but that\u2019s only a taste of what may be possible with 5G, according to Jason Krute, senior marketing manager at DAQRI, which makes AR Smart Glasses for use in industry. \u201cA lot of industrial manufacturing facilities have wifi but there are significant hurdles there,\u201d he says, \u201cSo a super-fast mobile connection will be potentially ground-breaking in terms of AR content.\u201d Researchers at Microsoft have been exploring \u2018holoportation\u2019, which allows full-sized 3D holograms to appear before your eyes via its HoloLens AR headset. \u201cIt means you can finally have that Star Wars moment of Princess Leia standing on your table and talking to you, says Henry Stuart, co-founder of extended reality company Visualise. The possibilities are endless. Conjured up on a headset could be a business colleague on the other side of the world, a doctor offering advice or a retail assistant demonstrating a product. Looking further ahead, we could one day experience the world of Stephen Spielberg\u2019s Ready Player One, stepping into a virtual world wherever we happen to be thanks to a VR headset connected via 5G. But it\u2019s not just about playing videogames. In theory a surgeon could operate on a patient remotely using a VR headset, haptic gloves and \u2018virtual twin\u2019 robotics. Blockchain: a node in the palm of your hand Although it\u2019s best known as the technology that underlies bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, blockchain is currently used in other areas such as logistics and product authentication. Everledger, for example, uses blockchain technology to track diamonds and other luxury items throughout the supply chain, guaranteeing provenance and authenticity. \u201cFor me, 5G is one of the important triggers to realising the true potential of IoT across supply chain transparency and traceability,\u201d says Everledger CEO Leanne Kemp. \u201cA number of device companies are already thinking about blockchain-ready mobile phones. So in the future every person on the planet could possibly store a blockchain node on their phone and authenticate transactional records in the palm of their hand.\u201d Professor Tafazolli believes that distributed computing will be another bonus from the meeting of 5G and blockchain. \u201cAt the moment, most of our content is stored in the Amazon cloud or Apple cloud or whatever,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with blockchain and 5G we can turn all the devices in a network into smaller clouds, or \u2018cloudlets\u2019. So we don\u2019t need to go to a centralised cloud all the time, which is expensive and highly dependent on one infrastructure. Instead we can use distributed ledger technology to turn most of the devices that have a memory and computing into a cloudlet.\u201d Thank you, Signing off Shiva Kiran Gupta ",
