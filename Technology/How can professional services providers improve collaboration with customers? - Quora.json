            "answer_text": "How can professional services providers improve collaboration with customers? Professional service providers refer to companies or people who hold professional licenses and get special training that can provide professional services in health care, legal system, finance, engineering, etc. It can also refer to providing support services in management consulting, tax advice and payroll services, internet telecommunications service, application software service, supplemental education service, etc. Professional service providers are important to help the business grow as rapidly and efficiently as possible. The collaboration with customers will increase the engagement of customer during the process of doing the business and greatly reduce the customer churn rate. It ends up with the improvement of the efficiency and productivity of the business operations. How to improve the collaboration? Involve the customers in the business process proactively. The professional service providers should not only be satisfied with the traditional ways to make customers happy through following the schedules, meeting the deadlines, reaching the milestones, accomplishing the deliverables, adhering the budgets, and tracking customer feedback, but also encourage them to participate in the process and provide constructive suggestions and share their ideas on how to shape product and service offerings so as to tie them closely to the business. A senior executive of a global specialty retailer said: \u201cWe spend millions on market research yet fail to take note of what our customers could tell us every day.\u201d It was found that the main obstacles that hinder the engagement with the customers are the communication difficulties or delays, lack of visibility into project status and the security of the sensitive data. The online communications software can be used to streamline the collaboration with clients and project team members. They make the defined workflow, clear feedback process, all communication in context and chronological order and accurate reporting and optimized outcomes become reality. They eliminate the miscommunication, version control issues, manually consolidation of pieces of projects living across multiple platforms and confusion and delay due to email, instant messages, spreadsheets and sloppy handoffs. For example, the collaboration software Team Project Manager can make project managers define project timelines, make employees track their tasks and enable clients to have full visibility into project status at any time and on any device. Software Wrike dashboards allows customers and everyone in the team to have a bird\u2019s eye view of all ongoing projects and what each department is working on at any given time, thus giving visibility and fresh data to the customers and executives through reporting. Through being informed of the progress of the projects by time tracking, making sure that everyone accountable for their own work and roadblocks can be stopped before they happen, the customers would be more confident in their investment in the projects and be more loyal to the brand and company. It invisibly improve the efficiency of the business and ameliorate the satisfaction of the customers. When taking care of the visibility stuff, professional service providers also need to consider the security stuff to improve the collaboration with the customers. The functions of customer management software tools such as Wrike can help optimize visibility and security at the same time through customizable folder permissions while maintaining flexibility. The client can dictate who on their own team can see different projects through discrete role-based permissions. The collaboration with customers can also be obtained through the cloud infrastructure by securing the clients\u2019 data and improve processing efficiency. Cloud enable the customers to have a complete visibility and control over their data. The providers can easily decide which customers have what level of access to what data and easily know documents are assigned to them. Hence, it increases and eases collaboration. Using the project management communication tools to strengthen the communication between the providers and customers and streamline the project management can improve the collaboration with the customers and project members. Improving customer\u2019s visibility to the project itself and guaranteeing the security of customer data will increase the confidence of customer for the service provided and thus, improving the efficiency and outcome of the business operations.

            "answer_text": "I think the biggest issue is letting the customers get over on the employees. If the customer demands free stuff, and it\u2019s not policy and the rep says \u201cIm sorry, we cant do it\u201d you set the employee up to be yelled at, berated and belittled. Then they demand to escalate, and the next level or the level after that just gives whatever to the customer. Having been in the first call, the escalation, and management - I know this happens. A lot. We are setting up a whole generation of people who think they can get what they want by yelling and escalating. A no from the beginning should be a no til the end.And an unruly belligerent who resorts to yelling at an employee, the employee should be able to at least raise their voice. That behavior is unacceptable, but customers are learning that it not only acceptable, but they get their way every time with it. And dammit, that first level employee is the easiest to fire, so maybe give them a little leeway with how they handle a customer. Ragemonstering at someone who can only speak politely and say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d repeatedly - totally wrong. When I worked in a retail store as a manager and could physically go there, I would put that customer out of the store if I had to call the police to have them removed. My cashiers were not paid enough to deal with that. This is why call centers have such a high turn over rate. They are the first to go if a customer wants free stuff and thinks they can get what they want by raging and complaining. AND stop with the call time limits (the places that do have them). You can monitor a call and see if the employee and customer are just chatting away about the weather, movies, or actually getting things accomplished. Employees rushing the customer because of average talk times leave the customer feeling unsure or unclear. ",
