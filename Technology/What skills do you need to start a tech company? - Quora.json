            "answer_text": "You need belief, vision, integrity, smarts, and perseverance to start any company, not just a tech company.  Let's take a look at each skill: Belief.  You are likely to be told by those that love you that your idea has no chance of success, and that you should just get a job.   Unwavering belief gets you through this phase. Let's say you start your venture and try raising funding.  Most investors are going to pass.  It's takes belief to get you to the investor(s) that will fund you. Now your operational.  You expect customers to just start buying your incredible product.  Except they don't.  Your team is questioning you.  It takes belief to keep the ship on course. Vision.  You have to have a clear idea of where you're going, and you have to be able to succinctly articulate your vision to your investors, customers, partners, and employees.   No one will follow you if they don't buy into your vision. Integrity.  You want to build an incredible team of A players.  You want customers to buy what you're selling.  And you're just another unknown startup? Why should they believe you?  Integrity is the answer.  You do what you say you will do over and over again.  You treat people (your team, your vendors, and your customers) fairly.  People want to do business with you because you have integrity. Integrity allows you to be around for the long run.  Smarts.  Running a company is hard.  You have to make decisions based on small amounts of data, and continually make the right decisions.  More importantly, you have to make sure the bad decisions you make don't destroy the company. And you want to build a great team of smart people.  A players want to work with other A players.  A players are smart by definition. Perseverance.  Most startups struggle for their existence and success.  It doesn't come easy, nor should it. What do you do when revenue doesn't take off?  How are you going to handle all those customers saying, \"Looks interesting, but we can't use your product now.  Come back in a year.\"  How are you going to react when your VP Engineering walks out the door with no notice, leaving you completely in the lurch?  How are going to deal with making payroll  on Wednesday when you have no money on Monday? The answer is perseverance.  You need to persevere to overcome all of these obstacles and more. And yes, you can quote me.  ",

            "answer_text": "Starting any business, not just within the tech industry, requires passion, relentless determination and an incredible work ethic.  Starting a technology business is not vastly different from starting any other business. I know a number of people that are not in any way technologically minded, but have started and grown very successful businesses within the tech industry.  It is obviously tremendously beneficial to be technologically proficient, but I would not say that it is an absolute necessity. If an entrepreneur sees a gap in the technology market, but is not particularly \"techy\" he/she can always hire individuals that compensate for their weaknesses. As long as the founder has strengths that are necessary to launch and operate a business, he/she can launch a successful technology business.  People like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are examples of very technically-competent founders. But there are also many non-technical founders of terrific companies, such as Pandora and Tilt. Being technologically oriented is certainly beneficial, but I believe that more than anything, what matters most is that an entrepreneur is determined, resilient and is prepared to outwork his/her competition. A founder must also believe in whatever it is that they are doing.  If the founder is not technically proficient, it is important that they do seek to attain at least a basic level of proficiency. Like with any business, the entrepreneur must stay up to date with industry news, trends and state of the market.  The founder can hire the people that he/she needs to bring their ideas to fruition, but it remains his/her responsibility to run a successful, profitable business, regardless of the industry.    ",

            "answer_text": "Often this question is asked by non-technical people who are worried that they will not be able to start a software company without a programming background This is because it\u2019s become a bit of a myth that you need to be a programmer to start a software company. Not every successful tech startup began with a nerdy kid coding away in his mums basement. Not even close. There are many huge market-cap companies, such as AirBnB, Pandora and Tinder that were started by non-coders. I actually think that programming, sales or finance are of secondary importance in the startup world. If you look at successful serial entrepreneurs, they often possess the following fundamental character traits: They are driven.To be a successful you need to make things happen not just talk about them. They are fast learners.You have to be a fast learner as you will be doing most things for the first time. And to be a success you really don\u2019t have the time to keep making the same mistakes again and again. They are not precious.You have to be willing to get your hands dirty. Just because you don\u2019t like reading contracts is not a good enough reason to pay a lawyer $300/hour to do it for you. They are dedicated to their vision.Sometimes being a success is seeing what others do not. Think of companies like Twitter in the early days. Many just did not get it. You only need to look at the amount of investors that tells stories about passing on the first few funding rounds! As a founder you have to believe that your idea is a winner - irrespective of what others say. They are leaders.Great founders are often great leaders. They are able to inspire people into helping them build an idea into a business - with no promise of success. More than that they are consistently able to actually turn that promise into a business. Hopefully you recognised yourself in some of the above attributes. Just remember, while you may not need programming skills to succeed as a founder; your business probably does. A mistake I see all too often, is a non-technical founder massively underestimating the importance of technical knowhow and leadership to their startup. I run Scalable Path, a network of freelance technical talent. We hire out remote talent to many startups and I see many great founders that have no tech background. What they do is make sure that somebody in the business does \u2018get\u2019 the technology. Good luck! ",
