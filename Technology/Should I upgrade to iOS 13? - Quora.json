            "answer_text": "Without a shadow of a doubt. I updated instantly as soon as it was available. Reasons to switch- Faster Face Id - Apple claimed on stage that it will be faster by 30%, I have no way of confirming the % however on my device it seems faster. They also claimed the angle has been improved, that turned out to be a myth (in my experience).Dark Mode - I found this very attractive and its not only form, its functional too, it helps save battery life as only required pixels are being lit up on screen. This is only true if you have a OLED screen though.App size - This is a real deal, I have seen it on my iPhone, I got around 1 GB of phone space back once I upgraded my phone to iOS13. Well you may not see it instantly, give it couple of days and you will notice the difference.Apple Car Play - I found this very useful, I use it all the time, it got its first refresh after its launch, and its just fantastic. It now offers the tile view on the home page and now you can use your iPhone independently of CarPlay. Meaning you can have a maps on carplay and can still navigate to music library without it being displayed on carplay. This was not the case earlier.Revamped Reminders Apps and App Store and Pictures app - used reminders all the time, they have made it really easy this time, plus I love the new look of App store. Pictures have been enhanced as well. New views to sort your pics.I see the only reason for not updating to iOS13 is if you want a jail break. If you dont care about JB, then just go for iOS13. I am sure you will enjoy it. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a list of questions to ask yourself, continue on yes, stop on no. Am I a developer? If not, stop now. Don\u2019t install it to a least the public beta.Am I a developer who needs to test on iOS 13?Do I have a second test phone to install iOS 13 on? (Geez no! Don\u2019t install it on your personal phone! Especially not beta 1.)Ok you\u2019re good to go then. Here\u2019s some questions for when the public beta starts, again stop on No: Am I willing to have potential battery problems, phone crashes, and possibly not have apps work correctly?Am I willing to put in bug reports to Apple and to third-party developers when I find a problem?Am I willing to put in *useful* detailed bug reports?Beta means problems, that\u2019s the point of a beta to test for problems that we know is in the code. If you want to show off with the most recent version be my guest, but don\u2019t complain about crashes, things not working, and battery problems, etc, etc. ",
