            "answer_text": "Frank, There are only two ways you would be targeted with intrusive electronic surveillance gadgets. If law enforcement, pursuant to a court order permitting intrusive collections, placed them, then you have bigger problems than detecting and finding the devices. If they are commercial (private investigator, corporate espionage, etc), you can purchase a detector or higher a reputable security service to do an electronic sweep. Consider your financial condition. Does it warrant someone spending $5k or more to listen to you cooking? Depending on where you live, I might be able to connect you with someone I know from my work as a Foreign Intelligence Operative for NSA,CIA, and DIA . I hope others are also able to help you with this question. ",

            "answer_text": "Well you could hire a professional bug sweeper( yes it's pricey). I m sorry to add to your paranoia but you do have them in your home. Your tv, your cell phone, computer all have a mic in them. Your phone is also registered with the FCC. These pictures units (personal information units) obviously are much more these days. It is possible to turn on any phone through a developer section and use the mic or camera or see how much national geographic you down load or steal your favorite rum and coke recipe. But let's face it, are any of us really that interesting? It's the same thing as a sense of humor, everyone thinks they are funny, and they are.. to themselves ( myself included). If someone wants to spy on you they are going to. As long as your not plotting some big disasterous Heist or worse your probably ok. If your that worried unplug your stuff and put the phone in the drawer, turning off your data is probably good idea to save power. And if you still think somebody's listening start making shit up. Relax it's a beautiful day, no matter what day it is. ",
