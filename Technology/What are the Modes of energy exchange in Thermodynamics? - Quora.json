            "answer_text": "Hey there. I believe, the following modes of energy exchange are prevalent in Thermodynamics. Heat interaction- Always cross-boundary interaction possible.Work interaction- Boundary workNon-Boundary workBoundary work- a form of work interaction where the boundary itself moves. Boundary can be defined in 2 ways. Rigid boundary (room)Movable boundary (piston cylinder arrangement).If you realise, the movable boundary requires the boundary or the piston-cylinder interface to be moved (which happens when the piston comes up and goes down). So the work which any gas will be doing on this piston will be called boundary work. Non-Boundary work is when the boundary doesn't move, yet energy in the form of work interaction is transferred from/to the system. For example, consider a room, wherein you have fixed An electric wire ORA stick which has a pedal on one side of it, and a stirrer on the other side of it.In case of (1), if we pass electricity through the wire, energy is transferred into the system even if there is no heat being transferred as heat is transferred ONLY AND ONLY if there lies a temperature gradient. Thus, this is a case of Non-Boundary work as the room doesn't expand or shrink if you supply electricity through the wire. For example, imagine having a bucket of water, and an electric water heater inside room. Now if you consider the entire room as the system, the only thing which goes into the room (considering the room is insulated) is electricity. And since this form of energy is not due to temperature gradient, thus, a form of Non-Boundary work. In case (2), if you fix this stick in such a way the the stirrer goes inside the room which is considered to be a system, and the pedal is outside the room. Now if you pedal from outside, and the stirrer gets rotated inside the room, this energy transfer takes place through the rigid boundary and thus, a case of Non-Boundary work. There may be many other examples of modes of energy transfer through a boundary in thermodynamics. But our main concern is bifurcating them into the above 3 categories so that later treatment of the energy transfer is easy. Also, this kind of gets complicated when we consider that there are 2 types of systems altogether (which are important to us wherein reality there are 3). Open systemClosed system.The above discussion is based on consideration of closed system. If discussion regarding open systems is required, please do ping me in the comments section. Have a great day. Much much love from India. Take care. Thank you. ",
