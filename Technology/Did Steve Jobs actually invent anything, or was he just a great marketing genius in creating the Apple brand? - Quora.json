            "answer_text": "Pablo Picasso is widely quoted as having said that \u201cgood artists borrow, great artists steal.\u201d Steve Jobs saw this and gave his paraphrased version, \u201cgood artists copy, great artists steal.\u201d Which one do people remember the most? Of course people might think that this was all Steve\u2019s because they probably never heard of Picasso, and this is what Steve became really good at - stealing ideas. He was a low level technician while working for Atari and was known for not really knowing much about coding. For that, he would pass on work to his good friend Steve Wozniak who was the brainchild behind the very first Apple Mac. Jobs saw his talent in getting people to do things for him, which I think everyone can definitely agree on. Jobs also had a love affair with Japan and was infatuated by Sony and all the inventions, products and prototypes that he saw there. This was most likely the source of his inspirations and where he started his visions of Apple doing the same. Now, having a vision and actually knowing how to implement them are two very different things. For the most part, Jobs often got a lot of things wrong. Like the first iphone:  Jobs was adamant in keeping the click wheel design for the iphone, but engineers suggested that a touchscreen was clearly the direction that their competitors were heading and that they should be using it as well. In the end, Jobs gave in to the touchscreen iphone. This reveals his stubbornness to hold onto past successes rather than innovate or invent something new because he simply did not know the boundaries and potentials of technologies. Like when the first ipod came out, it was 1.9 cm thick. Jobs did what anybody would have suggested - make it smaller. That\u2019s not really a genius suggestion, but his persistence to his engineers in making things smaller or thinner made him look like some kind of technology genius. So no, he wasn\u2019t able to invent anything, nor was he a marketing genius. He was, as I mentioned earlier, great at getting talented people to do the impossible things for him despite having no clue on how to lead them there. Edit: \u201cThe jobs stealing quote was about being inspired by things in nature, etc. not literally stealing someone else\u2019s work\u201d Jobs did not have strong engineering skills (and Woz revealed this), so the only way forward for Apple was really to steal ideas. Many of the features that ended up on the Apple Lisa came from Xerox, but even a genius like woz could not figure out how they did it. So how did they do it? They had to buy the licences from Xerox which provided all the blueprints, all they had to do was plug and play it in the Lisa to use it. That was how Gates was also able to create Windows, he also had to learn via Xerox licencing. ",

            "answer_text": "Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, and Adele Goldberg built the Smalltalk system at Xerox PARC knowing exactly what they had. Kay in particular had a very specific vision known as the Dynabook, of which the OLPC project is probably the closest realization of it in the idea\u2019s four-plus decade history. But\u2026 go play with Squeak, the most direct linear descendant of PARC Smalltalk. Even after many, many years of development (and keep in mind, Alan Kay did quite a bit of work at Apple, and is very familiar with the Macintosh), Squeak still feels more like a sandbox than a real work environment. It\u2019s a nice program, but it isn\u2019t the kind of thing that was going to bring the average person into the world of computing. Similarly, if you know much about the architecture of X Windows, you know that although it served its purpose as a client-server system in its time, it\u2019s massive overkill for modern systems where there\u2019s rarely a need to offload the heavy processing to a central application server. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to understand what Steve Jobs brought to the party. Jobs was heavily focused on the human interface side of the equation, and left the tech issues to the best people he could find (not only Woz, but people like Burrell Smith, Bill Atkinson, and Andy Hertzfeld). Jobs\u2019 visions always involved end-to-end user experiences, and that meant putting designers like Susan Kare and Jony Ive on the front lines with the techies. It would have been easy enough to put some bells and whistles on Lisa Smalltalk in 1981 and just say \u201cship it\u201d, but that wasn\u2019t going to be the end-user-focused information appliance that Jobs envisioned. That required taking the basic concepts that Jobs had seen at PARC in 1979 and bending them into a form that would be close to intuitive for the average person who was likely still doing most of their work on an IBM Selectric rather than any kind of computer. And, in turn, that required a lot of testing and refinement; even LisaOS seems weirdly counterintuitive and restrictive compared to the first versions of the Mac, to say nothing of the awkward, unrefined betas of the MacOS that the \u201cTwiggy Mac\u201d prototypes in 1983 were running. All of this was due to Jobs; though he didn\u2019t create most of the original concepts, and fundamental things like the Resource Manager and screen redraw came from the engineers on the Mac project and not Jobs himself, he was the driving force between putting them together in a coherent whole that ultimately changed the way computers were used. Truth be told, Jobs in his early days was only middling as a marketer; the Mac was almost a failure and didn\u2019t really come into its own until after Jobs was kicked out of the company. The Jobs that came back to Apple after the Amelio era had spent a long time in the wilderness at NeXT and Pixar learning to become a better marketer and business leader. What didn\u2019t change was the end-to-end product focus. The iTunes ecosystem followed the same principles as the Mac project \u2014 give the customers a complete solution, integrated top-to-bottom, that does most or all of what they need in a consistent and relatively intuitive fashion. Synthesis is as much innovation as invention is. That was what Jobs did brilliantly, and to dismiss it as mere marketing is as dumb as those who accuse Einstein of plagiarism because his work was dependent on the previous work of Poincar\u00e9, Lorenz, et al.

            "answer_text": "Was Steve Jobs a Thomas Alva Edison? No, he was not. However, Thomas Edison's winter home in Ft. Myers, FL is right next to Henry Ford's, and I think there is a reasonably fair comparison to be made between Steve Jobs and Henry Ford. Ford didn't invent the automobile, but he did make it both accessible and popular and arguably \"invented\" the assembly line. Any customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants so long as it is black. - Henry Ford. http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Henry_Ford <deep breath> I went on a bit of an impassioned screed in the wake of all of the eulogizing after his death. Ian McCullough's post in Miscellaneous. While it is most certainly not the case that he didn't invent anything, he often gets far more credit than he deserves for the original invention of some very big things. Pulling from what I wrote then. Let us first be very clear about what Steve Jobs did and didn't do. He was central to the mass marketing and consumerization of the personal computer -- but he by no means invented it. That credit most directly goes to people like Ivan Sutherland, Alan Kay, Douglas Engelbart, and the people who worked at Xerox PARC and the Stanford Research Institute during the 1960's and 1970's. Let us also remember that he didn't invent the portable digital music player. Looking past the Sony Walkman which first met the general desire to carry music with you, the first known mention of a digital music player is Kane Kramer's IXI in 1981. In the US, the Diamond Rio was the first widely available portable MP3 player in the late '90s. The iPod didn't come out until 2001. How about multi-touch screens? It's a big \"no\" there too. That was Bent Stumpe and later Murray Hill, with some early experimentation from musicians like Huge Le Caine and Bob Moog. And what of Pixar? He actually bought what became known as Pixar from none other than George Lucas in 1986. It was Ed Catmull that drove the Pixar technology side and ultimately John Lasseter that drove the creative side. (Steve does get credit there for cultivating the business, building the Disney relationship, and \u2013 according to all third-party reports \u2013 smartly staying out of the way.) To be completely fair: as far as I know he never actually laid claim to these accomplishments, but he is so tightly associated with them in the popular mind that many people make the errors. ",

Because the screen and their touchscreen was laggy and data was expensive). And real mobile apps because SAFE DISTRIBUTION was one click away.

            "answer_text": "There are all kinds of inventors. Steve Jobs certainly could be considered one. Thousands of inventions precede every successful invention. People made lightbulbs before Edison, but they burned out instantly or were too difficult to manufacture. This does not detract from Edison's accomplishments as an inventor. Someone made something that was the first automobile, and then someone invented an electric car (much longer ago than you might realize), and then diesel, etc. But if all the forms of powering a vehicle have existed for nearly a century, then no one invented the hybrid, because it simply combines existing technologies and doesn't bring anything new. Steve Jobs often did the same thing, bringing together several technologies \"invented\" by others to produce something entirely new. For example, he took the graphical user interface developed by Xerox PARC, refined it for the way people actually worked on their computers and made it a global standard. He took several technologies and merged them, and through his own initiative and creative process added the unique intellectual property that exponentially increased the usefulness of the technology to the world at large.  Patents and engineering expertise are not necessarily requirements for being an inventor. I have several patents and my degree is in journalism. I am on these patents becase I saw a need for a new product or technology that did not at the time exist in the desired form. ",

He got lucky with the ipod's success and milked the idea for a decade by adding new features and branching out to different markets.   He's a great business man for realizing that his fans are willing to pay premiums for the brand, and sold Apple products accordingly.  Was he a great inventor?  Let's not get carried away. Steve Jobs' greatest invention was an mp3 player that was later changed to include a phone.  His greatest accomplishment was convincing the music industry to sell music in a centralized store in order to change with the times. Apple does, however, have a lot of money from it's insane popularity and offensive pricing structure... so they must be doing something right, right? ",

Every single device he's ever made has a clear precedent before it.  I think he was amazing at a two things: 1) Understanding what people want. Every other tech company on earth except maybe Dyson, is driven not by what people want, but what can they make and make unique.  2) Reduction. The ability and balls to maintain focus on one or two key attributes that people want ( see above) One you know what people want, you make it, it's actually incredibly easy to market it. That's for me why in my mind the latest ad campaigns for iPad 2 and iPhone 4S have been weak. There is no clear, step change in performance or benefit to present. ",
