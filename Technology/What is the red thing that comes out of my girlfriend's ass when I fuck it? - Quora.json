            "answer_text": "Ding*ding*ding Give the cigar to Mr. Shaw. The correct answer is: prolapse. It\u2019s her rectum getting turned inside out, just a little bit, hopefully. It\u2019s red because it is delicate tissue filled with blood vessels. This delicate blood filled tissue was never meant to take the in-out pounding of a penis. Though I will admit the size and shape of the orifice does look awful penis like in those anatomical drawings. A little bit of prolapse is probably normal. Watch your dog\u2019s ass next time he\u2019s pushing out a big dry turd. If that doesn\u2019t put you totally off the anal sex, then watch your girlfriend\u2019s rectum next time you\u2019re plunging away at it. If it sticks out farther than your dog\u2019s, you may be fucking her inside out, and you may want to stop. Go ass to mouth instead. Explain why afterwards. Surely she\u2019ll thank you for the m-bare-ass-ing ER visit that you spared her.. ",

Third of all, I know you didn\u2019t ask but\u2026 the way you talk about your girlfriend and this situation is very strange. When you fuck \u201cit\u201d? Is your girlfriend just a fuckhole to you? I think, based on the very limited information provided in this question, both explicit and implicit, you could probably stand to improve your communication with your girlfriend, as well as the way you view her and your relationship. But that\u2019s just my opinion. ",
