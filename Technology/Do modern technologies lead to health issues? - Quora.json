            "answer_text": "Working at a desk on a computer all that time can lead to repetitive stress injuries if you type too fast or use the mouse all the time without ever taking a break to give your hands and arms a rest. Also, staring at a screen all the time can be tiring for your eyes because they never focus on anything far away\u2014another good reason to take breaks. However, it doesn\u2019t do permanent damage. Contrary to what a lot of Internet conspiracy theorists are saying, WiFi and cellular telephone networks are harmless. There is a different risk with 5G having to do with the fact that the Chinese want to manufacture all the equipment. The West is afraid that they will build in back doors that will allow the Chinese security services to bypass the encryption and listen to our phone calls. But that\u2019s nothing to do with health. I don\u2019t know of any other modern technologies that cause health problems. Of course, there are lots of older technologies that did: mining coal caused black lung, and burning coal created horrendous air pollution. Mining asbestos also turned out to be very dangerous. ",
