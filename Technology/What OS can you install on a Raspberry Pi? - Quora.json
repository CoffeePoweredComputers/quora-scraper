The officially supported operating system for the Raspberry Pi family of SBCs is Raspbian - a Debian-based Linux distribution optimised for use with the Pi\u2019s low-energy, low-performance ARM CPU. However, you are still free to install any operating system you desire on your Raspberry Pi. There are dozens of ARM-ported Linux distributions out there - Linux Mint, ArchLinux and Ubuntu to mention a few, and non-Linux operating systems such as Windows 10 IoT are also supported. (Note that W10 IoT isn\u2019t the same as the x86 Windows found on desktop computers, but a lighter ARM port of it.) If you really wanted to, you could run an unsupported operating system using a VM or emulator; however, the performance drop could prove to be problematic. Happy hacking! ",
