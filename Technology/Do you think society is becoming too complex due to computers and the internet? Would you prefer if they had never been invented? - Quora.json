            "answer_text": "I love technology, science, electronics, and computers. No, I don\u2019t think that technology has made society too complex. In answer to your second question, yes I wish they had never been invented. But it\u2019s just a wish. Man\u2019s thirst for knowledge is unending. Advances in technology have mostly just enabled us to do things faster than we were able to do without it and we have become slaves to it. A recent example. My doctor has a small family practice. I had an appointment with him last Tuesday when the latest cyber attack hit his server. He was working on it as I arrived. He sent me and others away saying that without the computer he couldn't see us today. Well, physicians have been treating patients with pencil and paper for centuries, but he couldn't see that. The real question is what is society (us) going to do when robotics take our jobs? So much of our lives are made up of what we do for a living. What are we going to do when we are forced to live on a government stipend? In Feb of this year Ontario, Canada began issuing UBI (universal basic income) in three cities guttered by manufacturing job losses. Why do we humans have such an un-quenching thirst for Speed? ",
