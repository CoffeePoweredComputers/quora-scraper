            "answer_text": "What is the device, name, model ?? Android as an entire operating system isn't exactly well known for its timely and consistent updates. Android's developer site shows us that the majority of devices are still running Gingerbread - an OS that was released in 2010. Thankfully, 16% of devices are running Ice Cream Sandwich, not the latest and greatest version, but still leaps and bounds ahead of Gingerbread. Somewhat ironically, the first device to ship with Gingerbread, the Samsung Nexus S back in 2010, is still getting Android OS updates, and you can actually download and run Jelly Bean on this single-core, relatively slow device. The Samsung Galaxy SIII still doesn't have a Jelly Bean update, yet the Nexus S does - it's a testament to the power of running totally stock Android on your phone. Obviously though, running Jelly Bean on a single-core device from 2010 with pretty limited RAM is a tall ask, but thanks to the developer community there are a few tricks you can do to make your Jelly Bean experience a lot smoother; more akin, if you will, to that of the Galaxy Nexus. The first thing you'll need to do is root your phone - the Nexus S is the easiest phone in the world to root. Once you've done this you'll obviously have installed a custom recovery image such as Clockworkmod, which will allow you to flash custom software onto your device. Now you can set up your Nexus S for Jelly Bean, let's use my personal phone as an example: Jelly Bean ROM I'm running a totally stock official Jelly Bean ROM for the Nexus S, which I found here on xda developers (be sure to flash the Galaxy Nexus sounds as well!). I also flashed Superuser after installing to ensure that my device had root access (I'll come to the benefits of this later). Tweaks I'm running a custom kernel for my device called Air Kernel. It basically speeds up your entire phone as well as increasing your battery life - it also allows you to overclock your CPU using an app such as SetCPU. However, I don't overclock my device as it's fast enough without and overclocking drains battery significantly faster. I have also run a script called V6 Supercharger - this changes the memory management priorities of the operating system to enable smoother multitasking. Essentially what it allows you to do is set a minimum memory allocation for background apps, the higher this number the more you'll be able to run and the smoother everything will be, the lower the more you'll be able to run but your phone will be slower. Using this I've noticed that both multitasking and switching between open applications is a lot snappier.Sidebar: the version of Air Kernel I have bumps the entire operating system to a minimum 60 frames per second screen refresh rate - this makes the whole OS feel much smoother.  That's pretty much it. I use my Nexus S pretty heavily through the day and Jelly Bean doesn't give me any problems. Sure, it is nowhere near as smooth an experience as it is on my Nexus 7, but don't forget that the Nexus S is two years old and for a device that 'old' to run this OS smoothly is pretty darn cool. ",
