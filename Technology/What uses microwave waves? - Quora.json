            "answer_text": "Q: What uses microwave waves? Microwaves are the electromagnetic waves from 1 meter in length to 1 millimeter, with frequency ranging from 300 megahertz to 300 gigahertz. The lower range include many frequencies used for various types of radio communications. Other uses are Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Radar uses microwaves. They are even to to heat food with at a frequency of 2.45 Ghz. See: Microwave - Wikipedia ",
