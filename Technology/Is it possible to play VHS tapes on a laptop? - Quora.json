            "answer_text": "Sure, if you buy an inexpensive USB \u201cdongle\u201d that will convert the composite video output of a VCR into a video signal your laptop can understand and play. People usually use these to digitize their VHS tapes for archiving, but there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t just watch the tapes as well. Here\u2019s an example, but check the user feedback and requirements to confirm that the software and hardware are correct for use with your laptop.

Of course, you also need a working VHS player. These aren\u2019t made any more, but are widely available used online, in thrift stores and pawn shops and local classifieds. VHS \u201cHiFi\u201d players would have potentially much better audio quality, assuming the tapes use that audio format. They\u2019re also completely compatible with older linear mono and stereo audio tracks, so that type of machine would offer the highest audio quality. Similarly, a S-VHS machine would be able to play the higher resolution tapes that typical VHS players can\u2019t, and is similarly compatible. Just make sure any machine you get is fully functional and has the remote. ",
