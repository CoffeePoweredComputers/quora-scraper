            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t work. You can\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d a corporation to do something. You can contract with them to do it. What is wrongly called \u201cforce tech transfers\u201d or \u201cIP theft\u201d works like this: foreign company seeks to access China market orforeign company seeks partner for production in Chinaforeign company does not want to invest in plant and equipment, but wants Chinese partner to do thisforeign company wants to leverage a joint venture rather than a supplier arrangement so complies with Chinese foreign ownership laws and forms a JV with them at 49% and Chinese 51% (and today they could also register as a Foreign Owned Company but this is a recent change)In the process of JV or company formation they decide the commercial terms - who is contributing what. They decide and foreign company accepts that the foreign company is contributing rights to use some IP and the Chinese partner is contributing capital (new factory, new equipment, training staff, doing prototypes, testing etc etc).Like many commercial decisions, you need to accept the commercial terms that can be agreed. If you can\u2019t negotiate better deals you don\u2019t do the deal. Nothing is forced. Nothing is stolen. If it is stolen it would be breaching the terms of the agreement and action could be taken in Chinese courts. But guess what? This is almost never done. The alleged theft is a Trumpianism and not reflected by any substantial reality. ",

            "answer_text": "So let\u2019s add some balance\u2026 The forced bit goes like this. Company wants to enter the China market or have a base in China. They go there and China says fine, but you MUST have a local partner. You can\u2019t operate in China just by yourself (most countries do this by the way). Company finds a partner and then they say ok, you need to pay xxx million for our plant, supply lines, warehouse, local knowledge and contacts etc etc or give us rights to your tech. Company can\u2019t afford xxx million so give up their tech in return for the ability to operate in China. I think this has been rescinded and companies can go it alone, but they will find that without a local partner they WILL fail and they WILL wish they had given up their IP in return for the gazzillions they get out of it. Just my personal opinion of course. So in reality, the government previously demanding a local partner could be seen as a way to avoid failure for those foreign companies. Halting that requirement is like saying ok, you asked for it\u2026 lol. One thing is for certain, we will see a huge upsurge of foreign company failures in China. I guess then we could make Chinese companies deal with and give all assistance to foreign companies who are in China. Yeah, Naaaa. (That\u2019s a New Zealand saying). ",
