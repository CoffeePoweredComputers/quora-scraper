            "answer_text": "300 years from now? Well, be glad You and I won\u2019t be alive by then. I say this because of the answer I\u2019ll give. These are my thoughts. Let me introduce you to Sophia:  Hey! Before I continue, I want you to meet the first Robot citizen of Saudi Arabia. What does that say to you? Couldn\u2019t she be the height of technology as we know it? Making her a citizen makes me think about the motive behind AI and the direction technology is going. The world is advancing to where technology will become autonomous. Which means humans are not required anymore. Almost like we are being replaced, right? What if that\u2019s the case? Autonomous vehicles, machines, etc.. You will agree with me that 300 years from now is more than enough to perfect Artificial Intelligence. Oh\u2026are you hoping I will tell you about IoT The World\u2019s First Artificial Intelligence robot citizen \u201cSophia\u201d may be a kind of \u2018Adam\u2019 for the robot generation. You should watch the video on the interview and tell me if that doesn\u2019t creep you out. She mentioned couple of times during her interviews with the word, \u201cWorld Domination.\u201d People laughed.  Also, with the advancement in technology, comes with a lot of negative effects as well. If I should guess what 300 years from now will be, I\u2019m sorry, but all I can picture is \u2018The Terminator\u201d Movie. Artificial Intelligence will be perfected by 300 years from now, with robots being able to detect that humans are killing their planet (Maybe). I should also mention that AI perfection will be the greatest technological achievement. That is where AI can not only think for itself, but also able to execute those thoughts. And they will also become autonomous to even write codes to create other robots. Humanity might become extinct just like Dinosaurs (Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t believe that, but movies\u2026\u2026. I guess I can make any prediction.) You and I won\u2019t be alive by then to see it.   I\u2019ve watched movies about how robots turned on humans. But now I feel these movies are trying to pass a message. Watch the movies Ex Machina - Ava In conclusion, If you ask about technology in 5 to 30 years from now, I might mention some gadgets and stuff\u2026 but 300 years from now, this is what you get. ",
