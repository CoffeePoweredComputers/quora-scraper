            "answer_text": "Drivers: Truck Drivers, taxi drivers, delivery agents\u200b will be fully automated.Banking clerks/Cashiers: All low level bank jobs will be fully automated in developed countries and semi-automated in developing countries.Stock Traders: Goldman Sachs has already replaced 600 traders with 200 cs engineers. So if your are entering stock market as a trader you are sooner or later going to be replaced by a automated trading software or a cs engineer.Relationship Managers: Some may think that this job cannot be automated as it's all about building new business but the catch is that most of the people are now keen to online interaction and not one to one.Accountants: A chartered accountant may not lose his job due to business complexities and taxation however people engaged in general accounting work has already lost their job to softwares.Newspaper/Publishing/Digital Marketing: More focus is on paperless tomorrow and a coder can easily automate digital marketing jobs.Factory Worker: Their role might change like doing more precise tasks instead of bulk however the need for more workers will reduce to drastic levels in the coming 5\u20137 years leaving from 100 to 10 workers.Operations/Analysts/Call center Executives: Will be fully automated leaving only the Manager's and above people leaving them as well under constant fear.Door to Door selling: A hectic job but still needed as products will be sold to humans not robots so their workload will be reduced by Marketing automation but not their needData Analytics: Will be automated but it is somewhat open ended and in demand right now so hopes are high.School/College teachers: From classroom teaching to online teaching but most of the education is from Industrial age point of view not Digital Age. Majority of us are still taught basic calculus instead of how to make a calculator which only the fortunate ones know. So in short education system is redundant.Jobs safe from automation: A computer science/ artificial intelligence engineer: These people create automation. Job Destroyers or Creators. Can't\u200b comment anything ;)Doctors/Surgeons: Although robotics has and will enter Medical Sciences but a human cannot fully entrust his life to a robot or software.Investment Bankers: They are business builders for big banks although it is very subjective to come at any conclusion that there job can be automated or not.CEOs: Depends on what business they are in.Actors/ Artists: Someone/ Somewhere will always need entertainment.Machine\u200b Maintenance: Not everyone can become engineers but someone can reduced their workload to some extent.Sales: Must have strong technical and selling skills both in order to survive.Data Analyst/ Data Scientist: They might pose threat to jobs of Management consultant\u200bs to some extent but they are also endangered by cs engineers.HR Manager's : Talent acquisition head or managers\u200b will be needed but HR executives maintain employee engagements or operational task will be replaced by a chatbot.Prostitution: Although sex dolls have already entered the market but I don't think they can and will ever replace feelings ;)That's all for now. Will add more if comes in HUMAN mind :D Some points in above answer might be wrong as it is written completely out of frustration as I have lost my job to automation. Suggestions pending. Tks. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a report by McKinsey that helps us answer that question.[1] In other words, the report tries to assess which types of activities have the potential to be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technologies. Based on that those activities can be further discerned in seven categories as shown from the picture below coming from McKinsey Report:  Each of those categories indicates up to which extent (as percentage) can those activities be automated. As you can see each of those has a potential of automation: managing others can be automated up to 9%applying expertise can be automated up to 18%stakeholder interactions can be automated up to 20%unpredictable physical work can be automated up to 25%data collection can be automated up to 64%data processing can be automated up to 69%predictable physical work can be automated up to 78%Based on that the first people that will lose their jobs will be the workers on factories. Where their physical activities is repetitive and extremely predictable (where there are no sudden changes in the activity performed or the environment is predictable). According to the report welding and soldering on an assembly line can be almost entirely automated. Other jobs like construction and forestry (where the external environment is highly unpredictable) can only be automated by one fourth. Managing people instead seems to be the less prone to automation. In conclusion, to assess whether your job has already the potential to be automated you can look at the activity you perform on a daily basis. Asses for each of it in which category it falls into. Then assign how much of it you perform. That is how you\u2019ll be able to assess if your job is about to be automated. For instance, if you work on an assembly line for 50% of your time. While the remaining half is spent managing other workers. Then, your job can be automated by 43.5% (9% * 50% + 78% * 50%). So you\u2019re still safe! Of course this is a simplification. Yet those parameters are one of the most realistic ways to understand whether the job you perform can be automated. Footnotes[1] Where machines could replace humans--and where they can\u2019t (yet)",
