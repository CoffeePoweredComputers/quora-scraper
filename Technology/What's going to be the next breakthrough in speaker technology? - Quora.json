            "answer_text": "Although the most common transducer is the moving coil-permanent magnet transducer (the one on the image below), many variations of acoustic transducers already exist. Even a \u201cFull Digital\u201d speaker.  The Moving Coil permanent magnet uses ferromagnetic or rare earth permanent magnets with high coercivity (resistance to loss of magnetism).  There is the Field Coil Transducer ( electrodynamic loudspeaker). In this one an electro magnet is energized by current through a second pair of connections to the driver.  There is the surround-less driver. As the name suggest this speaker has no surround at the end of the cone.  There is the planar magnetic transducer electrostatic. The frequency response of a planar driver is not constrained by its mechanical design or construction. The light mass of the diaphragm allows it to reproduce the full audio spectrum as it responds very quickly to fast transient sounds... Imagine several drivers grouped together, because the total area of all the drivers combine and behave as one large and very fast speaker. In contrast to the conventional round drivers, the flat two-dimensional shape of planar drivers project sound in a more \"natural\" dispersion pattern almost like a beam of light instead of the sound radiating out in concentric rings rippling out from a central point as it happens with the conventional cone speaker.  You have the concentric loudspeaker Cabasse calls its version of the coincident source the Spatial Coherent Source, or SCS. This is the same as 3 separate fixed magnet speakers into one (woofer/mid range/tweeter).  Another variation of a 2 way concentric speaker has been used by Tannoy for many years (Woofer/Tweeter).  You have the Manger's MSW full range driver that has a flat diaphragm which is bent to produce sound waves, rather than pushed and pulled like a regular \"rigid\" speaker cone.  You have the drivers German Physics uses. An omnidirectional speaker that radiates the wave from the sides of the cone rather than using the front of the cone to radiate the wave.   You also have the MBL Driver \"Radialstrahler\" In this one several membranes compress and extend in order to create the sound wave.  You have the ESS amt-1b Heil Air-Motion-Transformer (AMT) a type of electroacoustic transducer or loudspeaker, also called Air Velocity Transformer (AVT) or JET transducer. Invented by Dr. Oskar Heil. In contrast to a planar ribbon loudspeaker, the diaphragm of the AMT is a pleated shape similar to a bellows. The AMT moves air in an augmented, semi-perpendicular motion using a folded sheet (made of polyethylene, polyester or polyimide), structured around a series of aluminum struts positioned in a high-intensity magnetic field.  You have the Ribbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers which consist of a thin metal-film ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The electrical signal is applied to the ribbon, which moves with it to create sound waves. The advantage of a ribbon driver is that the ribbon has very little mass; thus, it can accelerate very quickly, yielding very good high-frequency response. Above and below the ends of the more or less rectangular ribbon, there is less audible output due to phase cancellation, but the precise amount of directivity depends on ribbon length.  Planar magnetic Loudspeakers with ribbon and planar-magnetic drivers and a transmission line woofer  You have the Plasma driver. It has no moving parts. It varies air pressure via a high-energy electrical plasma instead of a solid diaphragm.  The Eminent Technology TRW17 Rotary Subwoofer, the only subwoofer to be able to respond from 1Hz \u2013 30Hz+/- 4dB. As it rotates its blades move to help it produce variations in the pressure wave.  You have directional parabolic loudspeakers. The image is self-explanatory.  You have the HyperSound Loudspeaker Technology  You have horn and waveguide speakers like these Omni Audio  You have surface transducers, with these, you can turn a solid resonant surface into a \"loudspeaker\" or will convert virtually anything into a \"sound source\"  You have some \"variations\" on this technology like the Greensound Technology Glass Speakers  And the Sony Sountina Glass Speaker  So as you can see there are plenty of different loudspeaker technologies available today. You even have \"invisible speakers\". Emo Labs has developed a revolutionary new technology that turns a TV screen (or a computer screen) into an actual speaker.  The technology is called \"Edge Motion,\" a very thin, clear membrane (the loudspeaker driver) is embedded on the TV screen. A thin piezo actuator micro flexes the membrane, creating the sound wave. Or you can have it stand alone.  Of course, within the conventional speaker, you have the Subwoofer driver  The Woofer  The Mid Woofer  The Mid Range  The Mid Tweeter  The tweeter   The Super Tweeter  And the full range loudspeaker driver Like this Voxative or the Feastrex below   I will try to remember other techs I may have missed and will update the answer accordingly. Although I have not mentioned \"new\" technologies, I have tried to show you several existing ones you may not know about. There have been other technologies like the Sony APM6 Drive units that used 4 coils working together with a square membrane  And the ones used in the Infinity Prelude Floorstanding Loudspeaker based on the same principle but with elongated coils   On a side note the Moving Coil permanent magnet transducer s (the most common of them all) voice coil (consisting of a former, collar, and winding) the coil of wire attached to the apex of a loudspeaker cone that provides the motive force to the cone by the reaction of a magnetic field to the current passing through it. Has a few types of different approaches. Because the moving parts of the speaker must be of low mass (to accurately reproduce high-frequency sounds without being damped too much by inertia), voice coils are usually made as lightweight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much power through the coil can cause it to overheat. Voice coils wound with flattened wire, called ribbon-wire, provide a higher packing density in the magnetic gap than coils with round wire.  Some coils are made with surface-sealed bobbin and collar materials so they may be immersed in a ferrofluid which assists in cooling the coil, by conducting heat away from the coil and into the magnet structure.  You have the Underhung coil usually intended for very low distortion applications. It has less moving mass and inductance, flatter BL. Gives extreme linearity (over a short distance), Low Distortion, constant Magnetic Flux. A larger X-max can be obtained by using an underhung coil with a thick top plate. But that makes for a massive magnet structure when using conventional magnets or an expensive slug of neodymium.  In a more conventional \"overhung\" driver, the moving voice coil is longer than the gap. It hangs over on both ends. And it has a much higher Xmax  The famous Scanspeak Illuminator uses an underhung design.  Read more here: B&O Tech: Why select one driver over another? (Part 1) or here: How Speakers Work, \u041a\u0430\u043a \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d \u041c\u041e\u0422\u041e\u0420 \u0441\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0443\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430, Voice coil. There are other considerations regarding the materials used. Some can stand more heat (more power) others less. But I suggest you read this very interesting article on the subject: The Mother of Tone You also have very long excursion woofer drivers (usually used on subwoofer systems)  ",

This could actually tie-in with one of the answers here talking about mobile phones (where VR content is on the upswing) \u2013 although I was thinking about other larger applications such as concert arenas/theatres/live sports venues (where most of the audio is still currently presented in mono), theatres, bars and pubs, etc. An application like this calls for a complete rethink about psychoacoustics, user/listener behaviour, speaker cabinet construction techniques, DSP, codecs/containers and possibly even transducer design. It'll be at least another 20, 30 years before something comes out, though \u2014 esp. For high-performance/high-fidelity designs. ",

While we have seen a resurrection of the use of planar magnetic and AMT tweeters, these technologies are are over forty years old and the vast majority of speakers, including the most advanced models, still use cones and domes. While material advances and design and measuring techniques have evolved over the years, most successful speakers are not much different conceptually than they were long ago.  If we qualify a breakthrough as an advanced concept that changes the way most speakers operate, it may be too far off to think about.  ",
