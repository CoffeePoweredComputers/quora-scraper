            "answer_text": "If you are ok to put 1,49,999* on a mobile device then you can definitely buy because with more improvements and beyond tech look samsung Z fold 2 is stealing every Tech vloger. But in my opinion I suggest you not to invest such huge amount on electronics because once you buy it you will regret in coming times so if you wait for 2\u20133 years you will get foldable mobiles in more affordable price. Till then buy a mobile at 49,999 and invest 1,00,000 in any shares (with guidence of professional) and trust me you will not regret doing it. Hope you found the Answer. Thank You, Have a Great Day \ud83d\udd96 Jai Hind! ",

            "answer_text": "First Of All If You had Buyed it then You Had Selected a good and heavy or multitasking device. But ya investing so much money in that phone is not too good because there are many smartphone with great features and cheaper than This phone. Samsung M51 with 7000Mah battery only in 22,499. So, don't mind if u had buyed it's ok and if not then I will suggest you to buy Any Phone with Great Features in Cheap Price . Because in this phone , if the display got changed or cracked then it will charge too much money to repair it. Thank you ",
