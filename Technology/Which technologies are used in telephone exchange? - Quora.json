            "answer_text": "Hi\u2026 This is kinda old school\u2026but all the exchanges I\u2019ve ever been around for AT&T, which is pretty much what's used in the US, all all digital\u2026The electromechanical stuff that supported the original \u201crotary\u201d stuff, were phased out in the 1980\u2019s, if I remember correctly\u2026 Most of the switches were basically of 2 types the NORTEL DMS-100 supernode, or a DMS-200 for trunk switching, and the ATT 5-ESS. NORTEL went out of business years ago, but was deemed too Big to Fail\u2026so the \u201cFiber Optic\u201d end of the business went to Ciena and the Switching end of the business went to Genband and Ericsson, if I understand this correctly. NORTEL, a Canadian based company, sold switched services and fiber muxes all over the world\u2026The bankruptcy was quite the surprise, and probably put in jeopardy service, repair and maintenance issues for businesses and governments all over the globe. To me, it all still looks and works the same to me\u2026A lot of the fiber equipment I worked with, in the way of install, test and turn-up, looked and worked the same, it just the the name plate of Ciena on the outside. But there is a lot of fiber muxes, switched, inner connected equipment to support, things like DSL, VOIP Fiber to the curb and fiber to the home, and the cellular network, which interfaces with 4G and 5G cell service. AS I remember my Switchman support, I used to provide\u2026my DMS-100 switch \u201chigh water mark\u201d as it was called was about 100K calles processed per hour. The DMS switch, is kinda like a large computer. It has at its heart 2 CPU\u2019s. I always thought of them as left brain, and right brain\u2026one side was always working and the other was a hot standby\u2026The last single card I replaced (CPU) had a a cost of 450,000 dollars, if I remember the billing correctly\u2026.Maybe why they went out of business. Just 3 removable cards, which were about 11x17 cost the company about 1.5 million, and we are still in the CPU section of the DMS-100 switch\u2026.go figure\u2026 So, switch spare cards were very expensive, and was kept under lock and key\u2026Problem is, I can\u2019t remember where I put the key\u2026Oops My Bad\u2026. Anyway, it's all a large digital switch system, interlaced with fiber muxes to support the various App\u2019s you enjoy with your phone service\u2026 PS\u2026I almost forgot all the copper T-1 and T-3 interfaces still processing various services to the field\u2026 Good Luck (My head kinda hurts trying to remember all this stuff)\u2026.
