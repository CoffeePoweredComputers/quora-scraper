            "answer_text": "It depends on the person and what part of intelligence is their strength, or what strengths they decide to use to their advantage. As well as who counts as an \u201cintelligent person\u201d as this can include a lot of different people. In many cases of \u201cromantic love\u201d and relationships, as well as friendship, the intelligent person will go into a relationship with someone they know has a high potential to be dishonest and who is intending to use them for money. But they try to create a situation that forces that person into honesty, because they don't want their partner to be a \u201cplayer\u201d. So they allow the person to take advantage of them in a way that makes that person feel bad about taking advantage of them. They're idealistic and want to \u201cchange\u201d someone (for example an inmate in the prison system) who is already basically dishonest and using them from the start. Many \u201cmethodical\u201d types who are in the range of sociopathy and psychopathy will explicitly use people. But a lot of professionals, such as doctors and psychologists rank high among those who set out to manipulate people; especially in terms of use of language, turning the meaning of things around, setting up situations in which to manipulate clients and patient's in various ways. However, a large portion of people who fit \u201chighly intelligent\u201d or \u201cgifted\u201d have massive \u201cempathy\u201d, \u201cconscience\u201d and \u201cidealism\u201d because of that intelligence. You're likely to find more \u201cplayers\u201d and sociopaths among \u201caverage intelligence\u201d than among \u201chigh intelligence\u201d because very high intelligence often (but not always) brings with it enormous empathy and sensitivity, and so there's a \u201cdepth\u201d that goes along with it that stands in contrast to the fakeness of sociopaths and players. \u201cPsychotic doctors\u201d, sociopaths, and all the various players do exist among the \u201chighly intelligent\u201d, however I would say they're actually the exception rather than the rule. One is actually more likely to find a larger number of \u201ctrustworthy\u201d people among those who are \u201chighly intelligent\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "An intelligent person looks for mutual advantage. Taking from others never ends well. Only an idiot believes that taking advantage of people is self-beneficial. If you want to thrive long-term, you will look for mutual benefit with others. You cannot make it by yourself, that\u2019s a joke. I always look to make other people stronger. I show other people how I can benefit them, which gives them a reason to want to benefit me. That\u2019s how a healthy relationship works. You offer value in exchange for value. When I help others become stronger, they become strong friends. Everyone wins. I know people who have cheated others and their luck ran out quickly. It will catch up to you. I\u2019ve spent my life building mutually beneficial relationships, and things typically turn out well for me because of those relationships. ",
