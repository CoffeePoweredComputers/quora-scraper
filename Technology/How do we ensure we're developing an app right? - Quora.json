            "answer_text": "My business tends to focus more on finding coders who will develop an app right, but I\u2019ve had people hire me to \u201caudit\u201d their app process. Here\u2019s some of the things you should look for: Clarity. Has the developer been given a clear plan so that there\u2019s no doubt in his mind on what he\u2019s supposed to do? One of the common failure points for a project is unclear instructions to the developer.Consistency. Has that plan stayed mostly the same throughout the process? Obviously there\u2019s going to be some changes. But if your plan is constantly changing in major ways throughout development, it\u2019s going to mean trouble.Communication. Are you talking regularly with your developer? Do you know what they\u2019re doing? Equally importantly, do they feel able to talk to you about problems? This can be important. If there\u2019s a feature that\u2019s taking a long time to develop, changing it or removing it could speed up development. That\u2019s not a decision your developer can make; he can only go by your plan. But if he talks to you about it, you can change that part of your product plan.Hiring. This is basically what I do, and I could talk a lot about it. I\u2019ll just sum up and say that you should take your time, and don\u2019t hire the cheapest guy. There\u2019s a reason why he\u2019s the cheapest guy. Hiring\u2019s an important decision, do it right. Also, don\u2019t hire a giant team all at once. Hire one person or a small group, and add more people ONLY if you have a reason to do so.Code Quality. I do this during my interview process. Look over the developer\u2019s code for your app if it\u2019s underway. If you\u2019re hiring, look at code from their previous work. What you want to do is make sure that the developer writes clean, maintainable code. If you aren\u2019t from a tech background, get someone who is to take a look.More Communication. This is important enough to say twice. If you\u2019re wondering if your development process is going well, ask your developer. Obviously, if they\u2019re dishonest they won\u2019t tell you the truth. But there are a lot of development issues that don\u2019t involve dishonesty, and if you know about them, you might be able to find a solution together.Hope this helps! ",
