            "answer_text": "Any mask that prevents airborne fluids from reaching your nose and face would work. The easiest way to test any barrier is to spray a mist of water at the mask. If you feel the mist on the other side, even without touching the barrier itself, then you can be infected. Before I go on, let me express my dismay at healthcare experts claiming that wearing a mask doesn\u2019t protect average people. I understand that they want to reserve medical masks for healthcare providers, and to avoid giving wearers a false sense of security \u2014 but there\u2019s no reason to lie. Indeed, just a little thinking would show that it\u2019s a lie: If masks don\u2019t protect the wearer, why are healthcare workers so desperate to wear them? The fact is, multiple studies have shown that wearing a mask does protect the wearer from airborne illnesses. For example, Masks plus hand hygiene reduced ILI in college dorm study A lot of people, especially mask manufacturers, also mislead people into thinking that you need a medical-grade or industrial mask (e.g. N95) with pores smaller than the virus. That would be true if individual viruses were floating in the air like pollen or dust, which can happen in a lab. But that's not the case in normal settings. They are carried by body fluids, mostly saliva and mucus secretions (oral and nasal; it's unknown whether eye secretions are infectious). If an infected individual coughs and you breathe in the fluid particulates, you can be infected. It can also be spread if you touch an infected body part, e.g. shaking hands that have infectious fluids, then touching your nose or mouth. As such, the COVID-19 virus spreads like the cold and flu viruses. And measures against those viruses would also work against the coronavirus, e.g. washing your hands with soap for 20 secs, not touching your face with unwashed hands, etc. It is unknown whether coronavirus can spread through inanimate objects like an infected doorknob. But handwashing and using hand sanitizers after touching public surfaces should prevent that. As for facial barriers, something as simple as a scarf or paper towel should work. Or a Muslim niqab (the facial covering of a burqa, see below. It would be fascinating to study if Muslim populations have fewer airborne illnesses). Just make sure the barrier doesn't touch your mouth or nostrils in case it gets wet from infections fluids. For example, double layering a scarf should work. Unless the scarf is soaked with saliva, the inner layer should prevent any airborne fluids from reaching your facial cavities. Very effective would be cloth with a hydrophobic (aka water resistant) coating like Teflon or silicone, such as that used for umbrellas and rain gear. That said, it's probably best to use something disposable so that you won't have to touch and reuse a potentially infected barrier. S. Damon's answer to How hard is it to make a surgical mask? As for tightly-fitting masks, e.g. N95, they're not necessary for most people. So-called experts often claim that loose surgical masks are ineffective because gaps around the cheeks can let the virus in. That's irresponsible fear-mongering. The virus is embedded in fluids. Fluid droplets are heavy, and start falling after being expelled from an infected mouth or nose. The droplet will not suddenly change direction and sneak in behind the mask, or search for gaps. The sucking pressure from you inhaling certainly doesn't have the strength to change the droplet's trajectory. Furthermore, the fluids are viscous and sticky, easily sticking to the outside of any fabric mask. So a simple surgical mask, scarf, etc will do just fine. People who are surrounded by infectious patients or work in a virology lab, where there may be purified viral particles, do benefit from an N95. That's because patients might be coughing from all directions, often close up. That's simply not the case for most people. Finally, if you're really paranoid, you can spread a thin layer of hand sanitizer over your facial barrier. Not only would the alcohol kill the virus, but the gel acts like flypaper, trapping any particulates. It also clogs the pores of your barrier/mask. Be warned, however, that spreading sanitizer on a paper barrier might weaken it, risking rips and tears.  Here is a Muslim niqab. An effective mask can be made trimming the lower portion. While it probably won\u2019t be too comfortable in the Summer heat, it\u2019s seems great in the Winter. And being loose and strapless, it\u2019s probably more comfortable and less restricting than a surgical or N95 mask.  ",

            "answer_text": " This is a disposable surgical mask. Unless you are a healthcare professional or a public servant on work, or a person who suffers from very specific conditions (oncologic patients, or people with a compromised immune system) that\u2019s all you need. According a nurse friend, you can reuse one of these masks for 3\u20134 times, as long as you use them only for a few hours and in lightly crowded places. After each use, hang the mask in the sun for at least one day or, better, use a ultraviolet device to sterilize them. They are not washable.  Before disposable surgical masks became standard, medical personnel used cloth surgical masks. These are good also in this instance if you can handle them properly. A cloth mask needs to be washed and disinfected after each use and should have a pocket where to inset a filter.  You can also buy quite fashionable cloth face masks with a pocket where to insert a filter. Filters like the above need to be replaced after serveral hours of use, and the mask should also be washed and disinfected regularly to avoid a buildup of viruses and bacteria. All of these masks are not mainly meant to filter out the viruses, they are meant to keep the eventual viruses in. If everyone consistently wears a mask, though, transmission is still almost impossibile.  N95/FPP3 masks with no valvealso protect the wearer from the virus, but these masks are extremely uncomfortable because they must be work so that they seal completely your mouth and nose inside. Brething through these masks is fairly hard and they are very uncomfortable. These masks should be reserved for medical personnel and for people who have a compromised immune system. FPP2 masks are not as protective as FPP3 masks, but still decrease sensibly the risk of breathing in the viruses. Since FPP2 masks are cheaper they should not be used by medical personnel but may be handy for those who need to work in a context that puts them in contact with lots of people, like supermarkets or pharmacies. These masks should never be washed.  N95/FPP3 or FPP2 respirators with a valve offer the same kind of protection as the masks, but they can let out the viruses. They are not a good mask to use, except in certain contexts. ",
