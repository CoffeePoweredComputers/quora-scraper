            "answer_text": "Best you can do is sign up for free trials on some of the sites that provide virtual phone numbers, as almost none offer them free of charge permanently. Your best bet would be Google Voice\u2026 IF it was available, well anywhere outside the US. Last I\u2019ve checked, it was available only there and you could use it only if you had a US number for verification purposes, and I somehow doubt you\u2019d be asking for a US phone number if you already had one. That said, there are many cheap providers out there that won\u2019t charge too much per month. I use Freeje, personally. They\u2019re cheap, provide a great service and know how to please their customers. Great customer support? Check.An amazing offering of countries for your virtual number? Check.Cheap and affordable rates? Check.Multiple kinds of services and options for virtual numbers? Check.So hey - if you want to check their Virtual UK numbers, prices, services or whatever else, here\u2019s the link - Freeje ",
