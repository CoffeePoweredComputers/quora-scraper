            "answer_text": "Typically the phone companies don't want to see you give your money to another company so they will continue your service on a month to month basis, some will force you to sign a new contract, some will raise your rates if you're out of contract. This is a great time to shop rates and entertain competitive offers. You might find that another company doesn't accept the phone you've been using and will require you to buy one of their phones, so while they initially looked to be the cheapest option, by the time you add in the monthly cost of the new phone, or outright purchase price divided over the length of your contract, the cheaper contract is more expensive. Thus plans that may not be the cheapest but let you keep your phones may be the best option for you. Something else to consider are things like manufacturer/model release dates, Samsung typically releases their S series devices around April and the Note series in September, LG's V series in November and HTC likes early December releases, which typically are released with advanced releases of the new Android released later in December to everyone else. Best advice I can give is to sit down and think about what you really NEED from your mobile device, eliminate all options that don't fulfill that need or do but are more expensive than you want, then shop plans based on access to the device you need, even if thats the device you already have. Don't get lulled into a new fancy device just because your co-worker, neighbor, or friend has it, get what YOU need, and the plan that fits that need. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer, yes. It usually reverts back to month to month, and any pre-contract prices (you might lose, for instance, that limited time promotion you enjoyed as part of owning a new latest and greatest phone, or even of being affiliated with a special group rate, such as veteran. Give them a call or have one of those apps or services like Charlie negotiate a better deal for you. ",
