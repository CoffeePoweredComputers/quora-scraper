            "answer_text": "Technology influences science in a number of ways:1) It makes certain methods easier than they would otherwise be. So, computers have made computation easier and cheaper than it would be otherwise. It even makes certain methods possible(web data collection? complicated models? etc)2) Technology opens up new areas of specialization. If computers didn\u2019t exist, all of CS would be an abstract sub-division of mathematics. Because they do, many universities now have entire departments dedicated to CS, MIS, computer engineering, and cognitive science. A lot of this is just because of applications(and associated funding).3) Technology increases the ability to spread information and collaborate at long distances.4) Technology changes the atmosphere of what people think and worry about. So, concerns about the singularity, the plausibility of economic planning, cybernetics, renewable energy, etc, all emerge out of a pattern of interaction between technology and science. People are often interested in science due to technology, and vice versa. ",
