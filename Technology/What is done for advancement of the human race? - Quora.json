            "answer_text": "Is done, or what should be done? The best thing that can be done for the human race and ultimately for this planet, (out side of everyone accepting Christ), is for there to be world peace. This can not happen until each person learns to love themselves. The Bible says to love our neighbor as we love ourselves. Unfortunately, this means that many, if not all, do not love themselves. We are on a course for self-destruction. Once we learn to love ourselves individually then loving another can be our main focus. Learning to love someone else, means that we learn to trust them. And once we learn to trust them, we do not fear that person to mistreat us. To take advantage of us. And they will see that they don\u2019t need to get for themselves first. They will do the same for us. And trust follows love. And when we learn to love we will learn how to live at peace with all men. Romans 12:18. But for this to happen, we must have a Common Denominator. Someone who can lead the way. And that person can only be God. So if world peace is our ultimate goal, then ultimate Love must be what we seek first. And Matthew 6:33\u201334, along with 1 John 4:20, puts all things into perspective. ",

The opposite of this is that mankind has not thrown off his baser instincts such as killing, rape, assault etc & why Karl Jung warned that we must learn about this as all future evil will come from MSN himself!
