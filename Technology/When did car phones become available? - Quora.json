            "answer_text": "1946 was first release by Bell but it wasn\u2019t until they became more common if not still very expensive. The first one I had was in 85. Phone was over $1,500 and cost for local calls was $.45 a minute with same cost for outgoing or incoming calls. Toll free calls were at the same rate. Any calls outside of local area resulted in flat daily roaming fees and really elevated per minute costs. $1.50-$2.00 was not unusual. Some phones are getting back to that expensive but monthly costs are way lower and more can be done with the phones. ",
