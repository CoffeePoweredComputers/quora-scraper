            "answer_text": "Scientists have created the hottest temperature ever seen on earth - an astonishing four trillion degrees Celsius. The record breaking temperature is 250,000 times warmer than the center of the sun and was last seen in the universe a split second after the Big Bang. But...The hottest thing that we know of (and have seen) is actually a lot closer than you might think. It\u2019s right here on Earth at the Large Hadron Collider(LHC). When they smash gold particles together, for a split second the temperature reaches 7.2 trillion degrees Fahrenheit! That\u2019s hotter than a supernova explosion. The highest possible theoretical temperature is the Planck temperature, which has the value 1.416785(71)\u00d710^32 K. Above~10^32 K, particle energies become so large that gravitational forces between them would become as strong as other fundamental forces. The Big Bang theory assumes that the universe has passed through this temperature about 10^(-42) seconds after the Big Bang as a result of enormous entropy expansion.

            "answer_text": "Fantastic question! There are two approaches to answering this question more fully: one is by further considering special relativity (SR), and the other considers quantum mechanics (QM). As regards special relativity, let\u2019s examine the explanation that the rate of combined atomic/molecular vibration, expressed as kinetic energy, is proportional to temperature, actually is heat. Kinetic energy involves mass in motion, and motion has velocity. Anything having mass may never reach lightspeed, so the velocity of kinetic energy is most certainly limited by a law of physics. This argument is somewhat academic because the velocities of atomic and molecular vibration are far below light speed. In any event, it is in quantum physics that we have a firmer, theoretical limitation on temperature. As with all energy, the kinetic-heat energy of atomic vibration occurs in discreet energy levels. It is quantized. The energy of the electromagnet radiation emitted by the vibrating atom or molecules is equal to the kinetic energy that produced it, and this is what we feel as heat. The higher the energy the shorter the wavelength of the radiation. The shortest possible wavelength is 1.616 x 10^-35 meters, the so called Planck length, and the corresponding temperature is 1.42 x 10^32 Kelvin. That is the theoretical highest temperature. ",
