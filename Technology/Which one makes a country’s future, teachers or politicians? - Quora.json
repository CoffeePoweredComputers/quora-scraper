            "answer_text": "Neither the politicians nor the teachers build future of the country but the good, honest, patriotic, hardworking, and democratic people irrespective of whether they are teachers or politicians or not.If the teacher is like Dronacharya, can never be a good teacher who imparts education equally to all pupils.Dronacharya, a symbol of a Nepotism/ Favouritism severed right thumb of Eklavya to whom even he never impart any training or education but he thought that if Eklavya remained n ARCHER, his BEB { Blue Eyed Boy ] Arjun would never have become an ace archer in the world.It is better if we forget the politicians who have no MORALS. They shift loyalties at the drop of a hat, always put THEMSELVES before everything including the Nation.I just loathe whenever any politicians speaks about the nation, society, poor, morality, humanity, equality, justice, truth, and so on because I I find very few rather handful who are truthful to themselves.",

            "answer_text": "You will be surprised by my answer. I prefer to name Entrepreneurs to be the nation builders. Due to numerous reasons, teacher and politicians have come to prominence. Because we see teachers right from the age 3 upto 20. Also we hear too much about politicians.We pay both by respect.We don't know that entrepreneurs are the skeleton and blood of the mation. Whereas Politicians are the brain and teachers are the mouth.A brain might desire 100 things, but if the skeleton is broken or there is NO blood, then the desires will never materialize. So NO Nation building!",
