            "answer_text": "As David Kra mentoins below, ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 are related to processes, not to products. However, the design and manufacture are also processes, thus the computers and any part of them may be manufactured in an ISO 9001 certified facility. The parts themselves should be certified to conform with electrical safety (and other) standards. For the manufacturer to be able to declare the conformity with relevant standards themselves, they must have some quality management system, usually ISO 9001. Thus the parts are made in ISO cerified facility and are conforming to the defined set of (usually ISO or EN) standards (electrical safety, noise, material safety, \u2026). ",
