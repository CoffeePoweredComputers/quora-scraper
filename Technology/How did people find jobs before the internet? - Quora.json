            "answer_text": "People networked - it was and still is common to get a job through somebody you know without the internet being used. You got headhunted - i.e. an employer employed an agent to search for somebody suitable. Or you had some business contact and the company approached you directly. You registered with an employment agency - it\u2019s just that you generally actually went there and filled in forms rather than did it over the internet. That still happens, especially for professional jobs such as lawyers, accountants, engineers etc You went through a careers office at your university who supplied you with the information on who to apply to and how and where to apply. (That\u2019s how I got my first job.) You looked up information in a library and wrote to companies by post, starting with a request for an application form and details of how to apply. You answered advertisements in newspapers. You answered notices on bulletin/notice boards - e.g. in supermarkets or outside libraries. You went to the government employment offices - e.g. the Job Centre or Labour Exchange. You went to companies directly and asked what vacancies they had. Some companies had a blackboard outside with a list of casual jobs. ",
