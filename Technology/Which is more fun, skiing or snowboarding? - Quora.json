            "answer_text": " It\u2019s a debate as ancient as time itself, and by this we mean the period of time that\u2019s occurred between 1965 and the present day. Skiing or snowboarding, what\u2019s better? Who\u2019s cooler? Who looks the best eating fondue? Well it\u2019s time to put all that to one side, and settle things the good old fashioned way\u2026 with an article-list thing. Never ones to favour the \u201cagree to disagree\u201d approach, i\u2019ve listed twelve reasons why we I skiing is definitely cooler than snowboarding. 1) Candide Thovex Is The King Of Cool  Candide Thovex\u2019s \u2018One Of Those Days 2\u2019 has had over 16 million views. Not only did this edit cement Candide as one of the coolest people in action sports, it pretty much made him the gnarliest person on this, or any other, planet. \u2018One Of These Days 2\u2019 dropped in January 2015, and it just gets better every time you see it. The audacity, the tricks, the twists and turns; it\u2019s all fish-hooks for your eyelids. Sure snowboarding has had it\u2019s moments this year, Billy Morgan\u2019s Quad Cork obviously springs to mind, but in my opinion nothing has come close to touching Thovex\u2019s powder-based magic. 2) Skiers Can Go Faster, Higher, And Further  Skiers can go faster, jump higher, and jump further. That might sound like a childish playground tactic to settling a debate, but it\u2019s true. Science, the old rascal, has proven time and time again that the basic laws of physics and aerodynamics will always side with the men and women on planks. The tuck-in position of downhill skiers means they pick up less drag than snowboarders, which consequently results in faster speeds. The fastest anyone has ever gone on skis is 252 km/h (157 mph). Comparatively speaking, the fastest anyone has ever gone on a snowboard is a measly 203 km/h (126 mph). Pah!  As a result of this speed advantage, and the added spring made possible by having two separate contact points with the snow, skiers are able to jump higher and further. Looking at this in terms of pure distance covered, the world record for ski jumping is a whopping 251 metres. That\u2019s the length of two and a half football pitches which, when you think about it, is absolutely insane. 3) Skiers Don\u2019t Get Stuck On The Flats  Snowboarders might look like the cat\u2019s pyjamas when they\u2019re shredding lines down a slope, but get them on the flats and they look like little old ladies with incontinence issues. From lording it over the skiers to being in desperate need of their help, and all because the mountain has had the stone-faced cheek to level off. \u201cGive us a drag-along, dude.\u201d \u201cHelp! I can\u2019t move.\u201d \u201cMate. Stick out your stick-thing, and give us a ride willz-ya?\u201d They\u2019ll reach out their hands to you and, because you\u2019re a skier and skiers are inherently nice, you\u2019ll offer them your stick and get them going again. The snowboarders might pretend the world would be a better place without us, but if skiers didn\u2019t exist the snowboarders would still be on the flat bits (three months after the snow had melted). 4) Skiing Has Much More History  Nobody is denying that snowboarding has history, but compared to skiing\u2019s rich history it\u2019s but a newborn baby. Archeologists believe that people have been skiing, in some form or other, since 5000 BC. The earliest examples of it being a \u201cthing\u201d were found in Putin\u2019s Playground (aka Russia). On top of that, wall paintings suggest that people have been using skis in the Xinjiang region of what is now China since approximately the tenth century. Of course, back in the day, skiing was purely a practical way of getting around. In the mid-1800s though, this all changed and skiing became a popular leisure activity. This revolution in the way people viewed skiing provided crucial economic support to mountain resorts and can be traced directly to the incredible facilities we see today. If skiing hadn\u2019t taken off in the way it did, there\u2019s no guarantee that snowboarding would even have had the infrastructure within which it eventually thrived. Go skiing, and feel the weight of history upon your shoulders. 5) Snowboarders Are Always Injuring Their Wrists  Statistically, skiers are more likely to die. But, that\u2019s alright, \u201cValar morghulis\u201d and all that. The skiers of this world have come to terms with that, after all we\u2019re the ones that can go faster, jump higher, and jump further. Death is just part of the package, a burden that we\u2019re willing to shoulder. When you delve down into the numbers some more it becomes clear that while skiers are wrestling with the Grim Reaper, snowboarders are much more concerned with their wrists\u2026and how not to injure them. Roughly 40% of all snowboarding injuries involve wrists and while it would be easy to make a self-flagellation gag here; we\u2019ve decided to rise above that easy option. Whether you\u2019re a snowboarder or a skier, wrists are important. They\u2019re useful for waving, for climbing ladders, for putting together anger-inducing \u2018Ski vs Snowboard\u2019 posts and for protecting your face from incoming projectiles thrown by people on the other side of the debate. Wrists, everyone. Look after your wrists. 6) Skiers Have Sticks, Everything Is Better With Sticks  Those of you who have eaten Chinese food authentically, with chopsticks, will attest to the beautiful simplicity of sticks. In the world of snow-based action sports, snowboarding is the equivalent of wolfing down a chow-mein with a shiny knife and fork. You might end up eating the exact same food as us, but the way in which you do it doesn\u2019t have quite the same class. Meanwhile, the skiers of this world weave majestically down the slopes with poles in their hands\u2026looking like a retro postcard (in a good way). Not only do the poles look seriously rad, they are also a highly practical slope-side accessory. Got stuck on the flats? Just push yourself along, and help stationary boarders in the process. Hiking up a mountain? Fear not because you have, not one but, two sticks to help you get where you need to be. Your snowboarder friends will be slipping and sliding, completely at the mercy of gravity, while you will be charging up the mountain like Sir Edmund Hillary. 7) Skiers Can Make Sharper Turns  Skis are like those sports cars, the ones that rhe Top Gear crowd slag off for being less aesthetically pleasing only to end up being stunned to their very core by their incredible handling. You can just imagine that plate-scourer-for-hair-Jeremy-Clarkson trying on some skis, possibly while wearing some tight neon spandex, and saying something like \u201cHammond! I feel like a right tit.\u201d But then Clarkson, hero to the dads, starts going down the mountain; utilising the extra contact points made possible by skis, he turns sharply\u2026showcasing in one eye-catching swerve the brilliant manoeuvrability of these \u201cvehicles\u201d attached to his feet. \u201cThese things offer more twists and turns than Scarlett Johansson\u2019s backside!\u201d And of course, at this point, he\u2019d probably say something classically Clarkson: \u201cWell tickle my gentleman\u2019s sausage, and call me Charlie. These things offer more twists and turns than Scarlett Johansson\u2019s backside!\u201d We\u2019re not condoning misogyny, the objectification of Scarlett Johansson\u2019s backside, or Jeremy Clarkson here; we\u2019re merely highlighting that it\u2019s easier to make sharper turns on skis. 8) Skiers Can Make Themselves Look Like Helicopters  You can\u2019t look like a helicopter while snowboarding. Unless, you\u2019re wearing some sort of bizarre outfit that makes you look like a helicopter. But who, in their right mind, would do this? Skiers can look like a helicopter whenever they want. They just need to hit a kicker and do that clever trick-thing where the planks cross like helicopter blades. What do you mean that isn\u2019t a reason? The ability to look like a helicopter, whenever we want, is probably the main reason skiing is cooler than snowboarding. Dare I say, the ultimate reason. 9) There\u2019s Never Been A Snowboard-Only Resort  And there are several skier-only resorts. Some people thinks this makes skiing elitist and snobby and, if we\u2019re being totally honest, it does seem to suggest that. On the other hand, fair play to these resorts for having the audacity to bank their entire income on one particular sport. If nothing else, the fierceness of these people\u2019s loyalty to skiing deserves a doff of the cap. We\u2019d hate for there to be an actual war between the two-sides but if it ever came to that, we\u2019d want the people of Alta, Utah, on the front line. 10) Snowboarders Are Scared Of Button Lifts  Most skiers look at a button lift, shrug their shoulders, and say \u201cYeah, man. It\u2019s a button lift. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d Then they get on the button lift, take in the nice views, and ski effortlessly off it when it reaches the top. Snowboarders, on the other hand, have endless nightmares about them. For weeks before their trip, and weeks after, they\u2019ll wake up in the middle of the night screaming \u201cNooooooo! Not the button lift, anything but the button lift.\u201d Calm down guys, it\u2019s just a button lift. 11) Snowboarding Used To Be Anti-Establishment, But Now It\u2019s Done By Balding Investment Bankers  Snowboarding is like the little alternative band you\u2019ve been loving since 2004, that suddenly blew up when their fourth album got a five star review in The Telegraph. You still love the band, but they\u2019re not \u2018your\u2019 band anymore. They\u2019re bigger than that, they\u2019ve waddled over to the mainstream and lost their underground appeal. Your favourite band, like snowboarding, is still churning out some cracking stuff but they\u2019re now singing to the entire congregation rather than just a handful of shaggy-haired rebels. This growth in audience has fundamentally changed the demographic of snowboarding, which was one of the things that made it so cool in the first place. There\u2019s still the outrageously cool Scandinavian dudes, of course, but now there\u2019s also a huge pile of investment banker types, called Graham, who choose snowboarding over skiing in a misguided attempt to stay young and relevant. And while the Grahams of this world see an increase in their \u201cstreet cred\u201d, the world of snowboarding suffers an almighty dip as a result.  Snowboarding is currently going through what Facebook went through a few years ago. Parents, parents of friends, uncles, aunties, and grandparents all started sending you friend requests and the whole thing felt immediately less gnarly. You\u2019re still on Facebook, but you know in your heart that things will never be the same again. Skiing, meanwhile, has slinked along under the radar and become almost anti-establishment in its nature. It doesn\u2019t have the video games, and it hasn\u2019t had a smash hit like \u2018The Art Of Flight\u2019. This might sound like a negative but, when you consider it thoughtfully, it actually highlights how skiing can be the choice for people who shun what society deems \u201ccool.\u201d  There\u2019s nothing cool about something so obviously cool and that, perhaps more than any other reason, is why snowboarding is less cool than skiing. Snowboarding thinks it\u2019s cool, and there\u2019s nothing cool about something that thinks it\u2019s cool. Same goes for people who give themselves a nickname; Derek \u201cThe Party Animal\u201d Smith, we\u2019re looking at you. These things go in circles, of course, but at this moment in time skiing is cooler because it\u2019s deemed less cool by the people who believe they speak for the concept of \u201ccool\u201d. Skiers bravely take the path-less-trodden and, because of that, they\u2019re cooler than snowboarders. PROS AND CONS: Ease of learning Skiing: The initial learning curve is pretty fast. The most natural mode of transport we ever learn, walking, involves independent leg movement. So does skiing. Once you've got the hang of the snowplough turn, usually on the first or second day, you're capable of skiing around the whole mountain, as long as it's not too steep. Even parallel turns usually come fairly quickly.But the problem with skiing is that it's too easy to get away with doing it badly. You can spend all your life making turns on blue and red runs by rotating your whole body, but as soon as you get on to steeper slopes, you'll get \"found out\". You will only master bumpis and off-piste with style when you learn to pivot your feet beneath you while keeping your upper body still and facing down the slope. Snowboarding: Anyone who has done it will tell you that learning to snowboard is a long and bruising process at first, only to be undertaken when the snow is soft. Imagine learning to windsurf with out the water! For me it was humbling: even after three days, it took me half an hour to ride down a run that I could ski down in around two minutes. As a skier, I felt very constricted having both feet clamped together, but I imagine that that feels unnatural for most people. There's almost no other activity where it is necessary - even skateboarders and surfers can move their feet a bit. And in snowboarding, there are two totally different types of turn to learn: backside (edging with your heels) and frontside (edging with your toes). Like most skiers, I found the backside turn easier at first (at least your toes are pointing roughly where you're going), and the frontside utterly alien. But, ironically, once you've picked up the frontside turn, you'll find it's the more stable and natural movement. It has been found that some skiers learn snowboarding quicker if they are given a pair of ski poles for balance. Soon after learning to snowboard on piste, you can try going off-piste. It will be a revelation - you'll realise that all the pain and anguish was worth it. Snowboarding in powder is virtually easier than doing it on piste, and is one of the greatest sensations known to humankind. Young snowboarders will also soon progress to taking air in the terrain park and halfpipe. But only the most masochistic will ever try to manoeuvre a snowboard through a mogulfield. Convenience Skiing: Of course, the worst part is walking to the lifts, clumping along with your ski boots open, dropping skis, poles, gloves and goggles as you go. You try to look cool with your skis on your shoulder, just like your instructor, but they keep slipping apart, and anyway they hurt your collarbone. But once you're on the mountain, you're in your element. Chairlifts present no problem, and once you've got the hang of T-bars and Poma lifts, they're fairly comfortable to ride. Snowboarding: Walking through the car park, you're the coolest of dudes. In your comfy soft boots you can saunter past the clumping skiers, snowboard nonchalantly tucked under one arm. But on the mountain, a snowboard is not the best-thought-out method of getting around. To ride any lift, you have to remove your back foot. Step-in bindings have made this easier, but most of them still keep clogging up with ice. At the top of every lift you increase your risk of haemorrhoids, sitting in the snow as you struggle to strap your back foot in again. T-bars and Poma lifts are, literally, a pain in the groin. And when you encounter the dreaded flat sections, you have four options: take the back foot out and \"scoot\"; bend down and claw yourself along with your fingernails; hop like a demented frog; or beg your skiing mates for a tow. Pose factor Skiing: At the moment, skintight suits are just not \"in\". Ski-racers need to wear them for aerodynamics, but most other young skiers have adopted fairly baggy gear. The \"New School freeriders\", acrobats who are inventing new skiing tricks based upon snowboarding, would not be seen dead in anything that isn't baggy. Snowboarding: You may think those young whippersnappers in the terrain park look pretty scruffy, in their baggy, drab-coloured gear. But they have spent good money to achieve that look. The snowboards themselves should have fairly subdued, retro graphics (no palm trees, motorbikes or naked women nowadays, thank you very much). The lingo Skiing: Has always been a source of techno-head jargon, and you'll still encounter plenty of that, especially with the current breakneck pace of ski development: torsional rigidity, sidecut dimensions, taper angle, ramp angle, alignment, vibration dampening, multi-injection, lateral transmission, dualtec, prolink, beta profile, monocoque, energy frame. The list is endless, and that's before you've even left the shop. Once you're on the mountain, there's plenty more: initiation, angulation, anticipation, upper-lower body separation, rise line, zipper line... But to be fair, these terms are sometimes coined by technicians or instructors to encapsulate a complicated concept, which would otherwise require many more words to describe. Snowboarding: Has adopted Californian surfer slang, and added a few terms of its own. If something is extremely tough, it's \"gnarly\", \"sick\", or \"rad\". To describe something especially good, the epithets \"wicked\", \"bad\", or \"dope\". Of course, these words may already have been superseded by even newer ones. But when referring to the sideways-standing sport, whatever you do, don't ever call it \"boarding\" - real snowboarders hate that word; it's either \"snowboarding\", or \"riding\". The injuries Skiing: No longer lives up to its \"break a leg\" reputation, but still keeps plenty of knee surgeons in golf-club fees, mainly due to the ubiquitous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures. In addition, upper body and head injuries, caused by collisions with other piste users or trees, are increasing as pistes get busier and better equipment makes people ski more confidently - and faster. Snowboarding: Much safer for leg injuries, although the ankles sometimes suffer. But upper body injuries are frequent. If you stack on the frontside, you may break your wrist or collarbone. If you slam backwards, your coxyx (\"tailbone\") could snap. Avalanche danger Skiing: The media coverage of freeride events is motivating more skiers to go off-piste. Even in the (relatively) safety of North America, more skiers are choosing to exit the ski areas through the backcountry gates, and take their chances. Snowboarding: For many years, snowboarders were the avalanche bogeymen. There is no doubt that snowboards make it easy for inexperienced riders to go off-piste, with little experience or mountain savvy. It's all a matter of education, and there are now special signs on the slopes in Austria, bearing the slogan: \"It's not cool to kill friends\". Hope this helps with the question you have about which is better, for me it\u2019s skiing but I enjoy them both :) Regards, Frank V. Ski, Snow and Blog enthusiast at snowgaper.com ",

            "answer_text": "I started out skiing but then switched to snowboarding. While skiing is easier to learn, it is harder to achieve a very high level of skill. Skiing has some very strong advantages in the backcountry over snowboarding, even split-boarding, particularly while navigating terrain that is relatively flat or has a lot of short ascents and descents. In general, skiing is more tiring; snowboarding does not require as much physical effort. But the question was not about mobility or learning the sport, or which is more physically demanding; it was about fun. Hiking uphill with climbing skins, splitboarding and skiing are VERY similar. Descending on a snowboard, I can navigate extremely steep terrain and tight trees. I can lean back and surf through unbroken snow with my arms unencumbered, which is one of the greatest feelings I have experienced. I can ride through a field of moguls and thoroughly enjoy the rhythmic turning, even if it\u2019s a little icy (I\u2019m in the northeastern USA - we get a lot of ice!). I have done both sports, and both are really fun, but I have a strong preference for snowboarding. ",
