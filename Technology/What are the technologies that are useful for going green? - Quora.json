Civil Engineering - Green building encompasses everything from the design oa building and the choice of building materials to where a building is located so as to have the least impact on the environment. Chemistry - The design, development and application of chemical products and processes to reduce or to eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances. Nanotechnology - involves the manipulation of materials at the scale of the nanometer - one billionth of a meter. Scientists believe that mastery of this field is evolving that will transform the way that everything in the world is manufactured. \"Green nanotechnology\" is the application of green chemistry and green engineering principles to this field. Recycling - convert waste into reusable material. ",

            "answer_text": "The technologies which are useful to Go Green are: We can see all over the world people trying to save more electricity power and now slowly moving towards Go Green. One new technology product which we are launching soon is Deskpod. It essentially has all the functions of a CPU and more. It is a small device that can fit in the palm. It solves the SPMS Failure, OS failure etc and many such issues but the main attractive benefit is that Deskpod consumes only 5 to 10 watt and saves so much power for the future Generation. So move from Desktop to Deskpod and go green.  ",
