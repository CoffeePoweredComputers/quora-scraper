            "answer_text": "By repetition 100% yes especially commercial main stream music.It can manipulate your entire life and choices if you are weak minded enough. Ever got a song stuck in your head that you can't get out ?  You remember all you hear subconscious pick up everything how are song lyrics any different from suggestions. For example \"I wanna party all night sleep all day\" (great for business that song) , \"you can find me in the club bottle full of bud\" (budwieser sales went up just a guess, but i would put money on it)  I also think as a DJ myself I can definitely see some of  the girls mood change when you play sexy song their character changes with it, or possibly comes out from hiding. I have also noticed that the general population are manipulated into liking music they never heard through media, friends, whats cool etc. Before they have heard it. If i were a nutter id say we being guided as a race by mainstream. What people to be music is not music in many occasions it is advertising and suggestion. I find that you can manipulate crowds into certain things by using playing certain songs and aiming them at certain people to hook up groups of people and make my night more interesting for example: For example a girl dancing a guy approaches for a dance. No interest whatsoever from her couldn't care less. Then Dirrrty by Christina Aguilera come on she on him in 5 secs flat raring to go like that was her cue to be slutty. It really seems like a pre programmed response especially when intoxicated. This happens a lot with so many song fights breaking out when angry music is played. Also think about if you say out loud i need a drink 5 times ill put money on it your mouth starts watering. Fat girls singing along to don't wish your girlfriend was hot like me 10 mins later they are walking round like they are Shakira i see this all night every night. This is why its so hard for amazingly talented people with strong ideals and individuality to get a record deal these days, and so easy for puppets, who can be easily controlled get the songs written for them told how to dress because its propaganda this is what is cool now this is what you will like this is what you will do because music can change the world and i believe it has already and will continue to for as long as we don't listen. Listen to music without words or with inspirational ones would be my advice. The beatles would be out of factor 1st round, so would bob dylan, bob marley too. ",

            "answer_text": "It varies. Some people have \"amusicalia\" and music sounds like random sounds to them. Some deaf people dance to rhythms they feel throb through their bodies. Some, like me, swoon helplessly to Dvorak. C&W makes me puke. Once in HS I played Pachabel's Cannon in D to a redneck dude who listened politely for a moment and then asked me when it started. My daughter wasn't particularly interested in classical music until, at age 25 when she heard some Vivaldi on the radio she'd heard a thousand times growing up and never notices. She had to pull over because her tears made it impossible to drive. When she was six she could sing every one of Brittany whazzername's \"songs\".... One's reactions to music has something to do with maturity. A member of a \"first contact\" anthropologist team that went to Papua NG  many decades ago tried playing the natives some Beethoven using a wind-up phonograph. The natives laughed hysterically. In other words, it's cultural.  Xtmas muzak in Sept. drives everyone nuts; it's situational/context. It's amazing. ",
