            "answer_text": "All Samsung products have a standard 1 YEAR WARRANTY which does NOT include physical damage OR water damage, unless it was not your fault (they will inspect it and make a determination). They will still provide customer support for ALL Samsung devices.. you can either chat with them using live chat on their website or visit a Samsung/Best Buy pop-up store where you can get free in person support from a Samsung representative (it's called the Samsung Experience Shop or Store inside Best Buy). However, after the warranty period, repairs are no longer free. They know when you first use the phone, the phone has a serial number and when you connect to the internet, Samsung knows the phone was activated and used. Typically Samsung will only repair phones no older than 4 generations.. so the Galaxy S5 or below is completely finished, they do not have any more repair parts for the phone and they will no longer fix that phone (though it's still possible to get it repaired from a 3rd party or yourself, Samsung will not touch it however). However, as of right now, I believe they can fix a Galaxy S6 and above\u2026 Samsung actually has contracts with 3rd party repair companies UBIF (UBreakifix) in which you can get your phone repaired locally at no charge if it's still under Samsung warranty.. if it was your fault that you broke it, you can pay to get it fixed here and they use official Samsung parts and it also does not void the warranty. Samsung also has a new support membership called Samsung Premium Care which is like INSURANCE plus in home customer service so you can have your phone swapped and replaced very quickly via 1 day mail shipping if you have a broken screen phone.. they even will send a person over to your house to help you with your phone. I forgot how much the membership costs but I think it was like $11.99 per month which is actually very good considering how expensive it is to repair a broken screen phone. There are a lot of details I didn't include so you should check their website for more info. There's a Samsung Care app (formerly Samsung+) on the new Samsung phones which has ALL you need to know about Samsung customer service and it will let you know your warranty status as well and it has community forums and live chat in it as well, and give you the nearest location of an authorized Samsung 3rd party repair shop. You can always go to the Samsung pop up store inside Best Buy anytime, there's always a Samsung representative there to help. They even do free software updates there on their special computer\u2026 they'll help anyone, no matter what Samsung phone they have or how old it is. ",

            "answer_text": "Roberto Santocho is mistaken Samsung give two OS updates but they give security patches for 3 years. For example, My daughters Galaxy S7 edge come out in February 2016 and is on Android security patch level 1 February 2019 same as my Galaxy S9+ and is using Android Oreo one Android version earlier than the S9+. The other often overlooked member of this equation is the carrier you use they control the OTA updates and not all choose to update the devices on their network. ",
