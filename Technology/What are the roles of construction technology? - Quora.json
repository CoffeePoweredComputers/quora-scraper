            "answer_text": "Construction is one of the largest industries on the planet, and as such is responsible for generating millions of jobs, contributing decisively to the advancement of society. The technology in the civil construction has been evolving every day and is the differential in the search of the efficiency and productivity of the sector. The technology allows a more rational use of time, material and manpower , since it speeds up and assists in the management of the various fronts of a work, both in the project and budget phases as in the execution. If you want to know more about construction technology, visit this article . Technology in the design phase In the design phase, modern software no longer only allows drawing, but allows visualizations in three dimensions, with minimal constructive details, avoiding unforeseen during the execution. In addition, modern CAD / CAM (Computer Aided Design) software enables structural calculations, loading and deformation simulations, vibrations, heat effects, and various other auxiliary modules. Modern rendering applications allow simulated visualizations both external and internal constructions, flow of people, objects and materials, as well as virtualized decoration and finishing, so that the client can choose in detail how the finished work will be. The technology in the management of the work and the schedule In time management there is a real revolution in the use of technology in construction. The works management applications allow the construction manager, engineer or manager to control the construction stages in detail.  The management of the work using the modern technologies available, favors the ordering in the supply flow of material and inputs, besides allowing to allocate the appropriate type and quantity of labor for each stage. Thus, it has the condition to make more effective use of the work force, of the space of the bed and of the materials, avoiding wastes and loss . The technology present in the execution of the work In execution, modern tools bring unprecedented benefits as they help prevent errors in execution that most often end up resulting in rework. Laser leveler, micro-processed concrete vibrator, computerized winch and sensors to prevent accidents, modern safety equipment, which are more comfortable and safe, everything is technology in construction. Technology in construction is part of a change of culture, where seeking the most modern does not only mean costs, but is also investment, with excellent opportunities to improve productivity, making time, intelligence and efficiency work in your favor. It allows to avoid failures and errors in the work, from the design of the architecture to the acquisition and application of the material. A new culture in construction Technology enables a change of perspective of the entire productive sector. Being up to date on modern practices and tools is no longer an option, it is a requirement. Modernity is now, and you can not see evolution as something that will happen tomorrow, because it has knocked on the door for some time. Anyone who wants to join or stay in the market needs to have mastery and make use of technology, which is the stepping stone to any successful enterprise. Control, discipline and an open mind to what is most modern, efficient and sustainable in terms of technology in construction, this is the attitude of those who want to build, above all their own success! Convinced that technology allows more than we can imagine? So leave your comment, share and stay tuned with the modernity that is already present in our day to day. ",
