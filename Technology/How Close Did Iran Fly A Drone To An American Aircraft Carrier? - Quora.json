            "answer_text": "Iranian Ababil-3 drones are capable of flying at 12,000 feet.[1] All aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf are sailing in international waters. And while each nation recognizes the sovereignty of the ship and its vertical airspace, a drone flying at the aforementioned ceiling would not be considered a threat and thus would be tolerated. Given the tensions between the United States and Iran over sanctions, and the importance of the Strait of Hormuz as an international shipping lane, it is not uncommon for traffic to be monitored by either side. Further, Iran is not about to repeat past confrontations that occurred in 1988, leading to a one-day naval battle in the Gulf. In the early morning hours of April 29, 1998, the United States struck two Iranian oil platforms in the southern Gulf, a response to Iran\u2019s mining of the Strait that had damaged a U.S. frigate. A confrontation ensued in which the U.S. Navy sank or heavily damaged six Iranian warships, escalating what had been a war of nerves up to that point.[2] [1] Iran Guard used drone to monitor US carrier Eisenhower in the Persian Gulf, report says [2] U.S. Sinks or Damages 6 Iran Ships in Persian Gulf Clashes : Tehran Strikes Back After Oil Rig Shellings ",

            "answer_text": "Not very. The carrier is considered as sovereign U.S. territory that means all airspace around it is off limits without permission. Not sure how high up that goes but the drone could probably be flown above some ceiling altitude that would be ok within international law. If the drone gets to low and enters the exclusion zone then the carrier would be with in its rights to shoot it down. ",

The Iranians have every right to protect and monitor potential aggressors on or near their territory especially one that has declared a severe economic war upon them and for what reason - because they were complying with a US backed UNSC approved nuclear agreement. Since when do responsible authorities or states (especially one which is a veto holding permanent member of the UNSC) go to war with a law abiding country? ",
