            "answer_text": "Thanks to Helon Hara for this question. If you want understand mind operating, you must forget the deterministic pattern. Deterministic pattern is similar to a straight line, mind operating pattern is similar to a circle. Deterministic pattern has a beginning and an end, mind operating patterns are made of \u201cloops\u201d, each of them is made by six step and each steps needs that the other five steps has been accomplished, then you can never say which is the first. This is a difficult concept to understand because it does not respect the \u201ctime existence\u201d, but a part of mind working is really \u201cout of time concept\u201d. Example gratia, the rational intelligence has these six steps: perception, attention, thinking, outside, culture, meanings\u2026 perception, ecc. Emotional and existential intelligence have different steps. Many mind activities are made of loops made of further steps (even six or three, it depends from the kind of description you choose). Describing each steps needs a consistent amount of time. Mind working does not rest on deterministic patterns, it rests on loops. Then the right response to you answer is \u201cever both at the same time\u201d. Is it not the answer you were waiting for? What I wrote could seem a fake? Sorry, don\u2019t blame me, an other Man created Universe, I can only describe it. :-) 30\u201312\u20132019 ",

            "answer_text": "Let me put it this way, there is nothing that exists in our reality right now that did not first begin in the imagination. It may seem in some areas that imagination has diminished but this is mostly friction caused by some who would have us behave a certain way, that is to say obdient to a system of control. They hide creativity well, but it is not gone by any stretch. It lies deep in the hearts of everyone alive. All that is necessary to see it is to feed it your passions. ",
