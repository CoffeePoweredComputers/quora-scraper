            "answer_text": "Acceptance is not as important as to recognise what to accept and how you accept your own acceptance or non acceptance towards something. As long as you are ok with your acceptance or non acceptance -: that doesn\u2019t matter you accept the situations, people, circumstances around you or no. It\u2019s as clear as you like Indian food so you eat it and you don\u2019t like Chinese food so you don\u2019t eat it. Fight starts where you are trying to like or accept Chinese food but not able to. Generally people accept things which suit their set of mind and definition of happiness. Chaos comes when there are things which don\u2019t go by their definition of peace and happiness. Here choice is absolutely of an individual- he/she may accept unwanted situation and let it be its way. He/ she may accept unwanted situation and decides to take action for it or work upon it to take it to a level that it doesn\u2019t bother you. those who chose to take action may not get the results, here also he is again on the same pedestal that weather to accept or not accept the situation, but there also acceptance and non acceptance doesn\u2019t matter, what matters is where person finds the peace. Peace is not in acceptance or non acceptance. Peace lies in being comfortable with your acceptance or non acceptance. E.g - if you don\u2019t accept steeling, lies, manipulation of facts of selfish reasons. Then here you are peaceful with your non acceptance of wrong things. So check how comfortable you are in acceptance and non acceptance of things. Accept your non acceptance towards the things you don\u2019t like and work towards its betterment, if you don\u2019t get results then change the way or find the ways where you are untouched of its impact. E.g - there is so much competition in engineering and you can\u2019t excel as you are an average student for engineering. Change profession or stream which you enjoy and you can excel too. Here no compititiOn can scare you because you know you can excel. It\u2019s not every time necessary to change the people, situations, things but to change only place or self to see things from a different angle. Acceptance and non acceotance both are important along with personal acceptance for both. ",
