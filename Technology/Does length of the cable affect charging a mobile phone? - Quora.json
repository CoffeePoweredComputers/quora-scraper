            "answer_text": "In theory, a short cable would allow for faster charging (lower resistance \u2192 more amps \u2192 faster charging), but at the current we are talking about (a few AMPs typically), this is mostly inconsequential for reasonable lengths of cable. You would find far more of an effect from whether the phone is powered off (not using charge), some apps are running, if the phone data IP connection is on, etc. Of course, this is under the assumption of reasonable length \u2026 meaning that if the cable were many, many, MANY feet, then you would definitely see a bigger difference.
