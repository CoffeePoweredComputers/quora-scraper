            "answer_text": "I just changed the battery in my Cadillac which was 11 years old, never failed to start the car. It is still in use to power an inverter for lights in my shed. My lawn tractor battery is still starting my 19hp Kohler engine after 5 years. I credit my long battery life to charging all my batteries once a month with my Schumacher computerized charger. Also the Cadillac battery is under the back seat, where it is not subjected to heat and vibration. I add distilled water when I service my batteries each month. Seems like maintenance keeps all my equipment running rather than just run until they quit like many do. ",

            "answer_text": "Life of a battery depends on usage, service conditions and ambient temperature. It also depends on maintenance and charging schedule. A lead acid battery is supposed to have a life of 300 - 700 charge discharge cycles, depending on type of battery, and its maintenance. A good SLI battery in car is expected to have a life of about 4 years. ",
