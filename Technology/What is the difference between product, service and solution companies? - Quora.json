            "answer_text": "Holla !!! Let's break your question in 4 parts Starting with Dictionary definition : Product - An article or substance that is manufactured or refined for sale.Service - The action of helping or doing work for someone.Solution - A means of solving a problem or dealing with a difficult situation.Company - A commercial business (commercial means making or intended to make a profit)Now lets enumerate the real world meaning behind product, service and solution with companies : Product Company : A business that creates some product intended to make a profit out of it. eg. Google is company that created product like Gmail, Google Duo, Android Phones, Android Wear etc. Service Company : A business that work for someone intended to make a profit, the work/service is charged by hours. eg. TCS, Infosys and Wipro, They mostly work on the product/Software which is purchased by client in other words fulfill software requirements for the client. Solution Company : A business that solve a specific problem with application of a product. eg. British Telecom, Deutsche Bank, Telefonica, Vodfone, uses product and provide solution for Telecom/Banking. Small real world example to sum up all (How different companies are interlinked) : Solution Company : XYZ(Some Telecom Company) Product Company : Netcracker Service Company : TCS XYZ need some telecom product for Providing Telecom solution to Customer. Netcracker will provide Telecom product to XYZ. TCS will work on the product purchased by XYZ from Netcracker and generate revenue to XYZ(In short TCS provides Technical solutions to XYZ).
