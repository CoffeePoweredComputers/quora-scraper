            "answer_text": "Well the right time to buy is \u201c when you need one\u201d i just bought a MacBook pro about 3 weeks back. But if i understand your question if its the right time to buy then i have 2 question for you How long can you wait till you absolutely need to buy one.Is the delay due to move fro intel to apple silicon.OK so let me give you my insight.. i have been a mac user from 2006. For me the options were not a MacBook pro or a windows laptop .. for me the choice was MacBook pro now or next launch. My last MacBook pro was the Mid 2014 15\u2033 which was working great i had decided to buy the new MacBook pro 2020 and apple made the announcement to move to apple silicon.. there by making me take a relook at my decision. Well i thought 1 question till when can i hold off buy a new MacBook pro. and if my answer was anywhere before sep 2022 then it was better to buy one now. Apple will support the current mac for at least 5\u20136 years.if apple released a new MacBook pro running on apple silicon in 2021 i dont want to be the ones among the first batch when a significant move has taken place.I didn't want to but the Macbook pro on apple silicon as soon as they are released rather the second version of the same which will most earliest be mid to late 2022.. that's was not the timeframe i could wait and continue using my mid 2014 macbooks pro so i bought the MacBook pro 2020 version. Well this will keep me company for at least 4\u20135 years.. so i will be looking for my next MacBook somewhere around 2024 -25 if all goes well. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. If it were for myself I would wait until around 2023 when the macbook chips get really powerful. Next year theyre adding apple silicon and that probably wont be great 1st gen. This years macbook pros arent very different to last year and they use 8th gen chips unless you spend thousands. Also they only have DDR3 ram. Buy the second variant of the macbook air or wait a couple years to buy the pro. ",
