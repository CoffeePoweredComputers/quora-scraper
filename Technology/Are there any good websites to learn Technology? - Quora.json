A list of top alternative sites can be found here. From that list, I\u2019ve used Alison, Udacity and Lynda. From those 3 I found that Lynda\u2019s tutors were a bit more clear with their explanations but me saying that doesn\u2019t mean much as it all depends on the person, it\u2019s a personal opinion. Generally, I was pleased with all of them but I still have Udemy as a first choice though. ",
