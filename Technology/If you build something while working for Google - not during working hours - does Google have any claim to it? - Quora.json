What is the exact language in your employment contract?Are there non-compete clauses? Are there intellectual property assignments? I've seen employment contracts which state that anything you build \"related to the business\" of your employer is automatically their intellectual property for as long as you're an employee of theirs. 2. What state (or country) are you in?Different jurisdictions have been known to honor employment contracts with varying degrees of strictness. Thus, whether you own your work might come down to what state the case it heard in. Intellectual property tends to be nebulous when it comes to who owns it.  Your employer wants to make sure they never have an employee \"go rogue\" with their propriety information, so most have a very broad definition of what they own. Whereas to you, it only seems right that your employer owns what you do from 9-5 on weekdays and the rest is your own. You can see how easy it would be for conflict to arise...  Bottom line: You should review your decision with a lawyer before you invest too much more time, energy and capital into \"your\" side project. ",

This applies especially if you discuss the work with co-workers or the code is relevant to your day job.Google has enforced these IP rules in the past, and some settlements have included giving Google a perpetual license to the IP. Many Googlers have internet reimbursement by Google, and many Googlers do not even own a personal machine. Needless to say, either of those conditions will mean that Google will own your IP. If you intend to work on your own code that will have financial significance (i.e., not open source), then you should own your own machine and pay for your own internet connection, in addition to meticulously documenting when you worked on your own ideas (a spreadsheet that's consistently updated with a version history will do).
