They have the full warranty and have no blemishes or scratches, and function like brand new products. Please search before asking, Johnanth Fallie. This question has already been asked and answered on Quora multiple times. Each time you ask a duplicate question you not only cause extra work for other Quora users who have to merge your duplicate question with existing ones, but you also miss out by not reading existing answers to that question - answers that might be very helpful to you. I\u2019ll go ahead and merge this one for you, but please search before asking in the future. On behalf of the Quora community, thanks in advance for your attention to this matter. ",

Plus, according to their website, it also will contain a new battery and new back shell. You're essentially getting a brand new device. Like a new device, you also get good coverage from Apple for the first 3 months and the option for AppleCare+ to extend that. All of that is essentially the same as a new device. The only difference? The price. ",

Think of the refurb as a new product that has gone through an additional round of quality control. Apple is giving it the same warranty as a new machine, and they are giving you a discount. It's a no-brainer. ",

Factory brand new devices are assembled at the factory out of new parts which are thoroughly tested and go through rigorous quality control, then tested, packaged, and sold the customer.  Factory refurbished products are disassembled, all defective parts are replaced or repaired, the device goes through the same rigorous quality control, maybe even more, tested, packaged, and sold/given to the customer. There is functionally no difference. Refurbished machines can have no physical defects or wear and tear and are essentially brand new. This goes for the refurbished devices that they sell and the ones they use as in repairs. ",

Anyway, before taking delivery and accepting the delivery without any review, please check the condition of the product and check properly and if possible make a video while doing so and be satisfied with it only accept the product after it is done. Even a few days ago I bought a refurbished iPhone from Zanooz which I liked very much. Even, according to their website, the phone has a new battery and a new back shell. So we are essentially getting a new device because they are supervised by experts. They provide the 12 months warranty and 3months good coverage facility just like a new device. ",
