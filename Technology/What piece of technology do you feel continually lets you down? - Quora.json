            "answer_text": "Wireless internet. It can never be as fast as wired, frequently lags connecting, can cause issues when switching between access points on the same network (like walking though a house with two AP's) and sometimes has trouble connecting even with a strong signal. While it does generally work and provides functionality for a variety of primarily mobile devices, it needs vast improvement to reach the level of speed and reliability that wired Ethernet provides, and I'm frequently frustrated with it's performance even doing something as mundane as reading articles, whether I'm at home, work, or Starbucks. It doesn't help that the marketing people frequently tout their wireless hardware at vastly inflated speeds, such as 500 Mbps for 802.11n or 1900 Mbps for 802.11ac. In the real world, nobody experiences speeds even a tenth of that most times. But the greater issue beyond speed is reliability, and the ability to transition between access points (or IP addresses) while loading content need to be addressed before I'm satisfied with wireless connectivity and the technology behind it.

            "answer_text": "Clever kitchen appliances. They get thrashed day in and day out in a dirty, wet, hot environment, and every year or so I have to replace one of them. The last replacement was the microwave - someone used it as timer for baking, but forgot to set it to Timer instead of Cook. Oops, another one bites the dust, but not my fault this time. Before that was the steamer - the plastic parts just can\u2019t cope with being steamed then dish-washed three times a week, plus the LCD stopped working, so we had to guess what it was doing. Next may be the kettle - it\u2019s a clever one which depends on the electrical contacts between the kettle and its base being good, and they are slowly deteriorating, so it quits half way through boiling. Or maybe the espresso machine - sometimes it forgets to stop expressing. That I don\u2019t understand at all. ",
