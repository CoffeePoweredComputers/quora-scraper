            "answer_text": "I highly recommend everyone that isn't comfortable building a PC themselves look at BLD - Custom Gaming PCs by NZXT. They use off the shelf components (meaning you could built the exact same PCs they offer, no proprietary or hard to find components are used), they are fairly priced- only charging a $100 build fee, all PCs are built to order, they are guaranteed to perform within 10% of what they quote and they build and ship it in I believe 48 hours. The only downsides are they charge MSRP so no sales pricing, they dont have all brands so if you want say a Corsair PSU or case- sorry they dont carry Corsair and they only use their brand for cases and water cooling. They are good products, just some people might want a different brand. ",
