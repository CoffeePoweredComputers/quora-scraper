            "answer_text": "Depends on the model of the MacBook. Theoretically you should be able to. If you have a MacBook with the USB-C ports, then you\u2019ll need a dongle or what I call a \u201cconverter\u201d to convert from USB-C to a traditional USB port. Then you should be able to use a regular mouse you buy from your electronics store. If you have a MacBook that has the traditional USB ports, you can just plug in your regular wired mouse. If you\u2019re talking about a wireless mouse, it\u2019s pretty much the same since you still have to plug in that little USB adapter thing. Moreover, Apple\u2019s Magic Mouse can be paired with any Mac so you should also be good with that. ",

            "answer_text": "If it has a USB connection then yes. The new Mac will require the use of an adaptor because Apple in it\u2019s infinite wisdom decided to exclusively use USB C ports, to which there are almost no devices that will directly connect. It\u2019s part of the reason I have no interest in upgrading from my older MacBook Pro\u2019s, and when I needed another I bought a 2015 model both because of price and more importantly because I needed standard USB connectors and don\u2019t want to use adaptors.
