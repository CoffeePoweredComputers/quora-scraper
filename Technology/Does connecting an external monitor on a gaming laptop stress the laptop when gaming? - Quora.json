            "answer_text": "Assuming the external monitor has the same specifications - or less - as the built in monitor\u2026 no, the GPU doesn\u2019t care which monitor it outputs to. If however you buy an external monitor with higher specs then yes, the GPU has to work harder. I have a laptop with a GTX1080 GPU and a screen with a 1920x1080 resolution and 144hz refresh. I bought a new monitor with 2560x1080 resolution and 144hz refresh which has 33% more pixels to it\u2019s width (for games that support ultrawide resolutions, not all do) and so the GPU has to work 1.33 times as hard to produce the display. The SIZE of the monitor matters not to the GPU, but the RESOLUTION (the number of dots) and REFRESH (how often those dots are updated) do. And of course if you extend your display across both of them then you!re doubling the width of the resolution\u2026 so doubling it\u2019s workload. Most people don\u2019t do that while gaming though (though in fairness for a while I ran three monitors while gaming\u2026 that was huge). ",

            "answer_text": "Asupam is completely correct. If you are simply playing your game on a bigger monitor and are either cloning your display or having your laptop lid closed (thus only using the external monitor) then there will be 0% extra processing on the gpu (or any other part of the laptop). If you extending the display but gaming on one monitor then there will be a slight hit. How slight completely depends on the specs of the laptop which was not specified. If you are gaming on both screens then there will be a much large load on the laptop gpu. Again how much completely depends on the specs of the laptop. ADDED:I also wanted to add that if your external monitor is higher resolution, then gaming on that monitor would cause extra strain. If you have a low end \u201cgaming\u201d laptop with 1386x768 resolution (which is going to have a lower end GPU), then gaming on a 1920x1080p monitor (at 1080p resolution) will be more stress on the laptop. Same thing goes for 2K or 4K monitor on a 1080p laptop. ",
