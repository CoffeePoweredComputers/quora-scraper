            "answer_text": "First, the proper terminology for handwriting recognition is ICR (Intelligent Character Recognition).  When OCR term is used, usually it implies a broader area of image processing, usually around machine printed fonts.Intelligent character recognition on Wiki Second, it is important to clarify what type of handwriting we are discussing.  There are two types.  First type is \"handwriting\" as you might see in a manuscript or notes on white sheet of paper, which is cursive interconnected letters combined into whole words.  Second type is \"handprint\" as you might see on DMV forms and credit card applications, which consists of separate block letters written by hand, usually in some kind of boxed field or framed area.  Key distinction of handprint is that each character is usually separate and not connected to next character. There are many good packages on the market for handprint recognition, and they do produce relatively high quality of text, which in turn makes them worthwhile to consider for wide business applications.  Typical examples include fixed forms processing, such as processing surveys, various applications, questionnaires, tests, and fill-in-the-blank types of forms (not really a blank, more like a box).  Usually each field contains specific content, such as a date, name, address, etc.  Knowing the content type helps to increase ICR quality, because, for example, if we are processing a date field, we know it cannot contain letters like O or I since they are more likely  0 or 1, respectively.  The package I most frequently use for such projects with handprint test is ABBYY FlexiCapture (WiseTrend >> Form Processing & Data Capture >> ABBYY FlexiCapture). For true handwriting recognition, I am yet to find good software.  I know of software applications that excel well in specific content handwriting recognition, such as Parascript for addresses on envelopes, but if you require to process a handwritten page of non-specific type text, like a manuscript, that would be a challenge that most likely would require substantial manual corrections even after some good ICR application.  ilya ",

Programs such as ABBYY and TeleForm are really good an converting writing when the written words are in constrained text boxes or coned fields that make each character easier to recognize. If you are looking for something that can recognize say a dollar amount from a check or a city, state zipcode combination on a for that is hand written our best chances are with a program called A2IA. A2IA is the industry leader in handwriting recognition. My experience with A2IA was in conjunction with third party tools and we had name dictionaries, city/state dictionaries and the results where much better when implemented with those dictionaries.
