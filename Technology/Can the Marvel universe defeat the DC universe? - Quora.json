            "answer_text": "Well\u2026.NO. DC characters are really strong but some are confusing like lobo, cyborg Superman, and mongul. They show amazing feats of strength but when faced against a weaker character, they loose. For example, cyborg Superman beat 4 supermen (2 who are stronger than the original man of steel)  And yet still lost to the man of steel even with the help of mongul. He even lost against green lantern, who can be literally flicked by anyone.  DC comics characters aren\u2019t stronger than marvels. Marvel has more all-father type figures. DC\u2019s all-fathers consist of very few new gods and 31st century heroes. Also some other heroes of the future like Wonder Woman of the year 85,271 (if she was a threat to big barda, then she is all-father level). But that\u2019s in the future. The strongest characters in the current timeline of DC are the spiritual characters, the supermen, and Batman. But Superman\u2019s strongest punch feat isn\u2019t enough either. He punched a planet using speed blitz and it exploded. The explosion made Superman faint.  But don\u2019t let dc fool you cuz marvel characters destroyed planets even before Superman did WITHOUT FAINTING!!!  Gladiator one punches a planet..,.  Hulk via rocket boosters (no world breaker).  Thor with Mjolnir and Beta Ray Bill in his way\u2026. U see so marvel characters are OP. Some people (such as me) misunderstand that DC doesn\u2019t overpower their characters!!! They make them seem overpowered by giving them almost every superpower. Cosmic Superman has super strength, super speed, super senses, laser eyes, freezing breath, cosmic manipulation, cosmic blasts, and reality warping. Almost every single power but yet Dr. Strange, Dormammu, or galactus have a chance of beating him. Marvel makes their characters with one or 2 specific powers so they can make more characters. Even though they have less powers than that of DC, they are stronger. Didn\u2019t you guys realize that there are almost 45 known characters in DC comics who have the same powers and history of Superman. There are 6 million that are unknown (survivors of kandor). And almost every single character has super speed. That\u2019s what marvel doesn\u2019t want although they failed since they made some copies of hulk, but they didn\u2019t fail at the same time, giving each hulk a specific power or history. Marvel has more variety which makes marvel have more characters. Marvel copied DC\u2019s heroes with less powers but with the weakness or something that could stop their DC counterpart. Like Wade and Slade.  Deadpool is weaker than his counterpart but u know why Slade cant stop him??? Because of his healing factor. It would be a long battle, but Deadpool would find an open spot and stab Slade. In fact Deathstroke was made before Deadpool. Also with Super Skrull and Martian Manhunter.  Super Skrull can beat MMH not because of his phobia of fire (because he got rid of the phobia 10 years ago), but because if a Martian from mars would get blasted by SS scorching hot fire, they would die. If a Martian were to live in Mars it would be accustomed to living in temperatures from -195 degrees F to 70 degrees F. 70 degrees for them would be 130 for us. So they wouldn\u2019t be used to fire. Fire would give them 4th degree burns which is impossible. Ontop of that Kl\u2019rt can block J\u2019onzz telekinesis with invisible woman\u2019s powers and possibly turn MM\u2019s brain into stew by creating a force field inside. Some of you might say that the force field won\u2019t work, but look what sue did to she hulk\u2026.  So Kl\u2019rt would beat J\u2019onzz. Some people don\u2019t know if The sentry can defeat Superman (I think it\u2019s stalemate) but that\u2019s why marvel created the void. Void is a team buster. Void is capable of stalematimg or beating MMH who can beat Superman. Ok you might say Spectre, or Anti-monitor are strong. Let\u2019s use COIE anti monitor. Hmmm let\u2019s see. Dark celestial galactus can beat or stalemate him. It is said he destroyed numerous universes just like AM. SCW AM is just trash so he dies to reg galactus. And don\u2019t underestimate galactus. Other versions of galactus can beat anti-monitor. He barely flicked Odin and thanos!!! (Unless you count his helmet being ruined).    Spectre would loose to the 2nd strongest being in the marvel universe (living tribunal). For gods sake he was controlled by a black lantern ring!!! Proof he ain\u2019t all that. Doomsday would loose to space punisher hulk, Destroyer, Mangog, Zom, Surtur, etc. I know I know don\u2019t put in the comments \u201cdoomsday comes back to life stronger than he was before\u201d and blah blah blah. I know that already. I\u2019m talking about their first battle in this case not second although mangog could beat doomsday in their second battle since he feeds and gains more power off of anger and hate\u2026..so marvel wins.

            "answer_text": "I never really liked this question even when I was younger because it really comes down to a popularity contest and who has the better plot armor. DC vs Marvel was a prime example of this. Fans were told of this and allowed to vote for who would win. This meant that the most illogical things could happen. CBR did an article on this. Victories like Aquaman dropping a killer whale on Namor and winning is beyond ridiculous when he has beaten people like the Hulk and only lost his head (RIP Namor) to Hyperion who some consider to be Marvel's Superman. Wolverine beating Lobo when Love has beaten gods and devils. Not a chance. So much bad writing for the fans sake. The pairing up was equally bad. Sure Flash and Quicksilver sounds like a no brainer at first but there is an obvious there. They should have had Batman vs Wolverine. The reality is to look at the numbers. DC has been around longer. They simply have greater numbers. It might come down to some major players like Spectre vs Eternity but, DC has more characters at a ratio of almost 6:1. That's not a fight. That's a beat down. ",

Honestly, someone who gets into \u201cwhats better/more powerful\u201d arguments between the two biggest comics companies either doesnt read comics and as asking from ignorance, or has issues. True fans of comic books enjoy both, depending on who\u2019s writing and drawing, what the story is and the habits of the EIC\u2019s for both. Or are we talking about sales and popularity? If so, its still a tossup. DC often has better rated comics than Marvel (story and/or art), though Marvel has pulled off some major winners. Over the last two decades in terms of sales Marvel has topped DC\u2026in the last decade they have dominated DC for share. Both publishers have their strong points and issues, and both have something to offer to readers. After 50 years of reading comics, wanna know who my favorite is? Easy answer: sometimes its Marvel, other times its DC, sometimes its even Vertigo or Image or Dark Horse. You are actually allowed to like both corn and flour tortillas. If you absolutely love the programming on FX its still OK to watch AMC. It doesnt have to be a pissing contest. ",

Marvel has characters such as The One-Above-All, Fulcrum, Beyonder, Living Tribunal, Cosmic Immortal Hulk, The One Below All, Thanos (HOTU, God Quarry, or Regulator). But DC has even more characters that powerful. They have characters more powerful than most of the ones I just name. A few of them are Lucifer Morningstar, Gabriel Hornblower, Michael Demiurgos, Great Evil Beast, Elaine Belloc, and The Presence. In this battle, characters like Thor, Superman, Sentry, and Shazam don\u2019t matter. But characters that are incredibly powerful do matter. ",

DC has three stand-ins for God: Elaine Belloc  The Presence  And The Great Evil Beast(Dark version of The Presence)  to Marvels 1 and a half: The One Above All. Possibly Stan Lee.  And the Fulcrum. Possibly Jack Kirby(Some say TOAAs equal, some say just an aspect of him).  Ezra Eastling's answer to Who are the 10 most powerful comic characters across both comic franchise's universes (DC and Marvel)?DC has MANY more Superman allegories/clones, and their cosmic landscape, while not as thorough, is MUCH more powerful. With the likes of Lucifer Morningstar,  Ezra Eastling's answer to Who would win, The One Below All (Marvel) vs Lucifer Morningstar (DC)?Michael Demiurgos,  and Dr. Manhattan,  a Metaversal Reality Warper, all of which have no equals and are the three most powerful nigh-omnipotent beings across both publications. DC. By a wide margin. ",
