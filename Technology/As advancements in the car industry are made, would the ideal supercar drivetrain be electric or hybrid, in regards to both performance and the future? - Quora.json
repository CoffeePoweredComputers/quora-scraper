            "answer_text": "Super cars are dumb. They are illegal to drive at the design speed so why design a car that cannot be driven that way? Same for off-roading. Why design a truck to go off road when it will be driven on the pavement 99.99% of the miles driven? Once the beginning spec for modern cars are written up the need for a thousand horsepower is negated and actually humorous. Making the laws allow for 180 mph using only 30.5 hp is the challenge to dual mode EV advancements. Once we get the power defined and under control, high speed safe travel on a guideway that does not let the cars flip over or leave the path, then battery electric with 40 mph battery swap is the best solution. Travel door to door in one private cabin in A/C comfort, beats noisy super car exhaust pollution needing to be re-tuned ever so often. I had a Jag once. I spent more time under that car than in it. Super cars tend to need maintenance, check the owner\u2019s manual. Stay on the road to avoid the off road issues and buy a race motorcycle for dirt. If you stick it in the mud you can pick it up and go again. When you buy a four-wheeler truck you can go deeper into the woods before you get stuck and have to hike out. ",

            "answer_text": "As advancements in the car industry are made, would the ideal supercar drivetrain be electric or hybrid, in regards to both performance and the future? I\u2019d wager they\u2019ll be BEVs. Hybrids (in \u201cnormal\u201d cars) were a useful transitional phase, something that eased the population towards EVs at a time when range was typically very poor. Today, range is far less of a problem with most new cars topping 250 miles and those ranges will increase very quickly, in a matter of years making \u201crange anxiety\u201d cease to be an issue. Without the concern of range, a hybrid really makes no sense. If the batteries can do everything you want the car to do, why carry a heavy ICE, and lose space to the engine, its fuel tank and associated control systems, especially in a supercar where reducing weight is a fanatical obsession. Porsche made a hybrid in 2013, the eye-wateringly expensive 918 (around \u00a3800k).  They now make an all electric BEV, the Taycan at the much more reasonable price of around \u00a3160k.  I\u2019d be willing to bet their next \u201csupercar\u201d will be a BEV. ",
