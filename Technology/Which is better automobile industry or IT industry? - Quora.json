            "answer_text": "It depends on what you are passionate about. For a person who is good at programming, he would love to code apps all day. And for a person who loves automobiles, would love to design/repair/research all day regardless of working conditions. But if I would to advice a teenager, i would ask him/her to choose Automobiles over IT. In IT, work culture is not emoloyee friendly in MNCs. Young joinees are forced in Mainframes, Java, Data Warehousing etc without asking them about their interests. Good coders are treated like robots and these days, IT salaries are not very luctrative as well. Automobiles is a much better field only if you are willing to work from a mechanic level and then get promoted. You need to ignore working conditions unlike AC bays in IT industries. I had a friend in Chennai, who was working with Daimler. He used to tell me a new story everyday, like testing a truck on racing track, testing engine in hot & cold conditions, testing emissions etc. Whereas I had no stories apart from new pretty girls in office. :) In IT there may be a chance that you will stick to one project for years and keep on doing the same thing everyday. But if you are in automobiles, you will be trained by the Brand about their new cars, new servicing methods, new norms, new makets to target, latest R&D results and much more. Life will not be monotonous. One has to be really passionate in Automobile to survive because they don't hire in great numbers like IT. There are high chances of you being successful in Automobile field if you work independently as well: You can start your own Garage specialising in only one brand. Provide quality service with honesty and see customers queing up.You can become a car broker and can earn anything around 2 lacs per month, if you are technically sound, don't hide things from customers and know how to get paper work done. No shortcuts here.Start a sophisticated car cleaning station by getting a franchise from 3M or any other known brand. Customers will surely queue up.Start a car blog, publish quality stuff and earn money from ads. Remember, Team-Bhp also started like this.You can open an alloy wheels showroom and wheel balancing garage. Again, be technically good to know how to get work done from labour. Honesty with customers get you long way.Both fields does have their pros and cons, it all depends on you, what you are passionate about. I have seen a \u2018pakoda\u2019 seller selling \u2018pakodas\u2019 more passionately and is happier than me. Because, he loves what he does. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey there.. Found this question popping right up in my news feed, staying in an IT city, i have been figuring it out from the past 6 years, so couldn't resist answering.. ;) You are comparing a sledgehammer to an object of finesse. The latter one being the IT, coz i dont want software engineers hunting me down on the part of calling them something related to hammer! IT, two decades ago was just another two ordinary letters in India. It's probably the most \"gone-viral\" profession of the world. People couldn't believe that some guys are earning jaw dropping kinda money over an electronic machine. Thanks to Mr Jobs and Gates. If you look at the graph( just an indication), you would see something like this..  \u200b\u200bIts been increasing over the years along with the no of software engineers. 10 guys, 10 pc's 10 chairs and one roof is all u need ! Coming to automotive engineering, it was started in 1886, driven by a single man's passion for comfortable commuters. Thanks to Karl Benz. Over the years, automobile sector have seen great rise and fall, from the introduction of racing to the great depression, it has gone through all the industrial revolutions. So when we talk about \"market saturation\" and complicated things, you bet we actually know then deep down. Also, with the age of developing machines, the man power requirement in auto sector has dropped down considerably. One more graph?  \u200b\u200b Second point which is gonna be my flagship point is that, there is almost no material cost involved in IT industry, all u need is a bunch of programmers, some pc's and 50 cents CD's and pendrives to sell the software's.In automotive, everything is production related, u need to buy sheet metals, machines for machining them, designers, manufacturing, finishing, inspection etc... So the margin of profit auto makers make compared to IT giants are really less.  Also, who doesn't wanna be near those beautiful heartthrobbing machines, pushing those engines to their limits on race tracks Right. Those bhp figures, that torquey revvs and an amazing feel when u look up on the road a car which u might have built... Or do u wanna stuck up with a pc all your life working on some program which is eventually gonna  get killed by a rich brat in his psp game?  IT guyz, no offence... :)  Cheers to both PC's and Cars!
