            "answer_text": "This is an old question, however, in today\u2019s world many changes have taken place in space. Space business is on the verge of becoming a reality, meaning people will spend currency to go into space. Obviously, this cannot be categorized as space exploration, neither could many military space initiatives. So, today we have many space enterprises and tomorrow more will develop. We need to redefine the term \u2018space exploration\u2019. Real Space Exploration Having worked deep space missions as a NASA contractor at JPL back in the 60\u2019 and 70\u2019s, any mission beyond Earth\u2019s orbit would have been considered \u2018space exploration\u2019; not true today! Even a manned mission to Mars, in my book, is not a true space exploration mission; we already explored Mars for 53 years, starting with Mariner 4 in Nov 1964. Since then, us humans had 24 successful Mars and area missions; with more planned in the future. One could surmise Mars has been Explored in these past 53 years. The game plan today is put humans on Mars, it also becoming a commercial enterprise. \u2018Real Space Exploration\u2019 today should be re-defined as space beyond the solar system; exploring interstellar space for Earth-like planets, or for reaching the stars. What advances have been made in this area since the past 53 years? Pioneer 10 & 11 and Voyager 1 & 2 All four of these spacecrafts have left the solar system and are 11, 8, 13, 10.7 billion miles respectively and approximately from Earth today. Voyager 1 the farthest out from Earth at 13 billion miles, however, it will take almost 17,000 more years before it would reach just one lightyear of distance from us. One can ascertain this 48-year-old technology is not the way to travel in interstellar space; most definitely with any humans on board. So, how can we travel in interstellar space and do some \u2018real space exploration\u2019 today; even with humans on board! What is peculiar, a group of German scientists was asking this very same question a century ago! They surmised Goddard\u2019s chemical rockets were great, and capable of probably getting to the Moon, but they wanted to go to the stars. I think today NASA and other countries with space programs proved them right. The real future space exploration will require a different technology than used 48 years ago with the Pioneer and Voyagers and others. Seeking an ET technology A hundred years ago in Germany, scientists were dreaming of going to the stars; were they just dreamers, or did they have a plan? One could say, they not only had a plan, but two potential extraterrestrial (ET) crafts to reverse engineer. So, while the U.S. space program consisted of students creating small chemical rockets to launch on weekend picnics to impress their girlfriends, the Germans were on a mission to reach the stars. Technology to win a war and control the world During the WWII years, the Third Reich provided all the resources needed to develop this technology; they believed it could be used as a weapon to both win their war, and to control the world afterwards. During the development phases of recreating those crafts, they became aware these crafts were not the total solution ETs were using to reach our solar system and Earth. Granted the crafts were a technology to outperform many aerospace capabilities over and above the current aerospace technology, but not the solution to reach the stars. A technology to get humans to the stars During the development of the crafts\u2019 technology, they stumbled (?) on a natural phenomenon being the solution to reach the stars; obviously the ETs were using it also. This natural phenomenon allowed the \u2018means\u2019 to reach the stars, but it did required technology to both initiate and control it. This being the Die Glocke technology the Third Reich was pursuing to win the war and control the world. Did they achieve their objective? It believed, close but no cigar! Leastwise in their dream of reaching the stars. I believe their launch pad, quite different than we are using today for rockets! They were looking at putting a pretty large size craft on it and sending it to the stars.  Die Glocke technology comes to America At the end of the Europe\u2019s war in 1945, the U.S. initiates Project Paper Clip, which brings close to 1,600 Nazi scientists and engineers to America to advance our technologies to meet theirs. Many areas of technology were advanced with this initiative, both military and space included (if not intensified). One would have to conclude, the means to reach the stars did not totally vanish with the war ending, doubt the Die Glocke technology had been totally discarded and humanity satisfied just continuing to play the rocket game getting into space. Just like the Nazis, the Die Glocke was a \u2018super top secret project\u2019, so would it been within any other country, including the U.S. military or space program. A technology which allows humans to reach the stars Fast forward to 1993 when a retired, top secret military contractor\u2019s director of Skunk Works giving a speech to UCLA alma mater engineers claiming, \u2018we have the means to reach the stars and the capability to take ETs back home\u2019 by using a system he alluded operates like how ESP works. Many states he was just joking, maybe; maybe not either! I say that with some experience in deep space travel, two very basic ingredients are needed to reach the stars: 1) near or beyond lightspeed, and 2) instantaneous communication between the craft and control center on earth. The director\u2019s alluded ESP-like system satisfies both these bare bone requirements and all others in getting humans to the stars. Concluding When we discuss space exploration today, one needs to move away (far away) from all the current Earth and the entire solar system environment. Both have been explored, the real, new frontier to explore lies beyond our solar system; we need to go to the stars. That same director, on his deathbed supposedly made the statement also \u2018both ETs and UFOs, both theirs and ours are real\u2019. Doubt he was joking there, should he indeed made that statement. By understanding the history of this potential technology, provides a strong possibility both ETs and UFOs exists today; possibly we, humanity, also has it. Personally, I would give humanity more credit in their capability to solve this problem of getting to the stars in a time frame of a century. I also believe Nature would never create a Universe without the means to travel through it. These assumptions makes the ESP-like system (teleportation) being most probable a natural phenomenon that the Germans discovered and created the technology to control it. This ESP-like system resides outside the taught science today and thus the whole possible reason why the \u2018open space programs\u2019 are still playing the same picnic technology game with rockets! If one way be better than another, that you may be sure is nature's way. - Aristotle ",

Simple answer but that\u2019s it. If you cant get to space you cant explore it. Everything else is incremental improvements and added capability. ",
