            "answer_text": "Its weird to be reading this, actually searching for this i didn\u2019t know what to expect. I totally connect with this dude, i mean, I've been going through the same turmoil for years(it\u2019s \u201819 as i write) and it started at college. I always felt as if i didn\u2019t belong when hanging with my peers back then, and this put me in a dark place\u2026of self loathe and all that murky stuff. Anyway, to make this short i won\u2019t go to all the gory details, I\u2019ve always thought of the past and known the exact date and time to fix, but its all a fantasy. One thing i caught up while struggling with this kind of feelings is that we all have regrets we would want to take back, and though we might be rooted to that past, we ought not to forget to live today(well, since we cant even relive yesterday), and from experience, this helps. By just focusing on today, making sure i don\u2019t make mistakes that i may regret tomorrow, but there are always slips here and there, and also trying as much as possible not to remember the past bad experiences, one ends up with a jovial mood to look at each new day. Also living in this millennial age can be quite challenging with all the social media screaming to our face how life should be, as a matter of fact this same reason i deleted my facebook account. Though i still get serious urges to rejoin and keep tabs on people, and stuff. At times I've actually even given in and then the sadness just starts flocking back in, and it reminds me why i quit in the first place. I just try to forget the past and avoid reminders, while focusing on what i got now in the sense time or whatever, cause that\u2019s all you got left. Besides i will agonize having spent yesterday regretting while i would have done something that would have made today just a bit less of a regret. The closest we get to go to the past is act on now.

            "answer_text": "Seriously, time doesnt exist it's a construct to help us understand our own lives. The universe is a serious of physical and chemical reaction happening constantly we try to measure these reaction with the passage of time. To theoretically time travel you would have to be able to freeze the whole universe pluck yourself out of the universe. Reverse every chemical and physical reaction in said universe and even if that did work with ya know people undying and people being unborn. You would have to put yourself back into said universe travel through space cause earth would have moved. And your entire life would be fucked up cause your own body was not present during reversal to put everything back like it was. If you think time repeats itself and you would just pull yourself from the universe and wait for your life to show back up\u2026 it's not your life that is another version of yourself(if you could call it that) and it would only be a imitation at best. Despite all this, a machine powerful enough to stop the universe or pull you out of the universe would infact need to be larger then said universe and reversing time would only reverse the creation of said machine making it a paradox. You can infact reverse the effect of aging with stem cell research but most of the information is covered up and would not allow you to travel time just live longer. ",
