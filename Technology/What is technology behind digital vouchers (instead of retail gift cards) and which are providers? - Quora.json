            "answer_text": "Gift cards are almost always available for multiple use, multiple product - I.e. the stored value can be used over and over again until either the card has no value or requires recharging. In the US a voucher is almost always single-use and is very often associated with a single product or service.  Depending on your implementation you could issue \"vouchers\" with something like Mobile Wallet Cloud Solutions - PassKit | Mobile Wallet Cloud Solutions | PassKit.com; but all you really need is the ability to code the voucher and have the retailer recognize the code. I would visit 45 Coupons APIs: Groupon, 8coupons and US Yellow Pages to learn more about your options on this front. ",
