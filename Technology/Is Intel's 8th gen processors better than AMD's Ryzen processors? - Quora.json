            "answer_text": "For the most part, yes. Intel\u2019s new line got a shot in the arm with extra cores and better phasing. Lets look at a few options. GamingIntel\u2019s legendary IPC has always been ahead of AMD and hence, clock for clock, the blue team is unmatched. Also intel cpus have much higher clocks and can sustain them for longer. Games depend mostly on IPC and clocks, so no surprises here. Very few games can use more than 4 cores and 4 threads. 2. Encoding and Editing This is an area where extra cores and threads flex their muscles. i8 has closed the gap due to extra cores and hyperthreading, but still is outmatched by the Ryzen chips. For video editors and media encoders, team red FTW. 3. Efficiency Both ryzen and coffee lake are big power slurpers, so not much to say. 4. Overclocking AMD has won our hearts by unlocking almost every ryzen cpu. But intel cpus are mostly locked, with only k models being overclockable. But anyway, AMD chips can only be pushed upto their boost clock as all the reviews say. If you want to go a good 1Ghz above the specified boost clock, choose intel. In short, both are excellent procs with great value for $$$. Pick yours ",

            "answer_text": "On benchmarks Intel tops each and every one except for ones that demand more core counts like Handbrake, Blender, Photoshop etc.. You need to understand this, Ryzen is a newer architecture and IDEs/AMD will optimise it further in the coming years. In real world testing you won\u2019t notice a difference in Ryzen 3,5 and 7 counterparts of Intel. If you love benchmarking then Intel is for you. If you value more features on affordable budget then AMD is wise decision. It has more PCIe lanes than Intel. I\u2019m sure ThreadRipper is the best HEDT processor when considering you\u2019re buying under a tight budget. ",
