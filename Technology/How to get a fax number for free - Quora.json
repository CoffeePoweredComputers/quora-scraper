            "answer_text": "If you already have a number available for mapping to a SIP trunk, and are familiar with Asterisk or FreePBX, you can receive a free Digium Fax for Asterisk license at Fax for Asterisk. That lets you use a DID you already lease while paying only your SIP trunk provider's termination fees. This is probably the best value for a company with modest monthly faxing volumes and a PBX server that needs only one fax number. While Google's ending of direct XMPP support for Google Talk in 2015 has complicated matters, you may be able to use a freely obtained Google Voice number with a fax machine by following the steps outlined at Faxing via Google Voice. Otherwise, if you don't need to have a persistent fax number, HelloFax and FaxZero offer free options for sending outbound faxes. ",
