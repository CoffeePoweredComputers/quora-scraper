            "answer_text": "I'm not going to get too technical here, nor use Ohm's law maths. I'm also not going to cover combined series/parallel circuits, though the concept is still the same here too.  The answer is it depends on the type of circuit. If it's a series circuit (like with many Christmas  tree lights) the current would stop. You still have voltage in the circuit (strength of the electric field) and potential, but no current flow thus no amperage (rate of electron flow in a conductor). If it's a parallel circuit you would still have current flow, but with less amperage.  Voltage can still be affected in parallel circuits too, because the size of a conductor, load and rating of a power source will lead to voltage drops in many parallel circuits. It's possible in some instances to see the other light/s get brighter by disconnecting a bulb.  You can see this effect in parallel circuits when you attempt to use a very powerful electrical power tool (a large reciprocating hammer for example), and not have it run effectively if the extension cord is too thin (too small of an AWG or metric conductor rating). You can also see this effect if you attempt to use a microwave step-up transformer (output of 2000 volts on the secondary) to attempt to power a 60 watt rated light bulb used in 120 volt circuits. Guess what: the light bulb will not do anything because the transformer has too low of a kVA rating.  ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming both light bulbs are switched on, working, and on the same circuit (basically, are switched on and off together, with one switch), nothing. Current (measured in watts or amps, and colloquially called \"draw\") describes how much electricity an appliance (like a light globe) uses, and converts into something useful (light, in this case). A 60-watt light globe draws 60w if it's on, regardless if you have other light globes (or, your microwave) on. Unscrewing a light globe has these consequences: Less current is drawn on the circuit (no one really cares)Less electricity is used (so, costs less money, though for a 60w light globe, the difference is very small)It gets a bit darker :)I have tried to simplify some concepts here, there are some small technical details I have glossed over that are not relevant to your question, or my answer).
