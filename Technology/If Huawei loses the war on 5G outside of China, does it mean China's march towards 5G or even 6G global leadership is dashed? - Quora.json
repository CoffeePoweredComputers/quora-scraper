            "answer_text": "Huawei is the leader of 5G, Huawei has nothing to lose if any country does not want to use Huawei 5G it is this country who lose on the best 5G technology. They will be left behind in the digital economy especially the west. I strongly advise all these western countries do not fall into the trap of loser and failure in preventing them from advancing in the coming digital economy power by AI. Huawei is not only a leader and matures in her 5G technology, but Huawei has also developed a range of IOT products that utilize 5G technology. These products will be the cutting edge technology that 5G enable. Countries that join losers who had failed to produce 5G will be left behind in the next wave of digital economy that power by AI and big data. Huawei is a diversified group, Huawei is involved in AI centered ICT solution for the coming digital economy in wide fields. Huawei ICT products are cutting edge technology that any developed country will be degraded to the third world if not deploying in time. On the other hand developing countries that adopt Huawei products will be elevated to the forefront of the digital economy. The 5G enable ICT solution of Huawei are way ahead of the west. Huawei is very dangerous to the failed leader of technology. I am not surprised they use country resources to try to crush Huawei. Huawei is such a great company, it is stupid and irresponsible for any country to follow the failure to ban Huawei. Huawei is ahead at least 3 to 5 years of current failed technology leader. That is why she is desperate to bring down Huawei. Huawei not only the producer and supplier of telecommunication 5G, smartphone but also provide solution and products enabled by 5G and AI in the field of energy, power supply, transportation, facilities management, electric cars, smart home, smart cities, smart facilities, smart administration etc. Huawei exhibition in Shanghai this month is eye-opening for me, so impressive,. That is why I can confidently say that any government of the country that bans Huawei is stupid and irresponsible, you risk degrade your country into a digital cesspit of the planet. The perceived and trumpeted current technological leaders claim that they are still leading in technology is just like Motorola claims her 2010 handphone is still better than Huawei P40. I urge the west to open your eye and look at what happened in China, not the spent leader in America. Huawei will not lose leadership in 5G and 6G, any country that does not join Huawei and China will be left behind in the 4.0 industrial revolution. China will be the center of the 4.0 industrial revolution. Here are the videos I watched and got impressed.   ",

            "answer_text": "Q: If Huawei loses the war on 5G outside of China, does it mean China's march towards 5G or even 6G global leadership is dashed? A: Yes. in fact Huawei/China already lost. No one is paying patent royalties to Huawei because Huawei did not invent 5G5G was invented by The West (as was all other cell technologies)The 3GPP is the International standards body that governs 3G, 4G (LTE) 5G, etc., Huawei/China must abide by those rules3GPP - Wikipedia5G manufacturers all file for patents on their specific hardware to try and prevent others from copying their exact cell tower hardwareIn the first quarter of 2019 when Huawei was boasting that they owned all the critical patents to 5G, and the Chinese government made it appear that everyone would have to pay Huawei for their 5G patents, the truth is that Nokia (not even counting Ericsson) already had 50% more 5G patents than Huawei had, and Nokia/Ericsson were filing 5G patents at a rate far faster than Huawei, so they completely overwhelmed Huawei with 5G patentsIn truth no one will pay Huawei for anything because Huawei did not invent anything, it simply has its own implementation of 5G, just like everyone else has its own implementation of 5GHuawei attempted to lead the industry by using Chinese taxpayer subsidies to rush their 5G to market to tray and get The West to buy their early, discounted, 5G hardware but that plan failed.This put Huawei one year of every else in starting their bulk of designing production line startup, but despite the long head start from the taxpayer subsidies, Huawei is now far behind Nokia and Ericsson in 5GNot only is Huawei behind in 5G (in the real world), there is no such thing as 6G since the 3GPP has not finished standardizing 5G yet, so there are no 6G standards so in act no one can work on something that does not existThe West is not buying any Huawei 5G hardwareThe West is actually buying their 5G cell tower hardware from Nokia and EricssonIn fact, the UK has issued orders to remove all existing Huawei networking hardware from their networks by 2025, so Huawei actually will have a negative market shareBy the end of summer 2020, the three cell phone carriers in the United States have already deployed 5G coverage from coast to coast (using Nokia and Ericsson cell tower hardware), at the same time Huawei only has placed coverage inside 3 cities in China (the Chinese government is falsely reporting wider coverage by quoting full city coverage when in fact they only installed a few towers in rural areas outside a few other cities) either way, China doe snot have full coverage, so they are well behind the USSo no matter how you look at it, Huawei and China are far behind the United States and The WestHuawei will most likely only sell 5G hardware into China and into a few places in Africa where the Chinese government is pouring massive subsidies int so Huawei will not have any significant impact on the 5G cell tower business.",
