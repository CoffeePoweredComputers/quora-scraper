Simply put - recompense. I must admit technology has given us much ease, enhanced life especially in health care, communication and transportation. So also has it made fast foods to engender Obesity, heart diseases and several other ailments. Conversely, as you dig deeper, the pile heaps up, so is the mess of advancement- no matter the seeming progress , except check and balances are put in place. Just as it is in perspective to say, life is getting better and equally worse , paripasu. Fitness industry is a multi billion industry, as technology has reduced the need for reliance of our biomechanics, we have far more effective and reliable means in robots and better transportation system options in place of human locomotion. However it equally predisposes us to lots of health challenges as we are less fit as a result. Yet in essence it has made the world a global village, as we easily go globe trotting, or Skype or put a call across fast distances. Technology has created so much pollution that we are at the mercy of our very greed, yet we cannot deny the giant strides it has achieved, but the price tag is written everywhere. Namely, Behavioral changes. Compromised health Environmental decadence Global village but increased loneliness via more mental issues. Some advantages are: Yet life expectancy is notching up, but people are battling more fertility issues Unprecedented wealth, that has equally created poverty So much food, but GM food is frowned at. Faster world of Internet with intrepid crime on line Remember the adage too, that the more things change, the more they remain same. Nature balances herself out. You cannot catch her off guard. She finds her balance ultimately by whatever means., even it means unleashing disasters(tsunami, tornado, wars, plagues etc) to achieve her aim. ",

            "answer_text": "I personally would not be able to live without technology, my whole life depends on it. Pathetic right? Well, let me explain my situation for a minute. I\u2019m currently living in a village somewhere in the middle of nowhere. The estimated population is about 60\u201380 people including myself. I\u2019m 20 years old while the majority of the village is at about 50\u201380. I obviously can\u2019t hang around with them. The closest city is at about 10\u201313 kilometers away from me. Public transportation comes once per day at 7:20 pm. Six out of seven days I can\u2019t use it because I\u2019m working from home. I don\u2019t have a car to move freely when I\u2019m done with work and I can\u2019t get one as I\u2019m rather poor at the moment. To sum things up: I\u2019m living in the middle of nowhere all alone, no shops or anything to entertain me around, and for the biggest part I\u2019m unable to get out of here. But, here I am. Talking with you guys here thanks to technology. I\u2019ve got some company, I\u2019ve got some entertainment, something to keep me sane. What would I do without technology? First of all, I would most likely be unemployed. The economy of my country (Greece) is terrible. We can\u2019t even afford to hire waiters. Even no skill jobs are rather hard/impossible to land unless you\u2019ve got some connections. But, my PC and the internet allows me to work as a technical writer remotely for people that are living across the other side of the Earth. How amazing is that? Secondly, I would have zero to no entertainment. I spent a couple of hours playing video games every day and 4\u20135 in writing music with my electrical guitar. What would I do without them here? Most likely stare at the ceiling. Last but not least, I would be completely alone for what would look like the rest of my life. I\u2019ve made friends with people that are living in other cities (duh). Thanks to technology, I can communicate with them over the distance and make plans for the very few hours in the whole week that I\u2019m able to leave this village. I could go on all day, but there is no reason to. You should understand by now why technology plays such a major part in my life. So, what do you think? Am I still pathetic for relying so much on technology? Let me know down in the comments below, I\u2019d like to read your thoughts. ",
