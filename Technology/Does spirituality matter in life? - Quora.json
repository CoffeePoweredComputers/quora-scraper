            "answer_text": "My question would be how could we think we don\u2019t need it? By spirituality I don\u2019t mean religion, those two are actually quite contrary to one another. We need people who question and seek deeper meaning, people brave enough to do so even if it brings them disadvantages, don\u2019t we?We need people who take responsibility for their own life, find their own answers and take responsibility for the consequences of their actions, don\u2019t we?We need people who are so centered that they become highly resilient to adversities, who bounce back after falling down, so much so that they can also help others along the way, don\u2019t we?We need people who have clear sense of direction, who are willing to do things that don\u2019t bear immediate results or satisfaction and can carry out long-term missions, don\u2019t we?We need people who are not only self-less, meaning altruistic, but rather who mastered their self and are able to employ it rather than let the self govern them, don\u2019t we?We need people who can tap into their intuition and inner guidance whenever needed, particularly when existing information doesn\u2019t provide a clear direction, is missing, deceptive or confusing, don\u2019t we?We need people who are highly flexible and capable of adapting to new concepts and situations, people you can send into any unknown situation and they will not freak out, don\u2019t we?We need people capable of highly connecting to others, having empathy and valuing relationships and humanity over quick gains and profits, don\u2019t we?We need people in tune with nature, deeply connected to it, who not only fight for the environment, but truly understand nature and our role in it, people who sense elemental powers, plants and animals on a deeper level, don\u2019t we?We need people who deeply understand their own body, love it and cherish it, who can sense energy and enjoy deeply connected physical and sexual experiences without shame, manipulation or violence, don\u2019t we?We need people who cherish and celebrate a sense of wholeness, whose mission is to bring split parts into a whole, rather than separate things, divide people and isolate those they \u201cdon\u2019t like,\u201d don\u2019t we?We need people unafraid of change and transformation, willing to change themselves, their habits, their ways of being, as well as contribute to changes of our society, don\u2019t we?These and many more are fundamental traits one gains through a spiritual awakening and journey. We not only need spirituality, we need it desperately to get out of the mess brought about by devaluing or indoctrinating all of the above. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever noticed that many people need a near-constant supply of novel objects and experiences to be happy? Have you considered that this need is the source of suffering, and indeed, that the sum of individual efforts to fulfill these needs creates the man-made problems of the world? Spirituality addresses the perceived void that creates this condition. But know that it is not the clinging to baseless beliefs, but rather, the discovery of your true nature, which is happiness. By default, we mistakenly take ourselves to be the body and mind, rather than their witness. The vulnerable body exists in the realm of the changeful, and so we must resist change to prevent the destruction we fear for it. To resist \u201cwhat is,\u201d creates various lines of tension between the outside and the ideal that\u2019s held within. The sum of these tensions are a distortion in consciousness that reflects a conceptual being to its witness; this imaginary being is the ego. It is evolved to preserve the body. If you take yourself to be a body, you have fear, and the vibration of fear hides love. And since you cannot perpetually strong-arm reality into the ideal, there is constant desire for things to address this vulnerability. Additionally, the belief that we are these unique versions of mind and body creates a separation that seeks safety with the familiar, hence human conflict. The hunger that the spiritually unconscious person feels is the drive to escape the accumulation of \u201clow vibration\u201d thoughts that build up over a lifetime, e.g., regrets/nostalgia for the past and fear for the future. We seek things that pull our attention out of this mass of thoughts. We look for things to bring us into the moment, where we can temporarily feel our true nature. Spiritual practice cultivates the ability to have this fulfillment without the outside lever to grab attention. Spirutal practices, in addition to meditation: Surrender - this is to confront every negative thought or memory that comes up, feel the underlying emotion without reacting or obsessing over the content, and then letting it go, handing it over to the universe. It is essentially seeing the perfection of what is, such that the resistance to reality falls away. In the stillness of this resolution, the distortion of the mind becomes the mirror of the heart, and in its reflection is apprehended the love that is its witness. Then what was formerly sought in outside things and experiences is known to be sourced from within, and that outside pursuits are merely \u201cmiddle men\u201d who take a substantial cut and keep you on the treadmill of seeking. Presence/Mindfulness - This is simply staying in the moment, not delving into the mental timeline. Surrender facilitates this in that the dissolving of the ego weakens its pull on attention. Also, if one sees perfection in what is, the reward of the moment is known to be in its truth and not its content. Basically, the kingdom of heaven actually is within you, true spirituality is looking inward to discover it. ",
