            "answer_text": "In my personal experience, you don't ever need to format an SD card unless your want to delete everything quick and easy. As for errors,a format is pretty much the only thing to do. I've bought and used several dozen SD cards and I usually lose them before they break. My typical use case is raspberry pi projects, large amounts of music, and just generally easier to lose mass storage. What formatting does \u2014 depending on the filesystem\u2014is unlink all files of their names and rewrite some header information. This is why it's possible to restore files even after a format. There's no particular benefit of habitually formatting an SD card. ",

            "answer_text": "You shouldn't really have to do it very often. That being said there is little to no harm in doing so, and is quite common for photographers and cinematographers. Hard formatting (writing over every bit on the card) is slow and usually unnecessary other than for security reasons. Soft formatting (forgetting where everything on the card is) is the preferred method for most cinematographers and photographers since it can clear a large card very quickly. SD cards are cheap and tend to break all of a sudden, so as others have stated, once you see blocks becoming unusable, just replacing the card is a good idea. ",
