            "answer_text": "Very powerful but only if a master optimization expert is working on the games. Games like Skyrim and DOOM and Wolfenstein II can play on it just fine but only when someone who\u2019s really good does the optimization. Rocket League was a home run on the Switch in terms of optimizing that game. Nintendo are masters of making things like Mario Kart 8 and Super Smash Bros. operate on the hardware at a constant 60 frames per second and you never feel like the quality has to take a hit at all. If the game developers are not good with optimizing games then they just can\u2019t make it work on the Switch or they wont even try. ",

You could compare it to the Pixel 2 in terms of raw hardware, but Nintendo did a good job with software and made the OS run really well with what it was given. The console would probably be able to play GTA V if Rockstar put a bit of work into it. ",
