            "answer_text": "Yes, you can add a telephone number to a QR code.QR codes have a large data capacity; they can store up to 7089 digits or 4296 characters, including punctuation. That's why many people, including business owners, use QR codes because they can store different documents or information in their QR code such as website URLs, pictures, or contact information. If you want to create a QR code that contains your phone number,use the QR Stuff\u2019s code generator because it's easy to use. You can create a QR code on their website easily. To start, visit their website and select Telephone Number as your data type in the first section.  After that, a field appears that requires you to provide the telephone number. Be sure to include the country code and the area code.  You can then select the foreground color for your QR code in the lower part of the first section. If you are a paid subscriber, you can also set the image size, resolution, output file type (PNG, JPG, TIF, EPS, SVG, PDF, or DXF ), and error correction level.  Click the \u201cDownload QR Code\u201d button, and your Telephone Number QR code is good to go.  QR Stuff is free to use, by the way. You don't have to pay for anything unless you are planning to use some of the features intended for paid users only. That's it. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Of course! Literally, any string of numbers, letters, and punctuation characters can be embedded into a QR Code symbol, as long as there aren\u2019t too many. I would surmise that your purpose of embedding a phone number in a QR Code would be to enable someone to have their smartphone, upon reading the symbol, successfully call the number in question. Doing this will require embedding more than just the phone number in the symbol. Having done lots of website design over the years, I know that a hyperlink on a web page that referred to something like \u201ctel:+1 780 555 1212\u201d would, when clicked on the screen of a smartphone, automatically call that phone number. Perhaps this is a clue as to how you\u2019d accomplish it yourself. ",
