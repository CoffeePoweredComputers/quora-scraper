            "answer_text": "It is very difficult to say exactly how the entire world would be able to work without Google \u2013 which is the most frequently visited website in the world. Google is a huge company which employs more than 30,000 people. There are a wide range of applications offered by Google and many of them are completely free. Users have the flexibility of using e-mail or Gmail and Google Docs for the purpose of sharing different types of documents. Google offers maps for the purpose of navigation, Calendar for organizing different activities during the week. Apart from this, Google offers Analytics for the purpose of tracking statistics about a website and Blogger for setting up an attractive blog for professional as well as personal purposes. Lineup of services offered by Google also includes Google Patents, Scholar, Finance, Groups and Google+ for social networking. You also get the Image search option which enables you to get hold of the best images that you would like to use. Not to mention, Google search engine which has completely revolutionized the whole procedure of getting useful information on the internet. There are a lot of things offered by Google for accomplishing a number of tasks without putting in much effort and also without spending much money. If there was no Google then to find everything on search engine, people would need to talk to each other more. Forums will start to be bombarded with small queries. People would often meet up in big groups to discuss things as there was no Google to tell them stuff. Instead of Googling everything whenever they wanted, people would try and remember more stuff. As is the case with phone book in mobiles, we no longer remember phone numbers of our family or friends. Same is with Google. We don\u2019t even make an effort to remember stuff because we know we can Google it any time we want. ",

            "answer_text": "The internet would be very different than it is today without Google. Google has turned into the predominant service for search, mail, and cloud storage, among other services. Its purchases of YouTube and Waze also shows its foray into other areas. Its no longer just a search tool \u2014 its a suite of services. What\u2019s most concerning is that it\u2019s slowly building a monopoly on the internet. Nowadays most people turn to Google for all of their needs. In my opinion, there needs to be more choice and more users willing to diversify their services, otherwise we are at the mercy of the Google gods. Many things would still exist in Google\u2019s absence. Let\u2019s consider that the core components of the internet existed without Google at all. Programming languages like HTML, Python, and C++ were the norm. They helped to build the internet, and even Google itself. The internet ran without Google until 1997, when it first appeared as a search engine. There would still be a way to browse the web without Google, too. Google simply got ahead of everyone else in the market at the time and kept their stride. Early search engines like Yahoo!, AltaVista, and Ask Jeeves may have had a chance if Google didn\u2019t debut new algorithms like PageRank. In fact, Ask Jeeves was actually ahead of its time \u2014 it was using conversational search queries unlike its competitors, who were dependent on keyword-based searches. But Google\u2019s way of searching through keyword-laden phrases squashed Ask Jeeves\u2019 chances at success. Many things would still exist without Google, but its dominance in the online space has certainly made it seem that the world would be at a disadvantage without it. ",
