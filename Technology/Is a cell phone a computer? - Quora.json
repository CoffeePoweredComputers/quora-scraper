            "answer_text": "Pencils exist \u2026 erasers exist. One day someone put an eraser on the end of a pencil, and called it an enhanced pencil, not an enhanced eraser. Scissors exist \u2026 bottle openers exist. One day someone put a bottle opener on a scissors and called it an enhanced scissors, not an enhanced bottle opener. \u2026 There\u2019s virtually an infinite supply of examples where product A is added to product B, and calls the combination enhanced product A. The choice is completely arbitrary. The smartphone is clearly the most popular swiss-army-knife in the world (the only thing it doesn\u2019t contain is a knife blade or scissors). It\u2019s a computer, camera, gps, calculator, pager, e-reader, browser, email client, portable game console \u2026 and almost 100 other common devices that each and every one existed independently \u2026 oh, yeah, and a phone too. Some people seem to think \u201cno, it\u2019s fundamentally a phone\u201d, but they\u2019d be wrong. Lots of people use smartphones without a SIM card, or any provisioned cellular service, as a pocket wireless computer, game device, image viewer, camera, etc \u2026 without any telephony purpose whatsoever. I\u2019ve watched the digital convergence from within the electronics industry. A year before I joined Motorola in 1974 an engineer retold me how an engineer who predicted the future told upper management that within 5 years Motorola won\u2019t make a single radio product without a computer in it. He was not believed at the time. He was right. I was once assigned to appear as an expert witness for a criminal trial regarding someone that stole passwords to a government owned and operated digital radio network \u2026 he had stolen the passwords to permit unauthorized access and use. He stole them to sell to \u2026 reporters (who else?) that were not charged criminally. That was decades ago. The defendant was charged with violations of law criminalizing hacking into a government computer system. The defense attorney cross examination questioning went something like \u201cthis is a radio \u2026 it doesn\u2019t look like a computer \u2026 how can something be a computer if there\u2019s no keyboard or CRT?\u201d Today this wouldn\u2019t (shouldn\u2019t) be considered beyond common knowledge.

            "answer_text": "Smartphones have come a long way since its invention and is undeniably the most rapidly evolving digital device. They even operate as a CPU and run full desktop operating systems (Ubuntu and Windows 10) when connected to a monitor. Even so, they are nowhere near conventional desktop and laptop computers for professional usage. Let\u2019s consider some examples. Software or apps on the computers have deeper controls and functions. They also produce outputs that look professional and are superior in quality compared to those from smartphones. Image and video editing, Animating, Music composing and Architectural rendering works that are produced in computers are too superior for smartphones to surpass. Granted that smartphones have their own easy, one-touch apps for image-editing and a few others but they seriously lack complexity, accuracy, and wider sets of tools and controls. For such creative and development works, a touchscreen doesn't stand a chance against the convenience of mouse and keyboard as input devices.The ease of replacement, repair, cleaning and upgrading of various components is another aspect with which desktops (and laptops to a certain extent) outplay smartphones. Modular smartphones have risen recently which has some interesting plug & play attachments but the core parts of the system are still integrated.Smartphones are never supposed to replace traditional computers. They are meant to fulfill our general computing needs. It holds a little of everything in it in a very small package and targets a casual user. It can run quality games and provide immersive media consuming experience but the outcomes aren\u2019t comparable with the likes of a conventional computer. ",
