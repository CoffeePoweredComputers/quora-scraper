            "answer_text": "Is WiFi the same thing as wireless internet service? A wireless internet service is where the internet service provider (ISP) provides wireless access to the internet. This means that the ISP is providing their service wirelessly to whatever premises or devices that they\u2019re providing the service to. Whether this includes WiFi though depends on the ISP. Some ISPs (most in the UK for example) include provision of the WiFi service in the home. So for these it is correct to say that the ISP is providing a wireless internet service to the devices in the home over WiFi, even though they may provide the service into the premises via phone line or cable. On the other hand some ISPs provide their service wirelessly to the home without using a cable to the house. The most obvious of these are the mobile phone internet data service providers, but there are also some who specialise in providing a service wirelessly to a fixed location using a number of different wireless technologies. However WiFi is generally not used for this purpose as it only works over relatively short distances. To further complicate matters some of these service providers also provide WiFi within the home, so in fact these are wireless service providers twice over, to the home using non-WiFi wireless and then within the home using WiFi. So the answer in general is no, WiFi is not the same as wireless internet service, but some ISPs do use WiFi to provide their internet service wirelessly. ",

            "answer_text": "Wi-Fi relates to a specific set of radio communications that commonly operate in the 2.4 and 5.8 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) frequency bands. It can be used for many things and Internet access is one of them provided that the access point has an additional interface to the Internet proper. You can view the access point as an router between tow different networks: the Wi-Fi net and the Internet. So, when used in that configuration, Wi-Fi is one type of wireless Internet access. But, there are many other types of wireless Internet access approaches. 6LoWPAN over IEEE 802.15.4 can also provide wireless Internet access as can Bluetooth and cellular communications. The key here is \u201cwireless\u201d. I.e., they will use either radio modulation or they could even use light (e.g., Li-Fi). The only requirements being the use of some wireless transit media and an interface to the network commonly referred to as the Internet with a routing function between the two networks. So, Wi-Fi is just an instance of a wireless access method commonly used to access the Internet. But, it\u2019s not the only one. ",
