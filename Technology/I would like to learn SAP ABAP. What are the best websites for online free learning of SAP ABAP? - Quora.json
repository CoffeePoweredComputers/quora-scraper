            "answer_text": "My experience with the official ABAP training was extremely good, but I have references from some of my peers that this seems not to be always the case. Having said that, I still recommend the official training over a lot of the online material if you are going to start developing in ABAP. The reason for this is simple: consistency and methodology. You can get huge amounts of information online for training, but I will be honest: most are terrible, and if they are good, there is no methodology for a broad coverage of topics. Most information is simply a bunch of code with little or no explanation about what is going on. Also, ABAP covers quite a few different technologies and when you are learning, having consistency over the examples using different technologies helps a lot in understanding the real concepts.  Another very important topic that most training sites do not cover is that you really need a system to exercise with your code. If you are already working in a company that has access to a SAP system, go ahead and request a developer user in a development system, and make friends with existing ABAPers: ask them for mentoring support. If you don't have access to a system, you can request an ABAP system in trial mode. There is more info in the SCN Abap space on how to do this (SCN. Com / community/ developer-center/ Abap)  It is really basic, but it can help you start. Another option is to use the Cloud Application Library  (cal. sap. com) but you have to spend a lot of money in an Amazon VM. Once you start coding, then it is the time to access the online resources. SCN is your first and main start point. It used to be a very stackoverflow-like site, but now is mostly blogging, but you still have access to old content with very specific knowledge. SAP Technical is another good one although you must know what you are looking for. My third choice is zevolving .com which is one of the very few blogs with interesting and beautifully presented content. Most of the \"blogs\" you find online are merely copy and paste of help. sap. com and full of advertising. P.s. Sorry about the links, Quora seems to dislike me adding links to my answers ",

            "answer_text": "All those so called \u201cBest Websites\u201d can only give you instructions and information. None of them can actually help you learn. As ABAP is a programming language, it requires practice. So from where are you going to arrange the system access? If you just want to have a casual understanding of what ABAP is, then just google it. You will yourself find numerous websites that provides basic to intermediate info. Every now and then I see ABAP videos on YouTube, which can be a great source of information. You can accumulate as much as theory you want, however none of them can make you a champ in ABAP or confident enough to crack an interview. Candidates with theoretical knowings are easily caught in the interviews. But in case you are able to find some \u201cfree\u201d way of learning(practicing), then request you to share with others also on Quora, as many other newbies will be benefited. Theory alone cannot help. ",
