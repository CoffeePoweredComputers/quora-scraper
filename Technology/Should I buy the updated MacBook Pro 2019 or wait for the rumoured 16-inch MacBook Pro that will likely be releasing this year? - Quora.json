            "answer_text": "If you are serious about buying a MacBook Pro 2019, you better not to ignore and read some rumors before buying. For curiosity sake I have been reading for many years some of the blogs like www.macrumors.com, www.cultofmac.com, etc. and my observation is that they could get quite a few information before hand and therefore make accurate analysis and forecast which helped buyers like me in making the decisions. You can be sure of few things: The new 16 inch model will be definitely more expensive than the current top of the line MBP. Processor and graphics card performance will be higher. The new model will address the heat/ventilation vs throttling issue in a better way. The new model will possibly solve the keyboard issue. Possibly this will be an entirely new touch keyboard! All in all, you can expect this new MBP to be a new generation unlike the normal gradual evolvement. ",

            "answer_text": "I faced a similar dilemma when purchasing a 15\u2033 MacBook Pro for my wife about one year ago. Should I purchase the legacy 15\u2033 MacBook that used the same MagSafe charger as my own or the just released 15\u2033 MacBook that uses the USB-C charger? I ultimately choose the latter because of the longevity of MacBooks, the only real limitation being the ability of replacement parts. Since replacement parts are only available for a certain number of years, I figured it was better to purchase the more recent model. Of course, both being 15\u2033 MacBooks, the price difference was not too great, though I do not remember exactly what it was. Of course, that price difference will likely be more significant between the 15\u2033 and 16\u2033 MacBooks. Good luck with whatever you decide. ",
