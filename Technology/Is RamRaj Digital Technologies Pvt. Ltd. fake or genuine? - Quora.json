First of all they don't know what exactly they want to do with digital marketing. They approached me for the job thru quikr       for joining they demanded training fee of \u20b910k... I paid the same, and after 1 day I was pretty much clear about their policies and business models its more like a chain business used to have in the past years who eventually shuts their business and fly away. They didn't gave me the refund. Is this the way of employing people. Don't know they are giving jobs to others or to themselves!
