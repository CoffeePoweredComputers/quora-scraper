            "answer_text": "We actually don't know. The fact that at very small scale, there seems some randomness that do not follow our intuitive physical laws and somewhat intertwined with \"the observer\" is not very promising signs for the objective physical world view - of course these are not proof that we live in a simulation, but it does not help proof the other way either. In a thought experiment, I could ask myself this question,\"what if I created an AI that has consciousness?\" (I do code and wrote my own computer games when I was a kid). The answer is strangely odd, it seems I will be fine with it. I don't have to intervene in their quest of truth - even if they are questioning if they are just figures in a game, my nature tenancy is actually let them be, and do not intervene. On this same thought experiment, I also asked myself this question,\"will I deprive my computer game the sensors like camera, microphone, if I was able to created a near sentient character?\" The answer is no! Actually as technology evolve, it will be VERY hard for me to forbid my creation to interact with those IO devices - unless there are some unimaginable goals that are totally beyond our intellectual ability to comprehend - there is no compelling reasons to run a simulation so advanced but is completely isolated from the world the computer is created. Because such IO devices would be ubiquitous, it will take extra effort to deprive the simulation to gain access to those devices - most of our simulations were isolated not because of our intention, but because of our technology limitation - imagine you want to run a simulation to see how our universe started, you can either run a rudimentary model with everything manually set, with low accuracy, or you can let your advanced AI figure out most of the parameters by itself . To say that completely isolated your simulation, with completely imaginary parameters is more advantages to your connected computer to pull information from your reality is hard to justify. Of course I'm not claiming we understand all the superAI's logic and reasoning. For example maybe that's the way they create their fictions and we are their fictionary creatures. Or many we live in a memorial - that all real human have all died out and their AI is creating a simulation to remember them - or analyze how did human killed themselves - that's why the isolate this simulation to the physical world - because there is not much left for the fictional creatures to see other than brutal battle field of destruction-which if is the case, it might mean we aren't heading the way we wanted. And, like mentioned earlier, the fact that particles behave in a way that we can hardly understand is not a good indication. It could indicate there is a granularity that the simulation chose to balance \"looks real enough\" and \"wasteful resource consumption\". I currently lean towards \"not a simulation\" side - I'm not convinced that running a simulation like what we have observed completely isolated from a physical reality has much value to a super AI - it might look great for us, who are still in the infancy of intelligence, but if superAI really is that super, already capable of exponentially expand it's own intelligence, running a simulation to create us with such level of resources dedicated to it seems not rational.
