Don\u2019t be afraid to make conversation with people smarter than you Many people begin to get uncomfortable when realizing they don\u2019t understand or aren\u2019t familiar with a topic someone is talking about. They might try to change the subject or worse, make an excuse to walk away. The next time this happens, try to continue the conversation instead. Ask questions about things you\u2019re unfamiliar with and respond with your own opinions when you can. There is no shame in showing you\u2019re interested in learning something new . If you are not willing to learn, no one can help you. If you are determined to learn, no one can stop you. Click To Tweet 2. Read a newspaper every day Coming off as someone who has kept up with the daily news is a clear indication of intelligence. It has and always will be important to be aware of what\u2019s going on around you. If you don\u2019t like reading the old school physical newspapers, try to subscribe to an online version. There are plenty of online portals that give you quality news for a reasonable subscription fee. Many even send daily digests straight to your inbox! 3. Listen to an episode of an audiobook or podcast every day With there being such a large range of audiobooks and podcasts available for free online, there\u2019s definitely something for everyone. Do some research on featuring topics that might interest you and try to listen to an episode each day. It\u2019s a great way to spend any free time you have and will end up making you a little bit smarter! Amazon Audible has a large collection of audiobook categories for you to select from. Now you get to enjoy listening to your favorite audiobooks anytime, anywhere. Knowledge is power. Enthusiasm pulls the switch. - Steve Droke Click To Tweet 4. Make use of idle time An idle mind is the devil\u2019s playground. When you find yourself in a situation where your mind\u2019s not at work (such as in a waiting room, during lunch break or while on commute) , try doing something to occupy yourself. Take the time to do some reading or listen to an audio book or podcast. Put your smartphone to good use by downloading some insightful articles that you\u2019ll read when you have time. It\u2019s better food for the brain than spending that time just watching people around you. 5. Visit any exhibitions happening in your area You know all those posters you see on your office or apartment building that advertise a cool event coming up? Next time you walk by one, try to actually pay attention. These little events or exhibitions are often a great way to learn new things and meet new people. The more obscure the event, the better. You\u2019ll end up coming out of it having picked up quirky bits of information that will make you an undeniably more interesting person. New knowledge is the most valuable commodity on earth. The more truth we have to work with, the richer we become. 6. Take a class on a subject completely new to you If it\u2019s been years since you graduated, it\u2019s likely you haven\u2019t experienced what it\u2019s like to be a student recently. Sometimes, the best way to learn is to just sit down with a class and listen to an expert who knows best. Research on centers in your area that offer classes on topics you want to learn more about. They are often not too expensive and will give you a unique opportunity to delve into a new subject. Copied ",

            "answer_text": "[Note: This is actually a quick adaptation of my earlier responses to similar questions on Quora.] It's quite simple, actually! First, read, read, and read widely and deeply, all kinds of published works, mainstream as well as from the fringes, so that you can have sustainable intellectual horsepower. Next, write, write, and write, so as to garner people's attention to your evolving acumen and growing expertise, which often can lead to more public speaking and consulting engagements. Next, begin with a warm, sincere and genuine interest in people all around you, as people are your greatest resource, as well as your opportunities. Next, don't forget to attend selected conferences, seminars and workshops to keep yourself abreast of trends and developments in your as well as outside your industry, as everything in business - as well as in life - is connected in some ways; naturally, don't hesitate to seek as much opportunities as possible to rub shoulders with like-minded professionals inside as well as outside your industry, with the longer-term view to gain diverse - or even contrarian - perspectives; Next, listen, and talk less. Next, keep learning - and doing - new things, so as to gain expanded perspectives and new experiences. Evolving experiences = applied knowledge! Next, develop a idea/insight generating mindset and a problem solving attitude, so that folks around you can turn to you for advice and help. Nevertheless, here are a few good tips for enhancing your idea/insight generation: - be acutely observant of your environment, by using all your senses;- be curious and inquisitive;- be open-minded to new and even radical possibilities;- suspend judgement;- make unlikely connections;- ask questions, all kinds, especially open-ended ones, like \"what if?\", \"why not?\", \"So what?\", \"What now?\", etc.- think like a child, but don't be childish, so to develop the beginner's mindset;- learn to see things backwards, inside out, and upside down; inside the box as well as outside the box, plus no box at all;- learn to see from atop; see ahead; see beyond; see behind; see sideways; see beneath; see behind; see from within; and see through, so as to develop multidirectional and multidevelopment viewpoints;- hitchhike; copycat; piggyback; leapfrog on other peoples' ideas, as \"Ideas Build on Ideas\";- you can make use of the simple but proven SCAMPER technique [it dates back to the 1950's], to expand your idea generation;- likewise, you may want to explore the more elaborate but proven CPSI methodology of the US-based Creative Education Foundation, to expand your idea geneation;- for the more adventurous, you can also take a look at the Synectics group brainstorming process, which also dates back to the 1950's; Next, go all out to share your knowledge, experience and acumen, orally or in written form, as \"Knowledge Shared is Power Squared\". Last but not least, be humble. Always remember, knowledge building and intelligence amplification is always a work in progress! [2015_Knowledge Acquisition] ",
