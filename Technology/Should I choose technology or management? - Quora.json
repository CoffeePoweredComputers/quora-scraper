            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not only you; millions of Indian youth are facing the same dilemma. Now in my believe \u201cWanting-to-do-something-cool/unique \u201c stuff is a modern form of cast system cleverly imposed by capitalists and their puppet media. Most people are capable of doing almost everything i.e. A B.tech graduate can perfectly do the job of a Hotel Manager but then how on earth the HM colleges will charge the millions from people to teach \u201ccleaning utensils\u201d(I mean my mother can teach me to cook better, spending a fortune doesn\u2019t make much sense given the system is not in place)???Besides the companies mostly seek \u201cSerious\u201d and \u201cFocused\u201d (Read \u201censlaved\u201d and \u201chelpless\u201d) people whom they can pay as less & treat as they wish. But unfortunately most of modern \u201cworkers\u201d (Especially in technology, management and other such lucrative domain) are not that Poor (If they don\u2019t have a rich daddy they can\u2019t afford the course fee). So corporate has created this modern form of cast system that repeatedly brainwashes the people like you (With their popular EXPERT COLUMNs and other sources, even your peers speak their language being biased by them)  to convince you \u201cSince you did Engineering from XYZ College, you better remain an Engineer any Tom, Dick, Harry who has done a Ba in English from god-only-knows institute, will be a better journalist than you\u201d. Speaking of Job Satisfaction:  A lot of people frequently use that word now-a-days;  but I doubt whether they all mean the same. Given the increasing corporate work pressure, lack of work ethics and job uncertainty I doubt there is any factor in those corporate jobs apart from Money that can satisfy you. Job Satisfaction depends more on the ambience you work, the package you get, and the working hours you have. In reality it has hardly much to do with qualification. If the degree papers really mattered, we won\u2019t have So many IAS officers, IIM grads and numerous people like you who moved from tech and made a decent career in non-tech. Even in technology (read software) the ground work done is much different from what is taught in college and most people move to management after 7/8/10 year\u2019s experience. And I myself surprise how relevant is a civil engineering degree for the job of a java developer\u2026(Especially when THEY are so particular about PROFESSIONALISM).Coming To You: Most of we people are more or less aware of reality but, we get confused when we face with some challenges, i.e. if you are an Civil Eng and you worked in a BPO/Sales for 3 years and then you try getting back to civil field, then you will be unanimously accused, and your probability of getting a decent job reduces etc. If the corporate won\u2019t discriminate and the interviewers won\u2019t harass people than I am sure majority of people like you won\u2019t be forced to think that way.  So chill, you did what you had to\u2026Its They who are forcing you to think this way..But if you are looking for a job which is less volatile in nature, and you have comparatively lesser psychological pressure, then try getting any job that doesn't involve marketing or selling a product directly/ convincing a client directly. (Even with an MBA in marketing you can do a lot of jobs that doesn't involve B2C sales yet provides good growth options)       You can shift to Sap domain (Both Fico and ABAP). If programming interests you than, ABAP is the right choice. You can shift to digital marketing / online product management / Content management with a computer and management combo skill set. In these jobs both your Marketing and computer skills will be relevant and you won\u2019t end-up selling things directly.           About your present Job: Selling Demat accounts/Insurance etc often gets difficult, because you have to sale a non-tangible stuff that is not the basic requirement of people and competition is tough like all other fields. If that is the issue you have with your present career than try switching to production/operation management like. Purchase management, hotel management, event management , quality management etc. Even a store manager\u2019s job in a decent shopping mall will involve a bit less target pressure and will provide you with equal or better growth opportunity.        Finally life is \"yours\" just don\u2019t let anyone define you, use your God gifted wisdom and be happy.. :-) ",
