            "answer_text": "All manner of them. The thing to understand is that the Jurassice spanned c.200\u2013145 MA. That\u2019s roughly the difference between the early Eocene and today. Just as things changed in that span in the Cenezoic, so did they in the Jurassic. So the fauna in the Hettengian stage was very different to that of the Tithonian stage. Thus to keep things simple, I\u2019m just going to divide it by epochs: Early, Middle, and Late Jurassic. We\u2019ll go from predators to largest prey. The Early Jurassic (Hettengian-Toarcian stages): The earliest Jurassic predators were animals similar to Coelophysis bauri (of Walking with dinosaurs fame). Many were still small (2\u20133 m), gracile, and swan-necked. However, since the Rhaetian and Norian stages, there was a trend toward increasing size, with Gojirasaurus and Liliensternus over 5 m in length. The earliest Jurassic continues this, with Dilophosaurus (5.5\u20136m), Sinosaurus (6 m), and Cryolophosaurus (5\u20136 m), and the informally described \u201cSaltreosaurus\u201d (6 m), from Italy. We see the earliest tentative remains of the Tetanurae from this period as well (Cryolophosaurus?), and toward the end of this epoch, the earliest Abelisauroids (Berberosaurus). The presence of Abelisauroids indicates that Ceratosauria had diverged into the three main branches (more on them later), but fossil evidence from this time is lacking. Plant eaters were also getting larger, with prosauropods the dominant form. Animals like Massospondylus, Plateosaurus, and Anchisaurus are common to this time. Sauropods are also known from this time, but were still comparatively small (Vulcanodon was around 6 m im length). The largest animals didn\u2019t yet get much over 10 m in length. Aside form them, we see the earliest ornithopods, the earliest thyreophorans (Scelidosaurus), and the Heterodontosaurs. These all did not exceed 3 m. The fossil record sparsens out in the Toarcian, which marks the end of the Early Jurassic. The Middle Jurassic: Aalenian to Callovian stages. This is actually the most poorly understoon period of the Jurassic. However, it was definitly the most important time in dinosaur history, as many of the classical forms are first seen here. Theropods get even larger; animals like Dilophosaurus and its kin go extinct. In its place are various tetanuran lineages, which began to diversify rapidly. They specifically branch into the Megalosauroids, the Carnosaurs, and Coelurosaurs. All three start appearing now, with the first two seizing the initiative. Megalosaurus dates form this time, and was already 8\u20139 m in length. Other animals include Metriocanthosaurus, Monolophosaurus, and Afrovenator (near the end of this epoch). The best evidence comes from China, as rising sea levels mean that most fossil assemblages form this time are marine. We see here the first true Abelisaurs\u2014such as the imaginatively names Eoabelisaurus. Additinally, we see other Ceratosaurs: but their remains don\u2019t become common till later. Sauropods get big now: Rhoetosaurus is 15\u201317 m in length, and we see the earliest macronarians and diplodocoids. Prosauropods go extinct at the start of this epoch. Evidence for ornithischian dinosaurs is scarce, though a couple are known. Stegosaurs appear here The Late Jurassic (Oxfordian-Tithonian). Here the fossil evidence really picks up: Tyrannosauroids first show up in the Oxfordian, and we also see rhe first Carcharodotosaurs (Concavenator), Ornithopods which are on their way to evolving into Hadrosaurs and iguanodonts, and early Maniraptorans (including birds), and so on. Limusaurs and Ceratosaurids proper are at thei most diverse here. Sauropods see the first good remains of Titanosaurs (Janenschia), other Macronarians (long list here), the diversification of diplodocids (long list here), and so on. China sees the evolution of the Euholepids, a sauropod branch nearly unique to China. Stegosaurs are at their peak here, and we see the first Nodosaurs and Ankylosaurs. So as you can see: there qas no one assemblage, and there is a trend toward increasing diversity. I further wish to add that Quora can\u2019t tell the difference between a matter-of-fact statement about camels, and a BNBR violation. ",
