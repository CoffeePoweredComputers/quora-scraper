            "answer_text": "In layman\u2019s terms, Deep Learning is the field where the machines learn by themselves by imitating the human brain. Imitate in the sense, the machines can perform tasks requiring human intelligence. Now, let\u2019s understand how? Human brain can easily differentiate between a cat and a dog.  (This is correct)  (This is correct as well) But how can we make a machine differentiate between a cat and a dog?  (????) We would feed the machine (also called training) with a lot of images of cats and dogs.  Then once the training is done, we will provide the machine with an image of either cat or a dog.Now, we will manually extract some features from the image and make a machine learning model out of it, which would help the machine recognize the input image.And then the machine learning model will predict whether it was a dog or cat. It was easy, wasn\u2019t it? But what will happen when we have many inputs? Manual extraction of features for a large input is backbreaking work. What if we could skip the manual extraction part? Wouldn\u2019t it make things a lot easier? When the amount of input data is increased, traditional machine learning techniques are insufficient in terms of performance. That is when Deep Learning came into the picture. From healthcare to self-driving cars, voice activated intelligent assistance to computer games, Deep Learning is reshaping automation industry in a big way, becoming one of the hottest evolving technologies of 21st century. Which also means that this is the perfect time to acquire this skill. To get an elaborate understanding on Deep Learning, you can refer to my tutorial blog on Deep Learning (explained with an use case). Where you will get to know how machines can imitate human brain to make decisions. Also, to implement Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Neural Network, there are API\u2019s available such as TensorFlow & Keras. TensorFlow is a low-level API developed by Google to make numerical computations faster and to implement neural networks. You can refer this video to get started with Tensorflow:  ",

            "answer_text": "Artificial intelligence is the future. Artificial intelligence is science fiction. Artificial intelligence is already part of our everyday lives. All those statements are true, it just depends on what flavor of AI you are referring to. For example, when Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo program defeated South Korean Master Lee Se-dol in the board game Go earlier this year, the terms AI, machine learning, and deep learning were used in the media to describe how DeepMind won. And all three are part of the reason why AlphaGo trounced Lee Se-Dol. But they are not the same things. The easiest way to think of their relationship is to visualize them as concentric circles with AI \u2014 the idea that came first \u2014 the largest, then machine learning \u2014 which blossomed later, and finally deep learning \u2014 which is driving today\u2019s AI explosion \u2014 fitting inside both.  From Bust to Boom AI has been part of our imaginations and simmering in research labs since a handful of computer scientists rallied around the term at the Dartmouth Conferences in 1956 and birthed the field of AI. In the decades since, AI has alternately been heralded as the key to our civilization\u2019s brightest future, and tossed on technology\u2019s trash heap as a harebrained notion of over-reaching propellerheads. Frankly, until 2012, it was a bit of both. Over the past few years AI has exploded, and especially since 2015. Much of that has to do with the wide availability of GPUs that make parallel processing ever faster, cheaper, and more powerful. It also has to do with the simultaneous one-two punch of practically infinite storage and a flood of data of every stripe (that whole Big Data movement) \u2013 images, text, transactions, mapping data, you name it. Let\u2019s walk through how computer scientists have moved from something of a bust \u2014 until 2012 \u2014 to a boom that has unleashed applications used by hundreds of millions of people every day. Artificial Intelligence \u2014 Human Intelligence Exhibited by Machines  King me: computer programs that played checkers were among the earliest examples of artificial intelligence, stirring an early wave of excitement in the 1950s. Back in that summer of \u201956 conference the dream of those AI pioneers was to construct complex machines \u2014 enabled by emerging computers \u2014 that possessed the same characteristics of human intelligence. This is the concept we think of as \u201cGeneral AI\u201d \u2014 fabulous machines that have all our senses (maybe even more), all our reason, and think just like we do. You\u2019ve seen these machines endlessly in movies as friend \u2014 C-3PO \u2014 and foe \u2014 The Terminator. General AI machines have remained in the movies and science fiction novels for good reason; we can\u2019t pull it off, at least not yet. What we can do falls into the concept of \u201cNarrow AI.\u201d Technologies that are able to perform specific tasks as well as, or better than, we humans can. Examples of narrow AI are things such as image classification on a service like Pinterest and face recognition on Facebook. Those are examples of Narrow AI in practice. These technologies exhibit some facets of human intelligence. But how? Where does that intelligence come from? That get us to the next circle, Machine Learning. Machine Learning \u2014 An Approach to Achieve Artificial Intelligence  Spam free diet: machine learning helps keep your inbox (relatively) free of spam. Machine Learning at its most basic is the practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world. So rather than hand-coding software routines with a specific set of instructions to accomplish a particular task, the machine is \u201ctrained\u201d using large amounts of data and algorithms that give it the ability to learn how to perform the task. Machine learning came directly from minds of the early AI crowd, and the algorithmic approaches over the years included decision tree learning, inductive logic programming. clustering, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian networks among others. As we know, none achieved the ultimate goal of General AI, and even Narrow AI was mostly out of reach with early machine learning approaches. As it turned out, one of the very best application areas for machine learning for many years was computer vision, though it still required a great deal of hand-coding to get the job done. People would go in and write hand-coded classifiers like edge detection filters so the program could identify where an object started and stopped; shape detection to determine if it had eight sides; a classifier to recognize the letters \u201cS-T-O-P.\u201d From all those hand-coded classifiers they would develop algorithms to make sense of the image and \u201clearn\u201d to determine whether it was a stop sign. Good, but not mind-bendingly great. Especially on a foggy day when the sign isn\u2019t perfectly visible, or a tree obscures part of it. There\u2019s a reason computer vision and image detection didn\u2019t come close to rivaling humans until very recently, it was too brittle and too prone to error. Time, and the right learning algorithms made all the difference. Deep Learning \u2014 A Technique for Implementing Machine Learning  Herding cats: Picking images of cats out of YouTube videos was one of the first breakthrough demonstrations of deep learning. Another algorithmic approach from the early machine-learning crowd, Artificial Neural Networks, came and mostly went over the decades. Neural Networks are inspired by our understanding of the biology of our brains \u2013 all those interconnections between the neurons. But, unlike a biological brain where any neuron can connect to any other neuron within a certain physical distance, these artificial neural networks have discrete layers, connections, and directions of data propagation. You might, for example, take an image, chop it up into a bunch of tiles that are inputted into the first layer of the neural network. In the first layer individual neurons, then passes the data to a second layer. The second layer of neurons does its task, and so on, until the final layer and the final output is produced. Each neuron assigns a weighting to its input \u2014 how correct or incorrect it is relative to the task being performed. The final output is then determined by the total of those weightings. So think of our stop sign example. Attributes of a stop sign image are chopped up and \u201cexamined\u201d by the neurons \u2014 its octogonal shape, its fire-engine red color, its distinctive letters, its traffic-sign size, and its motion or lack thereof. The neural network\u2019s task is to conclude whether this is a stop sign or not. It comes up with a \u201cprobability vector,\u201d really a highly educated guess, based on the weighting. In our example the system might be 86% confident the image is a stop sign, 7% confident it\u2019s a speed limit sign, and 5% it\u2019s a kite stuck in a tree ,and so on \u2014 and the network architecture then tells the neural network whether it is right or not. Even this example is getting ahead of itself, because until recently neural networks were all but shunned by the AI research community. They had been around since the earliest days of AI, and had produced very little in the way of \u201cintelligence.\u201d The problem was even the most basic neural networks were very computationally intensive, it just wasn\u2019t a practical approach. Still, a small heretical research group led by Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto kept at it, finally parallelizing the algorithms for supercomputers to run and proving the concept, but it wasn\u2019t until GPUs were deployed in the effort that the promise was realized. If we go back again to our stop sign example, chances are very good that as the network is getting tuned or \u201ctrained\u201d it\u2019s coming up with wrong answers \u2014 a lot. What it needs is training. It needs to see hundreds of thousands, even millions of images, until the weightings of the neuron inputs are tuned so precisely that it gets the answer right practically every time \u2014 fog or no fog, sun or rain. It\u2019s at that point that the neural network has taught itself what a stop sign looks like; or your mother\u2019s face in the case of Facebook; or a cat, which is what Andrew Ng did in 2012 at Google. Ng\u2019s breakthrough was to take these neural networks, and essentially make them huge, increase the layers and the neurons, and then run massive amounts of data through the system to train it. In Ng\u2019s case it was images from 10 million YouTube videos. Ng put the \u201cdeep\u201d in deep learning, which describes all the layers in these neural networks. Today, image recognition by machines trained via deep learning in some scenarios is better than humans, and that ranges from cats to identifying indicators for cancer in blood and tumors in MRI scans. Google\u2019s AlphaGo learned the game, and trained for its Go match \u2014 it tuned its neural network \u2014 by playing against itself over and over and over. Thanks to Deep Learning, AI Has a Bright Future Deep Learning has enabled many practical applications of Machine Learning and by extension the overall field of AI. Deep Learning breaks down tasks in ways that makes all kinds of machine assists seem possible, even likely. Driverless cars, better preventive healthcare, even better movie recommendations, are all here today or on the horizon. AI is the present and the future. With Deep Learning\u2019s help, AI may even get to that science fiction state we\u2019ve so long imagined. You have a C-3PO, I\u2019ll take it. You can keep your Terminator. ",
