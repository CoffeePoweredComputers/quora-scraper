            "answer_text": "Ever heard of electromagnetic waves before? Electromagnetic waves are waves that do not need any medium to move or travel. That definition is actually not important and is not the answer to your question. There are basically *seven electromagnetic waves and I have listed them in descending order of wavelength and simultaneously, ascending order of frequency: Radio WavesInfrared RaysVisible LightUltra-Violet RaysX-RaysGamma RaysCosmic RaysAccording to this list then, radio waves can travel the farthest but have the lowest frequency while cosmic rays have the highest frequency but cannot travel very far. Radio waves are what carry information wirelessly. Most wireless telecommunication devices use radio waves. Wi-Fi, Cellphones, Bluetooth, you name it! They all use radio waves. There\u2019s something about electromagnetic waves you should know. All electromagnetic waves, no matter how small their frequency or wavelength may be are very dangerous. Too much exposure to electromagnetic waves can cause cancer and other abnormal-growth-of-cells diseases. This is why we are advised not to keep our phones on sensitive parts of our body. Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer among men, and usually, this is caused by too much radio waves close to the groin. Men are advised to avoid keeping their cellphones and other similar devices in their front pockets, because this is too close to the scrotum. Keeping your cellphones in your bag, in your back pockets or in a cellphone holster is not so bad. This could hypothetically save your life. Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women. I actually don\u2019t know what causes this one or how to prevent it but I can hypothetically say that perhaps, breast cancer is mainly caused by inherited genes. Prostate cancer is also caused by inherited genes, though. To answer your question, cellphones and other devices sure do emit radiation which is harmful to the human body. *I believe that there is one more electromagnetic wave, which is the microwave, but I really don\u2019t know where this one is.

            "answer_text": "Electromagnetic waves are produced by the motion of electrically charged particles. These waves are also called electromagnetic radiation because they radiate from the electrically charged particles. According to their frequency and energy, electromagnetic waves can be classified as either ionizing radiations or non-ionizing radiations (NIR). Ionizing radiations are extremely high frequency electromagnetic waves (X-rays and gamma rays), which have enough photon energy to produce ionization by breaking the atomic bonds that hold molecules in cells together. Non-ionizing (NIR) is a term for that part of the electromagnetic spectrum which has photon energies too weak to break atomic bonds. They include ultraviolet radiation, infrared radiation, radiofrequency and microwave fields. NIR can not cause ionization however have been shown to produce other biological effects, for instance by heating, altering chemical reactions or inducing electrical currents in tissues and cells. There are four subgroups of electromagnetic radiation fields with frequency and intensity. This electromagnetic spectrum begins at a frequency of 1 Hertz ( Hz), which is 1 wave per second.  We are interested in Radio Frequency (RF) which includes the frequencies between 100 kHz and 300 GHz of the electromagnetic spectrum. RF sources is widespread used in whole world. Majority examples are mobile phones, broadcasting, medical and industrial applications.  The RF sources are used in different frequency bands and subdivided in different categories: Sources operated close to the human body (mobiles, WLAN), Sources operated far away from the human body (base stations), Medical applications (therapeutic applications such as soft tissue healing appliances, hyperthermia for cancer treatment). A discussion about the adverse effects of electromagnetic waves on the biological life has been ongoing since the discovery of electricity in the 19th century. The general opinion is that there is no direct evidence of hazardous effects on human health incurred by low-frequency radiofrequency waves. Studies at the cellular level, which uses relatively higher frequencies, demonstrate undesirable effects. In recent years there are a lot of studies about effects of EMF on cellular level; DNA, RNA molecules, some proteins, and hormones, intracellular free radicals, and ions are shown. Epidemiologic evidence compiled in the past ten years starts to indicate an increased risk, in particular for brain tumor, from mobile phone use. Because of mobile phones used close the brain tissue, electromagnetic waves affects it the most. The magnitude of the brain tumor risk is moderate. A literature search on \u2018mobile phone use and cancer \u2018in Pubmed lists more than 350 studies. More than half of all of these studies is related to brain tumors. At present, evidence for a causal relationship between mobile phone use and brain tumors relies predominantly on epidemiology, in particular on the large studies on this subject. However, the etiopathogenesis of this causal relationship is not clear. The absence of this clear etiology even raise doubts about the cause itself. Weak evidence in favor of a causal relationship is provided by some animal and in vitro studies, but overall, genotoxicity assays, both in vivo and in vitro, are inconclusive to date. ",
