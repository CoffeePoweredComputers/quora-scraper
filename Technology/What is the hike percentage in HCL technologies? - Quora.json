I worked for HCL-CODC for a couple of years People who work hard and done some kind of value add to the project will be considered as distinguished performer and percentage varies from 12\u201316 If you work normally on day to day basis and meet/exceeds your performance goal then you are considered as Good performer and percentage varies from 8\u201312 If you done average contribution to the project then you will get meets expectation which is around 4\u20138% If you have done some mess in the production and some escalations from client Project manager then you will be awarded Need improvement and some part of your CTC will be reduced in this case. The above percentages are given if you are under 10years exp. and sometimes it varies on case to case basis. If there is a lot of dependency on you then the above figures will get drifted to 20\u201325. Hope, It answers your question :) ",
