            "answer_text": "What I understand from this question is what are the basic ways of finding a website which has useful information or some sort of functionality to serve or facilitate your research needs. Well, there are mainly three ways of finding a web site you need. These are search engines, directories and links from other trusted websites. Search engines are the most preferred (and in most cases the easisest) way to find the web content you are looking for. You can find many websites related to your search query in less than one second. You can compare alternatives and find the best site serving your needs easily. This way is the best for finding popular materials and services. However, there is also a lot of junk, misleading and malicious material. And anether issue is that search engines work without any human interruption. So if you cannot find the correct keywords for your query, you may end up it with surfing a lot of unrelated websites which do not have what you are looking for. Directories are collections of links generally collected and organized by human beings. As a human being checks the relevancy of a website before adding it to a directory, a good directory will in general lead you to a good site. And for the same reason, it is less likely that you will be directed to a junk or misleading website from a directory. However, constructing and keeping such directories updated is much more time consuming. Finding a good directory related to your search topic might be difficult and even if you find it, finding the specific content you are looking for will be more difficult compared to search engines. In general, you need to search through the layers of a table of contents rather than searching by keywords. And the last way trusted websites. Well, if you have already found a good website about your research topic, these website may include links to other websites having similar or complementary content. And these websites are most likely to be good websites as they are backlinked by a good website. What are the examples of search engines or directories? Google (leader of the search engine market), Bing, Yandex, DuckDuckGo, and Yahoo are widely used examples of search engines. For directories, Yellow Pages, Internet Public Library, Curlie Directory, and A1 Web Directory are among good examples. For trusted sites, it is up to you to find them based on what you are looking for. Saying all of this, searching web effectively requires both knowledge about search tols and also some experience. It is rather an art to find the website having the content what you are looking for in a short time period. ",
