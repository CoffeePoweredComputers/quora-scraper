            "answer_text": "Thank you for the question. This has happened to me before, once on Windows XP and once on Windows 7. For Windows 10, there is a \u201cRepair Windows\u201d option in your diagnostic blue-screen popup menus (it is in there, but I can\u2019t recall the step-by-step directions as I write this). You may access that on the opening screen before Windows starts. What I would do: Reboot your PC while holding the F8 key to enter SAFE mode. [ For Windows 7 and earlier - that will work (not sure about Win10) ] Then run System Restore** and select a date before the update. From my experience, 90% of the time it works all of the time. :-) Apart from that, review the other answers and see what will help your situation (since you did not mention what Windows version you are using). Happy hacking! ** Substituted from original text (Windows Recovery was incorrect - thank you to Richard Taylor for correcting my bad memory!) ",
