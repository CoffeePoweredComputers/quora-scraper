            "answer_text": "Yes, almost all 3D modeling tools are highly programmable via scripting.  I have not used Revit, but Autocad has built in scripting via AutoLISP and Rhino can be programmed with Rhinoscript or Python. Other popular 3D modelling tools such as Blender, Maya, 3DS Max, and MODO all use Python as the scripting language of choice, and allow you to extract data about faces, vertices and edges fairly easily.  You can even build models with scripts and create custom creation tools. Python is quickly becoming the standard for 3D program scripting, and in many ways the scripts for one application will look similar to those for other apps.  You mention that you are familiar with Ruby, which is similar to Python.  They are both pretty easy-to-learn programming languages with a natural language feel.   Whatever 3D software you decide to use will probably be programmable via scripting.  Just search the documentation for your software and I am sure you will find a large section with a ton of examples.

            "answer_text": "What do you actually mean by \"extract their sections at specific heights\"? Export 2D section drawings? Export numeric data? Autocad isn't the best 3d modelling tool. It's a bit long in the tooth now, and although its still available, it's generally used for 2D drafting. The 3D side has been superseded, but to the best of my knowledge, most 3d modellers have a scripting language. SketchUp uses Ruby, it's free, easy to use, and has a very active community of plugin developers. It's also one of the most popular 3D applications. ",
