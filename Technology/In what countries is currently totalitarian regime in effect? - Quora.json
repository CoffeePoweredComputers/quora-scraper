After reading a little And trying to understand there governments. it a option. Im Not saying my list is better then any one else. Some U mite have Hurd of others no so much.

And They had have many in America for education and business. In Washington DC they have a whole building. And the Police are at there call. For any issues. The brains behind 911 Osama bin Laden is a family member. Trump was there about 7 mouths ago working on a arms deal. That did sale arms just promise to. The role family.

We Shoot way in and push them out. breeding the government to take control. like nothing happen. I ended With North Korea because in the news And what not talked about is Why they are investing in missiles and Nuclear weapons. China is next door. just a simple river called Yalu River Bridges Sino Korea Friendship Bridge, New Yalu Bridge just a few. There like No real security that stops China from sending good to and from North Korea. Trucks every day it like going from one state to next. North Korea not worried aboutChina invading. long time traders. And if china did North could hole them back. And China not worried the North Korea going attack them. China has send people to help North create missiles and Nuclear weapons. IF we attack the North Korea we would hurt and kill many China people. And if North used it on the south it would hurt and kill there own people. To build these weapons is not hard because all been done before. But does take people who can make metals and fuels and treat uranium. It not like they have the best education system or skills to build. they need help. Step in China. It not talked about. And sadly We have are hands tied. North Korea want keep power and be on the world stage, as a equal. And They may have a military Not as big, But hard ass they are. They take orders and every man woman is part of that System. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, since you said currently, you obviously don\u2019t mean in the past, although some past totalitarian nations have been the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Today, though, there are only three as far as I know: Iraq, China and North Korea. North Korea is clearly a totalitarian nation, as you hear from the media. The government has absolute power and the people aren\u2019t allowed their own views, sometimes on pain of death. However, one thing should be made clear; there are NO stereotypes. Just because I said \u201cabsolute power\u201d, does not make it \u201cunquestioned power\u201d. To think that people have whole different brains (almost like a second species) is nothing but racist. The people there are the same as you or I, but they are just accustomed to their particular way of life. As for China, it may not be the thing that comes to mind when somebody says the word. With that said, the definition of totalitarianism is, relating to a system of government that is centralized and dictatorial and requires complete subservience to the state (Google Dictionary). Now that you know that, you can see how China is totalitarian. It may not be as profound as North Korea, but it is a communist country officially. This, on our world, means that the government knows exactly what they want to do and do it, but keep the people in check by saying, \u201cEverybody is equal here!\u201d One great book to read about this topic is Animal Farm, which is about instant, total power and how those who take advantage of that are corrupted. So, now we have established that China is totalitarian in its own way, we can move onto Iraq. This is the example of totalitarianism that is just pure evil. Iraq wasn\u2019t totalitarian before one man: Saddam Hussein. In his idea of the perfect country, he had complete control and surveillance over his country\u2019s population. Those who disagreed with his ways were kidnapped then tortured and brutally beheaded in public. Not so fun fact: Hussein was the first leader of all time who allowed the use of bio-weapons against his own populace. One man, al-Shaikh Yahya, tried to resist this, but he was arrested and sent to prison. I will not repeat what happened to him, but if you really want to know, click this link. It goes into greater detail than I wish to about all his crimes, including the methods of torture he favoured All media is owned by him, and some is fabricated by him. He also committed genocide multiple times against ethnic or religious groups he didn\u2019t agree with, such as the Kurdish, Shi\u2019a and Kuwaiti peoples. However, in 2003, he was hanged because the people couldn\u2019t bear his life. There are few people in the world that I wish dead, but the world is definitely a better place without this evil man. The country isn\u2019t back to normal yet, but without another Saddam Hussein, they will get there in the future. The moral of this story is that when you do terrible things, people don\u2019t forget and they definitely don\u2019t forgive. To avoid this sort of backlash, don\u2019t do the disgusting things to start with. Thanks for reading! ",
