            "answer_text": "Yes, there is: it is WiFi. In fact, most reviewers would agree, I think, that WiFi is preferable to Bluetooth as it is more stable and provides higher quality transmission. If you use Sonos speakers, for example, they are wirelessly connected among each other, i.e. they only need a mains connection each while the music is transmitted via WiFi. You can stream music from the Internet or transmit music from your iPhone to the speakers via AirPlay 2.

            "answer_text": "Yes, the old way. Get a FM radio transmitter (usually used to connect a tape player\u2019s audio output). It has a 88\u2013108 MHz output. Then connect a small FM receiver and tune it to the frequency of the transmitters output frequency. Feed the audio output jack to the external speaker. ",
