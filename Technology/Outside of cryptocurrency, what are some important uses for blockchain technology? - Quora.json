            "answer_text": "This is a very crucial question that most people tend not to pay attention to as it is usually viewed with a myopic view or rather narrowly related to crypto currency alone but we need to understand the roots of what we discussing in order to properly achieve and understand the intent of the question in subject here , so we might as well start with the question what is cryptography and why is the blockchain employed for it\u2019s use? WHAT IS CRYPTOGRAPHY ? The method of translating ordinary plain text into unintelligible text is synonymous with cryptography, and vice-versa. It is a way of storing and distributing information in a specific form such that it can be read and interpreted by only those by which it is intended. Not only does cryptography shield information from manipulation or modification, but it can also be used for authentication by users. Earlier cryptography was efficiently associated with secrecy, but cryptography today is largely focused on mathematical theory and practice in computer science. SCOPES OF CRYPTOGRAPHY Confidentiality - Information cannot be understood by anyone which is why studying on how crypto currency can be protected is very essential. CRYPTO RIG MINER & REVIVAL (RV-64)TECH (DIGITAL CURRENCY REVERSAL TECH) Integrity - Information cannot be altered. Non-repudiation - Sender cannot deny his/her intentions in the transmission of the information at a later stage Authentication - Sender and receiver can confirm each Cryptography is used in many applications like banking transactions cards, computer passwords, and e- commerce transactions. MODRN CRYPTOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES Symmetric-key Cryptography: Both the sender and receiver share a single key. The sender uses this key to encrypt plaintext and send the cipher text to the receiver. On the other side the receiver applies the same key to decrypt the message and recover the plain text.Public-Key Cryptography: This is the most revolutionary concept in the last 300-400 years. In Public-Key Cryptography two related keys (public and private key) are used. Public key may be freely distributed, while its paired private key, remains a secret. The public key is used for encryption and for decryption private key is used.Hash Functions: No key is used in this algorithm. A fixed-length hash value is computed as per the plain text that makes it impossible for the contents of the plain text to be recovered. Hash functions are also used by many operating systems to encrypt passwords.WHY BLOCKCHAIN IS USED FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY ? Decentralized networks that need a cryptocurrency may be allowed by blockchains. The blockchain is the technology that functions as the public ledger which enables trust to be established by a network. Distributed consensus allows transactions to be monitored by the network , which allows value which knowledge transfer. The tokens used within these networks to transfer value and pay for these transfers are cryptocurrencies, or to have network rewards. In addition, you can see them on the blockchain as a tool, acting as a resource or service in certain situations, or also digitizing an asset's possession. OTHER USES OF BLOCKCHAIN APART FROM CRYPTO CURRENCY Medical Records - Almost all of us have electronic medical records. They contain very sensitive, very confidential information and are prone to cyber-attacks. MedRec has discovered a way to make our medical records more secure by using the blockchain. \"Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) attempt imagination. The advancement of technology in medical data collection has been stifled by years of legislation, whilst an assortment of incompatible back-end processes and inconsistent data trails hinder the ability of patients to share in their medical records. MedRec is shown as a remedy that is adapted to the needs of patients, the care group and medical sciences. MedRec incorporates novel, blockchain smart contracts through providers to create a shared information management framework for the healthcare details. Election Frauds - There's another matter that gets as much buzz as blockchain does, perhaps. Elections or election manipulation is a problem that is in some cases overlooked and overestimated by many people. For eg, almost anyone who likes Bernie Sanders is not a \"Russian bot.\" Plus, it is highly unlikely that people will partake in voting fraud. Although the polling devices used in the United States are rather vulnerable, and interfering with international votes presents a definite danger to cybersecurity. The creators of Obey My Vote have found a way to make democratic elections safer by using blockchain. Voting is rife with claims of illegitimacy today. This is primarily due to the existing structures and procedures in use, which can be particularly fragile. Refugee Aids - Every year, millions of individuals worldwide become refugees. For others, becoming a refugee is a risky and frightening experience. And refugees are mostly weak and need financial assistance urgently. Syria's instability is an unfortunate instance of a massive humanitarian disaster. Blockchain, join. One of the biggest-ever Ethereum blockchain applications for a humanitarian cause has just completed a fruitful trial. Chronicled - I am not a solicitor. Yet I get legal papers emailed to me as a licensed freelancer, such as job contracts and NDAs. I typically fill them out with an invoice for PDF editing and my written signature, then send the edited PDF back to the group that first emailed me the contract. Yet I don't see near as many court papers as a lawyer or a paralegal does anywhere. Usually, legal records contain classified material. With a blockchain deployment, Chronicled has its own technologies for securing knowledge. Chronicled can not only capture and protect legal records, but also supply chain, IoT monitoring, and various other types of data. They have an entire framework that integrates IoT, NFC, Bluetooth and blockchain for smartphone applications. ",

            "answer_text": "Since it is getting a lot of attention lately, there has been a proper demand for it if we\u2019re talking about integration and collaboration. I have been seeing platform that seems to me jack of all trades and was able to provide the convenience and resolution to whichever industry they are currently working at. One example would be Symbol from NEM, that focuses on what matters most during these pandemic. Given that most of us are transacting online, conducting our businesses as well as sorting our financial assets, by using a trusted, secure value exchange network for business. Symbol smooths business friction, increasing the flow of data and innovation to supercharge the creation, exchange and protection of assets. If we are talking about security, Symbol comes with built-in safety features that take the worry away. Our contract plug-in framework makes Symbol more resilient to human error and network attacks. Flexibility wouldn\u2019t be a problem since Symbol is interoperable to fit around you. Our APIs ensure seamless integration with existing enterprise systems and processes, as well as other networks and blockchains. And lastly, Symbol speed and efficiency is unmatched. Our tiered architecture and plug-in solutions improve flexibility, speed up processing and development time, and lowering costs. I can\u2019t really pinpoint what is really important right now, but it really depends as to where you\u2019ll be using a blockchain platform in your own way. If that reason would be relevant to you, then it will be applicable and truly important for you. ",
