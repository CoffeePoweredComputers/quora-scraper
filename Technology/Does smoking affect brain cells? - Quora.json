            "answer_text": "One thing that you are doing, is that you are depriving your neurons from a constant flow of oxygen, which your neurons need in order to preform their cellular function. Nicotine is a stimulant which reduces your appetite, as a result you are cutting down on your consumption of glucose which your brain needs as an energy source. Not to mention other nutrients that your brain desperately needs. Your brain is 2% of your total body mass yet it uses up 20% of your body's energy. Gotta feed the brain. Nicotine stimulates your brain, but if it doesn't have the proper amounts of oxygen and glucose, it is like expecting a car to run on fumes with a sealed exhaust and you hitting on the gas. It just won't work. Best advice is to drop smoking, it honestly is like carpet bombing your own body with carcinogens, if anything jump on those e-cigs they have the nicotine (that you crave)  but none of those added chemicals that give you that \"smooth\" taste...and cancer. But keep in mind that to improve your cognition and concentration drop all of it. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Smoking is the worst thing you can do to ALL the cells of the body. Nicotine is a stimulant, but when one has constant stimulation the brain cells reach a threshold and the effect no longer works. In a sense, the brain becomes refractory to the effect. Similarly, a muscle cell when constantly stimulated reaches a point where it no longer contracts. The body needs resting periods and will cease to respond to constant stimulation. ",
