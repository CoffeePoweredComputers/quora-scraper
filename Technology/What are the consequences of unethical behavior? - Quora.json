            "answer_text": "This is simple, the consequences of unethical behavior is that we end up hurting ourselves and other people. A consequence of acting ethically is that we build up the common good and life for everyone becomes better including for ourselves. Our ethical behavior reinforces norms and expectations that leads to a just society. We help to create a culture where ethical behavior is reinforced and human beings can flourish. I don\u2019t see migrations of people leaving just and equitable social conditions. People leave situations where life has become intolerable due to the consequences of some kind of injustice whether it be economic disparities, suppression of basic human freedoms or acts of war and violence. We think that we are just one person and that what we do has little significance or no one will know anyway and that we can get away with it. That kind of thinking is the beginning of slippery slope of trying to justify what we know to be wrong. What we do matters and has consequences for other people. When you think of some of the people in this world who have made a difference, people like Martin Luther King, Elie Wiesel, Mother Teresa and Malala Yousafzai; these people didn\u2019t just happen, but they were formed by the consequences of their own life choices in relation to the circumstances surrounding them. None could have known in the moment, the full impact of their actions or decisions, but the world is a better place because of them. I am grateful for each one of these people. No one can think of themselves in isolation from other people. The choices we make and what we do matters and impacts the world either for the better or for the worse. ",
