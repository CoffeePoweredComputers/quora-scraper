            "answer_text": "Well then, it\u2019s obvious. Everyone is automatically disconnected from the meeting. Duh. What Zoom probably doesn\u2019t know (or does, but doesn\u2019t care) is that the 40 minute time limit is rather useless. This is because everyone can just reconnect immediately. You\u2019d think they would put a time limit or something before you can reconnect. However, I highly doubt they care anyway. They must be making so much money because of the pandemic. If it were me, I won\u2019t care either. The only thing this 40 minute limit serves as is random interruptions. Kind of like Spotify: \u201cTo listen without interruptions, get Premium!\u201d Does anyone know of anything which keeps bugging you to get Premium, asides from Zoom and Spotify? I\u2019m putting a random image to throw you off:  Have you guessed it Yet? You\u2019ve had long enough. Your answers are: 1. YouTube Seriously, are you gonna pay for YouTube premium? I thought as much.     2. WinRAR I have to end here. This answer has diverted so much from the main point. ",

Secondly if you hook up with more then 1 person then the 40 minute limitation kicks in. The last time (appx 6 weeks ago) I had 5 people on and a warning came on saying that the 40 minutes is up and because of the extenuating circumstance now they are not cutting you off at 40 minutes. It didn\u2019t cut us off. I have since then purchased a Pro Version for a year. We have been using this in our business extensively the last few weeks. ",
