Good broadband providers are BSNL and AIRTEL in vijaynagar area AIRTEL-in terms of speed and customer service airtel is best but its plans are bit costly and come with limited data and speed restriction after consumption of some data. BSNL- my friend using BSNL broadband unlimited plan(with speed bar on data usage), and its working fine, no connection drop and quite responsive service in that area in contrast with bsnl image :P so its a reasonable option. Now about tikona, as per my experience sometime it sucks, and service is poor.. My friend also gave same review for tikona. Also in airtel and bsnl there are landline cum broadband plans, see them also. ",
