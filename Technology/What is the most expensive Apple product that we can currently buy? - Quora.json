The base model is available costing \u00a34,899 and comes with an 8-core Intel Xeon processor, 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. But options include up to 18-core processors, where most machines are either dual or quad-core, AMD\u2019s workstation-class graphics cards such as the Radeon Pro Vega 64, up to 128GB of RAM and up to 4TB of SSD storage, all of which read like computer Top Trumps cards. The top-spec machine costs \u00a312,279. According to Apple, it\u2019s people working with \u201creal-time 3D rendering, immersive VR, intensive developer workflows, high megapixel photography, complex simulations, massive audio projects and real-time 4K and 8K video editing\u201d who need that kind of processing power.

            "answer_text": "Currently a Mac Pro with or without extras.  Next month it will be an Apple Watch although you might still be able to pile on enough extras onto a Mac Pro to beat out the $17,000 Apple Watch. Without any external accessories you can get it up to $9,599. With every available extra (this includes third party hardware) I can get it up to $21,939.88. So I think it still beats the Apple Watch.    ",
