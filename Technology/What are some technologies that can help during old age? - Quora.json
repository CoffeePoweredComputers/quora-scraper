I haven\u2019t needed that help yet, but it brings me peace of mind knowing I could call if necessary. My phone could also be used to find me, if I were incapacitated. Bonus points for that. My phone is my audio book reader so I am entertained when I want to be lost in a story. my phone is my GPS, which keeps me from getting lost. Which saves me frustration and confusion. My phone is my camera so I can document my memories and share them My phone could be my blood sugar monitor tracker although I eat so healthy now I no longer need to track my blood sugars. My phone has several games that I use to keep my mind sharp\u2026 My phone tells me how hot or cold it is outside as well as predictions for the next 10 days so I can plan any auto travel to days where no storms are predicted. My phone has my calendar so I don\u2019t miss appointments that may be important to my overall health My phone has my grocery list so I make it home with everything I need My phone allows me to text those whom I really don\u2019t want to talk to\u2026which saves me quite a bit of frustration My husband\u2019s phone monitors his heart rate, and can allow a print out to take to his cardiologist\u2026 So much a phone can do and I can no longer imagine my life without a smart phone.

            "answer_text": "As we are into healthcare for elderly, we will discuss about how technology can be used for enabling better health in older age. Medical Devices and Equipment - This is the commonest use of technology in its physical form. Eg, walkers, wheelchair, Digital BP machine, Diabetes self-check kit, etc.Medical Apps - Although not used widely, many medical apps are being developed for multiple uses from Saving medical records and sharing them with a doctor to online tele-consultation with doctors across the globe. Elderly should make good use of these to get a quick opinion on simpler health issues.Diagnosis and Treatment- Today, medtech advance has led to easy and accurate diagnosis and treatment which make patient experience hassle free and convenient. Eg, robotic surgery and laparoscopic surgeries reduce the complications, enable quick recovery and improve post operative outcomes.Education and awareness - With so many avenues of information now available, elderly can get themselves educated by following social channels of renowned medical organisations across the world (however we detest the use of online search engines and non-medical sources for receiving medical advice; only authentic information sources should be relied upon).If you wish to know more about tech for old age, you may write to us at hello@medinhealthcare.com.
