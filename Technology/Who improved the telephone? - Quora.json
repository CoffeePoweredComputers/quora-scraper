            "answer_text": "Through the years, the telephone and network were continually upgraded through the R&D efforts of Bell Laboratories. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T. Bell Labs employed scientists from all disciplines and their research was not limited to telecommunications. They are credited with the development of the transistor, lasers, and many other advances in IT and telecommunications. Many Nobel prizes were awarded to researchers at the Labs. After the Bell System was broken up Bell Labs continued but on a lesser scale, spun off to support the newly formed \u201cBaby Bells\u201d. Eventually, Nokia purchased and continued the R&D efforts. As indicated by Nokia\u2019s investment, and especially with the advent of cellular technology, manufacturers have continued the R&D efforts to their own benefit. If you look at Qualcomm especially, you see a new wave of patents and improvements down to the microchip level within systems. All the major Telecom companies continue the race to improve communications at all levels of the \u201ctelephone\u201d. ",
