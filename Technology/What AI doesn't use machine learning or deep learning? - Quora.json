            "answer_text": "Artificial Intelligence can roughly be stated as, giving machines the ability to make intelligent decisions themselves, the work which humans can easily do (Whether humans take intelligent decisions or not is a matter of discussion). For a better understanding of applications where machine learning is not used, it is quite useful to know both the applications where it is used and where it\u2019s not. How can computers gain the ability to do things like a human, there are two ways: Definite sets of rules are given to computers. (Not ML/DL)Computers learn all by themselves. (ML/DL)In the first approach, we have definite sets of rules which we provide to the machines and they act according to the rules, and such behavior can be considered as intelligent behaviors. For example, we define rules for driving a car as we tell it to accelerate when speed is to low and there are no cars ahead and apply brakes when it encounters a speed breaker or an obstacle is in the way. So, according to the rules and logic defined, the system works and perform. This is called Knowledge-Based Approach of AI. This approach is not machine learning as the computer or the machine is not learning anything instead it has been provided with the rules and doing some logical inference the computers take decisions. The drawback of the first approach is that it doesn't perform well in many cases and rely on the rules provided by the human. Places where we can use or some people use the Knowledge-Based approach are simple chatbots, not all chatbots use machine learning and NLP to learn better, some use grammar and synonym rules and some logic to answer the queries. Machine learning approach turned out to be better at making computers intelligent than knowledge-based approach, therefore mostly it is being used for modern applications. There can be many possible applications of this approach, we can create a rule-based car driving system. In the second approach, we don\u2019t give rules to the computers to behave, instead, it learns automatically to behave well. It learns using the data provided by man and automatically devises the correct rules to behave in various situations like predicting some value, classifying any entity and many more things. This approach where the computers learn all by themselves provided the data is called Machine Learning. If computers need to identify real-world entities i.e. Computer Vision, we can use machine learning approach where it will learn to identify. Deep learning models are performing exceptionally well in this field. If computers need to understand a language i.e. Natural Language processing, we can use machine learning approach to train a computer to understand human language. Same way, we can use machine learning and deep learning to perform various tasks arisen from a variety of needs like the need for recognizing speech, need of new scientific discoveries, leading to a variety of ML and DL applications like speech recognition, DL helping in protein folding problem, etc. The knowledge-based approach is an example of an approach where we do not use ML/DL, we can think of and invent various approaches to give the ability for computers to make intelligent decisions. It might have been quite longer read, I hope this would have cleared your doubts. Still, need any clearance of further doubts, feel free to ask. ",

            "answer_text": "Machine learning is HOT these days. It\u2019s tough to find a modern example of an AI application that doesn\u2019t rely on ML or one of its many children, like Deep Learning. This is because Machine Learning is really just a sexy pseudonym for applied statistics. ML has had a ton of success recently with probabilistic models, hence more people are spending time on ML-based AI. So what we\u2019re really looking for in an answer to this question is, \u201cWhat is an AI system that doesn\u2019t rely on statistics?\u201d We can definitely find one of those :) We might have to take a look back, however. As other answers have pointed out, expert systems are a good example. They use a list of rules to convert an input into an output. The process is completely deterministic and can be tuned by hand to produce the correct results. Think of it as a series of if-then expressions. Although not really an expert on anything, the ELIZA therapist project works like this. As a \u201cpatient\u201d of ELIZA, you talk to it and ELIZA responds to you and prompts you to keep talking. But behind the scenes there is no comprehension \u2014 ELIZA simply matches the structure of your statement to a pre-defined response. i.e. \u201cI love breakfast food\u201d will prompt ELIZA to respond with \u201cWhy do you love breakfast food?\u201d even though ELIZA only understands \u201cI love (X)\u201d and simply reformats your input. Not what I\u2019d call intelligent. We can only go so far when all the intelligence of your AI has to be hardcoded in advance. That\u2019s why we now rely on probabilistic models, because they can capture possibilities beyond simply \u201cif x then y.\u201d ",
