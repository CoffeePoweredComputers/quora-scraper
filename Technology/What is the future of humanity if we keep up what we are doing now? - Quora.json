            "answer_text": "Not much different than in the past decades, centuries, millenia, IMO. But today we have more powerful tools that are accessible to an enormous number of people on earth\u2026.and this seems to be increasing. Of course the upside is an ability to (continue to) make impressive advancements for many of the people on earth\u2026.and some trickle down (less impressive but still very significant) benefits for many others, as well. But we should never forget that more powerful tools in the hands of more people also increases the probability of accidental and deliberate catastrophes. Some catastrophes are local (be they accidental or deliberate) but not all are local. Predatory opportunists will always exist\u2026.always. So if they have access to these ever increasing tools as well, global catastrophes are almost surely to result. I would not be at all surprised if someday we find that COVID-19 was part of some experimenting that was taking place and an accident (maybe deliberately, maybe not) occurred. I believe HIV release was similar with medical professionals in Africa involved in \u201cthe accident\u201d. A disgruntled employee, a passionate activist or someone bypassing safety/handling procedures (to expedite a result, maybe or laziness or inattention) can rather easily \u201ccause an accident\u201d as well as true accidents that can occur (spills, machine failures, etc.). I don\u2019t mean to scare anyone but IMO, the likelihood of these types of \u201cpowerful tech\u201d unpleasant occurrences will be on the increase, not decrease. So it\u2019s how these potentialities are regulated, monitored and handled that will likely determine how risky or safe our future as a species will be. Note the HIV initiated in Africa and COVID-19 in China\u2026.both are regions with less candor+openness in what is taking place, compared to more well monitored western areas. Most westerners would surely be shocked by what they would see if they were observing the location of and at the actual accident/release. Knowledge (and the tools to use it) cannot advance faster than Wisdom without these issues arising. Handing freedoms to children (or childish adults) who lack wisdom is a recipe for eventual disasters. I hope this helps. ",

Were allowing our wildlife or even causing its extinctions of the creatures that we're supposed to be sharing this planet with, when things get offset by mankind's greed and ignorance, This is what happens, its happened before and will happen again if we as the thinkers and doers cant control what we do , like using our natural resources and exploiting our own people because we have no accountability or oversight in our manufacturers of the things we discovered and the way we go about it theres no balance Pharmacutical companies are selling us poison and causing the suffering and death of millions of there own , without a second thought all to ensure them, and there relatives an easy and safe life for generations to come, all for a dollar? We pollute our oceans and kill all life within , erect steal and concrete jungles because it gives the people the sence of security, news flash theres no security in life, it doesn't exist in nature therefor it doesn't exist at all, just the illusion does, same thing with relationships again an illusion that were not alone on this earth, we were born alone and bareassed and we'll die that way. So in closing I'd like to remind you and I'm sure this virus has everyone's attention, we as humans are not the boss , were not in charge and we will be held accountable for our behaviors, this is mother nature telling us who's really the boss, of balance it's all about balance and respect, and when things get warped nature kicks in and balances things out, all life needs to be respected, so be kind be respectful and remember we share this incredible planet with the life that the creator put hear. It's time to learn , and this is our lesson.\u262e ",
