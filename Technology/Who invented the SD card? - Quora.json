            "answer_text": "Who invented flash memory? Flash was originally developed by Toshiba electrical engineer Fujio Masuoka, who filed US Patent 4,531,203 on the idea with colleague Hisakazu Iizuka back in 1981. Originally known as simultaneously erasable EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), it earned the nickname \"flash\" because it could be instantly erased and reprogrammed\u2014as fast as a camera flash. At that time, state-of-the-art erasable memory chips (ordinary EPROMS) took 20 minutes or so to wipe for reuse with a beam of ultraviolet light, which meant they needed expensive, light-transparent packaging. Cheaper, electrically erasable EPROMS did exist, but used a bulkier and less efficient design that required two transistors to store each bit of information. Flash memory solved these problems. Toshiba released the first flash chips in 1987, but most of us didn't come across the technology for another decade or so, after SD memory cards first appeared in 1999 (jointly supported by Toshiba, Matsushita, and SanDisk). SD cards allowed digital cameras to record hundreds of photos and made them far more useful than older film cameras, which were limited to taking about 24\u201336 pictures at a time. Toshiba launched the first digital music player using an SD card the following year. It took Apple a few more years to catch up and fully embrace flash technology in its own digital music player, the iPod. Early \"classic\" iPods all used hard drives, but the release of the tiny iPod Shuffle in 2005 marked the beginning of a gradual switchover, and all modern iPods and iPhones now use flash memory instead.
