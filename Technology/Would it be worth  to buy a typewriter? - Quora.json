            "answer_text": "The short answer is yes. But it depends mainly on what you plan to do with it. If you want one simply for the sake of decoration, it may not be worth it. Many of the older and more rare machines can be quite expensive. Unless you really want it as a piece of \u201cart\u201d I would advise against buying a nice machine just to put it on a shelf. If you are going to use it, than that is a different story. Ignore all the people who say old typewriters are delicate relics that shouldn\u2019t be used. That\u2019s not the case. Every typewriter ever sold can be restored and used more vigorously than your laptop computer. Typewriters are sturdy machines that were made for hard work. This is partly why they\u2019re still around, some after a couple hundred years. Machines after 1860s are the ones that are most commonly used for frequent modern writing because they have a modern keyboard. Machines after 1900 are probably your best bet. They have all the necessary features, and are very easy to use. Serviced machines are always your best bet, because a professional has gone over them to make sure they work as they should. The machine itself is always up to the user. Everyone has a different preference. If you\u2019re a writer, or anyone who works with words, and you need a non-digital or a unique way for writing, then a typewriter is definitely worth it. It will probably last longer than you. One machine that will work the same way for the rest of your life. That\u2019s a pretty good bargain. Below is my Royal 10. It has a standard QWERTY keyboard, a shift key, shift lock, backspace, and 84 characters, single, double, and triple spacing. It was made in the early 1930s, has been serviced (by me) and works exactly the same as it did nearly 90 years ago. It is capable of typing neat lines of text at 110 words per minute or higher. I purchased the ribbon from my local office supply store and wound it onto the original spools. I\u2019ve typed thousands and thousands of words on it and never had a single issue.  ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWould it be worth to buy a typewriter?\u201d A functioning, not too collectible typewriter can be had for under fifty bucks. I have several typewriters and the most I paid for one was 80 bucks for a 1938 Erika S that still works like it was made yesterday.  But my most efficient typewriter are my Olympias. I have two SM models: A 1959 SM4 De Luxe with wide carriage that I use the most:  A real beast of a machine, super sturdy but also smooth and practical, though a bit on the heavy side, so I only use it at home. I also have this SM7, which is basically the SM4 in a Sixties coat:  It has a normal size carriage and is easier to transport, but while it\u2019s smooth and easy to type on, it doesn\u2019t have the thwack-attack of the SM4. The SM4 cost me 32 euro (including the 7 euro shipping fee) and the SM7 was 46 euro. Ink ribbon is standard KMP, about 4,50 a piece. While I also write on my computer, I\u2019m currently writing drafts on the Olympias. ",
