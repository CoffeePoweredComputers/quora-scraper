            "answer_text": "Commercial AG in the United States is one of the largest sources of income for us. The United States is the number one ag exporter. We have the ability to produce in great volume which in turn can feed more people. Until politics get into the mix. Lately market prices are down. Farmers have to watch the markets to see what they should and should not plant so they have a better chance of profit at the end of the year. It is a fact that smaller, family owned farms are more efficient than larger commercial operations. Sadly, not enough people in today's world wish to take over their families farms. This leads to land sales which commercial operations or developers buy up land. Once houses are on farmland it is gone. Which makes producing food more difficult. They don't make more land. ",
