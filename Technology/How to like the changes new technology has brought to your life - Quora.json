            "answer_text": "Well, the devices I use of the \u2018New technology\u2019 are just my PC, my phone, and the internet and some other things..Well my PC has brought me\u2026 somethings to do in my leisure time (I haven\u2019t use it that much for my education or my profession, yet) things I do with it, are making short videos or, photo-shopping pictures and surfing the net etc. I got my first PC in 2005 while I was in grade 5, and was 10 y/o. Those days were not good as I didn\u2019t have internet then. I felt like I was living a caveman life or something, when I use my PC just for playing that same gddmn Vice City again and again.. listing to the same set of songs again and again.. watching the same DVDs again and again.. And it\u2019s still a so much CooL thing that I have internet today; like I feel terrible and think it\u2019s not worth having a PC, when my internet capped (in early 2013s) or when it goes bad. So the internet, well it is my main source of energy now. As I eat, drink, sleep, defecate, for all the things I want the internet beside me. I go crazy when my package is over and if I\u2019m in a area without internet, again I feel like a caveman. And I\u2019m not playing online games all the time, well I do not play online games at all, most of the time I do, reading the whole internet out. So I do like that the new technology has brought so many things into my life, (and I\u2019m not upset that I\u2019m too internet dependent, like, I remember living a lone life before the internet, and now I have \u2018something\u2019 to do) And earlier, if I need some songs, I had to go to a \u2018record bar\u2019 to get them on a CD, and I had to pay 100 LKR just for 20 tracks on it, and yes, if I wanted a particular software, again I had to go to a shop and, though it\u2019s a pirated version, I had to pay 100 LKR for a one pirated copy, to the shop.. And the internet had brought me the ability to do those tasks my own. And mobile internet devices like phones, yes they have brought the ease of surfing the web whenever we want, as you don\u2019t want a PC all the time, and not needing a laptop and a dongle with you every time, it\u2019s far more easy to surf the internet when you want to. And when you are reading a book, - as English is my second language - I need a dictionary a lot, so having them integrated in the phone itself gives a ton of ease. And, those Q&A forums, yeah I love them. When you want to just kill time, you can use a site like Quora, or if you need an answer to a question on a particular subject, there are forums like, stackexchange, dereview, xda, reddit etc. And things like IPTV had brought the ease of watching a program later without having to use an OTR or something like that. (We have never use an OTR though). And 4G network is still a miracle to me, as in 2011s, if I need to download a song, I had to put my phone near to an open area of my house, and leave it there for about a minute, for the song to download. So now, I\u2019m fascinated by seeing how fast Opera tells me that the 5mb file has finished downloading, just a 50ms after I tapped download.So yeah, cool thing, technology ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings Tiff, I assume your are asking me this question because of my age\u2026 :-) On a scale of \u2018like-a-ability\u2019 from 1 to 10, I would have to go with a 6\u2026 and that\u2019s being generous; it has taken me years to rate the new technology to reach 6. I spent most of my years working hard in the construction field and I never had to become involved with computers until around 1992 when my wife\u2019s son gave her his old Commodore's Amiga\u2026 that was a challenge, and as it may have had a better running system compared to windows, but it was years behind reality. My wife handled the Amiga, although we had to rely on her son for technical support. Eventually, we upgraded to the windows platform so any documents my wife wrote would be acceptable, to save and send. I still had quite the long learning curve to handle a computer and I spent an entire day with a friend of a friend to show me how to navigate the web; I\u2019m glad I have an astute mind and I learn things very quickly. Without any previous typing skills, I can type with both hands now, using my middle fingers (with the odd ring finger poking a key or two) and spell check comes in very handy\u2026 for an old guy that is! Please, don\u2019t ask about my cellphone skills because I don\u2019t have any, that is, other than turning the cellphone on and off. Texting, nope, do I know how to send photos, nope but I do know how to take a picture; so my pictures haven\u2019t any place to go because I haven\u2019t a clue how to retrieve them off the cellphone or even email them to myself. If I was to get them to my email address, I can handle them there. My wife and I had purchased a smart TV a few years back, and eventually after a few weeks we sold it; we couldn\u2019t stand the woman\u2019s voice speaking when we wanted to change the volume or stations. I tried to tell her to \u2018shut-up\u2019 without any success. Btw, I didn\u2019t have white hair until I found myself paddling aimlessly around, in new technology. Maybe I should revise that 6 to a 4, what-do-you-think? ;-) ",
