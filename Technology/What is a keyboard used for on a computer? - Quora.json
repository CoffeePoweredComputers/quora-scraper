            "answer_text": "A keyboard serves as a Human interface device - Wikipedia or HID. An HID is a peripheral device to a computer which either receives input from the user to be delivered to the computer or receives output from the computer to be received by the user. A keyboard is an input device, as is a mouse. A keyboard delivers datain the form of letters, numbers, and symbols to the computer. Most keyboards can also deliver basic instructions to the computer, such as the enter/return key, ESC key, Ctrl, shift, tab, etc. A mouse transfers movements to the computer as well as some instructions (click, scroll, etc). An example of an output device would be a monitor, ranging from alpha numeric calculator-style displays to full blown 8k editing monitor. USB (universal serial bus) actually has a set specification for HIDs. This helps make USB devices operate as plug'n'play devices, able to function without downloading 3rd party software.

            "answer_text": "The keyboard\u2019s primary use in a computer is as a way for entering data. The keyboard is very easy for humans to use and is a mechanical analogue of human writing (i.e. enter data one letter or character at a time, just like how we write) and so very easy for a human to understand and use. It can also be used to provide non-data input such as feedback and control instructions (in a game you might hold down the \u201cW\u201d key to move forward in the game, or you may press \u201cF7\u201d to change the brightness of your computer display, or even the famous CTRL-ALT-DELETE that kills the Windows OS).
