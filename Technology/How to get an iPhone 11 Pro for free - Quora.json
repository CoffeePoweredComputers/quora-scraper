That\u2019s a thousand dollars. Now do not, I repeat DO NOT go on google and search for free iPhone 11 Pros you WILL get scammed. The only way you are going to be able to get a free iPhone is from a giveaway. Now you can find multiple on Instagram as lots of people do this for followers and make a business off of it. But only do this with verified accounts. Why? Because verified accounts are real people with real followers that Instagram has deemed well to have the verified sticker. My suggestion personally, get a job, save up buy it yourself. I would personally suggest the iPhone 11 over the Pro because it\u2019s $300 cheaper and still a fantastic phone ",
