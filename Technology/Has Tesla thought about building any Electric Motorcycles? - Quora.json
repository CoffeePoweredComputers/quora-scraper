If Tesla do so; with 25KWh. battery for under $20,000 for 250 miles range, as on one ever has it. 250 freeway miles range as up to 400 around town miles. Both ZERO and Harley Davison Live Wire will be dead with too short range. With new battery, Tesla motor boats for hours of fun. ",

Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won\u2019t do road bikes, as too dangerous.
