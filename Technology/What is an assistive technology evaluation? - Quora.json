            "answer_text": "Others are answering this question very appropriately as it is usually considered within the context of evaluating students to determine the tools of technology that can assist in the functionality. However, let me broaden the answer. In this highly technological world, few of us perform our functions without dependence on technology. You cannot submit your question and receive answers from any place in the world without access to technology; farmers use drip irrigation controlled by technology; health care is now administered through smart phones and online education is filling in the gaps while schools are closed due to the corona virus. The trend is that in ten or so years, about 50% of present job descriptions will be obsolete due to digital displacement. We have smart cities, smart buildings, smart phones, smart warehouses and the list is infinite. My point is that each of us is digitally or technologically dependent and we need to do our own self analysis (or if a business to have a professional evaluation made) to determine what knowledge and devices we need to stay current.
