            "answer_text": "They are trying to do as little as possible. They are strongly motivated to NOT do anything. There are four reasons: Almost anything that needs to be done will require an expense on the part of industries and large corporations to reduce emissions, stop pollution and clean up damaged areas. The government gets tons of money from these same corporations to NOT require them to clean up. The lobby efforts and bribe money mean that nothing will be done or if it is, it will be weak and ineffective at any serious cleanup effort.Related to the above is that if the government acknowledges the need for action on climate change, then they are, de facto, admitting that industries have caused the problem. By confirming that, they put all those industries at risk of liability lawsuits which could cost them billions. When the tobacco industry finally was taken to court, they settled the US call action lawsuits for $200 billion and the international class action lawsuit for $365.5 billion. They climate polluting industries will pay the politicians a lot of money to avoid that much litigation.A significant amount of any clean up of the environment or actions to address climate change issues will also require large investments from the government - in the tens of billions per year. This is an expense Congress does not want to spend because there is no immediate payoff or payback. Any benefit is years into the future and the government, in general, never plans that far ahead. They would much rather spend the same money on something that is more likely to garner votes in the next election. Doing anything at all is simply pushed off into the future.Partly due to the propaganda and marketing campaigns by the polluting industries and those facing possible clean up expenses - and partly because this is all new to scientists, there is no clear and simple answer as to what to do. Most of the obvious things like cutting car and industrial emissions actually will have a very small benefit as compared to the cost. One study on the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, said if we invested $1 trillion per year in reducing CO2 emissions for the next 80 years, we will change the resulting climate change by less than 3%. A cost-effective solution has not been discovered yet. Numerous proposed efforts have been lab-tested but not field-tested. Other proposed designs have gone to small scale prototype stage but it is unknown if they can be scaled up to the size needed in a cost-effective manner.Bottom line is that the politicians do not want to spend the money. They are not sure what to spend the money on. And they being bribed to take no action at all. Meanwhile, we have not yet stopped making it worse. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing, apparently. It\u2019s still changing. I don\u2019t think anybody knows how to stop climate change. Look at climate change over millions of years:  The most stable and sustained climate seems to be ice free with average global temperature 25 C. That\u2019s what it was for 85% of earth\u2019s existence, maintained stable for hundreds of millions of years. Life evolved and flourished during those hothouse period. The 5 mass extinctions all happened during ice ages during full glaciation periods. Ice age covers only 15% of earth\u2019s history. I\u2019d say that for natural terrestrial conditions warmer (much warmer than now!) seems to be the rule, colder the exception. We are in an ice age now. We are not in danger of overheating any time soon. We are much more in danger of another mass extinction when the next glaciation comes. It takes 333.55 kJ to melt 1 kg of ice. Multiply that with the total mass of ice on earth to reassure yourself that it would take tens to hundreds of thousands of years for all the ice to melt with the average level of insolation we have now. Only if insolation increases dramatically will ice melt faster than now, and then it would still take thousands of years for all the ice to melt. While the phase change is taking place the water temperatures won\u2019t rise until all the ice melted. The melted cold water will mix with warmer water much better than ice restricted to the polar areas would. Most of the ice on earth (Antarctica and Greenland) is not even in contact with the oceans yet and as it melt will continue to dilute the current heat in the oceans for a very long time. It is quite likely that this would cause the oceans to cool rather than warming which would be a powerful negative feedback preventing runaway warming. It doesn\u2019t seem as if climatologists have thought about the powerful feedback system the water covering 70% of earth\u2019s surface represents. Compared to a trace gas in atmosphere (only 0.04% or 1 / 2500 air molecules) it is laughable to even think that CO2 could overwhelm the climate system. Nothing of that nature has ever been experimentally demonstrated and there isn\u2019t even a scientifically sounding (falsifiable) hypothesis about the mechanism by which CO2 could warm the oceans and melt all the ice. It takes 4200 J heat energy to raise the temperature of 1 liter of water by 1 C. Multiply by the total volume of the liquid on earth. Then explain where the CO2 in the system is hiding with all that heat. We don\u2019t see it now. It can\u2019t be the cause of the warming. ",
