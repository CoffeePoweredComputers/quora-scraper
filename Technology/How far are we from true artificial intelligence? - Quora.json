            "answer_text": "How far away are we from the real Artificial Intelligence? Infinitely far, because no matter what AI achieves, someone will always say \u201cWell, that\u2019s not true intelligence!\u201d And that\u2019s not just sour grapes. Decades ago people used to say that beating world chess champion or translating arbitrary text from one language to another would mean \u201ctrue AI\u201d, because they could not imagine such feats to be done without \u201creal understanding\u201d. Well, both milestones have been surpassed through combination of brute force, clever algorithms and Internet-worth of data, not through actually making computer intelligent \u2014 whatever that means. But ultimately, what does it matter? When a farm can be run by a swarm of robots which are collectively aware of the health and condition of every single corn stalk, and respond to every problem with soil, weather, pests and market vagaries faster than a hundred human farmers could possibly do, who cares that this swarm cannot discuss Hamlet?

            "answer_text": "Very far unless we change the way computer programs are written and they way they work and the machinery used to execute the programs. At this point no computer program is intelligent and there is little hope that our current computer programs will ever be. Intelligence is defined as general cognitive problem-solving skills. A mental ability involved in reasoning, perceiving relationships and analogies, calculating, and learning quickly. Computer programs are written instructions with very well defined limits and set tasks to be done. As long as we continue to develop instructions that are so precise, and do not allow for much deviation, they will never be intelligent. Intelligence is a result of growth experiences, accumulated learning and understanding what is correct or not based on the accumulated learning. Intelligence also requires imagination, inquisitiveness, and risk taking. It is very hard to write programs for all of those qualities and integrate them along with new learning as the brain does. My intelligence and experience with computers says it will be a very long time before we can create that with machines. ",
