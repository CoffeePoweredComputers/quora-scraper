AutoCAD is still the standard for the disciplines that will support your work\u2014subcontractors like plumbers and landscape architects may send .dwg files that you\u2019ll have to import into your project. If you\u2019re a student, you should focus on your hand drafting skills, followed by AutoCAD. Revit is extremely intuitive and easy to learn. If you don\u2019t form a foundation in what you are doing, it won\u2019t be much use to have advanced skills in how to do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly there are so many types out there it's hard to say. It depends on what the designer specializes in & how big their business is. Program's are costly so I use the bare minimum to get by & do a lot of hand drawings because I'm a smaller business. Which ones are you curious about? I've probably heard of a few of them. ",
