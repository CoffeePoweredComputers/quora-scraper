            "answer_text": "Always.  The selection intensity varies greatly, depending on many different factors, but the vast majority of progeny can be considered failures in some sense.  As a plant breeder, we toss anywhere from 50-99% of our materials, every generation.  Depending on the crop, we typically have 5-10 generations before a release, so that means that the vast majority are discarded, well over 99.9% of materials. Here's a simple illustration; note the number of lines:  Elsevier: Article LocatorIn this cartoon illustration, we only ended up with 1/2,000,000!  Sounds crazy, but it's pretty typical. The corollary is that you could have a triangle in the other direction showing the number of resources spent per line.  It increases dramatically as you move into later generations. The reason is simple: there's no point in spending resources on something that isn't performing.  Those same resources can be better spent evaluating new populations, better families, or better individuals. This isn't much different in animals.  I'm not familiar with animal breeding details, but I quickly looked up an example where 20% of a beef cattle herd were culled every year.  Then, even among those that aren't culled, <20% of males and 60% of females were bred.  This was from an old paper, and I imagine selection intensities have increased in modern breeding (although selection may occur on semen and eggs, rather than actual individuals).Page on pubs.aic.ca Of course, the selection intensity is not as great in companion animals (for obvious reasons), but just consider how a breeder will only keep one or two puppies from their litter.  The others aren't culled, but they're the ones sold off.  That's a 20-50% selection intensity right there. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, in any selective breeding there's an awful lot of animals that don't make the grade for whatever you are breeding for.  If you are breeding animals just for conformation to breed standards nowadays then the 'reject' animals will often just get sold off as pets (as opposed to show animals). But there was a time when it was entirely acceptable for animals that didn't meet the required colour/size/temprement to be killed off at birth (for example, it was only  a few years ago that the Kennel Club changed its advice for breeders to specifically say they should not kill healthy pups for not being perfect specimens of the breed - up until then it was simply accepted practice). This kind of thing is especially prevelant early on in the domestication process, or when attempting to create entirely new breeds (because so many of the first animals will not meet the standards you require, and they will take up space and resources needed for the ones that do).  So you are right that this is one reason that 'eugenics' (selectively breeding humans) is such a horrible idea - if you are trying to create 'perfect' humans, and only allowing the 'best' people to breed then what happens to the less than perfect people? They could easily come to be seen as somehow less than human, and that's when you get into really scary, dangerous territory. ",
