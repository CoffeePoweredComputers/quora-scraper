            "answer_text": "Microsoft (or Windows) has no OS version for a Smart TV. The only OS available for Smart TVs as of now are Roku, WebOS, Android, Tizen, FireTV. There are other variations and UI but most manufacturers use the same base OS and put their own UI on top of it. Microsoft has given no hints of releasing any OS for a Smart TV, so we cannot expect running Windows on any Smart TV anytime soon. There are at least no successful ROM flash methods that I have seen where you can flash your Smart TV OS to run any other OS. IF you would still like to use your TV as a computer, then you can purchase an Intel Compute Stick or Asus VivoStick. They run full Windows 10 and you just plug it in as plugging in any other HDMI cable. ",
