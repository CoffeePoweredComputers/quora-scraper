            "answer_text": "Nearly every job today started out as a way to reduce labor costs and is therefore a example of technological unemployment. Quick and easy answer is bulldozers and backhoes-they have eliminated thousands of jobs that used to be done with men and shovels-and most of the men are now doing something else but for those who did not learn new things they are out of luck. Garbage trucks used to have a three man crew -one driver and two (or more) picking up garbage cans and emptying them into the truck. Computers- the bookkeeping department of many corporations was huge when all accounting was done manually. the list is almost limitless -all successful technology meets a need. More often than not that \u2018need\u2019 is to reduce human effort-which means less human labor (or other effort). ",

            "answer_text": "There are milk farms with robots only cleaning the stalls, feeding the cows, put them on milking machines, checking their temperature and so on. If this job can be done by robots instead of humans, in few years nearly all of us will be jobless and likely homeless. Nobody debates this trend, meaning it's step by step sneaked and our future will be in the hands of the wealthy owners of the robots and automatons. They will decide to feed us or not, if decision isn t made by us ASAP. The way everything is done silently, but in an organised manne, is ominous, and if we all don't come with some solution and demand it, our end is pretty much near. The technology and science aren't our friends, since they aren't in our hands and under our control. ",
