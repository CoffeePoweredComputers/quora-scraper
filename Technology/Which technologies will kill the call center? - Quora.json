            "answer_text": "Oh what an interesting question! Can\u2019t afford to pass it by. TL/DR: Call center as we know it may die. However, call center as a business will just evolve. That is, businesses will use phone calls as part of a more communication strategy, rather than an isolated channel. It will also be combined with more interesting tech (like AI) to make it more targeted and efficient. Given that I have been working with a call center software, let me give you some key statistics:  What this tells you is that, despite the emergence of new channels of communication, phone calls still form a key channel of communication (hence the call center shares across industries) Added to that, here is more info on how phonecalls are growing: a) Call center software purchase and adoption is going up! b) Given social distancing laws, call centers make the perfect substitute for personal contact c) Call centers allow you to reach a large audience in short time d) Call center software are cost effective to execute. So I agree with a lot of responses given here: that the call center cannot (and will not be killed). But given the evolution in consumer behaviour, how we use call center will doubtlessly under go a change. For instance, instead of phone calls being the first means of contacting a lead, a consumer will get called only in the last stages of the buying process (to accelerate conversion). Say a lead comes to your website/app to check out a product. You will nurture them with push notifications, text messages, and even emails, till they add the product to cart. If after that, they still do not buy the item, your call center can call them to ask them what the problem is and help them with purchase. Also, phone calls can be made to customers after purchasing the product to get feedback. In other contexts too, call centers still have humungous potential. For instance, in politics, phonecalls form a crucial part of GOTV efforts. In the Bernie Sanders presidential primaries, hundreds of volunteers came together to call voters and enabled them to make it to the polls. Similarly, for nonprofits making a call to a donor instead of simply sending an email can have more impact. But why did you think call centers would die out in the first place? Would love to know your thoughts on that. ",

            "answer_text": "I own an outsourced call center and over the last twenty years I have seen a tremendous evolution in technology.  The Internet, e-mail, websites, interactive voice response systems, smart phones, etc.  With each new innovation I heard predictions of the demise of the call center.  It didn\u2019t happen and in some instances, it actually increased the volume of calls that were generated.  This was true for a number of reasons. Reach: Internet marketing (search, websites, pay-per-click, etc.) has vastly increased the size of the audience that companies interact with.  For this reason alone the numbers of telephone calls that are generated has risen. Trust: People trust people.  When a lot is at stake \u2013  time, money, safety, etc., you naturally want the reassurance of talking with a live human being. Complexity: Voice recognition software isn\u2019t intelligent enough yet to deal with complexity.  If your question doesn\u2019t fit the predefined menu on an interactive voice response system,  you need human assistance.  For example, if you have questions about a special application, you have an emergency, you have an unusual request,  etc. you need the complex interaction that only a person can provide. Sales: Automated systems can\u2019t \u201csell\u201d a prospect.  Yes, purchases are made all of the time through websites.  But the more emotional or complicated a sale is, the more likely it is that the intervention of a sales support person is required. Complaints: Automation is never going to calm down an irate customer.  We are very emotional creatures.  If you really want  to ensure that a customer leaves you, create an automated system that can\u2019t acknowledge those feelings.  Technology can absolutely augment your sales and customer service processes. But it needs to be thought through carefully and tested.  It should support your sales and customer service goals, not hinder them.  Don\u2019t ignore the need to identify situations where \u201clive\u201d intervention is vital and provide your audience with that option. Two types of calls that you should definitely focus on are first-time sales calls and calls that carry any type of legal risk.  In both of these situations, losing or mishandling a call has a high cost.  For a first-time sales call the cost of an abandoned call is potentially the value of a sale.  Calls that involve a legal risk could be situations where a contract has stipulated a guaranteed response time, there is a safety issue, you must meet a regulatory requirement or there is a problem with your product or service has put your client\u2019s business at risk, etc. What are your \u201chuman critical\u201d situations?
