            "answer_text": "The latest reports of global cell phone market shares by company are a little mixed, but so far they are now #3 in the world, trailing behind Huawei and Samsung. Now as far as Motorola goes, which was due to their own very long litany of mistakes, they occupy probably only 1\u20133%. Apple's World Smartphone Market Share Above 50% Samsung and Huawei crush Apple's smartphone global market share | ZDNet The interesting point here is that Huawei is now the #1 manufacturer in the world in terms of volume, with Samsung behind them. Apple, without actually owning any plants in their own name, can\u2019t really or legally be called a manufacturer. Even assembling them in their own plants they could claim the international legal trading recognition of 40% content of the overall product, and since this is the largest portion of their components, can have it legally labelled for trade purposes only, as made by Apple. Licensing a company to manufacture or in this case assemble a product for them, doesn\u2019t constitute a legal right to say the product was made by Apple. Motorola has been making cell phones for decades. They were so diversified and made so many other products that it\u2019s a disgrace that they victim to their own internal fighting and entitled ignorance like RIM did. Motorola almost completely fell out of the market they pioneered and trended, much the same way IBM did, and many others. From quality products, to becoming the joke of the cell phone industry, they were regarded as the Dollarama of the Telecom industry where they cheated the consumers too many times and then can\u2019t figure out why they fell behind so quickly. There are no published numbers that can be verified, and with so many companies in the Android sector, they\u2019re just another one churning out devices. Nothing special at all, especially when so many others have surpassed them in specs, quality, pricing and reputation. Some reports say that Apple has just over 51% of the world market. Others report its now as low as 19%. Even if they\u2019re at 51%, then subtract the feature phone and flip phone market of say 2% (being generous but seeing this trend rise again), that leaves 45% of the Android market for everyone else. With Huawei being #1 manufacturer by volume in the world, then Samsung, and then a whole long list of companies in China most consumers have never heard of, Motorola is probably in the 1\u20133% market share at most. Hope it helps. In China, Europe, South America, the Middle East, India, and even The African Continent, there are so many brand names that most North Americans just shrug off, just like they did with Huawei when they entered the North American market over 10 years ago, and look where they are now, thanks to USA President Donald Trump. Do I think Motorola will ever regain their market share? No. That ship has sailed and never reached another port. Could it make a reasonable comeback? No. Their only recourse now is to make products by listening to their customers, if they want to. From the beginning I knew RIM needed to migrate their BlackBerry to the Android platform as their only choice and saving grace. But they stubbornly refused and almost went bankrupt a few times. Apple was in the same place 3 times since the 80s. Now look at them. Motorola? No. They\u2019re better-off selling off the division to some mainland China company like the way IBM did to Lenovo. ",

Google purchased all the patents and sold off what they were no longer interested in: Lenovo bought the name & logo, Blackberry got the little bits that struck their fancy. At least Google picked up some awesome code and employees in the ruckus while at it. ",
