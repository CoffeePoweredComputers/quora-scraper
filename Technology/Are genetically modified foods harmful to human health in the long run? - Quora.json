            "answer_text": "In the past 20 years, there have been about 200 studies (outside of industry-funded ones) on the health effects of GMO foods. There was 1 study in 2012 that found a link between glyphosate-resistant corn and cancer in rats, but it was retracted post-publication. The author blamed Monsanto for pressuring the journal, and Monsanto did send letters to the editor - but they weren't alone, and their points were certainly valid. The author, while still concerned about glyphosate-resistant corn, conceded that his data don't support his conclusions. He's performed some additional research and hasn't been able to link GMOs to any health effects, but he's still hopeful. From a public health standpoint, there's no evidence of health effects from GMOs, but there's some evidence that people handling glyphosate (Round-Up) may have health issues from that. Consumers don't get exposed to enough Round-Up for there to be effects for them, but those loading the sprayers and performing the spraying get exposed to quite a bit. Bans on GMOs are little mis-understood. Countries have not banned the sale of GMOs, only the planting of GMOs. Even in the heyday of the anti-GMO movement, Europe imported more GMO grain than they produced non-GMO grain. That's still standard practice. Finding evidence of harm from GMOs is going to be a difficult task if there is any at all. There's currently no mechanism that biologists know of by which they would cause harm that isn't already readily assayable. Allergenicity is really the big one, and it's easily evaluated and the risk ruled out. People have been consuming GMO food for quite some time and there's never been an acute effect attributable to them, and chronic effects are not noticeable  and would probably hard to disentangle from responses to non-GMO food anyway. We know that variations between natural cultivars produce greater responses in people than variations produced by genetic modification (as one might expect, since the differences between cultivars is much greater). Genetic modification doesn't cause or alter the rate of mutation. That's directly observable with current technology. Even then, mutations occur naturally and are not good or bad, simply minor differences. Far more profound effects are seen from conventional breeding (in fact, the most dangerous genetic variants in agriculture are non-GMO celery, where it's relatively frequent that crops produce dangerous levels of psoralen and have to be destroyed; that sort of things has never been seen in GMO plants, and a mechanism whereby it would be possible is unknown). Nothing about agriculture is \"natural\". Agriculture exists explicitly by working against nature to develop novel strains of plants that couldn't or wouldn't ever develop in nature. Brassicas (broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, etc.) are all man-made mutants of a common grass, natural corn looks like wheat - no ears, no large grains; seedless plants are sterile clones, etc. The notion that GMOs are a threat to human health has largely been dropped by the early anti-GMO activists in favor of environmental arguments (some of which are far more sound and have evidence to back up). The notion that GMOs might be harmful to human health, however, is of extremely high importance to producers of whole foods, nutraceuticals, superfoods, and the multi-billion dollar health-foods market. There's a lot of traction there, and it's going to be big business for a long time. ",

            "answer_text": "GMOs are dangerous to our health, according to latest independent research  New Studies on GMOs There are other studies showing that GMOs are even worse than what was originally feared. Dr. Kruger's research shows how chronically ill people have higher glyphosate levels than healthy people. Dr. Swanson has linked glyphosate use with America's deteriorating health. Dr. Young's work showed how Roundup is an endocrine disruptor in human cells at surprisingly low amounts. It doesn't take much Roundup to disrupt hormones; the levels of Roundup allowed in municipal drinking water is enough to cause harm. There are many other studies that have been done that are showing other problems with GMOs. Independent science is coming to a different conclusion than industry-funded science. That doesn't seem all that surprising though, does it? Learn more: http://www.naturalnews.com/050454_GMO_research_biotech_dangers_health_issues.html#ixzz4106lHOYx 95% of the American Public Favors the Labeling of GMO Foods, Including Many Scientists This is not a debate of irrational fears versus a pragmatic technology. This is an argument among scientists and governments. There are those scientists who are employed by the U.S. government and biotech, and then there's just about everyone else. On the issue of GMO labeling, most of us are in agreement. Many countries all over the world ban the cultivation of GMOs, and many countries mandate that GMOs be labeled. The debate went global a long time ago. While the rest of the world bans GMOs, Americans have been unsuccessful in just getting GMOs labeled. Scientists have been speaking out against GMOs for some time now. For years they have been pointing out GMOs failures in yield, toxicity, safety, and containment. Recently the World Health Organization has named Roundup a probable carcinogen. One of the most common genetic modifications is the modification making crops Roundup ready and immune to the Roundup herbicide. In light of the health concerns raised by skeptical scientists, you would think that the U.S. would be scaling back on its use of Roundup and other suspected or known toxic chemicals in agriculture. Instead of scaling back on the use of pesticides, these kinds of chemicals are being been used more widely. Before the harvest of conventional oats, wheat, and other crops, Roundup is now often applied in large amounts. This dramatically increases the American consumers' exposure to this probable carcinogen. The U.S. government has now approved the use of Agent Orange ready (24-D) soy and corn. No one should consume these chemicals in their food, yet the government says it's okay. Common sense says otherwise. Or if that fails some of us, there's plenty of evidence and hundreds of experts to fall back on. Learn more: http://www.naturalnews.com/050454_GMO_research_biotech_dangers_health_issues.html#ixzz4106tzNg6 cientists all over the world have called for a moratorium on all genetic engineering. Scientists such as Prof. Ruth Hubbard, Geneticist, Harvard University, USA and 814 other scientists have written an open letter to governments and international forums. These prominent scientists are extremely concerned about the hazards that GMOs pose to biodiversity and food safety. They are \"extremely concerned\" about the risks GMOs pose to human health and animal health. Experts all over the world are saying it's time to change the way we do agriculture. These and hundreds of other scientists worldwide are calling for a ban on patents on life. Patents on life forms threaten food security and health around the world. Patents, they argue, have the effect of legally sanctioning biopiracy of indigenous knowledge and genetic resources. Lifeforms such as organisms, seeds, cell-lines, and genes are discoveries. These discoveries should not belong to corporations but rather they should belong to all of us. These discoveries should not be the kind of discoveries that a person or a corporation should be able to patent. GM pollen from GM crops can travel miles. It is commonplace for birds, insects, and weather to carry GM pollen and seeds. Animals and natural processes can spread patented genes onto other farms. When this happens, hapless farmers are sued, and contrary to all common sense, they are the ones who usually lose in court. GM crops cross-pollinate with other crops so voraciously that we can't seem to get rid of some unapproved GM varieties. Genetically modified wheat keeps popping up in farmers' fields across the country though it was ordered to be completely destroyed 14 years ago, way back in 2001. Patents are meant to protect property rights, but the patents on genetically modified foods have been used to take farmers lands away from their rightful owners and to control farmers. Instead of protecting the freedom to own property, these patents are eroding the rights of property owners. The current techniques that are used to genetically modify foods are unreliable, uncontrollable, and unpredictable. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of unwanted mutations result from genetic engineering. These can result in new allergens or toxins, and even new viruses. This makes sense when you consider that GMO foods are made to either be immune to poison or to create their own poisons, or both. Traditional breeding techniques are simply more controllable and predictable. This is an argument made by thousands of farmers and scientists. These are just some of the reasons that GMO foods should not qualify as inventions GM crops are neither necessary nor beneficial to agriculture. There have been many failures of genetically modified crops. Now that independent research is being done on GM crops, the picture of a failed technology emerges from the research. Genetically modified crops have produced inferior yields when compared to their unmodified counterparts.GM crops have been shown to have poor disease resistance.GM crops engineered to contain BT toxins kill beneficial insects such as bees, lacewings, swallowtails, and monarch butterflies. (Monsanto claims they are concerned about this, but so far greenwashing has been their only response).Glufosinate causes birth defects in mammals.Fruit abortion (a failure of fruit production).Glyphosate has been linked to cancer.Poor financial returns for farmers.GMOs violate farmers rights (Monsanto takes farmers' farms away by lawsuits monthly).GMOs violate human rights and basic human dignity. (The right to know and control what we put into our bodies is a basic and fundamental human right).The 815 scientists who wrote their open letter to the world call on support for research and development of non-corporate sustainable agriculture. Much of this invaluable research has already been done. Bill Mollison and David Holmgren have developed sustainable, non-corporate organic agriculture. They can farm anywhere and their yields are amazing. Their techniques are called permaculture, which means permanent culture. If agriculture does not become sustainable, then not only will agriculture not last, we will not survive. Profitable and Sustainable are not Always the Same Thing When genetically modifying our food, the biotech industry would have the public believe that they are improving upon life, and doing it sustainably. We are told that the benefits outweigh any risks, or even less believable, that genetic engineering is a risk-free technology. When put into practice, the benefits accrue to Big Agriculture while the costs are paid for by the consumer and society in the form of higher prices, toxic food, and environmental degradation. The costs of genetically modifying food is also paid by farmers. They face the threat of GMO contamination, pesticide runoff, soil degradation, and higher seed prices. The same crops that become genetically modified become more expensive, in all of their varieties GM and Non GM. In a successful attempt to manipulate the market, biotech corporations have been buying seed companies for some time. This enables biotech companies to make non-genetically modified seeds more expensive, and harder to obtain after they genetically modify a particular crop such as corn. Non GMO corn seed became much more expensive in North America after Monsanto produced GM corn seed. Even though this is a violation of our antitrust laws, biotech companies are still getting away with it. The same thing is happening in Spain. After allowing GMO cultivation, the variety of maize available to Spanish farmers has declined dramatically. Rising corn prices are sure to follow. Genetic engineering is not what Big Agriculture claims it is, and it will never do what they claim it will. The critics of GMO technology are often condemned for being anti-science, as if being against one type of technology is the same as being against all forms of technological progress.Learn more: http://www.naturalnews.com/050454_GMO_research_biotech_dangers_health_issues.html#ixzz41072RcAo http://www.globalresearch.ca/former-pro-gmo-scientist-speaks-out-on-the-real-dangers-of-genetically-engineered-food/5424010   ",

            "answer_text": "No. Everything that humans eat is already genetically modified - and I mean that in a much realer sense than just as a comparison to traditional breeding. Transgenic organisms, the class of GMO that seem to cause the most controversy, are created by splicing a gene from one organism into a different organism. Do you know how we accomplish this? Viruses are an entire class of organism that reproduce in exactly this way: by splicing their DNA into a foreign genome. They are the most abundant class of organism on the planet, so they've gotten pretty good at it. So, when we want to do the same thing, why reinvent the wheel when we can just make a virus do the work for us? To perform modification with a viral vector, we find a virus that attacks the plant we want to modify (works best on plants - we'll see why in a second), clear the malignant DNA out of the viral particle, replace it with the DNA we want spliced in, and then unleash it on a culture of plant cells and let it do its thing. The end result is a genetically modified cell culture.  But rather than being modified to produce viruses, which is what the old viral DNA would have done, it's been modified to do our bidding, according to whatever DNA we put in that virus. Now, before you violently react to the word \"virus\" and start spouting some nonsense about how all viruses are dangerous and how dare Monsanto feed us food that's been blasted with viruses, bear in mind that most viruses are very specific.  When you get sick with a viral infection, you don't get your pet sick, too, right?  In the same way, there's very little chance that a plant virus is going to make the jump to humans.  Even if there were a chance of that happening, bear in mind that the virus we're discussing here has been de-fanged.  Without its viral DNA, it's no longer infectious.  Also, no viral remains are going to make it into the final product.  If you're still uneasy about the viruses, then that's actually sort of my point - read on, and I'll get to it. Back to our plant cell culture.  The beautiful thing about plant cells is that they're pluripotent.  That cell culture will now grow into an entire plant.  If the splice we made was deleterious - for example, if the virus inserted our transgene into the middle of an important plant gene - then that plant just up and dies.  No problem, we have others.  We test all of the plants we created for the ones that display the phenotype we spliced in, select the ones that do, clone them, and collect their seeds.  Voila, transgenic crops - a very, very simplified overview, obviously. Now, how can we be confident that this process is safe?  Well, remember, all we did was piggyback the viral reproduction process.  And viruses, as mentioned, are the most abundant form of life on Earth.  I guarantee you that you have never eaten anything that was not infected by a virus - either recently, or in its ancient evolutionary past.  In fact, you have certainly been infected and genetically modified by viruses in your lifetime. The argument that a local viral infection is not comparable to modifying the entire genome of an organism isn't going to fly, either, because viruses have modified the entire genome of organisms.  Every genome we have yet studied has displayed genome-wide viral remnants - old, leftover junk DNA from germline viral insertions at some point in that organism's distant evolutionary past that didn't take.  In the case of some plants, these leftovers can even make up the majority of the genome! So, there you go.  We use viruses to perform transgenics; viruses are everywhere; everything is transgenic.  If you want a long-term feasibility study on the safety of transgenic organisms, try looking at everything. EDIT: Justin Ma points out in the comments that agrobacterium is favored in plant modification over viruses.  It's been a while since I studied this stuff. :P The point about transgenic viral remnants stands: my field was bioinformatics, and I can confirm that leftover junk viral DNA is literally everywhere, and doesn't seem to hurt anything any.  Agrobacterium specifically may pose risks that I haven't touched on here, though; for instance, it seems to be an opportunistic human pathogen. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Others answers have already covered this, including other questions on Quora.  But I'll repeat it again. 1. Safety in comparison to other crop improvement practicesGMO techniques are, at the end of the day, yet another tool for plant breeders and other plant scientists to help improve crops.  Modification of plants has been ongoing for millenia, and in some ways may be considered the oldest science.  Scientists have taken advantage of many methods to generate variability, as they have been developed.  These include interspecific crossing, somaconal variation from tissue culture, mutation breeding, doubled haploids, and of course, selection. None of these are natural by any definition of \"natural.\" Transgenic insertion is yet another means of generating variability.  It is helpful because it allows us to be much more specific about what we are inserting, and we gain access to genes from any species.  The changes induced by transgenic insertion, unlike all the methods listed above, are specific.  Thus, the changes expected from GMOs are actually far more controlled and limited than many of those other methods.  The other methods are often far more invasive, but there is zero hype about them (and that's the way it should be). When a scientist says there may be risks, they're really just hedging.  Many scientists don't like making absolute statements.  If I'm going to make the hedged statement, it's that GMOs pose no greater intrinsic risk than other crop improvement methods, and in many cases, pose less of a risk. 2. Empirical studies have demonstrated GMOs are safeFirst, let's let the myth that no safety studies are done die.  Because of public wariness (frankly, it's illiteracy), GMOs are by far the most heavily regulated of crop improvement techniques, both by government agencies and by industry. Justin Ma's answer to What are some good widely accepted scientific research studies about the safety of GMO products? List of studies.  This list is meant to be exhaustive: GENERAUSDA approvals (pending, rejected, or approved), including documentation:USDA - APHIS - BiotechnologyInternational approvals, including documentation: GM Approval Database There's a lot more than health safety information in these documents (legalese, environmental safety, agronomic performance), but it's there. It's incredible how detailed these documents are.  Each one typically consists of more work than a PhD thesis. Personally, I think studies feeding whole seeds are a waste of time, given our biological knowledge.  We know exactly what the protein we're inserting is, so if the protein is tested, it's a much better safety experiment. 3. A personal exampleThis is to prove my point that transgenic techniques to produce GMOs do not intrinsically pose a danger, at least not compared to other methods.  I work with tobacco.  Tobacco kills (by the way, that should tell you something about \"natural\").  Scientists have identified some of the most potent carcinogens in tobacco.  I work with tobacco where some of these genes for carcinogens have been knocked-out.  We've done it by GMO and by mutation breeding.  Do you really want to tell me the GMO tobacco with a known carcinogen removed is more dangerous than non-GMO tobacco with a known carcinogen? 4. If anybody wants the comprehensive industry opinion, here it is: Tempest in a Tea Pot: How did the Public Conversation on Genetically Modified Crops Drift so far from the Facts?It's written by a Monsanto employee in regulatory affairs.  It's got links to everything you want. And finally: I am a plant breeder.  I breed plants \"traditionally.\"  I work with GMOs.  I work with interspecific hybrids.  I work with germplasm.  I work with tissue culture.  I work with doubled haploids.  I work with chemically-induced mutant populations.  I work with plants in the greenhouse.  I work with plants in the field.  I work with plants in a lab.  I eat GMOs.  And I know commercial GMOs are safe. ",

There is no mechanism by which kinds of modifications made to GMOs could harm us. Even so, GMOs are required to go through years of expensive testing to make sure that they do what they are supposed to and that they are safe: A survey completed in 2011 found the cost of discovery, development and authorization of a new plant biotechnology trait introduced between 2008 and 2012 was $136 million. On average, about 26 percent of those costs ($35.1 million) were incurred as part of the regulatory testing and registration process. The same study found that the average time from initiation of a discovery project to commercial launch is about 13 years. The longest phase of product development is regulatory science and registration activities, at about 5.5 years for traits introduced in 2011. How much time does it take and how much does it cost to successfully develop a hybrid with one or more transgenic traits from conception to commercial release| GMO Answers Regulation of \u201cBiotech Plants\u201d is done 3 government agencies. The USDA makes sure that they don\u2019t become pests themselves. The EPA makes sure that pesticides produced by certain biotech plants are safe for both us and the environment. The FDA looks at whether they are actually safe for human and animal consumption. There are standardized tests required for a GMO to make it to market and every company has to follow them. Yes, these companies must prove that their products are safe according to the criteria of third-parties before they can sell them. Regulation of Biotech Plants Then there is the fact that there is literally no evidence that GMOs have any safety risks whatsoever. There are several studies that have attempted to show that they magically cause everything from cancer or stomach inflammation to killing gut bacteria, but every one I have been shown so far has small samples sizes (e.g. 10 rats already liable to random tumors), no statistically significant results, retracted, poor design (they don\u2019t even know how to diagnose stomach inflammation), no data to begin with, etc. Frankly, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that anyone who thinks that there is any science backing up the claim that GMOs are unsafe simply haven\u2019t read the papers they are supporting. It\u2019s not even an opinion. They are just objectively bad studies which is why no regulatory agencies have actually taken action based on them (though some may have given in to public pressure). The whole \u201cGMOs are dangerous\u201d craze seems to be just another conspiracy movement. It\u2019s not much different from the antivaxxer or AIDs denialist movement. In every conversation I\u2019ve had thus far, it always comes down to \u201cthe science doesn\u2019t agree with me because big companies are faking the data\u201d. There is no evidence of such a thing and there is plenty of independent research out there, but that doesn\u2019t seem to matter. That isn\u2019t to say that GMO don\u2019t have downsides, but human safety isn\u2019t one of them. ",

            "answer_text": "GMOs \u2014 should they be allowed and should they be labeled? While government agencies and scientists claim GMOs are safe, controversy still surrounds this hot topic. Here\u2019s what you need to know. What are GMOs? GMOs \u2014 or genetically modified organisms \u2014 are plants, animals, or microorganisms whose genetic material (DNA) has been changed in a way that cannot occur spontaneously in nature. Genetic engineering techniques allow scientists to insert genes from one species into another species in order to improve certain attributes. For example, a segment of DNA from a bacterium that confers insect resistance can be inserted into a corn plant so that the corn also becomes resistant to insects. Therefore, less insecticide needs to be used. In genetically modified (GM) plants, scientists typically aim to improve drought tolerance, decrease the need for pesticides, and strengthen resistance against plant diseases. Ultimately, the goals are to increase crop yield and quality. A food product made from GMOs is referred to as a GM food.  (image: Shutterstock)  What are common GM foods? The following are common, commercially available, GM crops along with their modified traits:  *The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved GM salmon in November 2015. This is the first GM animal approved for sale in this country. The FDA stated it rigorously evaluated extensive data and determined the salmon is safe to eat. What are advantages of GMOs and GM foods? GM foods can increase food production and provide supplemental nutrition. Here\u2019s how: Decreased pesticide use: Scientists can insert a gene (originally from a soil bacteria that produces a toxin that is lethal to insect larvae) into the DNA of corn and other crops. This enables the plant to produce that same toxin so that it is also protected from insects. Thus, the GM crop requires lower amounts of pesticides.Resistance to plant viruses: Seeds can be genetically modified to make them resistant to plant viruses, which results in higher crop yields.Weather-tolerant crops: GM crops can survive longer periods of cold and drought compared to conventional crops. This allows farmers to increase production, despite harsh conditions. One example \u2014 an anti-freeze gene from fish has been inserted into tomato plants to help the plants resist frostbite.Fortified nutritional content: Scientists have created a strain of rice fortified with vitamin A, as well as a type of cassava root fortified with vitamins, minerals, and protein. These crops have the potential to combat malnutrition in developing countries where people rely on those crops as the staple of their diets.How do GMOs affect the environment? Resistant pests: There is a concern that GM crops could cause pests and weeds to evolve into insecticide- and herbicide-resistant \u201csuperbugs\u201d and \u201csuperweeds\u201d that can no longer be eliminated by chemical sprays. This resistance would render insecticides and herbicides useless, which could harm conventional crops.Introduction of gene into wild plants and animals: While this has not been thoroughly researched, there is concern that GMOs could escape agricultural fields and introduce the engineered gene into wild plants or animals in the surrounding habitat.Species shifts: If an insect-resistant crop causes the extinction of a particular bug, other insects may come and occupy the area, shifting natural populations and causing new pest problems.What are the potential concerns for human health? Gene transfer: There is some evidence that genes can transfer from GM foods to bacteria in our digestive tract. This would be concerning if these genes are detrimental our health, like if antibiotic-resistant genes were transferred. However, the chance of gene transfer from GMOs to gut bacteria is extremely low \u2014 research has shown that the chance of gene transfer from GM crops is lower than the chance of gene transfer that happens randomly when we eat conventional foods.Allergenicity: People are concerned that genes from commonly allergenic foods (like nuts) could be transferred to non-allergenic foods, increasing the risk of allergic reactions. However, this practice is discouraged by the World Health Organization, and currently no GM foods have been found to cause allergic reactions.Links to diseases: There are a few studies that have linked GM foods to inflammation or tumor growth in animals or in test tubes. However, most of those studies are highly flawed and were not published in prestigious scientific journals, as they were not peer-reviewed, lacked scientific rigor, and were written by researchers affiliated with anti-GMO organizations.Are GM foods safe to eat? Reviews of over 1500 studies on GMO safety have shown little to no evidence of harm. In addition, organizations such as the American Medical Association, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and the World Health Organization have analyzed the scientific evidence and have concluded that GM foods do not pose more risks to humans, animals, or the environment compared to conventional foods. Before they become commercially available, GM foods are studied and tested more rigorously than other agricultural products.Research has shown GM plants are nutritionally equivalent to their non-GM counterparts (unless the GM food has been enhanced for nutritional improvement, as in vitamin-A enriched rice or soybeans with more healthy monounsaturated fats).Studies have shown that GM genes are not found in any organ or tissue samples from animals fed GM plants. A study of long-term consequences of GMO consumption in animals \u2014 up to 5 generations \u2014 found no evidence of harm.The current scientific literature has not shown GM foods to cause any new allergies, cancers, ADHD, infertility or other diseases.There are no studies on the long-term health effects of GM foods in humans \u2014 GM crops weren\u2019t widely approved until the 1990s. The studies that do exist (lasting between 90 days and 2 years) have not suggested any health hazards.Can a food be both GM and organic? Foods that have the USDA organic label cannot be made with GMO ingredients. What are the current laws about GM foods? In California, there is no requirement to label GMO-containing foods. Several states have labeling laws, but there is no national consensus on labeling. Some companies have chosen to include a \u201cnon-GMO\u201d label on their products. GMO labeling is required in 64 countries due to consumer demands. Conclusions: GM crops have enabled farmers to efficiently increase crop yield or food quality. While there are concerns about the effects of GM plants on the surrounding environment, from a nutrition standpoint, studies have shown that GM foods are nutritionally equivalent to conventional foods. There is a need for more research in this field, but the existing evidence suggests that GM foods are safe for human consumption. Ultimately, though, whether to consume GM foods is a personal choice.

            "answer_text": "The big question is where you place the burden of proof.The precautionary principle dictates that the burden of proof is on  Big Ag to prove that GMOs are safe, not the other way around, not that environmental groups have to show that they're harmful.  This is key because proving something is true is pretty hard and takes a long time and a lot of money, money Big Ag has, but consumer groups do not. The reasons countries are resorting to banning GMOs is because these agricultural companies are not being good corporate citizens and they are insisting on the opposite approach. They're insist that they're going to sell us this stuff until someone shows proof it's harmful. Not only that, but they're going to try to be as surreptitious about it as possible (The New York Times). Given what's at stake, I'm okay with a temporary ban. Since Monsanto and their ilk aren't willing to go along with the precautionary principle, government is going to have to make them.  The past should certainly serve as a lesson that these large corporate entities place profits first, PR second and public health somewhere at the very bottom, just above migrant workers' rights. Whether it's lead in paint and gas, BPA, HFCS, dioxin in manufacturing, agricultural runoff (see: Toledo), asbestos, pesticide and on and on and on, we have unfortunately learned that corporations do stuff for a buck, then thirty years later they change their policy only after we, the citizens, have paid a very very lofty price and often after many lawsuits and laws.   Are GMOs safe to eat? I don't know, and neither does Big Ag even though they promise promise promise they are, for real this time.  The probability is that they, in fact, are safe. But until we know for sure and until they spend the time and money to test it out, it should not be on shelves.   I see no reason why GMOs or other food innovations - stuff we ingest - should be treated any differently than drugs. Merck can't put out some new ADHD drug and then just take it off the shelves if, eh, sorry folks, this causes cancer. They have to put the time and money to test it, not the PTA.   It's also worth mentioning that GMOs are part of a larger trend of establishing monoculture in agriculture. This does lead to harmful effects on agriculture as a whole - more vulnerable crops, requiring more intensive pesticides, pesticides which, again, are used by Big Ag, with all their assurances that you're being totally non-scientific and anti-progress and hey, they have to feed the world if you think that's a problem. All the stuff you see being trotted out here. Crucially it is against the precautionary principle. Then they're proven wrong about pesticides (e.g., Non-cancer health effects of pesticides), then, after a lot of law suits and argument, Big Ag begrudgingly changes policy and makes due with some small drop in profit and the world food supply doesn't collapse.  What this demonstrates is that even once they're shown to be harmful, Big Ag only stops when dragged kicking and screaming. When it comes to GMOs, it's unfortunate that these folks are so untrustworthy and require being baby-sat like this. It's the bed they've made, though. Would you trust the decision about GMOs to corporations that continue to insist on using pesticides long after they've been shown to be harmful (Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, & Neonatal Nursing)?I wouldn't.

There is no scientific evidence that GMO harms people.  The key word is \"scientific evidence\".  The ONLY evidence that anti-GMO people have, comes from specious sources, anecdotal evidence and from tests that draw questionable conclusions that GMO food may cause differences in the way it is digested.  No harm has ever been demonstrated. Those who are against GMO foods depend almost exclusively on the same rhetorical tactics as very religious people.   If you dont' side with them, you get personally attacked.  Your credibility will be assailed.  (\"Anybody who disagrees with me is in the service of Satan and is evil.\" -- religious nutters; \"You must be in the pocket of Monsanto!  You're brainwashed!  You're destroying humanity!\"They will use \"resources\" of specious repute.  (\"People in Nigeria are cured by my religion's healers\" -- religious nutter; \"People in India are committing suicide because of Monsanto Corn\"  --Anti GMO).They will use propaganda websites that do not link to original source material.   (Every anti-GMO website draws massive conclusions but rarely links to peer reviewed studies)Will attack the same process (peer review) that we depend upon for vetting things that almost all believe in:  global warming and evolution.  They will selectively appreciate its results when it favors them, reject it when it doesn't.  Same with religious nutters.  They will claim global conspiracies. (\"All universities are run by atheist lefties!\" -- religious nutters;  \"All food companies and labs are in the pocket of Monsanto and their capitalist hegemony\"-- Ant-GMO).They will outright lie; distort reality. (\"The bible is factually true and has never been proven wrong.  The science proves this.\"  -- religious nutter;  \"Monsanto sues farmers into capitulating and forcing them to use Monsanto seeds.\" --anti-GMO)Appeals to the masses.  (\"Then why have so many people believed in Allah for over a thousand years and have been saved by Islam?\"  --religious nutter;  \"Then why have people in Europe demanded that GMO get banned?  Are they all wrong???\" --anti-GMO)  [yes, they're wrong and hysterical]When ever pressed for original source, peer reviewed studies that show it's harmful, they're quick -- oh so very quick -- to do whatever they can to avoid having to address that.

It makes no sense\u2026. you can say \u201cit doesn't matter\u201d\u2026 and then the long term studies and epidemiological evidence can by examined\u2026 but to say \u201cits the same\u201d is simply incorrect\u2026 it\u2019s NOT. When you say: \"It has been 20 years since genetically modified food being spread in the market\" it seems to imply we have 20 years to see if \"it\" is safe. This is simply not true... you are assuming that since one is fine, they are all fine. The genome is very complex and we have evolved to eat historical familiar food since the beginning of time. As you probably know dietary changes induce digestive changes in cells and systems. I think GMO is essentially going to end up being an epidemiological study\u2026 not something that a 5 year trial and \u201cprove safe and effective\u201d\u2026 JMO. For a parallel there are drugs \"proven\" safe and effective that are pulled all the time, often after long periods when effects start to show themselves: 35 FDA-Approved Prescription Drugs Later Pulled from the Market Any scientist pounding the table that all GMO is and will be necessarily \"safe\" is not much of a scientist IMHO. We are learning a lot about the genome all the time, we are also learning about what this means for various cells and systems... there are huge breakthroughs, its awesome, but why would one pretend to know how it all works with respect to GMO... if we clearly \"are learning all the time\"!

However, inhaling smoke is simple to understand that it will cause something bad to you. Consuming something with introduced genes is hardly dangerous. We do it every day by accident when we eat food. We consume daily viruses, bacteria, fungi etc without knowing. Foreign DNA enters our bodies constantly. Why are GMOs any different? Also, something you need to consider is the adaptation of human physiology to any external factor. If you switch from eating constantly bananas in the morning to pears, your body will undergo a change. However, if you change from bananas to a GMO banana, there won\u2019t be any difference for your body. Unless the GMO contains allergens or toxins that affect humans, it will never be the case. Also, companies avoid creating GMOs that even remotely could be harmful. The cost of creating a GMO is very high and creating something harmful to society is just a legal and financial Russian roulette. No company will do that. Companies depend on consumers being alive, healthy, and buying their product. Not sick or dying. If their customers die, so will they. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no proof they are, but that would be putting the burden of proof on the wrong foot. Non-gene-spliced foods are the ones humans have been eating for thousands of years and they require no proof. It\u2019s the new ones that do, and because long term health effects by definition take a long time to be evident, it will take many years before such proof could be satisfactory. Technology has evolved quickly, but human physiology has not. It takes many generations before we adapt to new environmental factors, so by default we should assume we\u2019re best adapted to the foods our great great grandparents ate until proven otherwise. A case in point. Hydrogenated fats were first introduced into the food supply in the early 1900s. Their commercialization was justified in part on the lack of evidence that there were any ill effects from consuming these fats. In time, oleomargarine, a product made from hydrogenated fats, was even promoted as a healthier alternative to butter. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s that evidence began to emerge that some of the products of hydrogenation, trans-fatty acids, were long term harmful to health. Even then, however, it wasn\u2019t until 2013 that the US FDA finally declared that partially hydrogenated oils containing trans fats were no longer considered safe for human consumption. It took a century for the ill health implications of hydrogenation to be formally recognized. If history is any guide then, it will take about a century for a gene-spliced food to be proven safe. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, we don't really know.  Some of what we do know is that GMO farming has more effects on the ecosystem than intended, allowing some bacteria and insects and critters to run rampant over the fields while killing off others, and often affecting the fields of other farms within striking distance in negative ways.  We don't really know if the new ecosystem is sustainable and beneficial, and we don't know how to go back from whence we came. Also some of what we do know is that there is a measurable increase in many crop yields, but we also don't know whether that's a temporary or permanent increase over many generations of plants.  There's been some indication that crowding out old seed stocks is a problem, as is the possibility that pollenization by GMO plants of non-GMP stocks yields infertile plants in the subsequent generation(s).  That could be a problem. There's a lot of unknown.  My personal feeling is that fooling around with Mother Nature on a massive scale could be a massive mistake endangering the food supply.  I'm not an expert by any means, but I don't like a lot of what I'm seeing. ",

            "answer_text": "There are very few genetically modified fruits and vegetables. Almost all GMOs are commodity crops and grains, and grown for making livestock feed and biofuels. Of those genetically modified fruits and vegetables found in the marketplace, I see no evidence that any are harmful in any way. Long term studies in the future may potentially detect something. Who knows the future? But for now, to the best of my knowledge, seems very healthy. There are a few commodity grains that are GMO that do make it into the food supply. And there is a very small number of studies that seem to indicate inconclusively they could potentially have long term ill effects on human health, probably indirectly rather than directly. However, the vast majority of the literature seems to indicate no significant health problems. But again, Who knows the future? My main objection to GMOs is that this tool of GE is being used in a way that is harmful to the environment! \"We try to grow things that want to die, and kill things that want to live. That is pretty much how (industrial) agriculture functions.\" Colin Seis This environmental harm will most certainly come back to haunt us. \"The first duty of the agriculturalist must always be to understand that he is part of nature and can not escape from his environment.\" - Sir Albert Howard However, there is no fundamental reason the tool couldn\u2019t be used to restore ecosystems just as easily. It\u2019s not the tool, it\u2019s how you use the tool that matters. ",

As I am stating in this blog Our Endangered Foodit will take 90 years before we have all of the safety answers, so because 20 years have already passed, we just have to wait another 70 years before the results are known. However, sensitive persons already suffer from infertility, autoimmune reactions and tumors have been described in long-term animal feeding experiments.  This is enough information to make me buy only organic foods. Addition (April 27, 2016): I am visiting Germany right now, where they are fiercely opposed to GMO with good reason. They just heard about food inspectors having found glyphosate in the majority of German beers. Germans have a very strictly controlled beer industry and for 500 years their quality has been outstanding. But now glyphosate, which is known to be one of the carcinogens has been found in beer. Is it the hops? Is it the barley? Investigations continue. But in the process it was found that Germans also excrete glyphosate from Roundup in their urine. It is thought that the Roundup-ready grain crops and perhaps alfalfa got into the European food chain. This may now contaminate the beef industry. German beer purity in question after environment group finds weed-killer traces. You will hear more about all of this in the news.  Even more reason for me to buy organic food and let the battle between those who claim GMO is harmless and those who say it is harmful go on.  ",

            "answer_text": "My big issue with GM crops is that the genetic modification is not to benefit the consumer with a higher quality product but to introduce a trait for glyphosate resistance in order to allow farmers to spray large amounts of glyphosate (Round Up) on their growing crops to selectively kill off the weeds. There is some doubt now that glyphosate is actually as non-harmful to humans as has previously been claimed. Also, there seems to be some evidence that it doesn't break down as rapidly as previously thought. Then there is the environmental impact of this style of farming. You often see self-seeded canola growing along roadsides near paddocks that had previously grown it. So canola has quite high weed-potential and can easily contaminate neighbouring farms who might have organic certification but would lose that and their price premium due to inconsiderate neighbours not adequately preventing the spread of their proprietary genetics. Given the weediness of some GM crops such as canola, it can then be difficult to control or eradicate as glyphosate could not be used and so other, potentially more harmful herbicides would be used. Finally, smothering crop-growing areas with glyphosate applies a very strong selective pressure to the weeds that are present. This means that the only weeds to survive would have some degree of herbicide resistance. If herbicide resistant crops are grown regularly in the same area, you very quickly find herbicide resistant weeds taking over the cropping area that are then even more difficult to deal with. ",

            "answer_text": "Dan Holliday's criticism of the variety of \"activist\" or Non-GMO websites citing themselves, independent journalists and everything but \"peer-reviewed evidence\" is a founded claim.  Why?  Because it casts doubt.  It is very effective as well, as you can see, by the prior answers.   To circumnavigate being misled, I pay attention to what a website advertises before I take in the information.  Most of these are selling Dr. Oz cures, others are redirected to WebMD.com's definitions.  On the other side of the fence are the studies done with questionable perimeters and selection criteria, thereby making the whole debate a matter of obfuscation. The report in question? Page on canterbury.ac.nz Took me a long time to find that report and I ran circles around those websites trying to avoid 404 errors--curious the number of those on reputable opensource websites.  My doubt is that material came out of thin air and yes, Heinemann did issue questions on the methodology: Unintended secondary dsRNAs that might be generated in planta or in animals consuming the plant cannot be anticipated but may well exist.  These secondary dsRNAs may have gene regulatory activities and thus act like siRNA. This means that dsRNAs created by the genetic engineering of wheat may cause the production of additional unintended or unanticipated dsRNA molecules in both the genetically engineered wheat and in any organism that consumes the wheat. Any of these unintended secondary dsRNA molecules could be the cause of an adverse effect. Now we turn to the \"concensus\" findings of ENSSER: No scientific consensus on GMO safety - and their conclusions are highly skeptical of the 600+ GMO safety studies as well as their toxicity-counterparts.  My favorite quote (section 5): Among the animal feeding studies and reviews of such studies in the  list, a substantial number found toxic effects and signs of toxicity in  GM-fed animals compared with controls.[33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38]  Concerns raised by these studies have not been satisfactorily addressed  and the claim that the body of research shows a consensus over the  safety of GM crops and foods is false and irresponsible. Yes, the jury is still out.  But funding investigations into these manipulations are sparse and manufacturing evidence for GMO benefits (outside of profits) is certainly a page in their playbook.  Being dismissive of the variety of techniques is naive, if not entirely ignorant, of how our genetic blueprints are structured and influenced by the things we consume.  If nothing else, GMO's impact on the environment (biodiversity namely) is a cause for pause. ",

(Keep in mind that the cigarette companies operated on this premise, though.) However, I have concerns, not about the technology or the concept, but the business behind it.  When I see companies that claim on one hand that there's nothing special about their product but then turn around to patent it and use those patents aggressively, I get suspicious.  When I see claims that a technology is the only path to survival, but never seems to produce the required numbers, I get more suspicious.  When I see companies try to destroy traditional farming models for their own profits, I get angry. And when someone who makes me suspicious and angry tells me I have nothing to worry about...well, that's when I worry. I support labeling (and even bans) on that basis.  The food may be fine, but the safety should be proven (what's the line about extraordinary claims...?) and the business models strike me as very and intentionally harmful. But genetic engineering itself?  As long as we test things for a few generations before letting them grow in the wild, I can't see how it's much more dangerous than natural selection.  But that's like saying that falling is perfectly safe and it's the sudden stop at the end you need to worry about. ",

So each intervention needs to be considered on its own merits. The terms \u201cgenetically modified foods\u201d and \u201cFrankenfoods\u201d are just marketing terms. So far there are no credible reports of widespread safety issues with any GM foods on the market. That suggests (but does not prove) that whatever safety testing is being done is adequate. That has limited predictive value. There are no 100% safe foods but the evidence so far is that genetic modification doesn\u2019t add more risks than other plant-breeding techniques. There are genetic modifications that we can predict would reduce risks. For instance we can eliminate the protein responsible for most peanut allergies. The precautionary principle (If you don\u2019t know the safest option, pick the safest option.) suggests that we should ban unmodified peanuts. There are some real issues in the interactions between new technology and old laws. Farmers have been forced to grub up their crops because of contamination with proprietary products. Those problems happen whenever new technologies come in. They are artefacts of government systems that expect to be able to take years to make decisions. ",

            "answer_text": "As science currently goes there seems to be nothing innately unhealthy about genetically modified foods. This, however, does not excuse them from being unhealthy. Practically all corn, soybeans, and wheat grown in the western world is genetically modified. It is genetically modified for multiple reasons, but the chief of these is so that it can be sprayed with more weed killing chemicals. As weeds become more intolerant to weed killers, more must be sprayed on them. The most common weed killer is Round Up. Since weeds have to be sprayed an over abundance to be killed, the crops need to be altered in order to be able to survive so much weed killer. These weed killers are what is very harmful to human health. There is a lot of conspiracy surrounding Monsanto and their facts surrounding the potential threat Round Up has on human health, but there is more and more evidence proving that Round Up and other weed killers are harmful to us humans (in California Round Up is classified as a carcinogen), and harmful to the integrity of the soil (which could result in something like another dust bowl if it would get bad enough). In conclusion, GMO\u2019s are not innately unhealthy, but since a large majority of GMO\u2019s exist simply to be able to take on more weed killer it makes them unhealthy to eat. Any product in a store that is not labeled as \u201cnonGMO\u201d is carrying residue from these weed killers and getting into your body. So yeah, I\u2019d be cautious of eating GMO\u2019s. ",

But bT doesn't seem to have an effect on most vertebrates in the quantities produced by GMO soybeans. If you were to eat 10 kilos of GMO rice at one meal, you'd probably experience some harmful effects, but likely no more than you would if you did the same with non-GMO rice. GMO crops face a regulatory regime which requires safety testing before approval for sale. This includes extensive testing for known allergens, known toxic compounds, etc. If the testing uncovers a problem, the crop is not approved for sale. It should be noted that non-GM methods of crop development, such as taking a batch of seeds, exposing them to mutagenic environments (radiation, chemicals, etc), planting them, and seeing what useful traits spontaneously appear, are not subjected to the same rigor of pre-sale safety testing.

Just like somking, somking one cigarette may not do harm to your health. Notwithstanding, if you smoke cigarette for a long time, everything will change. Therefore, no matter what time will tell. Before we know the fact, we should not syop doing some researches related with GMO . Additionally, we\u2019d better not eat GMO. It is really hard to say whether GMO is safe. Some scientists may say that GMO is nothing different from other food, becasue traditional plant breeding is also associated with the change of genes. Therefore, using genetic enginnering method to change the quality, tolerance, and other traits to satisfy we human being demands is very essential. Using the advanced molecular techology indeed improves the yield and good qualities of the plants. Nonetheless, we can not make a conclusion that GMO is safe. Moreover, the application of GMO is very likely to have a significant effect on the indigenous ecosystem. Once the GMO becomes the dominant species, it will decrease the biodiversity and change the food chain and the food web as well. Overall, GMO does have its advantages and disadvantages. However, we can not outweigh the weaknesses and strengths by now. ",

Know this: We have been monkeying with food supply genetics since the 18th century. Anyone ever hear of animal husbandry breeding techniques and hybrid crops? Our farm animals do not resemble their ancestors who lived in the wild. And . . . Did you know that \"organically grown\" basically, just means that the crops were fertilized with cow poop? Genetic manipulation of the food supply has already saved countless lives by averting catastrophic famines in Asia and Latin America. It even brought about an economic miracle in India. Norman Borlaug earned the 1970 Nobel Prize with brilliant accomplishments, with his work on food producing plant genetics. It is known as the \"Green Revolution.\" There was a time when it was common to see bodies of people who starved to death in the streets of Calcutta. High-yield wheat existed, but was impractical to cultivate because the tall stalks would topple over and ruin the crop. Norman Borlaug manipulated the genetics of this wheat to produce what we call \"pygmy wheat\" or \"dwarf wheat.\" It had a shorter and thicker stalk that effectively supported the high yielding crops. Vastly improved food supply helped better feed the entire region. With India's cultural high regard for education, the now well fed population, proceeded to create nothing short of an economic miracle. As we perfect scientific breakthroughs in hydroponics and genetic engineering of plants, our descendants will be able to continue to eat well on a crowded earth and during space travel. The fear-mongers remind me of railroad critics during the advent of steam locomotives. People were terrified by the predictions from mainstream scientific authorities, who described lethal g-forces that would maim and kill anyone attempting to travel over 25 miles per hour. Their reference outlook and explanation was based on the distressful experience of feeling like the wheels may come off when riding a carriage or stagecoach at top speed, drawn by galloping horses.

One is to enable broad sweep poisons to kill pests or other plants without killing the desired plant. This means that your environment will become laden with the poison and there will be traces you can then imbibe by eating the food. The other reason for GM is to bring a new nutrient into the product. Whether you want this is up to you. And selective breeding over many many hundreds or thousands of years has given us big juicy potatoes, tomatoes, apples, pears, pineapples, olives, dates etc. The increase in sugar content of our fruits may make them less healthy to eat, but competition from sugar cane probably makes the effects of fruit sugar unnoticeable.
