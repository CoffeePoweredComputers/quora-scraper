The calico cat is a neighborhood cat who has invited herself into my house couple of times. She came when I said kitty and looked over my house climbed everywhere had a snack and left. I had seen her on my fence before and across the street. Three days later she was on my lawn and I looked out the window, she saw me and came to the door she came in and out 4 times in a hour got petted, rubbed my legs and left. She has been gone 10 days, I miss her, I don't have any cats but I do have lots of pictures of her. ",
