            "answer_text": "Obviously, nobody knows. Since writing was one of our later inventions (in terms of all human history), it was never recorded what the first invention was. (Verbal tradition, while valuable, is notoriously inaccurate.) However, there are some possibilities, in what I feel are their likely order of invention. Digging tools. Early humans ate anything, so digging grubs, worms, and insects out of the ground would have been a good way to get food. Grabbing a stick and using it as a tool is something we\u2019ve seen chimps do, and it\u2019s pretty certain that our ancestors did the same.Weapons. Since humans are relatively weak, slow, and lacking defenses (horns, shells, etc.), they needed weapons to survive when predators were after them. Those same sticks that they were using do dig grubs out of the ground would have been a natural way to ward off lions, hyenas, and such. If you look back in recent history, many of our technological advances have been accelerated by war. Airplanes had HUGE improvements in the courses of World Wars I and II due to the need to find better ways to kill the enemy. Warfare has also brought great medical advances, as we\u2019ve tried to find ways to save wounded soldiers.Language. To pass on information, you have to have a common \u201ccode.\u201d Without language, every generation would start from scratch, since nobody could create anything based on what the prior generation had done. Every invention we see today is made possible because A) somebody invented something earlier and B) somebody else found out about that invention and improved upon it.Clothing. Early humans and pre-humans were generally OK out in the weather, but it gets cold even where humanity originated in Africa. Early \u201cclothing\u201d probably consisted of large leaves, sheets of tree bark, and maybe the skins of animals who\u2019d died and had been eaten up by other animals.",

            "answer_text": "I doubt anyone really knows or can prove what the first invention was ..but if you look at it like what was the first think man devised to help his existence ..I would say it most likely was either clothing of some type \u201csomething anything to shelter their bodies from heat or cold or retain warmth \u201c - It\u2019s just logical ..perhaps a second or runner up to this would be using a stick or sharp object as a tool to help in every day tasks searching for food or to cut things ..maybe that was actually first , ie. being used to create forms of clothing .. or used to dig and scavenge etc . yes i understand that technically these may not be inventions by modern standards - but using something that wasn\u2019t designed / intended for the purpose you are using it for .. by necessity, is a form of invention none the less. the reason i said clothing ( a body covering of any type ) is that this is exclusive to humans -and is made for a purpose .

            "answer_text": "Stone tools are the oldest inventions we know so far. The systematic archaeological excavations undertaken at East Gona between 1992\u20131994 have resulted in the discovery of the oldest known stone artifacts from EG-10 and EG-12 localities dated to w2.6\u20132.5 million years (Myr) (Semaw, 1997, 2000, in press; Semaw et al., 1997). (...) The current evidence from Gona combined with the well-preserved excavated cut-marked bones identified from Bouri provide complementary data showing that the first stone tools were used for processing animal carcasses for meat and bone marrow.
