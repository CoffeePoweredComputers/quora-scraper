            "answer_text": " CSE(Computer Science & Engineering) and IT (Information technology) both are quite similar in some or the other manner. I always have come across students who are confused between these two fields because of the lack of the understanding of the minute differences and similarities between the two engineering streams. Also read Comparison between Engineering branches: ECE and EEE Subsequently, aspirants should also be aware about their own interest/s and in which area would they like to make their career in? Or which one do they think will ensure a better future for them? Considering these points, let\u2019s discuss the difference between both these engineering fields: Main Difference : CSE: Computer science engineers are involved in many aspects of computing, from the design of individual microprocessors, personal computers and supercomputers to circuit designing and writing software that powers them. IT: Information Technology deals with the use of electronic computers and computer software to store, protect process, transmit and securely retrieve data. IT professionals perform a variety of tasks that range from installing applications to designing complex computer networks and information databases. The major difference between both these field is that IT deals with the application of computing technology to real life processes, while, Computer Science deals with the science that facilitates these applications. To make it short and simple, Computer Science is the creation of software and hardware by using different programming skills. On the other hand, IT is just the selection of the proper software or hardware for the task. Difference in course and core areas: CSE: Computer Science engineering students study about design, implementation, and management of information system of both software and hardware processes. Students pursuing computer science study: Algorithms and Data Structure, Architecture, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Database and Information Retrieval, Human-Computer Communication, Numerical and Symbolic Computation, Operating Systems, Programming Languages and Software Methodology and Engineering. IT: Information Technology deals with installation, development and implementation of computer systems and applications. Under this stream, students learn the following: Data Structures and Algorithms, Microprocessors and Interfacing, Computer Communication and Networking, Database Systems, Internet Technologies and Applications, Software Engineering etc. Career scope: CSE: Job openings for Software professionals is much higher in the corporate sector than in public sector. Professionals can join as junior programmer, database administrator, junior network manager, Data Analyst, Software Developer, Software Engineer, and Client-Server Systems Manager etc in the initial stage. Students have job opportunities at organizations like IBM, Intel, HP, TCS, INFOSYS, WIPRO, TECHMAHINDRA,CTS and Dell in India and abroad. IT: Career options after B.Tech in Information Technology are good. IT Specialists are required in almost all range of employment fields such as finance, arts, medicine, defense, and other areas. Many opportunities are available in various IT firms all over India. Some of the leading IT Companies are Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Accenture, HCL Infotech, IBM, etc. These professional can get jobs in many public sector firms. Some of the leading public sector firms are BSNL, ISRO, CDIT, CDAC, etc. Option in Higher Study: Students who have completed their bachelor degree in Computer Science or in Information technology go for higher specialization in the related area. There are various colleges in India as well as abroad that offer Master\u2019s program in Computer Science. Those who have pursued Masters of Business administration can attain both technical as well as administrative skills. Given below higher study options such as M.Phil and PhD also awaits professionals in Computer science and Information technology. Masters in TechnologyMasters in EngineeringMasters in ScienceMasters in Business AdministrationsM.PhilPh.DStudents only have to think about their interest and then select the field . They shouldn\u2019t leave any space for any sort of confusion. Taking the right decision at the initial stage, would be a boon to students in the research field and to those who want to do more invention or become innovators for tomorrow\u2019s world.. ",

            "answer_text": "Academically, Both are same The subjects in both branches. Probably there will be a maximum of change in 1 or 2 non-technical subjects which are also inter-related. ( One branch will study Managerial science and Another will study Managerial Economics )The placements that you will be attending are same.The companies will take both the branches as same.Non-Academically, IT is good IT people will have little more hardware knowledge than CS.Colleges these days are having more number of seats in CS than in IT as people are thinking CS is superior to IT. It is causing too many people in CS because of which the standard of teaching is decreased in CS.Fees in CS is comparatively high than IT as people thinking CS is greatYou don't need to get a really good score in entrance exam to get into IT to enter into a good institute but you need a really good score to enter CS ( This happened in my case and Now I am as good as CS student studying in same college )IT students will have less number of students and faculty. So it will be good as you have chance to have good interaction with all. ( The ratio of IT and CS sections in our college is 1:3 )This is difference at the time of education. When it comes to job both are same. ( These days people from Electrical and Mechanical background are also same in job perspective as many companies are treating them as equal to CS and IT guys ) Hope this will help :) ",
