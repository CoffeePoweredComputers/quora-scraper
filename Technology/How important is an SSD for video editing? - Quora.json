            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re doing typical editing of HD footage, a standard hard drive is perfectly fine. But if you\u2019re looking to edit 4K, an SSD can come in handy. Also, if you do a lot of multi-cam editing, like from a concert for example, you can benefit from an SSD, but it\u2019s not mandatory. If you have a tight budget and storage space is important, then you can convert your footage to proxy files. Proxy is a low resolution version of your footage that you can edit with so it\u2019s not so taxing on your computer. Final Cut Pro X and Adobe Premiere Pro provide this feature. And when you\u2019re finished editing you can link back to your original footage for rendering. If you\u2019re not familiar with proxy footage, just do a Google search or watch a YouTube video that explains it. So no, an SSD is not critical to video, but you do gain a speed benefit from having one. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not vital, but it\u2019s a nice piece of hardware to add. For Adobe Premiere, Adobe recommends at least 3 hard drives: 1 for OS and software, 1 for footage and exports and 1 for cache and temporary files. This because the software is generating writing and reading files the whole time. With 1 or 2 hdd the PC would get very laggy and slow, because the HDD\u2019s mechanical arm just can\u2019t work that fast. With an SSD all those problems don\u2019t exist. You can have just 1 SSD and edit your videos without any lag. Of course it\u2019s not recommended to have your footage and your OS on the same drive. With an SSD your computer will read and write data without delay or without any lag, since there aren\u2019t any mechanical/movable pieces in there. ",
