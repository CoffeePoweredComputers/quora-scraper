            "answer_text": "One of the areas 5G Technology has the potential to affect in a big way is the Internet of Things (IoT). Although, many debates are going on stating will 5G be a revolutionary technology for IoT projects or not. Keeping the present scenario in mind, most of the IoT applications such as asset tracking and remote monitoring data do not require lightning-fast, ten gigabit-per-second download speeds or 1-ms latency levels but at the same time, Gartner predicts two-thirds of enterprises plan to deploy 5G by 2020. This surely means that 5G could ultimately be a pivotal technology in driving that shift.  The following post sums up in what ways the tech can help unlock the enormous potential of IoT for businesses as well as end consumers. But before that, let us take a small walk through how changes that will help 5G in becoming the catalyst for next-generation IoT services. Advanced modulation schemes for wireless access2. Network slicing capabilities 3. Automated network application lifecycle management 4. Software-defined networking and network function virtualization 5. Support for cloud-optimized distributed network applications Hope you got your answer\u270c\ufe0f ",
