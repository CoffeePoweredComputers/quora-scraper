            "answer_text": "I don't know whether your question was from which perspective of designing, but it seems to be a generic design question. I will give you an answer from an engineering perspective. When designing anything for an engineering application my design process is as follows. I ask myself these questions.  What do I want? Asking the primary question on what the problem is and what all does it encompass. This includes:-1. measuring EVERYTHING, 2. scoping the general area and special requirements for work, 3. seeing how much space I have at the site,4. seeing how much space I have nearby, 5. seeing how much space I have nearby that nearby area, 6. how to access the above areas.How do I want it? After the design is implemented how is it going to be used, how and when and with what frequency is it going to be operated, what environment/temperature/pressure is it going to be used. This includes:-1. looking at the basic requirements for that design, 2. looking at possible scenarios for general and special cases(emergency), 3. how to best insure that it is safe to work with and/or near it.What do I do? This is the actual design process to look at the possible solutions and thinking on how to best come up with an answer that fits the above two questions. This includes:-1. a lot of free hand drawing, 2. thinking/working out the math involved to get rough numbers,3. advanced requirements for the design.4. design lifeHow do I do it? This is basically a selection among the various options I have and making an educated selection based on:-1. the safety rating of the overall design,  2. ease of installation and ease of fabrication, 3. cost constraints for manufacturing, 4. cost of labour, 5. cost of maintaining it once it is installed6. reliability of the new equipment7. legal requirements/engineering standardsHow exactly do I do it? There is a huge difference between Q4. and this one, as this one involves a lot of details end results.1. Drawings2. How to install 3. How to test ( commission )How do I make my life easy? This involves making sure that the documents are properly labelled and saved, the markings are done on the equipment, the critical spares are in the house. These are the miscellaneous requirements for any sort of design work.",
