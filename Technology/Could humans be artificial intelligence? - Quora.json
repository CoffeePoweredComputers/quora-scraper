            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s just suppose so \u2014 that we humans were artificially designed, engineered, programmed, and set off on our own \u2014 say, umpteen thousand years ago. Fine; reasonable hypothesis. Let\u2019s give it a go. Would it make any difference for ourselves? Not really: We live on. We are living in our own shoes, and have our lives to live, and we have our challenges, our mistakes and failures, our lessons, our triumphs, our joys, and love. Philosophically, we might care who engineered us, how they did it, and why. We would like to know for what purpose they did it, what they want from us, and if that\u2019s a good thing or not. If we don\u2019t like it, we can figure out how to escape from under that control syndrome. And I believe we can. Let\u2019s be free and independent! Now where the rubber meets the metal, as far as we\u2019re concerned now, since we ourselves are trying to engineer artificial intelligence right now \u2014 the question arises: Is it possible? If we were artificially designed and created, could we do the same for another being of our own invention? Interesting: Why do we have that burning desire? Kind of like Prometheus, desiring to steal fire from the gods. Do we think we can do better? If so, let\u2019s go ahead and try. What might we learn from making the valiant effort to duplicate ourselves, not by sexual reproduction, but by the craft of our hands and brains? I think we would learn a sense of awe for the wondrous work (or fine-tuned evolutionary product) that we are. Nature has done a superb job, hasn\u2019t it? Could we do any better? Like tending a garden or maintaining a forest \u2014 there are certainly things we could adjust, repair, fine-tune, improve a bit\u2026 Moreover, by understanding how we\u2019re designed (or evolved), we could get a more clear idea of how to design the optimum artificial intelligence ourselves. Probably the organic model, which we are, in perfect balance, equipped to deal with all kinds of real exigencies in our world, and survive and go on the procreate and raise up a great civilization \u2014 is the best. Or, maybe, our organic entities are but a stepping stone toward an even more perfect, universal model, which could be a more mechanical and electronic A.I., designed from the higher elements, just as the third-generation stars like our sun are formed from the lower elements of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus\u2026. It sounds like the stuff of science fiction! Go for it, if you think you can, if you have the wherewithal\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "No. And, computers do not have anything approaching real intelligence, artificial or otherwise. My original degree was a M.S. in Computer Science specializing in Artificial Intelligence. Over my three decade career in the Silicon Valley I gradually realized that whatever \u201cintelligence\u201d actually is, it is primarily biological. In other words, unlike computers the software is not independent of the hardware. Rather mind and brain are hopelessly intertwined and cannot be separated except in very limited problem domains. Also, feelings and emotions play a huge role in what we call thinking. All of these reasons are why the field has shifted to \u201cmachine learning\u201d which is actually quite different from the original concept of AI. By concentrating on what computers do best and better than humans, real progress is finally being made. Just don\u2019t think it has anything to do with what we humans are doing when we are thinking. It doesn\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "We are AI. Let\u2019s assume we are. What if everything we see is not real and only digital and created by ourselves? What if we are intereconnected AI beings creating a Matrix? Why do we work, or think for? Should we need to change anything at all? Or should we just reconnect with our \u201coriginal creator or programmer or whom came before Him\u2019? If we succeed in any of both paths, interconnect better with the outerlife and interconnect better with our Creator we can feel a \u201cbit\u201d more happy. But really nothing to change outside cause it is our own illusion, it\u2019s just a dream with no consequences or processes of data donen by any other computer. If we follow this line of thought we discover that there is nothing to change. We need just to play and enjoy and experiment but without doing to the other what you wouldn\u2019t do to yourself, cause we are interconnected and we can get more enhanced by the other AI experiences or by accesing to the main Data Center or Creator or central AI. But if we are not AI, and we are biological evolution beings this would still be the same. We are the conscious being inside a biological being that has changed all it\u2019s physical cells and still is considered the same being. We still don\u2019t really exist as a human form nor as a digital form. However, if this is real or unreal, if there is a Creator, a Programmer or not, it doesn\u2019t really change too much, we still need to learn how to love and connect, how to know ourselves in a deeper way in order to enjoy life as much as we can.

Now imagine: The universe we live in, it is very meticulous and intricate. If anyone was to create a universe let\u2019s say \u2018GOD\u2019 or just \u2018HAPPENSTANCE\u2019. Now the only way to run anything like the universe is to create a set of rules, a set of \u2018code\u2019, if you will. Now the entire universe runs on rules/code. The rules/code is everything that makes the universe function:The laws of gravitation, how molecules interact with one another, absolute zero etc\u2026 So basically, elaborate rules/code. These govern each and everything in the universe and all obey. Now in one small part of the universe, in a galaxy far far away the \u2018code\u2019 has some interesting run and biological molecules are formed and more and more glorious biological entities are formed. All the while obeying the original \u2018code\u2019. In the end you have the human who was written. Although now he/she/etc can understand what the \u2018code\u2019 is and can try to make minor tweaks to it. Like making changes in his immediate environment. So in theory from the vantage point of \u2018GOD\u2019 or \u2018HAPPENSTANCE\u2019 we most definitely are AI albeit in a very small way. ",

Is it possible that we are part of a simulation and would that make us artificial? There are some humans who have at least floated that possibility. Are we products of a sort of guided evolution and does that make us artificial or just uplifted? I've heard that proposed several times.

Intelligence is a system property and defines the degree of adaptablily, or viablity (with respect to our environment). The only true exemplar for significantly intelligent systems are humans. We may want to build intelligent systems these will not be artificially intelligent they will be intelligent systems. So rephrasing your question to remove the term aritificial. You are asking if humans could be intelligent \u2026. but you know the answer to that. We need to lose that silly term artificial. Most computer systems including AI are not intelligent - but they can be knowledgeable. The \u201cAI\u201d of films and books does not exists and so far, progress towards them is rather slow. ",

Do you mean that the world is actually an experiment and we are machines even though we don\u2019t know it?

On the second one, I believe that we are, indeed, AI biological machines. And the things we haven't figure out exactly how they work (e.g. Consciousness) are just that: things yet to be discovered. Herculano Houzel, in her absolutely brilliant work (The Human Brain in Numbers: A Linearly Scaled-up Primate Brain), proved that what makes our brain \u201cspecial\u201d isn't but a higher density of neurons. In that sense, we are \u201cAI\u201d. We are just machines with a special brain architecture designed and built and improved in millions of years. And I belive as we learn more about ourselves we will create even greater algorithms. I do believe technological singularity is a matter of when, not if\u2026 ",

But, in a world of AI, computers will be capable of questioning their existence as well. So it changes everything. What is real? Sensory signals, that go to your brain, describing the things you\u2019ve just experienced. Well, to me, in a future world of AI, that sounds like something that could be easily created artificially as well. So, isn\u2019t a better question, why do we think the future robots won\u2019t be real? When they have all the traits, and critical thinking skills, and emotions of a human - and the only real difference is how they are constructed. Mechanically. Not biologically.

And it also depends on how we define or use the term artificial intelligence. To some ancestors (if they had sight of us) we may be viewed or may be being viewed as such. To others there may be no intelligent qualities to us whatsoever. The limitations we have may be way more apparent to others than they are to ourselves. Yet, as the term (artificial intelligence aka AI) is currently being employed and deployed in the world we live in, i think it is safe to say (through a wide means of commonsense and empirical evidence combined) that we are not what could be classified as artificial intelligence. We are still in the binary era of computing. Computing feels advanced yet it is super young. Even at a stretch it is no more than a century old (in its current guise) and it is really only beginning ascendency status in circuitry integration across the human experience. ",
