            "answer_text": "When the world has already seen the launch of OnePlus 8 smartphone and is gearing up to see the next one, talking about OnePlus 5 smartphone isn\u2019t very sensible. This is such an old smartphone with old technologies and you would certainly not like to have an old flagship when the new budget smartphones have better features. For instance, would you like to have a dual rear camera smartphone at a high price when the quad-rear camera smartphones are already in the budget segment? No! And this is why, the newly launched Redmi Note 9 is a lot better option in terms of smartphones against OnePlus 5.  Talking about Redmi Note 9, this is the world\u2019s first smartphone with MediaTek Helio G85 processor. This is an octa-core gaming processor by MediaTek which is clocked at 2GHz and is said to offer great gaming performance in the budget and mid-range segment. The smartphone is available in three variants of RAM and ROM and the lowest variant with 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage would cost you 12k in India. Against this, the one with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage is the highest variant which costs 15k in India and you can choose any of them according to your requirements because I find each of them quite suitable as per their prices. Redmi Note 9 has a 48MP + 8MP + 2MP + 2MP quad rear camera with an LED flash and it also has a 13MP front camera. No doubt, the features of this smartphone are really interesting and added to it is the 5000mAh battery with 22.5W quick charging support. In fact, there is a 9W reverse charging support as well with the battery. The smartphone has a 6.5-inch display with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection and ant-splash design. The 1080p display resolution and the punch-hole cutout for the front camera are again something that lures the attention of the users and it is available in three beautiful colors. Overall, the smartphone is really good and it is certainly one of the best gaming smartphones available. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t understand the basis of this question because OnePlus 5 is an old phone whereas the Redmi Note 9 is an extremely new launch. There is no doubt that Redmi Note 9 is obviously the better choice because it has been integrated with the latest features and abilities. Moreover, it also has incredible gaming support with its integrated Mediatek Helio G85 chipset processor. OnePlus 5 has become an obsolete phone for the brand itself, and it will be of no competition for the newly launched Redmi Note 9 either. Xiaomi has launched this phone at a decent price point of 12,000 rs and I think this is a good deal for any mid-range consumer.  Compared to OnePlus 5, Redmi Note 9 has a lot more features that are objectively better and more performance enhanced. The Note 9 comes with a solid 5000 mAh battery compared to the 3300 mah battery of the Oneplus 5. It also has a better camera and a solid RAM. Moreover, Redmi Note 9 is capable of supporting strong and efficient mobile games with ease but the same gaming support cannot be expected from the OnePlus 5. Overall, there is no real reason for a consumer in 2020 to opt for the OnePlus 5 when a much better alternative is available for them in the form of the Redmi Note 9. ",
