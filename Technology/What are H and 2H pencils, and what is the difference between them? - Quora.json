            "answer_text": "You normally get two different sets of pencils available in the market . H and B. H stands for hardness whereas B stands for boldness. The less harder the better . H will give you a light shade but the pencil marks will be uneven, scratchy. Rubbing out the marks will be easy but you won't get rid of the painful impact . 2H is a bit lighter shade than H and also a bit harder . You won't actually know the difference between the shades of these pencils unless you want to act all super mighty and apply full pressure on those pencils. Warning : For the paper's sake, don't apply pressure while using them. Don't rub repeatedly trying to remove those awful pencil scars. If you really have to use hardness, use a mechanical pencil. Doesn't leave painful impact and feels nicer on papers. :) ",

            "answer_text": "H and 2H pencils belong to the harder grade of pencils. As H means hard. As we progress from H to 2H,3H and so on, the mark made by the pencil gets lighter. These pencils are mainly used for laying outlines of a sketch or for very light even shading as they can go deep filling the crevices(tooth) of the paper. The basic difference between H and 2H is that, 2H is harder and therefore lighter. One thing to keep in mind is, the indentation made by a hard pencil remains on the paper and is difficult to get rid of, compared to soft pencils. ",
