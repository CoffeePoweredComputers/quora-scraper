            "answer_text": "Radio waves going in very different directions than from one phone to the other. Instead, the radio waves would go to a cell phone tower first. Unless the other phone is near the same tower, they would then be converted to signals traveling through wires or fiber optics, which may go through several switching offices before reaching a tower near the other phone. Once they reach the right tower, they will be converted but to radio waves and set out from that tower so that they finally reach the other phone. The radio waves from each source are not pointed in a particular direction; they just keep spreading out until the next step in the chain receives them. ",

            "answer_text": "You would see a glow of strong radio signal emanating from and surrounding each phone. It goes out in all directions, getting rapidly weaker. Some of it gets to a cellphone tower (the bit that matters) but you would not see that. The signal from the cellphone tower would also be a glow surrounding it. Some must reach the phones, but you would not see that. ",
