            "answer_text": "There is not much difference between 4K monitor and 4K TV but you get the faster response time in 4K monitors as compare to TVs which almost all the models comes with IPS panels have lower response time whereas monitors also comes in IPS display which has lower refresh rates than TN panels. Also TV comes mostly with HDMI connectors whereas in monitor you can get Display ports with HDMI ports. TVs mostly comes with 60FPS but in monitors you can get higher FPS. TV are made to view from distance view but if you see TV with closer than you see the pixels are shredded whereas monitors build for the close view though you can see it form the distance too. ",

            "answer_text": "Difference between a monitor and TV are as follows: TV has different AV inputs such as TV, Composite RCA, Scart (Europe), Component RCA, S-Video (perhaps), HDMI and USB. The monitor has VGA, DVI and DP inputs and sometimes HDMI.A TV contains tuner than can scan and tune to TV channels via standard TV input.TV will always have speakers whereas monitors usually don\u2019t have them.(Modern) TVs usually start at 32\u2033 whereas monitors are rarely larger than 32\u2033. This is because with monitors we are usually sitting just a foot or two away.Because monitors are small, the pixel density is high. This is good for close viewing. TVs - while can be used as monitors - do not work well as monitors.",
