            "answer_text": "Due to the ongoing sentiment of using only the Indian products in India, Micromax is getting a lot of attention these days. This is one of the Indian brands that was highly popular a few years ago, but the market went down with time due to competition. However, Micromax is making a comeback in the Indian market with some really interesting devices and you can expect MediaTek gaming processors in them. According to the sources, the MediaTek Helio G35 and MediaTek Helio G85 processors are almost confirmed in the device and besides, there can be some high-end smartphones as well. No doubt, the smartphones from Micromax seem to be really exciting and they could pose a lot of competition to the others in the budget segment.  ",
