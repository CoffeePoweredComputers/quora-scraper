            "answer_text": "Software programming has become the most integral part of any technological development in the world, so advancements and developments in software programming have had a vast impact on all sectors. Hence keeping up with the trends, especially in software programming, is very vital for learners and employers. Not all technological advancement is compatible with the requirement, it is based on the growth and feasibility of the technology you need to learn or adapt. Here are the latest technologies used in software programming, BlockchainBlockchain is creating a distributed database of records involving transactions happening between participating entities, with its footprint in Digital Currency. This digital currency is highly controversial, but the technology behind it is well being adopted because of its flawless operation and security features. Thus blockchain is being adapted in both non-financial and financial sectors. A Notable example would be that the Singapore government has started developing Digital health passports, its most awaited health care upgradation, using Blockchain showcasing its wide adaptability. MicroservicesIt is one of the latest emerging technologies in architectural style, this is used to develop, manage and update architectures from its small and self-contained units. This is being widely adopted because of it being fully autonomous and full- stack. This has emerged parallelly to cloud computing, aiming to provide virtualization in lightweight use for application packaging mechanisms, where a complete platform is provided to the Cloud (PaaS). DevOpsMany internet service-based companies like Facebook, Google, etc., roll out new functionalities every day. There is continuous development and deployment involved. This has many pros and cons. DevOps is a combination of Development and Operations, it\u2019s a process of end-to-end automation of development and deployment of software. As many companies are following agile methodology, DevOps is one of the most emerging and trending skills among developers. Business Intelligence and Data VisualizationData visualization, because of Higher visibility and benefits provided for business, has been adapted by many organisations around the world. One of the promised achievements in the scope of business intelligence is seen with Data Visualization. As businesses are producing a lot of data, dealing with large data is one of the tricky factors for organization. By making use of data analytics to remove unwanted data, highlighting subsets of data business can have better vision. Thus, dynamic or static representation of the graphs provide a good platform for business to communicate information clearly. Mean stack vs Mern StackSoftware development companies want full stack developers, who can develop complete web or apps from scratch. Now Mean Stack is becoming one of the widely used development frameworks enabling developers to develop complex web applications. It is set in JavaScript, Node.JS, MongoDB, Angular, and Express.JS. One more stack, Mern stack, is used for complete development in both the front end and back end. While ReactJS is used here instead of Angular in Mern. Both of these development frameworks will be one of the biggest contributors to developing new generation websites and apps. Omni-CloudOne of the key factors that made business change to the cloud is scalability, cost-benefits, and security. Cloud computing has been accepted from the start, with it companies can focus more on other core functionalities instead of managing data. But companies require something other than using multi-cloud, as applications are becoming more robust and portable. The need for omni cloud provides advantages to companies with improved security and utmost scalability. Omni cloud is seen as one of the greatest technological advancements for latest technologies used in software programming. Also, 5G, Augmented reality, Machine learning, CSS grid, IOT, AI, etc are among many latest technologies used in software programming. ConclusionWith the changing technology, the need of skilled employers is also rising. Companies are focusing on hiring people who can match the current trend. So, learning new software development skills aids your career development and keeps you in the competition. ",
