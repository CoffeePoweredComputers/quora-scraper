            "answer_text": "For the same reasons I think it\u2019s a good, succeeding ,safe city. Cities are large complex places, with varied populations, varied businesses, long convoluted histories and different faces to show each observer. You see what you are looking for, and many out-of-town observers come in looking to find \u201cbad/failing/dangerous\u201d, so that\u2019s what they see. I see a whole different City, and I\u2019m getting pretty sick of people from other parts of the world pre-judging Detroit based on something they read on Facebook. If you are really interested, here\u2019s something I wrote a year or so ago on what caused some of Detroit\u2019s problems. The on-going solutions were described in Mayor Duggan\u2019s State of the City Address a few days ago. The answer to your question is long and complex, but I have tried to condense it to a few paragraphs. Obviously, there are many factors in Detroit's demise, but I will try to hit what I think are the most important. And please keep in mind that the 316-year story of Detroit continues. The last few years have seen substantial revivals in several large parts of the City. These revivals have little or nothing to do with the auto industry. Prior to WW 2, large factories were built with iron (not steel), wood and brick structural elements. This meant that floors and roofs needed support columns every 16 feet, and these columns severely limited the movement of materials, products, and machines in the space. Production lines, which were evolving quickly, needed more freedom of movement. During the war, new steel framing materials were developed that allowed architects to eliminate most of the columns. Open spans went from 16 feet to 40. This allowed construction of huge one-story plants, which operated much more efficiently. These required acres of open land, but every square foot of land in the City was occupied. Manufacturers therefore moved out to the rural agricultural areas north of 8 Mile and south of the River Rouge. Large tracts of land could be had cheaply, so the Big 3 car makers, (Ford, Chrysler and GM) left the City. The new military hardware builders (General Dynamics, Tank Automotive Command, Chrysler Aerospace, LTV, Thompson-Ramo-Woolridge) never even built in the City, they started in the 40's in the suburbs. The car-makers' old Detroit buildings were left to rot. The corporations didn't want to spend money on demolition, and they were able to convince the City government that other tenants would be found. Of course this was fantasy, but the large companies had such powerful control over the local government managers that the fantasy was accepted. The truth is obvious 60 years later in the gigantic hulks of decaying structures all over the City. An entire style of art called Ruin Porn has been created in and around these old plants. Naturally the workers had to follow the jobs. Some continued to live in the City and drive to the new locations. This was viable only for white workers. Due to long-standing institutional racism, people of color could not get car loans, and DWB (driving while black) was cause for harassment or head-bashing by the newly-created suburban police forces. The majority of the white workers soon tired of the long drive, and new homes started appearing by the thousands in the former cow pastures. The inner ring of suburbs, within 6 miles of the city limits, was created entirely in the 1950's and 60's. Of course, non-whites couldn't get mortgages either, and they would have been violently unwelcome in the new neighborhoods. They had to stay in the City. In any other city, mass transit could have come to the rescue. Urban residents could have ridden the bus or train to the suburban jobs. However, the transit system in Detroit ended at the city limits, and the suburbs didn't want it extended. They created their own systems, with few routes, sparse service and no crossing the City limits. Further, the car makers informed the Common Council that \"This is the Motor City, people shouldn't be riding on street-cars.\" Stupidly, the Council agreed, so in the late 50's a viable light-rail system was uprooted, rails torn out and the cars sold to Mexico City. The bus system, once quite trustworthy, started to deteriorate. Most people in and around the City have accepted the absurd notion that a mass transit system benefits only the riders, and therefore all operating costs have to be covered by the bus-fare that riders pay. This leads to constant budget problems and ever-creeping service cuts. Some area employers now refuse to consider a job applicant who plans to ride the bus to work; not reliable enough. And most of the suburban jobs are nowhere near the few bus routes. So those are some of the main causes of the City's pathology. Here are some of the consequences: When big employers move, small employers follow. Thousands of small industrial shops, from die-makers to plastic molding companies, stamping operations to office supplies, moved to the 'burbs to be close to their Big 3 customers. Of course, as the incomes of the inner-city residents fell, the retail and service business withered, and had to follow the money. Retail fled to the suburban malls, service to the new glass office towers in the \u2018burbs. The result, of course was more vacant buildings all over the City, but especially downtown. With the loss of so many businesses and residents, the City's tax revenues dropped quickly. The City tried to make up for this by raising tax rates, but this is not a sustainable practice. Schools deteriorated, both functionally and structurally. Some Detroit schools graduated people who could barely read. Public services of all kinds faltered, emergency response times slowed, parks got neglected, garbage piled up in vacant lots, libraries closed. The resulting loss of quality of life further depressed the real estate market. Landlords who can't find tenants aren't going to keep maintaining their buildings, so blight spread. When the jobs move away, when the people can't get to suburban employers, when some aren't well-enough educated to do those jobs even if they get to them, when every effort to maintain dignity is thwarted, people lose hope. Civic virtues like respect for your neighbors, respect for property, respect for police don't make much sense to hopeless people. Drugs, gambling and prostitution provide income for a few, and hideous costs for many more. Hundreds of storefront churches sprout up to siphon off more of the people's meager resources. So that's how the Arsenal of Democracy came to be the poster-child for urban decay: Corporate arrogance, lack of vision and backbone on the part of local government, and racism at every level of society brought down a great City. Today Detroit is rebounding in may ways, but not evenly, not in all neighborhoods. At least the movement now is in the right direction, and if someone can figure out a way to deliver public services to a widely-spread remaining population, the City may blossom again. The heart of the City, in the University area, Midtown, Downtown and the Cultural Center is still beating strongly, and grows slowly stronger. Some residential areas like Corktown, and along the River are being revived with new homes and restoration of the old ones. Software is now a major job source, craft brewers and urban farms are small but fascinating sources. Detroit is a stimulating place to live and work and I plan to stay. ",

            "answer_text": "Detroit is dangerous. But there are worse cites such as East Cleveland, OH. New Orleans, LA. North St.Louis. and Miami and lets not forget southside Chicago. All are both more dangerous then Detroit. The media likes to portray Detroit as the worst city and most violent in the country because of its decline. They lie and say its worse then it actually is. Don\u2019t listen to the media. They lie about everything. Unfortunately most people believe what others tell them and in return everyone in the country is now saying Detroit is the worst city yet they are turning a blind eye to cites that are much worse then Detroit. If you\u2019ve never been to Detroit. You have no right talking crap about it. Want to see bad and dangerous? Go over to New Orleans Lower 9th and 7th wards and watch how they live. The true ghetto\u2019s are in the southern US. Not the North. Louisiana is much worse then anywhere in US. Even Detroit can\u2019t be compared to Louisiana\u2019s Hoods/Slums. Ifs a different world in it self. Miami is even worse then Detroit. Miami is much smaller then Detroit. People are more poor in Miami. Miami has gangs that are very violent. Just watch first 48 Miami or gangland. Detroit is not even comparable to Miami\u2019s vicious gangs. ZoePound would probably scare the shit out of any hoodlum from Detroit just based on the crimes they commit alone. There very violent. Half the crimes in Miami like stabbings and people ending up in Trash bins/ the ocean. Cut up bodie parts being thrown in the water would never happen in Detroit. Its just the nature in the south. There crazy down there. if you still say Detroit is worse well you are a big fucking dumb motherfucker who doesn\u2019t know shit. U are ignorant and believe wat others tell you without knowing the true facts. There are no opinions just facts. ",
