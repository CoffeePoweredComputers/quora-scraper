            "answer_text": "HAVE you ever watched the news and thought, \u2018Can things get any worse?\u2019 There is so much tragedy and cruelty that some people believe we must be close to the end of the world. Is that true? Is there a way to know what will happen in the future? Yes. Although humans cannot predict what will happen, Jehovah God can. He tells us in the Bible about our future and the earth\u2019s future. \u2014Isaiah 46:10; James 4:14. When we read in the Bible about the end of the world, it means, not the end of planet Earth, but the end of wickedness. Jesus taught people that the Kingdom of God would rule over the earth. (Luke 4:43) THE LAST DAYS War. Jesus said: \u201cNation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.\u201d (Matthew 24:7) More people have been killed in wars in our time than at any other time in history. One report from the Worldwatch Institute shows that since 1914, wars have killed more than 100 million people. More than three times as many people were killed in wars during the 100 years between 1900 and 2000 as were killed during the previous 1,900 years. Just imagine the misery and pain that millions of people have felt because of war! Scenes of the last days: a bomb exploding, a malnourished child, a war plane, a person trapped after an earthquake 7 Hunger. Jesus said: \u201cThere will be food shortages.\u201d (Matthew 24:7) Even though more food is produced now than ever before, many people never have enough to eat. Why? Because they don\u2019t have enough money to buy food or land on which to grow it. More than a billion people have less than one dollar a day to live on. The World Health Organization says that millions of children die each year, mainly because they don\u2019t have enough food to keep them healthy. 8, 9. What shows that Jesus\u2019 prophecies about earthquakes and disease have come true? 8 Earthquakes. Jesus prophesied: \u201cThere will be great earthquakes.\u201d (Luke 21:11) Many powerful earthquakes are now expected every year. Since the year 1900, over two million people have died because of earthquakes. And although technology has helped to detect earthquakes earlier than before, many people still die. 9 Disease. Jesus foretold that there would be \u201cpestilences.\u201d Dangerous diseases would spread quickly and kill many. (Luke 21:11) Even though doctors have learned how to treat many sicknesses, there are still sicknesses that cannot be cured. In fact, one report explains that each year, millions of people die from diseases, such as tuberculosis, malaria, and cholera. Not only that, but doctors have found 30 new diseases, and some of them have no cure. WHAT PEOPLE WOULD BE LIKE IN THE LAST DAYS At 2 Timothy 3:1-5, the Bible says: \u201cIn the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here.\u201d The apostle Paul described how many people would behave during the last days. He said people would be selfishlove moneydisobey their parentsnot be loyallack affection for their familyhave no self-controlbe violent and aggressivelove pleasures more than Godpretend to love God but refuse to obey him11. According to Psalm 92:7, what will happen to wicked people? 11 Do many people behave like this where you live? All over the world, many do. But God will soon do something about it. He promises: \u201cWhen the wicked sprout like weeds and all the wrongdoers flourish, it is that they may be annihilated [or, destroyed] forever.\u201d\u2014Psalm 92:7. Not to hell. ",

            "answer_text": "If you plot on a graph the critical planet-threatening, species-extinguishing threats that are measurable and verifiable, you will find that many of the curves converge in 20 to 40 years. 2040 to 2050 is going to be the decade when civilization could easily come to an utter end. Interestingly, that is also the decade which Bible prophecy and chronology points to as the focal point of all the Bible\u2019s hopes. Not the time of death and destruction, but of rescue and hope. I would argue that we will come to the end of human governance, the end of institutional Christianity, the end of every optimistic dream of humans \u201csaving the world\u201d, in about 20 to 25 years. But that will also be the end of death, disease, slavery and environmental destruction, because it will be the beginning of a new era. It is \u201cthe world to come, wherein dwells righteousness.\u201d Ludicrous as it may sound to you, the golden age, in my humble opinion, is around the corner. If I\u2019m right, here are some predictions along the way which can be used to gauge our progress, and test my hypothesis: Trump and Trumpism will go into eclipse, probably as early as this fall.We will have a new, albeit much lower, normal in terms of economic prosperity and public health for the next 8 years, till roughly 2029.During that time the progressive parts of American and European society will enjoy relative calm compared to the turmoil of 2020, and a number of social and public health improvements will be undertaken.Even with the best of intentions and liberality of expression, our human leaders will face constant challenges from accelerating climate catastrophes, economic collapses, new pandemics, food and water supply emergencies, etc.On top of these existential threats, the pressure from violent \u201cChristian\u201d elements of society will mount, and a new kind of Trumpism that is much more cunning and competent will again lay a claim to power and the authority to speak for God. I expect them to regain power again in 2028 or 2029, either through election or overthrow resulting from civic unrest.We will then face what Jesus called the \u201cdark night\u201d, and \u201cwinter\u201d. I think it will last the better part of 14 years. Non-violent and multicultural Christian voices will be silenced, along with many on the secular left. The repression will start with efforts to restrain popular unrest, and end with the disintegration of all the benefits of civilization we take for granted: the electrical grid, water and sewage, subways, easy air travel, news coverage, the internet, habeas corpus, etc.One major feature of this sequence which is well known is the idea of a Middle Eastern war that will threaten Israel. Known popularly as \u201cArmageddon\u201d, this battle will pit Arab and Russian invaders against an Israel standing alone, without any outside help. A major turning point, which may not even be noticed globally because media coverage may already be curtailed by then, will be a promised miraculous deliverance for Israel from certain defeat.In the end the wheels will then fall off the rest of the global economic system, and many will flee to whatever wilderness they can find, to live off the land in ad hoc efforts at community cooperation without the institutions of government. Picture tent cities stretching for miles. And also picture many people focused on retribution against those rich folks who have attempted to hole up in their bunkers behind their survivalist fences and stockpiles of food and weapons.That frightful denouement of western civ will be short-lived \u2014 because before it can reach a destructive climax the loving hand of God will intervene, coming to the rescue of planet Earth.These are predictions that have been more or less understood, without the time-precision we now have, for almost 200 years, but have been buried under the suppression of \u201corthodox\u201d Christian voices since the 1840s. Then all the news will be good, and life and peace will spread planet-wide. Within a couple more centuries, after the living billions have idled the doomsday engine of civilization, and begun to heal the planet and their own souls, peace and prosperity will expand to include all the dead generations of mankind. For a thousand years this restorative work will continue. I like the way Isaiah summarizes that scene in his vision: \u201cThe whole earth is at rest and is quiet. They break forth into singing.\u201d You asked when? The end of new bad stuff comes in 2043, give or take a couple of years. The immediate cleanup of the mess of the last two centuries, leading up to the 2040s, will probably take at least two centuries \u2026 a time when 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 billion people learn to work together on improving the planet, and treating each other like the golden souls they are capable of being. No one is dying, everyone is getting healthier, the climate starts improving, animal populations start bouncing back, and major shortages and practical problems are being solved by cooperative effort. And then another 800 years of worldwide growth and prosperity accompanies the resurrection and resettlement of all the past generations of mankind. Like Israel in the last 70 years, the human race will be busy making room and providing a welcoming home for their parents, grandparents, etc. If the Bible is true, the earth will not come to an end. It was made to be inhabited. ",
