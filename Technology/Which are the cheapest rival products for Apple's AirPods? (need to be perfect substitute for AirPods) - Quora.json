            "answer_text": "My daughter got her Airpod Pro\u2019s for her B\u2019Day (lucky kid!), and so I got to compare them to my Bose SoundSport Wireless. Hers sound amazing, really, which, for me is the most important characteristic in an earphone. And has some very neat other features most people will appreciate (me included). For me, though, the SoundSports are preferred, because \u201cThe Bose Sound\u201d, for me, is preferred. Punchy bass, clean mids, and generally very good. Her Airpods are, as well (surprisingly so), but the bass is slightly less (for me) satisfying. So, the Bose SoundSport Wireless (about $99 these days (but they have a wire connecting them together behind your neck (which I like (harder to lose (etc., etc.))))) is a cheaper alternative, and in some ways, \u201cbetter\u201d. Caveat: I went to a busy (and affluent) mall with my SoundSports (meaning, EVERYBODY had BlueTooth devices in use), and all the interference meant I could not use mine. It is an older product, where this was not yet an issue (Apple says theirs are immune from others\u2019 device usage). That is the only problem, for me. Other than that, Bose is great, for me. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing will quite match Apples airpods in terms of connectivity, style, fit, and finish. The only other options don't have a connected eartip style, nor will they have the same connectivity features. The other responses don't take into account the style of the Airpods, fully wireless, hey Siri supported, the charging case is unique as well. The best option is to get fully wireless earbuds with similar available features. If you have an iPhone, there's nothing in the same category that would work better. If you have an Android, the Samsung Galaxy buds are a pretty good bet. They have a wireless charging case, have a Virtual Assistant, have great battery life, and touch controls that work. Other options include Jaybird run series, Sennheiser momentum and others like that. Run XT Samsung Galaxy Buds - Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds | Samsung US MOMENTUM True Wireless ",
