            "answer_text": "Seeing that Venmo is increasing the fee for instant transfers to your bank account as of November 6th 2018, it\u2019s a good time to be looking at the company Metal Pay. The company launched the app in September 2018 and its primary competitor is Venmo. This P2P payments app allows users to send money to one another without charging a fee. Not only that, you will actually earn cryptocurrency each time to send and receive money.

I find n number of pages that are dedicated to that which people have used or made a sample of.  According to me, there is a barrier of cost when it comes to new technology being easily accessible to end users. Google Glasses is one good example. Everyone wants it, question is who can afford it?
