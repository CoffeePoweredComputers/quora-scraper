            "answer_text": "The most prominent technologies that comes to mind is telecommunication, navigation and reconnaissance satellites. One device that can be find in many cars and in almost all modern cellphone devices is GPS. Global positioning system is used for navigation. This technology was developed as a result of space research and in fact it actually is deployed in space.  Communication satellites are used to provide television, voice, video and internet service to remote area that have no other alternatives, and to cities where other alternatives such as fiber, cable and telephone lines exists. Only this week we heard that SpaceX\u2019s starling was granted license to provide internet services to Canadians through their satellites systems in space.  Weather satellites helps to gather data to better predict the weather and climate change.  But generally, if you are looking for technologies that were developed as part of space research and are being used on Earth for other purposes, you probably want to check NASA\u2019s website and look for spinoff technologies. Here is NASA brochure that list spinoff technologies in 2020. https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2020/pdf/2020_Brochure_web.pdf Note, 2020 is not over, there are other years other than 2020, and there are other space agencies and organization involved in space research other than NASA. So, the 2020 spinoff technologies list above is a partial list. ",

            "answer_text": "Shalom Semra Following your request for specific researches, I would like to add one very important research that is not exactly related to the space efforts but it is still a very unique one and conducts us to think outside the box. Israel has just completed its first successful knee surgery using a coral-based implant invented by an Israeli startup. Earlier this month, a 30-year-old patient who had undergone several unsuccessful knee surgeries in the past received an Agili-C implant at Hadassah University Medical Center on Jerusalem\u2019s Mount Scopus campus, created by the Kfar Saba-based CartiHeal startup. Agili-C, which is made of a material derived from the exoskeletons of coral, is currently undergoing clinical studies centering around the regeneration of damaged cartilage and bone. More than 70 patients have been treated with the implant so far worldwide. Dr. Adi Friedman, who performed the operation, said the surgery could be an important milestone in knee surgery. \u201cThe need for an implant that leads to the regrowth of damaged cartilage is genuinely needed in the orthopedic world, and we hope that the [clinical] trial will succeed, and that the implant will be the breakthrough that we have been waiting for for many years,\u201d he said in a statement. This is just one innovation from the start up nation, Israel, laboratories. There are still many more. Thank you In friendship Rima ",
