            "answer_text": " I\u2019m old enough to remember being in awe as I made a call on a cell phone like this back in 1992.  Of course I was impressed in 2001 when I got my hands on one of these babies.  I was blown away in 2007 when I got this puppy.  10 years later the iphone 10 gives us facial recognition, gps, unlimited music, 1000\u2019s of apps, camera, video camera, text messaging, virtual credit cards etc.  Soon we will be lining up to purchase this thing. The Wove Band. It took less than a decade to to from the 1992 brick phone to the 2001 small cell phone. It took 15 years to go from the brick phone to the iphone. It took ten years to go from the iphone to the iphone 10. 2007\u20132017 I truly believe that in 2021 we will look back at this question and say the last five years of innovations have been greater in scale and impact on everyday life than the innovations produced and consumed from 1992 to 2017. When I think of the tech that went into that brick phone in 1992 I think of the industry it spawned and the jobs it created. When I think of the tech that goes into that wrist computer (last pic) I think about how the A.I. in that thing will not create jobs but eliminate jobs. By the way, can\u2019t wait to buy a Wove Band. ",

            "answer_text": "This really depends on how you perceive advancement. Will we see mindblowing advances in technology that we haven\u2019t seen before or will we just see improvements on existing technology that\u2019s been around for a while. My gut feeling is that we will see more of the latter and less of the former. We are already seeing it in the movie industry with reboots after reboot using tried and trusted money making formulae (not guaranteed but better than gambling on a new idea). ",
