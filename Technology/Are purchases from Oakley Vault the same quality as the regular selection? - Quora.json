            "answer_text": "Just to update a previous incorrect answer \u2014 the eyewear available at Oakley Vaults is not exclusively \u2018old eyewear\u2019. Discontinued Eyewear (DE) is available only at Oakley Vaults and at a greatly reduced price. DE items are unsold retail items that have been returned to factory for QC and redistributed to Vaults. Though Oakley Vaults sell DE items, they are also equipped with most of the latest and greatest you'd expect to find at a retail location. From the newest Elmonts to the oldest Hijinx \u2014 snowboard/motocross goggles, football and hockey visors galore. All of those from factory, and nowhere else unless specifically a DE item. Note, you won't find a Vault store that is outfitted with a Rx (prescription) frame selection \u2014 Opticians only work in retail locations. ",
