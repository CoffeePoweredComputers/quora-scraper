            "answer_text": "Hi there,  I see that you are looking for a technology product to increase your productivity, and I am here to help! Appfluence is an app that increases your productivity, efficiency, and can save you 45 minutes a day using the Eisenhower Method of time management. Within the app, you can divide all of your tasks and projects into these four categories:  Critical and Do Now: these are tasks that demand attention now, because of their rapidly-approaching due date, and their importance. For example: preparing for an investor meeting, or replacing your all-star sales team member who just quit. Critical, but Do Later: tasks in this category can be approached more calmly. Examples include: reaching a long-term goal of boosting sales by 25%, or building a new company website. Not Critical, but Do Now: these tasks are best handled by delegating them to someone on your team, because they don\u2019t demand your expertise. Examples include: cancelling an upcoming meeting, or adding data to a spreadsheet. Not Critical and Do Later: in general, this is a place to leave underdeveloped ideas, or random tasks that don\u2019t fit into other categories. A good rule is to get rid of these after 2 weeks if they haven\u2019t been addressed.    So, you divide your projects and goals into four quadrants, as shown in the diagram and make an individual 4-quadrant project from each one.- This allows you to figure out and prioritize the tasks that will allow you to complete each project and reach your goals. If you\u2019re looking for an app to help you with this, try Priority Matrix. Within the app you can: Create multiple projects to prioritize tasks and stay organizedEasily collaborate with your team members and delegate workSet task due dates and sync to your calendarUpload files and chat within the appManage your emailsStop losing time re-organizing your to-do list!There are also other templates other than the Eisenhower method that you can use to prioritize each project!Here is a link to Try Priority Matrix for free!

            "answer_text": "Hello Everyone, Here I\u2019would love to explain some easy ways modern technology can be used to increase your productivity 1. Set clear goals  Setting clear goals is a major advantage and there are tools with powerful features that provide a simple way to track goals and achieve success. Moreover, technology also serves business and teams the easiest way to create a long-term plan aka a roadmap. It\u2019s simple, having SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based) goals and plans minimize the chances that things will grind to a standstill, thereby increasing business productivity. 2. Manage information effectively  In an organization, when employees get access to the necessary information that their job required, they tend to perform more productively. In addition to this, ensuring easier access to business-critical information helps to avoid frustration among employees and save time to get things done more efficiently. So, how do we make it easier to access information in the workplace? Well, the answer is technology. There is a range of document management and file management software solutions out there that allow businesses to store, organize, access and proof all their critical files in one centralized, secure place. Remember, your team and employees have a better experience if they have the ability to access information round the clock and overall productivity will increase. 3. Make collaboration seamless  It\u2019s a well-known fact that effective communication and collaboration are crucial to business productivity. Companies who resist investing their time and efforts in improving communication between teams often face whopping losses in the future. Luckily, today\u2019s market is offering businesses many advanced technological solutions to boost internal communication and team productivity, at the same time. From team messaging apps to video conferencing tools, there are many intuitive team collaboration tools available now for businesses of all sizes. Whether you are working with an in-house team or you\u2019re a freelancer, having the right collaboration technology helps to keep everyone on the same page regarding the company\u2019s business objectives, as a result, increase productivity. 4. Enhance employee engagement  Nothing kills productivity more than an employee with no direction. As a manager or supervisor, it is your responsibility to guide each employee and encourage them in improving their job as well as the organization they work for. You need to make sure that every team and every department in your company has a sense of purpose and are working dedicatedly towards their goal rather than just punching the clock. This is where technology provides opportunities to create, maintain, and increase employee engagement in the workplace. There are communication and task management tools available now that focus on alignment, feedback, learning and development of an employee in an organization. These tools are designed to offer employees clarity over their everyday duties and encourage them to be a part of the conversation, thereby increasing engagement and productivity. 5. Be available anytime (and anywhere)  Today, every individual in an organization is armed with updated mobile devices and advanced gadgets. So, why can\u2019t businesses use this fact to their advantage? By investing in the latest project management tools and apps, managers and owners can ensure that their employees always stay connected and never miss an opportunity. Furthermore, with the help of technology, the business can give their employees the freedom and flexibility to work from wherever they will be most comfortable. This leads to greater employee satisfaction and brings a huge increase in the business\u2019s productivity level. If you want your employees to be readily available, regardless of where they are, start evaluating the range of tools and solutions that are available in the market today. 6. Organize your time  If you can\u2019t keep track of your (and your team\u2019s) time, you can\u2019t use it productively. To improve your business productivity, you need to understand and work on your clock. Using a time tracking tool and workload planning solution can help you get answers to some simple yet important questions like\u200a\u2014\u200ahow much time each employee spends on each task? What are your most productive hours? How many tasks are falling behind schedule? And so on. These answers help you determine whether or not you (and your team) are being productive with your work hours. It further helps you to practice and promote better time management and, as a result, improve overall productivity.
