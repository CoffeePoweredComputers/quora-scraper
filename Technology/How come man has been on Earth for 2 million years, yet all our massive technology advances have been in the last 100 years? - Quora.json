            "answer_text": "Humankind has not been on earth for 2 million years. As sentient beings we would never stand for being bumbling morons for fifty thousand generations\u2014and history bears this out. The Aztecs, the Babylonians, the Egyptians all were brilliant mathematicians. Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the earth around the year 240 BC and is well known as the founder of the field of \u201cgeography\u201d as well as the innovator of the so-called \u201cleap day\u201d once every four years to keep the calendar in sync with the actual seasons. Two very significant factors of innovation as already mentioned by several others are what I call \u201ccritical mass\u201d of population and global proximity of collaborators. In earlier centuries Universities were isolated centers of higher education with attendance limited to the very privileged few. Innovations and innovators were sporadic and knowledge took years and even decades to become accepted and widely adopted. Whereas today such progress can be achieved in months, days, or even hours.  We can examine the matter of population from a realistic point of view in a natural geometric progression. We\u2019ll say hypothetically that there were five men and five women on earth 100,000 years ago. Infant mortality for these fictional troglodytes is 20% so when every couple has five children one will die in childbirth\u2014not at all unrealistic. Every couple begins having children at the age of 30 and stops having children at the age of 35, meaning five children are born, one child dies. Each couple has four children who survive to child-bearing age and so on. Every 33 years the original population doubles\u2014meaning every century sees an eightfold increase in global population (minus a 12% attrition rate for those who die of old age.) Ten original humans become 80 after 100 years, 640 after 200 years, 5120 after 300 years, 40960 after 400 years, 327000 after 500 years, 2.6million after 600 years, 20million after 700 years, 167milion after 800 years, and 1.3 billion after 900 years. That would put earth\u2019s population at 10.7 billion after 1000 years\u2014a mere 99,000 years ago. Really? You start to see the problem of keeping this progression going for five thousand years, let alone two million\u2014especially when you consider the reality that the world population today actually does double about every 37 years! The idea that humans have been on earth for 2 million years is absurd.  So, back to reality\u2026 Cause and Effect (i.e. Reality) says that for innovation to happen all requisite parts of the innovation must exist already. Simple case in point\u2014semiconductors.  In 1947, one transistor exists in the world and Mr. Shockley is looking at it. 1947-Shockley, Bardeen, Brattain patent the silicon transistor1957-Bill Noyce patents the Integrated Circuit1968-Noyce leaves Fairchild Semiconductor, starts Intel Corporation1969-Bolt, Beranek & Newman of Boston inaugurate the ARPAnet1971-Intel introduces 4004, the first \u201cmicroprocessor\u201d1973-Motorola exec Martin Cooper makes first call over a \u201ccellular\u201d network1981-IBM introduces the original \u201cIBM-PC\u201d featuring Intel 8088 CPU1989-Intel develops the first 80486\u2014the PC is ready for the mainstream1990-Microsoft releases the first successful Windows (version 3.0)1991-Tim Berners-Lee develops HTML and conceives the \u201cworld wide web\u201d1994-Marc Andreessen develops Netscape1995\u20132006 WiFI matures, Bluetooth is invented, LED screens become commonplace, touchscreens come down in price, CCD (charged coupling) devices for digital imaging make enormous advancements, flash drives progress from a few kilobytes to over eight gigabytes, 64-bit processors come into existence\u2026etc\u2026etc\u2026etc2007-Steve Jobs introduces the iPhone There is and always has been Cause, and Effect. You are looking at one of the very first smartphones. Today in 2018 a mere decade later over 5.1 billion smartphones exist. Zero existence of semiconductor devices to total global saturation of full-scale mobile communication in seven decades. The people who lived for the thousands of years before we existed were just as smart as us (and often probably smarter) they just didn\u2019t know as much. If we have accomplished a few amazing things, it is because we are standing on the shoulders of giants. ",

            "answer_text": "First, the question is wrong, at most it is 250,000 years, not 2M. We can not assume that non Sapiens varieties of Homo had language, let alone the capacity for abstract thought necessary to develop written records of achievements so essential to the accumulation and propagation of acquired knowledge, which is at the heart of the intellectual advances of the last 4,000years. But it is enough of a conundrum to ask, with the same species of primate for 250,000 years, why agriculture appeared independently in so many places and why only in the last 10,000 years. Sure, this marks the end of the last Ice Age, but many other Ice Ages came and went without any such human cultural development being triggered. Agriculture appeared in China, India, Mesopotamia & The Levant & Egypt, the Americas and New Guinea (this last one always surprises people, but it shows there is nothing \u201cinevitable\u201d about progress once agriculture is developed, as here \u201cprogress\u201d remained static and stuck in the Stone Age). \u201cGuns Germs and Steel\u201d explains why Eurasia developed faster, but not why it developed at all. Some answers here are wrong to imply the inevitability of intellectual, technological and material progress, because many times in history that has gone into reverse. Islam, the society which probably came closest to developing Scientific Rationalism, (and which did actually found one Science, Chemistry) went into reverse fast after 1200 and has been doing so again since about 1970 and rapidly so, even among the brightest and the youngest, and many of the well educated. Thought within the Islamosphere is being corrupted by Saudi Wahhabism financed by oil. There are droves of these anglophone, articulate and often berobed young men with depressingly Medieval minds on Quora Anyone who thinks the intellectual environment doesn\u2019t matter needs to reflect upon the fact that 1.8bn Muslims have produced just three Nobel prizes in Science. Several individual Oxford and Cambridge colleges with under a thousand people have done better than this. China went into reverse after about 1350 (shortly after her fleet reached East Africa), and of course large parts of Western Europe itself forgot how to read and write after the fall of Rome, and took a thousand years to get back to the same population levels as were achieved under the Empire. Finally, Bible Belt America began to go into intellectually reverse gear in the 1920s and just as with Islam today, the power of the irrational mind is ignored at our peril, as it can infect even Western minds too (just think of all the intelligent Film Stars who hold or have held absolutely bonkers religious and \u201cphilosophical\u201d ideas). \u201cIn God we trust\u201d was only made a legal requirement to put on US currency in 1956. Not to mention the absurdity of both 20C National and Soviet Socialism whose iniquitous fantasies were all clothed in the language of Scientific Rationalism. However, it is the advent of literacy, printing, paper, then telecommunications, Radio and TV (which can reach even the illiterate) and finally the Internet, which have undoubtedly been responsible for the cumulative acquisition of Scientific knowledge which has produced and allowed the propagation of first the revolution of Steam, then the internal combustion engine,Electricity and finally the computer. All this has produced the revolution of the last 200 years. And what an overwhelmingly predominantly Anglo-Saxon succession of Revolutions it has been. No coincidence, because between the demise of Latin and the advent of World English, there was no single tongue with which the individual European intellectual power houses could communicate with each other, or the rest of the World. French came closest, but the German speakers, (by far the greatest Continental contributors), remained relatively isolated, without even political unity until 1871. England of course had the advantage of early political unification (926AD) and military security, (no significant invasion for almost 1000 years) as well as complete independence from Papal thought police, (who so crippled Italy Spain and Portugal), nor did we have the the handicap of a Louis XIV, who performed a similar role for \u201crationalist\u201d France (which slaughtered and expelled her Protestants, the group most prepared to think the unthinkable in Science as in Religion), and no Asiatic hoardes ( be they Mongol or Muslim) to sweep periodically into our State and cripple thought and the structures created to nurture it. Most English contributors lived within the small triangle formed by London, Oxford and Cambridge. In addition of course, later on, the huge input from the burgeoning population of the Empire and the USA (always part of a single \u201cEnglish\u201dintellectual entity, unaffected by 1776). In the Anglophone hothouse practical applications for new ideas proved to be \u201cthe English speciality\u201d, whereas the often patrician European,Chinese and Indian pursuit of knowledge for the sake of knowledge, the down-market and only recently literate English, knowledge was pursued for the sake of material advantage. Always motivated by \u201chow can this turn me in a profit?\u201d And of course essential to this also, was an economic and legal system which allowed the individual to keep his material gains. Here modern economic theory (Lead by Adam Smith) and the English Common Law ( and the development of Patent law) were critical. Something Russia snuffed out herself with Socialism, even after she had expelled all her invaders. So the largest oil producer and biggest State on earth, has today an economy about the same size as that of Italy. Her present form of State Gangster Capitalism confiscates material gain almost as effectively as does Socialism. The same is of course true of Capitalist States which have not controlled their criminal networks, even when the State is not itself hand in glove with criminality. This is why even a creaking economy like Socialist Cuba appears not so bad, when compared with the drug crazed and criminal infested forms of Capitalism which prevail across much of the Caribbean and Latin America. And of course before Castro, Cuba was almost run by the American Mafia. Anyone who doesn\u2019t think that economic and legal systems affect the rate of technological and material progress need only consider the dramatic difference between E and W Germany in the past, and N and S Korea in the present day. Identical populations and cultures. Wildly different outcomes. Altogether it has been a constellation of so many factors which has produced this astonishing technological revolution, to which most of the Planet has now been recruited in some form or other, and ideas, inventions, techniques and resources are now pooled and applied to problems in a vast co-operative effort which traverses all cultures, economic systems and linguistic groups.
