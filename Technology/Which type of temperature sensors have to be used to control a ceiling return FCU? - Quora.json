            "answer_text": "The sensor can be a thermostat, thermistor type sensor or even a bimetallic type of appropriate accuracy. Normally this would be located about 5 feet above the floor and under the return grille as a reasonable and traditional location. This sensor, via a controller, would operate the fan and control valves for heating or cooling as appropriate. If the FCU (Fan Coil Unit for those wondering), is larger and serving more rooms, sensors can be averaged or a single return air sensor would be used to gauge the average temperature of all rooms. ",
