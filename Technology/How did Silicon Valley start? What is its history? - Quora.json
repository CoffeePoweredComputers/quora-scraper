            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a combination of things. Great universities like Stanford and UC Berkeley. Good weather. In the beginning it had reasonable housing costs. All of this led to a critical mass of great engineers who pioneer new methods and learn from each other. Fairchild Semiconductor was one of the first big companies in the Silicon Valley. It pioneered many innovations and employed well over 10,000 people at its peak. But eventually it struggled and people left, but those that did spread throughout the valley and started new companies. A critical mass of great engineers begets even more innovation and more great engineers. People leave one company and bring their techniques and know-how to other companies where they learn from each other. That group then migrates to yet more companies and spreads that knowledge even further. I work in the Silicon Valley and I have learned more from my coworkers than I ever have from books. But why has Silicon Valley succeeded where other areas of the country have failed? In the 1980s route 128 around Boston became known as \u201cAmerican\u2019s Technology Highway\u201d. It also has great universities like Harvard and MIT. It had many well known companies like Digital Equipment Corporation, Data General, and Wang Labs. After these companies struggled and went under, why didn\u2019t other major companies sprout in their place as they did in the Silicon Valley? I believe that main reason that the Boston area did not do as well is because Massachusetts has allowed restrictive noncompete clauses while California law does not. (Massachusetts has finally passed a law preventing such restrictive contracts.) People were able to leave Fairchild and start other companies. They were today able to go from company to company spreading their knowledge. In Massachusetts people were not easily able to go from one company to another due to such restrictive employment contracts. It was more difficult for them to leave and start their own companies and more difficult to find good workers if they did. In fact, the law discouraged many good engineers from staying in the state at all. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a wealth of information about this online, so you should really do a simple Google search before asking here on Quora. That said, there happens to be an excellent new PBS documentary on this precise subject: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/introduction/silicon-introduction/  Here's the summary: In 1957, decades before Steve Jobs dreamed up Apple or Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook, a group of eight brilliant young men defected from the Shockley Semiconductor Company in order to start their own transistor business. Fairchild Semiconductor's radical innovations helped make the United States a leader in both space exploration and the personal computer revolution, transforming a fertile valley in California into a hub of technological ingenuity, and changing the way the world works, plays, and communicates. Their leader was 29-year-old Robert Noyce, a physicist with a brilliant mind and the affability of a born salesman who would co-invent the microchip -- an essential component of nearly all modern electronics today, including computers, motor vehicles, cell phones and household appliances. On October 4, 1957, the young founders of the newly minted start-up heard some startling news: the Soviet Union had just launched the first artificial satellite into orbit around the Earth. With the United States scrambling to catch up, the timing could not have been better for the upstarts at Fairchild, who got the opportunity of a lifetime when President Eisenhower and Congress created NASA a year later. The new availability of government contracts immediately gave Fairchild a client who had both a great demand for their products and the deep pockets to purchase them. In fewer than two years, Noyce co-created a groundbreaking invention that helped put men on the moon, and it had an impact far beyond the Apollo program. The integrated circuit, also known as the microchip, would re-shape the future, and launch the world into the Information Age by paving the way for the invention of microwaves, pacemakers, digital video recorders, and smart phones. Noyce transformed the world with not only his invention, but also his management style, which launched the unique business culture for which Silicon Valley would come to be known -- openness over hierarchy, risk over stability, jeans over suits. This revolutionary new style continued at Noyce's next venture, Intel, which in 1971 introduced the world's first microprocessor, the driving force of every digital product we use today, and the heart of a $100-billion industry. An eye-opening look at the birthplace of the modern technological era told by the people who shaped it, Silicon Valley is a fascinating reminder of how Robert Noyce and his team of trailblazers led the way in transforming California's Santa Clara Valley into a worldwide hub of industry and innovation, and laid the bedrock for modern technology.
