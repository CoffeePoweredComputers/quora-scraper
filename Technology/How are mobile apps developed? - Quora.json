            "answer_text": "Demand of mobile apps is increasing rapidly around the globe and we can find millions of Business apps, lifestyle apps, educational apps, on-demand apps etc on the Google Play Store and the App Store.  Starting your own app based business is good idea but you must have a proper plan for it as the competition is stiff and its challenging to attract the users. Here I am sharing few tips on how to start your own app based business: KNOW THE PAIN POINT It\u2019s imperative to know the pain point you want to solve. If your idea is solving a specific point point for a niche target audience then you are on the right track. You should know the requirements of the audience which will help you understand the pain points in better way. IDEA  After analysing the problems, interest and requirements of the users it will be a bit easier for you to come up with an app idea. If you are struggling to come up with an idea, then go an analyze other apps in the market, which will give you a few ideas. MARKET RESEARCH Now, you know that you are going to build an app for particular field and next step is to move towards the market research. Check out the similar apps on the Store. Download few apps use them personally from the end user\u2019s perspective and you\u2019ll come to know about the positive and negative points of your competitors. In this way you can also find the latest trends and see what your potential customers want right now. PLATFORM CHOICE  You should choose the best platform for your app so that you can provide good experience to the users. You can go for Android app or iOS app or both depending on your target geography and audience. You may choose to go with: Native: For specific platform only like iOS or Android. Different code for different platform. Hybrid: For both platforms iOS and Android. You can code once and reuse it for both iOS and Android DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT  If you are familiar with any of mobile app programming language then it's good otherwise you can hire a developer or a team of developers and designers for the development of your app. Designing is the first step and functionality development is second. UI of your mobile app should very innovative, modern and smooth. Focus on the user interface and user experience. The functionality comes later. TESTING  It\u2019s very important to properly test your app before you launch it in the market. Try to find as many bugs as you can before you launch. You can always launch incremental updates with bug fixes post launch but it\u2019s best to avoid any crashes or bugs before you put the app in the hands of your customers. Focus on giving a great user experience to your customers. LAUNCH YOUR APP  Finally, its the time to submit your app to the store. You must know and abide by the guidelines and the rules of the app store for the successful approval of your app. If you want your app to have a high download and user retention rate, it needs to make a good first impression within the first few days of the launch. In order to optimize the onboarding process, this is a critical time to focus on highlighting the value of the app. If you are unable to impress your new users quickly, you\u2019ll likely lose their interest altogether. MOBILE APP MONETIZATION  You should select the best monetization strategy based on your app\u2019s purpose. I am sharing few app monetization strategies which will be helpful to make money from the mobile app. Advertising: This is the most common and easy way to drive more traffic to your app and get more downloads by end-users. You can do advertising by third-party ad networks. Different type of ads like- Banner ads, Native ads, Video ads, interstitial, incentivized and display ads.Sponsorship: If you have decent traction in the market then you will also attract the sponsors. This can be done in two ways: Either receive a monthly sponsorship fee or to split the revenue with your sponsor.In-app purchases: This is the powerful strategy to earn money. All you need to do is to keep some features paid in your app. Those paid features must be very attractive and your app should entice the user to upgrade to those features.Push or e-mail marketing: Once you have a large user-base, you can charge brands to add their logos or offer in your email newsletter or push notification.Subscriptions: You can add subscriptions to your mobile app. Subscription means you are offering some content to the user for a limited period of time and after the user will pay to unlock the whole content without any restriction.Collecting and selling data: As we all know that mobile apps collect the behaviour data of their user and this type of data can be required by number of researcher, So you can sell that behaviour data to the researcher and make a good amount of money.And remember, be in it for the long-run. You may not get short term returns but if you continue to focus on marketing and user feedback based updates, then things will fall in place for you. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve launched over many apps and SaaS platforms for entrepreneurs and early-stage startups who\u2019ve gone ahead and made hundreds and millions of dollars using these platforms. If you have an app idea and not sure where to start, I can help. Feel free to connect with contact details in my profile. ",

            "answer_text": "If I was starting a new mobile app today I would start with these questions to myself. Has this idea been done already?If it has been done, can I improve the solution for a user via my idea?Is there a way for me to get some user feedback using spoken words and paper?Do I need some form of web presence to build interest and demonstrate capabilities?What would be the amount of money I would be willing to put toward this app idea, my seed investment?What would be the amount of time I have available to put toward this app idea?Is there a way for me to partner with someone who I can give either money or equity and they will do the things I do not have time to do?Can I find a partner who will contribute funds in addition to my time?What is the potential market for this app idea?Who will build / design / code the various aspects of the app, do I know these people already?Everything up to this point has lead me to the decision of YES or NO to going further. If its a NO, or a Not Just Yet, then I park that idea for a little while, it sits in the back of my mind, simmering. If its a YES, then, my method of starting to make an app is; Map the idea in a digital flow - On a whiteboard I picture the app as a website. People land on the home page, they explore a little, they interact and they do something.Identify Users - Who are these users which I pretended to be on the whiteboard; customers, different types of customers, staff, friends of customers and so on.Mapping and user identities are the minimum I would do when starting an app. What follows are things I also do, but I have experience now building apps and these things get me to where I want to be faster. Design the database tables needed to support whatever knowledge this app requires.Design the look and feel, maybe give the app a working title and image in my head to represent the app as a real thing.Get my back-end dev to mock up in less than 10 hours a sample site.Build some front UI samples on InvisionReview what I have built to date and start so I can see what we have learned, what we still need to know and also what works best. I may take this to users again to test their interest and feedback.From this point on-wards the decision has to be made \u201cdo we now invest the $30k plus to get this thing going or not\u201d. That is a somewhat subjective decision to make but hopefully by doing the above list of items, you have a greater understanding of the risks and what is involved. And most of the above costs me about $2,000 or less each time. By the time i have spent the $2,000 its more a case of when do we proceed, not whether we will stop now. We look at apps as businesses and the $2,000 as the due diligence we do on every one of them before we buy. ",

            "answer_text": "In 2020, mobile apps are expected to generate revenue of 8 188.9 billion through app stores and app advertising. What's more, by 2022, the value of enterprise mobility is estimated at $ 510.39 billion. Although many businesses are trying to make the most of this trend, most of them do not know how to effectively build an app. Success becomes a reality in the competitive landscape of these growth forecasts \u2014 but only if the process of mobile app development is fully supported. Regardless of the size or scope of this development process, your company will succeed with the mobile app development program. 1. Strategy First, the mobile app development process defines the strategy that makes your idea a successful app. You can add a more important part of this to your overall enterprise mobility strategy. While the goals of one app may differ from another, there is still an application-specific impact on the mobility strategy to address in the development process. At this stage, you can: Identify app usersResearch the competitionSet goals and objectives of the appSelect the mobile platform for your app2. Analysis and planning At this stage, your app idea will start to take shape and become a real project. Diagnostic cases begin by defining use cases and summarizing detailed functional requirements. Once you have identified the requirements of your application, prepare a product roadmap. This includes prioritizing mobile app requirements and classifying them as delivery milestones. If time, resources, or costs are a concern, define your minimum viable product (MVP) and prioritize it for the initial experiment. 3.UI / UX Design The purpose of app design is to provide seamless and effortless user experiences with an enhanced design. The success of a mobile app certainly depends on how much the users are adopting and benefiting from all its features. The goal of mobile app UI / UX design is to create amazing user experiences that make your app interactive, intuitive, and user friendly. Improved UI designs help with early adoption, and your app needs to have intuitive user experiences to keep app users engaged. 4. Application development Planning is an integral part of this phase of the mobile application development process. Before embarking on actual development/programming efforts, you should: Define technical architecture,Select the technology stack andDefine the development of milestones.A typical mobile app project is made up of three integral components: back-end/server technology, API (s), and mobile app front-end. 5.Testing Performing a thorough quality assurance (QA) test in the mobile app development process makes apps consistent, usable, and secure. To ensure a comprehensive QA test of your app, you must first prepare test cases that address all aspects of application testing. 6. Unemployment & Support To release the native mobile app you will need to submit your app to the app stores for iOS apps including the Apple App Store and Google Play for Android apps. For this reason, you need a developer account with the Apple App Store and Google Play Store before launching your mobile app. For app release in the App Store, you need to prepare metadata, including: Title your appDescriptionCategoryKeywordsStart the iconApp Store ScreenshotsApp development is an ongoing process of developing enterprise software applications or developing with emerging technologies. This process will continue after the initial launch as you receive user feedback and build additional functionality. This company ensures that your app is launched successfully if you follow the mobile app development process. ",

            "answer_text": "here\u2019s a look at the app development lifecycle and the objectives and challenges along the way. The ResearchFirstly, all apps start with an idea, even if yours is just to have a mobile app presence. So, refine that idea into a solid basis for an application. And, make sure your initial analysis includes actual demographics, motivations, behavior patterns and goals of your buyer persona. Well, during each stage of the process, keep the end-user in mind. Next, try to think of your customer\u2019s lifecycle, once their characteristics are pinned down. WireframingWell, the second step is to document and wireframe the app, to understand future functionalities. However, time is not on your side at this point, actually drawing detailed sketches of the envisioned product helps you uncover usability issues. Whenever you\u2019re done sketching, wireframing will help refine the ideas and arrange all components of the design in the right way. And, focus on the user experience and keep in mind the differences in the way people use a mobile app versus a mobile website. Technical Feasibility AssessmentNext, you might have a clear understanding of the visuals by now; however, you also need to consider if the back-end systems will be able to support the app\u2019s functionality. To know whether the idea of your application is feasible technically an app, depending on its format as well as the platform will have different requirements. DM360\u2019s team may have different ideas for the app or decided that some of the initial functionality isn\u2019t feasible. So, this point brainstorms a little, ask questions and review the status. PrototypeMoreover, build a rapid prototype. And, you can\u2019t truly comprehend the touch experience until and unless you touch the App and see how it works and flows. Thus, build a prototype that gets the app concept into a user\u2019s hands as quickly as possible to see how it works for the most common use case. Also, use rough and not exhaustive wireframes for this phase, will help you see if you are taking things in the right direction. And, the prototype will give different stakeholders the first look at your app and will help you validate the information you\u2019ve gathered. DesignMoving further, once you get this step out of the way, you can dive into coding. And, your user experience (UX) designer architects the interaction between design elements, as the user interface (UI) designer builds the look and feel of your app. Thus, depending on your project scope and app budget, this design phase can be completed in a single afternoon or can take a team a whole lot of hours. Also, remember to create multiple variations of a screen by playing around with the layout of navigation, buttons and other visual elements. Plus, the more your product varies, the higher the chances of your UX being original. DevelopFurther, the development phase generally starts quite early on. Well, one time an idea gains some maturation in the conceptual stage, also a working prototype is developed which validates functionality, assumptions, as well as assists to give an understanding of the scope of work. Next, in the initial stage, the core functionality although present is not tested. Thus, see the app is very buggy, and non-core functionality doesn\u2019t exist at this point. And, in the second stage, much of the functionality proposed is incorporated. So, the app has ideally gone through light testing and bug fixing, though some issues could still be present during this phase, the app is released to a certain group of external users for more testing. Lastly, after the bugs in the second stage are fixed, the app will move to the deployment phase where it\u2019s ready for release. TestingWell, in mobile app development, it\u2019s a good idea to test early and often. Doing this will keep your final costs low. And, the farther in you go into the development cycle, the costlier it becomes to fix bugs. Also, refer to the original design and planning documents while building out the various test cases. However, application testing is vast, so make sure your team covers all the necessary facets of it. And, the application should be tested for usability, compatibility, security, interface checks, stress, and performance. DeploymentLastly, your app is ready to submit. So, for different application stores, the policies for launching an application are different. And keep in mind, this is not the end. And, app development doesn\u2019t end at launch. Thus, as your application gets in the hands of users, feedback will pour in, and you will need to incorporate that feedback into future versions of the app. importantly, every app will need updates and new features. Usually, as soon as the first version of the app is released, the development cycle begins anew. Besides, the money invested in building a digital product, keep in mind that it\u2019s a long-term commitment. ",

            "answer_text": "Building an app isn\u2019t a piece of cake but a hard and time-consuming work of many people. Experienced people. If you want to build a mobile app, you should find a software house specialising in this particular field. A very handy tool here is Clutch - a software directory where you can check the company\u2019s experience, portfolio (in most cases) and previous clients\u2019 reviews. Choose one, share with them your idea and you\u2019re on the right track to develop your new mobile app. Seems straight forward, right? Nope. There are a few things that you should do before you choose and decide to contact a software development company. Idea - make sure your idea for a mobile app is unique.Research - do in-depth market research. Check your competition, what features are in other already available on the market apps. Dig dipper and learn what\u2019s really missing in the world of mobile apps and think what could you do differently from other developers.Features - define the core features, functions and design of the app. Describe what makes the app so special and worth purchasing. Would it be for Android or iOS?Users - define your users and verify your ideas with them. Ask them if they like the app and its features, design, price, etc. Ask them for honest feedback and use it in the next steps of development.Price - price your mobile app correctly, bear in mind that all bad assumption cost. You can earn a lot of money here or lose it all, along with time.When you tick all 5 points above, you\u2019re ready to call the software team.

Steps for the development of mobile applications Steps for the development of mobile applications When we want to turn an idea into reality and develop a technological project we have several alternatives such as using the commercial solution that best suits the needs of that project or developing an application tailored to your project, both are radically different in the execution. If you are from the second alternative, we will discuss the steps you need to take to make a custom mobile development: D functional EFINING the app The project must be well defined, both its objectives and the functionalities that are required to fulfill its purpose. The greater the definition, the better. If this task can not be done only, there are professionals as consultants to define a mobile application . This will prevent unforeseen developments that always make the projects more expensive, it is advisable to have everything fully defined before starting anything. Mobile application development company With the definition of the finished project, it is necessary to know how much it costs, so it is necessary to value the development. For this, it will be necessary to contact mobile development companies and agree on a term and price of the development of the app. Both the term and the price will depend entirely on the functionalities and the type of development chosen, since it is not the same (nor is a project of equal quality obtained) to develop native apps that hybrid, or that the project requires a complex back end oriented to mobile or do not even require this part. Planning It is the first phase of the development of the project. It consists of having a work program with a breakdown of all the activities that will be carried out (from the design to the final tests), the estimated time of hours that each of them will be dedicated and establishing the human resources that will be dedicated to achieve the objectives that have been proposed. In this process, which must be continuous, they must be reflected -Equipments, programs, licenses etc that are going to be used -New graphic assets and deadlines for receipt -Needs that depend on the client (hostings for example) and dates to have them available -Changes that may occur during the development of the app Good planning and its updating is key for the correct development of the mobile application and for its implementation on the scheduled date.  UI / UX design Prior to the implementation it is necessary to have totally defined the structural design of the app and its behavior. For this purpose, mobile application design programs such as Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop are used and then prototypes such as Invision that show the appearance and usability of the application. The design consists of making the appearance and usability as well as the correct application of Apple's design guidelines and the design guidelines for Android or Microsoft Windows Phone applications, in addition to the correct adaptation to all screen densities (remember for example Android has MDPI (160 DPI), HDPI (240 DPI), XHDPI (320 DPI), XXHDPI (480 DPI), XXHDPI (640 DPI) and its treatment to be suitable for programming. The design of mobile applications is one of the most important phases because it has nothing to do with the design for Windows desktop programs or even web designs and is what makes it especially interesting because it has to be specific for each app since each one of these has a different purpose. Development It is the programming of the project. This phase will be done according to the technology that has been decided to use for each programming platform and the development environments used will be in accordance with it (Eclipse, Xcode, Visual Studio ...); remember that you can develop native or hybrid apps , and it will take more work effort depending on the above. This is logical because if you decide to develop a native application and also for multiple platforms (Android, iOS and Windows Phone) will require specialized engineers in each of these areas, since Android is programmed in Java, iOS in Objective-C and Windows Phone in C #. If the project also requires a backend, a content manager and a web page, engineers with knowledge of PHP or Java, SQL and HTML5 will be needed. In view of the above, the development team , from an application, however simple, can be made up of 5 computer engineers (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Backend, Frontend) and a designer, as well as the director of the project that coordinates all of them. Hence, the cost of an app be totally dependent on the technology that we use in the development and the complexity of the project itself. Application testing Once the app is developed it is necessary to do a deep testing of all the parts of it. The testing can be divided into: -Functional testing: to ensure that the application works as it should and follows all the necessary flicks. - Test of performance: to verify that the behavior of the application under certain conditions (multiple requests of simultaneous access, little coverage, little battery ...) is correct. -Recommendations of memory leaks, crucial in mobiles because the resources are much more limited than in programs for desktop computers. For this task, task and program automation programs that report the error code are commonly used, in addition to intensive manual testing. Pre-release distribution Prior to the rise to the markets of mobile applications, distributions of mobile applications can be made. In Android it can be done using the Android development beta environment available in the developer console and for iOS there are alternatives such as using Testflight. Implementation and distribution At the end of the development the app will be suitable to be known and marketed and the last step will be to upload it to the corresponding application markets. For this last step you will have to digitally sign the apps with the developer account, create certificates for push notifications in Apple (if the app has this functionality implemented), compile the package and upload it to Google Play, App Store, Windows Marketplace ... Prepare the rest of the necessary requirements such as images, logos, descriptions etc. Required by the app markets. Promotion One of the most important steps and that should be done before finalizing the development and once it is published is the promotion of apps . The promotion is all the measures that will cause impact for the launch of the app and that will help to increase the visibility and therefore the downloads since increasing the visibility, you increase the downloads and the positions in the rankings, and this brings more downloads . As we discussed in previous posts, it is important to work on social networks forums and blogs with Community Managers etc to be noticed and improve in the rankings. ",

            "answer_text": "Mobile application market keeps in an explosive growth rate with the arrival of the 4G network era. Which drives the rapid development of mobile app screen design. Meanwhile, the big market also has a great job prospect for designers. How to make their own products stand out in the mobile application market is the opportunity and as well as challenges for UI designers. In addition to the function itself to attract users, the APP interface design also occupies a large part of the factors. Facing with the serious homogeneity on mobile app screen design and low competitiveness and other issues in the current mobile application market, how the app interface design trend will develop in the future to jump out of the cycle and find new opportunities? Fundamentally, the following points are worth considering: UI design principles Mobile interaction design rules How to judge an APP is good or not UI Design Principles  1. Consistency principle. The consistency principle of mobile phone APP is the visual structure, visual level, visual elements to achieve a unified design. That can help to reduce the user cognitive costs and deepen the impression of the product. 2. Be consistent with the design guidelines for mobile phone systems. A lot of interface design books have emphasized the consistency of the interface design principles. UI designers should also follow the Dos and Don'ts for iOS App UI Design and Android App UI design guide to ensure that the design conforms to the consistency of the operating system. For example, in the IOS System Human Machine Interaction Guide, it is noted that the default font for all IOS system versions is Helvetica Neue. 3. Keep the consistent on the visual structure. Usually, the APP visual structure mainly includes the status bar, navigation bar, main menu, and content area. The main menu usually appeared in the top of the interface, so we must follow this principle to put it at the top. The layout of the other pages keeps a good coordinate to arrange the other components in a proper proportion. Mobile Interaction Design Rules  Interaction design rules also apply to the small screens. Before proceeding with the design, designers should take into account the following five major design elements: 1. Goal-driven Design. This allows you to customize the app working process and meet requirements for target users. 2. Usability. The usability principle is emphasized in many design books. It may look empty, but you have to guarantee your application is usable and will bring value to users. 3. Affordance & Signifiers. The signifier is an implication of affordance. With correct signifier, users can easily understand UI element. For example, underlined blue text reminds you it\u2019s a hyperlink, and it can link to other pages when you click it. 4. Learn-ability. Users can instinctively know the function of this mobile app screen design, rather than through complex reasoning to clear the logic of each button, each jump between the pages of logic. Compliance with the instinctive design is the easiest to learn. 3. Feedback and response time. One of the standards to judge an APP is good or not is from the visual effect. A good mobile app screen design will usually impressive users at the first sight. So the visual effect on the retention of users played a crucial role. As for how to conquer the user on functions, and how to judge the APP is good or not, you can refer to the 14 questions of Julie Zhuo to the product manager.

            "answer_text": "Mobile app development can take place on multiple platforms, depending on what works best for you in terms of time and budget. If we talk about developing an app from a layman\u2019s perspective, you can go with these options: Developing an app yourself In another words, you can choose to \u201cdo it yourself\u201d. If you own a small scale business and have a relatively lesser budget and more time in hand, you can go with developing an app yourself. You will have to start by taking up an online course or training to develop a basic skill set. To gain basic knowledge, you will approximately need 5-6 months before you can actually start building the app. There is a possibility that you may have to keep upgrading your skill set, considering the language advancements. Not often do business owners opt for this options because of the immense time it takes to gain basic knowledge of developing an app and finally creating one. While you may think you are proficient with the app technology, your app may not be as impressive as you thought it would be. As economical as this option may sound, it may eat up a lot of your time that you could have invested in doing more revenue producing activities.  Subscribing for app builder plugin This is a great option for freelance app developers with limited clientele, who majorly want to convert website into app. App developers who work on a freelance models mostly subscribe to app builder plugins because of lack of exposure to deliver a full blown app. Sometimes, developers also go with this option when they have lesser time in hand to develop an app for their customer. My focus for this section has constantly been developers because to integrate an app plugin, you will still need basic coding skills. Also, to build an app through this option, you must have a website that can be turned into a mobile app. To go with this option, you will have to start by finalising a plugin that suits your requirement the best. You will also need basic development skills to integrate the plug to make an app.  Engaging a mobile app development company Multinational companies and other large scale companies, with a big budget, usually go with this option. If you are in good hands, this platform can be very reliable. A good company will carry out the development of your app through experience and skilled coders. This process mostly lasts 2-3 months, depending on the complexity of app development. If you\u2019re a small scale business, hiring an app development company can disturb your yearly budget completely.  Getting started with online app builders This option is last on my list, not because it\u2019s the least important but because it fairly new and has been gaining popularity all over the world. You can do wonders with this option if you have a good website. You can convert your website into an app by simply registering with one of the good app builder online and get started. Most commonly, you will come across app builders that are completely online and the ones that ask you to register and deliver the app within a week of signing up. In either options, you will need no coding skills. I would recommend going with the second options because like I said before, it is always better to let the professionals do their jobs. I personally have reviewed App My Site and put in a good word for this app builder because they are among very few companies who provide native app development that means your app will be faster, more efficient and will be built from scratch.app builder.

            "answer_text": "There are tons of app building programs out there that can help you make your vision a reality. Let\u2019s start at the very beginning of how to create an app\u2026 Step 1: Set a Goal You need to set goals before start building your app. Decide what exactly do you want your app to do? How are you going to make it appeal to users? What problem is it going to solve? How will you market your app? Step 2: Sketch your Ideas. Decide if you are going to give your app away and offer ads to generate money, or are you going to offer it as a paid download. You can also choose the option to offer in-app purchases. If that is something you are going to do, make sure you sketch out those ideas as well. Step 3: Wireframe Here you can your sketch and design idea, and you give your idea a little more clarity and functionality. This will become the foundation for your apps development, so it really is a crucial step. Step 4: Start Defining the Back End of Your App Regardless of what method you choose to use to develop your app, it is imperative that clear diagrams are created as they will serve as the directions for everyone working on your project. Step 5: Get Building Start building your app. Set up your servers, databases, and APIs. If you are using a quality do-it-yourself app builder, this will be done for you. You need to create an account with Google Play and Apple so that you can get your app on the market. It may take a few days to go through the process. Step 6: Design the Look Now create your UI or user interface. The user interface is a very important part of your app because people are attracted to how things look and how easy they are to navigate. Step 7: Test Your App You need to run a number of tests on your app in its completed form to assure that both the look and the feel of the app meet your expectations. You can use the information you get from this testing phase to help you move forward. You can simply add your app to the android store. You will instantly be selling your app in the Google Play store. iOS, on the other hand, will review your app before it can go live. ",

            "answer_text": "There is nothing better than dreaming but making your dreams come true is the best feeling one can ever have. Most of the times it is difficult to make others understand your dream later seeing their faces is the ease.  The Start Up With every startup a scenario comes where you are confident of the idea but not sure how to sail it through. You go out convincing the investors about your product idea seeking some capital investment but you are not prepared enough to strike the right chord. Numbers on the project viability are useless until backed by the user feedback on product. Minimum Viable Product We have been working a lot for startups \u2013 providing them the needed support in form of capital investment, technological support and mentoring them to nurture themselves. This has made us realise the common mistakes committed by most startups. An idea which comes out as the solution to a problem is good but its feasibility can only be attained when it is launched in the market and the best way for this is getting an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) rather the complete solution that we are proposing. Even when you are making an MVP you have to be very precise with things around importantly the cost. Majority of projects shelve just because their approach to MVP is not right. Here are 3 things to keep in check when getting on with MVP: 1. The Right Team While many have that conviction to buy the equity formula to join the team, some are not the risk takers as they need regular income jobs. Most among these are the technical partners of the project and with the right set of technical people on board, your success rate just soars. Technical Team isn\u2019t about a coder and a UI/UX designer but a whole set of Coder, Developer, UI/UX designer, front-ender, back-ender, QA and project manager. It gets difficult to find so much of right human resources at your terms initially, that is why it is preferable to hire the external agency if you don\u2019t have people with right skills set. 2. The Prototype MVP is all about the product with only top features in it. The features that distinguishes it from the other products. First, don\u2019t try to imitate the competitors or implement their top features into your MVP. Your MVP should constitute the best of your product, making it look decent enough as a good UX with every possible attribute that will benefit the end user. So don\u2019t add everything in the MVP leave something for future updates. It is best to avoid : Heavy UI based and tagged social media featuresUnnecessary features lifted from other productsAdding every feature that comes to your mind, have faith in users\u2019 feedback.3. Development Method Before you undertake any journey it is important to choose the path. Developing an MVP is about taking the right path to reach the goal of launch the full-fledged product. While it is always debatable to select Waterfall Method or Agile Method, it certainly depends on the relationship with the developing team. The payment structure and skills are key to the relationship with the developers, be they internal equity holders or some external contractors. One should always keep in mind following tips while preferring one method over the other: Having clarity of being updated with the progress and the outcome of the work.Allowing some resilience to adapt different things for the betterment of project.The momentum of work to maintained with parallel working on different aspects.Don\u2019t forget that MVP is just the first milestone of the long journey which will lead to success. Doing proper planning and implementing the MVP in a strategic manner surely improves your chance to succeed. Always remember, the purpose of MVP is just to test the water, get users feedback, analyse it, work on shortfalls and come back again with a better product. Losing hope is not an option.

            "answer_text": "In 2020, mobile apps are projected to generate $188.9 billion in revenue via app stores and in-app advertising. What\u2019s more, enterprise mobility is estimated to be worth $510.39 billion by 2022. Success within the competitive landscape of these growth projections can become a reality but is dependent on the support of a precisely cultivated mobile app development process. While many companies are trying to take advantage of this trend, many do not know how to create an app successfully. Success within the competitive landscape of these growth projections can become a reality\u2014but only if supported by a precisely cultivated mobile app development process. This development process will make your enterprise mobile app development initiative a success no matter the size or scope. 1. Strategy First, the mobile app development process defines the strategy for evolving your idea into a successful app. You may include a more significant part of this in your overall enterprise mobility strategy. While one app\u2019s objectives may differ from another, there is still an app-specific impact to the mobility strategy to address during the development process. In this phase, you will: Identify the app usersResearch the competitionEstablish the app\u2019s goals and objectivesSelect a mobile platform for your app2. Analysis and Planning At this stage, your app idea starts taking shape and turns into an actual project. Analysis and planning begin with defining use cases and capturing detailed functional requirements. Once you have identified the requirements for your app, prepare a product roadmap. This includes prioritizing the mobile app requirements and grouping them into delivery milestones. If time, resources or costs are a concern, then define your minimum-viable-product (MVP) and prioritize this for the initial launch. Part of the planning phase includes identifying the skills needed for your project. For example, iOS and Android mobile platforms use different development technology stacks. If your goals are to build a mobile app for both iOS and Android mobile platforms then, your mobile development team should include iOS developers and Android developers. Have you selected the name of your app yet? Mobile app names are like domain names and have to be unique within each app store. Research each app store specifically to ensure your app\u2019s name isn\u2019t already in use! 3. UI / UX Design The purpose of an app\u2019s design is to deliver seamless and effortless user experiences with a polished look. The success of a mobile app certainly hinges on how well users are adopting and benefiting from all its features. The goal for mobile app UI / UX design is creating excellent user experiences making your app interactive, intuitive, and user-friendly. While polished UI designs will help with early adoption, your app must have intuitive user experiences to keep app users\u2019 engaged. Information Architecture & Workflows The first step of your mobile app design process is to determine the data your mobile app will display to the users, the data it will collect, user interactions with the finished product, and the user journeys within the app. Enterprise mobility solutions have users with different roles and privileges, so it is essential to incorporate these rules as part of your app\u2019s information architecture. Workflow diagrams help identify every possible interaction a user has with the app and the app\u2019s navigation structure. Wireframes Designers often start mobile app design with sketches on paper. Wireframes are the digital form of sketches. Wireframes are conceptual layouts, also referred to as low-fidelity mockups\u2014they give visual structure to your app\u2019s functional requirements. With wireframes, the focus is chiefly on aesthetics and user experience, not on color schemes and styles. Creating wireframes is a quick and cost-effective approach for designing app layouts and iterating thru them in the design review process. Style Guide Style guides are \u201cliving documents\u201d housing an app\u2019s design standards from branding to the navigation icons. Guidelines for standards include: What font family will your app\u2019s text use?What will the color scheme be?How will your brand be reflected in the app\u2019s design?Style guides contribute to an app\u2019s design strategy. Establishing a style guide early on improves the productivity of your team behind the mobile app development process. At the same time, keeping your app\u2019s look and feel consistent. Mockups Mockups, or high-fidelity designs, are the final renderings of your app\u2019s visual design. Here, wireframes combine with your style guide design standards. As your app\u2019s design begins to finalize, expect further modifications to its information architecture, workflow, and aesthetics. Adobe Photoshop is the most popular tool for creating high-fidelity mockups. Prototype While mockups display your mobile app\u2019s functionality using static designs, these can turn into click-thru prototypes with tools like Invision. Prototypes are highly useful for simulating the user experience and the app\u2019s workflows expected from the finished product. While prototype development can be time-consuming, the efforts are well worth it, as they offer early-stage testing of your app\u2019s design and functionality. Often, prototypes help identify modifications to the app\u2019s proposed functionality. 4. App Development Planning remains an integral part of this phase in the mobile app development process. Before actual development/programming efforts start, you will have to: define the technical architecture,pick a technology stack, anddefine the development milestones.A typical mobile app project is made up of three integral parts: back-end/server technology, API(s) and the mobile app front-end. Back-End/Server Technology This part includes database and server-side objects necessary for supporting functions of your mobile app. If you are using an existing back-end platform, then modifications are needed for supporting the desired mobile functionality. API An Application Programming Interface (API) is a method of communication between the app and a back-end server/database. Mobile App Front-End The front-end is the native mobile app an end-user will use. In most cases, mobile apps consist of interactive user experiences that use an API and a back-end for managing data. In some cases, when an app needs to allow users to work without internet access, the app may utilize local data storage. You can utilize almost any web programming language and databases for the back-end. For native mobile apps, you have to choose a technology stack required by the targeted mobile platform. iOS apps can be developed using Objective-C or Swift programming language. Android apps are primarily built using Java or Kotlin. There is more than one programming language and technology stack for building mobile apps \u2014the key is picking a technology stack that is best suited for your mobile app. Mobile technologies advance much faster with new versions of mobile platforms. Furthermore, new mobile devices are released every few months. With platforms and devices rapidly changing, agility is essential for building mobile apps within timelines and budgets. If time-to-market is a priority, use an agile development approach. This approach supports frequent software releases with completed functionality. Defining development milestones as part of the agile development plan supports developing your mobile application in an iteration. As each development milestone completes, it passes on to the app testing team for validation. 5. Testing Performing thorough quality assurance (QA) testing during the mobile app development process makes applications stable, usable, and secure. To ensure comprehensive QA testing of your app, you first need to prepare test cases that address all aspects of app testing. Similar to how use cases drive the process of mobile app development, test cases drive app testing. Test cases are for recording testing results for software quality evaluation and tracking fixes for retesting. A best practice approach is involving your QA team in the Analysis and Design stages. Their familiarity with your app\u2019s functional requirements and objectives will help produce accurate test cases. Your app should undergo the following testing methods, to deliver a quality mobility solution. User Experience Testing A critical step in mobile app testing is to ensure that the final implementation matches the user experience created by the app design team. Visuals, workflow, and interactivity of your app are what will give your end users first-hand impression of your app. Make sure that your app employs consistent fonts, style treatments, color scheme, padding between data, icon design, and navigation. Ensuring that your app matches the original design guidelines will have a direct impact on its user adoption! Functional Testing The accuracy of your mobile app functionality is critical to its success. It\u2019s difficult to predict every end user\u2019s behavior and usage scenario. The functionality of your app should be tested by as many users to cover as many potential testing conditions as possible. It might surprise you to catch bugs when two different users test the same feature but get varied outcomes. For example, both users can fill out the same form, but they both might enter different data\u2014which could lead to discovering a defect. The purpose of functional testing is to ensure that users can use your app\u2019s features and functionality without any issues. It can be broken down further into system testing (the app working as a whole), and unit testing (individual functions of the app operating correctly). If you are building an app for iOS and Android mobile platforms, then your functional testing should include a feature comparison between both versions of your mobile app. Performance Testing There are many quantitative criteria to use for measuring the performance of your app. How well is your app responding to the user requests?How fast are the app\u2019s screens loading?Is your app draining the phone battery or causing memory leaks?Does your app leverage network bandwidth efficiently?Is the size of your app bigger than what it should be?Even when your app passes basic performance criteria, test the app, API, and backend for load by simulating the maximum number of concurrent users. Your app should be able to handle the load and perform well even when usage spikes. Security Testing Security is of utmost concern for enterprise mobile apps. Any potential vulnerability can lead to a hack. Many companies hire outside agencies to perform thorough security testing on their applications. Your QA and development teams can take a few simple measures to make your app secured. Ensure that any APIs used by your app for interfacing with the backend use \u201cHTTPS\u201d protocol. This is a standard way of securing communication between your app and its backend. Note: you must have an SSL certificate installed on your backend for this to work correctly. If your app requires users to log in, these log in sessions should be tracked on the device and the backend. User sessions should be terminated by the system when a user has remained idle for an extended time (typically ten mins or less on a mobile app). If your app stores user credentials on the device to make it convenient for them to re-login, then you must ensure using a trusted service. For example, iOS provides the Keychain feature that stores a user\u2019s account details for a specific app. Data entry forms within your mobile app should be tested to ensure there is no data leakage. Device and Platform Testing On average, new mobile devices enter the market every 12 months with new hardware, firmware, and design. Mobile operating systems are updated every few months. Multiple mobile device manufacturers like Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola use the Android platform, but they customize the platform for their mobile devices (since Android is open source). The devices come in different sizes and shapes. Compare that to Apple, which has a lot more controlled environment, since they control both hardware and the OS. However, there are multiple iPhone & iPad (Apple iOS) devices out on the market. This is where testing during the mobile app development process differs significantly from web app testing. You can get away by testing your web app just on the Chrome browser in a Windows environment. But your mobile app should be tested on multiple mobile devices or device simulators to ensure smooth working of your app for all users. The complexity of testing a mobile app on all mobile devices, ongoing support costs, and headaches of mobile device management are primary reasons why companies tend to build their enterprise mobile apps for a single mobile platform (and often provide mobile devices to their users). In our experience, most companies tend to develop their enterprise mobile app first with Apple\u2019s iOS mobile platform; only where needed they build an app for the Android platform. Testing is imperative to an app\u2019s future success; it encompasses a substantial section of our overall mobile app development process. Having a comprehensive mobile testing strategy is a must for delivering a quality mobile app. During the testing phase, there are many ways for distributing your app development builds to the testers. The most common approach with iOS apps is using the Testflight and for Android apps via email or Over The Air (OTA) install. 6. Deployment & Support Releasing a native mobile app requires submitting your app to the app stores including the Apple App Store for iOS apps and the Google Play for Android apps. For this reason, you will need a developer account with Apple App Store and Google Play Store before launching your mobile app. An app\u2019s release in the app store requires preparing metadata including: Your app\u2019s titleDescriptionCategoryKeywordsLaunch iconApp store screenshotsOnce submitted in the Apple App Store, iOS apps go through a review process which may take from a few days to several weeks depending on the quality of your app and how closely it follows Apple\u2019s iOS development guidelines. If your app requires users to log in, then you will need to provide Apple with a test user account as part of the release process. There isn\u2019t any review process with Android apps, and they become available in the app store within a few hours of submission. Once your app becomes available in the app stores, monitor its usage through mobile analytics platforms and track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for measuring your app\u2019s success. Frequently check crash reports, or other user reported issues. Encourage users to provide you with feedback and suggestions for your app. Prompt support for end-users and frequently patching the app with improvements will be vital to keeping users engaged. Unlike web apps where patch releases can be available to app users instantly, mobile app updates will have to go through the same submission and review process as the initial submission. Moreover, with native mobile apps, you have to continually stay on top of technology advancements and routinely update your app for new mobile devices and OS platform. Conclusion App development is an ongoing process similar to developing enterprise software applications or developing with emerging technologies. The process will continue after the initial launch as you receive user feedback and build additional functionality. Following this enterprise mobile app development process will ensure a successful launch of your app. ",

            "answer_text": "Nowadays, the App Store and Google Play Market are full of mobile applications. It's quite difficult to come up with something unique that does not exist yet. Usually, to develop a mobile application you need to follow the next steps: 1. Idea. You need clearly understand what would you like to achieve in the end and what kind of problem your application will solve.  2. Competitor analysis. Just use any search engine and be like Sherlock Holmes. Note everything that you like and don't like in apps / services of your competitors.  3. Describe your idea and draw sketches. You don't need to be a painter or designer, just use a pencil and visualize your idea on a paper. Put notes next to each screen. Share your idea with friends or colleagues and ask what they think about it.  4. Development. This step is the longest one. Find a contractor who can design and develop your application. For that purpose, you can use Clutch or contact with The Rebl who are experts in the mobile app development field. Then decide the scope of work, payment model, team size and sign a contract. You don't need to develop the whole application, just begin with MVP (Minimum Viable Product). It'll save your time and money.  5. Testing. Make a proof that your idea works. Share the application with your friend and some interested people. Collect feedbacks take them into account. 6. Release. Publish your application to App Store or/and Google Play Market. 7. Don't ignore the marketing campaign and the further maintenance of the application. Collect feedback and add new features which users ask about in the next releases. And finally, get a profit from your long journey!  P.S.: I recommend to peruse Sprint book. This book will help you to understand whether your idea works and will outline the core value that you are going to provide your users. Also, there is described a way how to turn your idea into a prototype in 5 days.  ",

            "answer_text": "In today\u2019s day and age, it seems as if the old saying is true, there really is an app for everything. However, there is another maxim that is equally true that not everyone is aware of: everyone has an app idea. Whether for their own enjoyment or due to their entrepreneurial spirit, it seems like everyone has app ideas these days. The only problem is that man people still don\u2019t know how to develop an app, even if they have a killer idea. For those who have an idea for an app but don\u2019t know where to start, you\u2019ve come to the right place. As app development professionals, we understand what you need to get started with app development. Not only that, but we can help you build that app from scratch. But enough talking about it, let\u2019s get into it.  Pre-requisites for development Now, before you understand how to develop an app, there are a few pre-requisites for you to make sure you have locked down. For instance, most apps today have a database that they store all the of the app and user\u2019s information. Meaning that understanding a database design language will be a pre-requisite for development. So, before you can even get into your mobile business idea, the first step is to lay out what languages you will need to know and how you are going to build each component of the app. Perform this quick diagnostic now and lay out your plan to avoid coming up against a roadblock later in the development. Brainstorm and choose your idea The next step when comprehending how to develop an app is brainstorming and deciding on your app idea. Now, this will be different for everyone, but if you need help with coming up with a mobile app idea, we have put together a guide for just the think. Read also: 5 Quick Tricks for Brainstorming Mobile App Ideas Once you have settled on the idea you want to develop, this part of the process is over. However, we recommend committing time to do some market research at this point to make sure that there is not only room for your app in the market, but demand as well. Define the core functions of your app Market research also fits in well with the next part of how to develop an app: defining core functions. Once you decide on an app idea, you need to figure out what value you will be offering with your app. Follow that line of thinking to imagine who your target customer are and exactly what they would need to find that value in your app using as few steps as possible. Those are your core functions. Everyone wants to have an all-in-one app or an app with really cool features, but before of all that can happen, core functions need to be put into place. This will be critical to your end mobile app design, so make sure you decide on these early on. Here are some sample functions that most apps will need some variation of: Users can make an account and login with it.Users can change their passwords.Users can retrieve their passwords.Users can message other usersUsers can view their account info.Users can delete their account.Coming up with core functions like these will save you time and money in the long run.  Sketch your app Once you have figured out the core functions of your app, now you need to put those functions and your other ideas on paper to see what sticks. Sketching and wireframing are where you begin to create the visual component of your app and work out what is doable with your app. Don\u2019t be afraid to try new things here. This is a brainstorming exercise more than anything, so lean into any ideas you have on your app. Who knows? It could lead to something exciting. Plan the UI Flow At this point in the process you should have a good understanding of each process users will complete and the different elements of your app. The next step is to plan the flow of the user experience from start to finish. This also includes every variant of the experience. For instance, what happens if they forget their password? Although this part can be meticulous, planning the UI flow here will lead better user interactions andUX design in the long run. It is also worth reiterating that keeping things simple at this point is important. If you get too bogged down in the flow of your app, so will your users. Keep it simple and your users will thank you for it. Design the database Now that you know how your users will interact with your app, we now need to look at where the information they are going to give you will go. In shorter terms, you need to design your database. This will look different depending on the kind of app you make, so conduct some research to see what sort of database you need to make your app work. For instance, if you are building a web-based app, you will need to have a cloud-server database that your app can access. Meanwhile, if you are making an app that will use an API (for using specific data), you will need to gain access to that API or design it yourself. Read more: Guide to REST API Best Practices The database design might not be the flashiest part of how to develop an app, but it is a key to creating a great app. Make sure that you have this down pat before moving on. Create UX wireframes If you didn\u2019t enjoy the sketching part of our process with the backend, we are sorry to report that you will need to do some again when creating the front end design. However, this is the last of the artistic stuff and it means that you are close to completing the app, so get excited! Creating the UX wireframes is a simple process of sketching out the way you want your app to look. You can choose different factors such as colors, button sizes and shapes, etc. The main thing you want to focus on is making sure that your users know exactly what steps to take to do what your app was designed to do, whatever that is.  Seek out solutions Once you have everything laid out, all that is left is to build your app. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t as simple as pressing a button that says \u201cBuild.\u201d This will be where you seek out solutions and actually put in the work to develop your app. Now, if you aren\u2019t a technical person and don\u2019t want to do all of the coding work yourself, don\u2019t worry. There are many different solutions available, such as hiring an independent contractor oroutsourcing app development. All that matters is that you get the solutions that you want, the rest is just deciding what route you take to get there. Build your app Finally, once you have laid out your design and decided how you will build your app, all that is left is to do the damn thing. Depending on the development framework you work within, your app might be ready to show the public in as soon as a couple of weeks. However, before that can happen, there are a few more things we need to mention. You still need to: Submit your app to the App Store or Google Play Store.Test your app repeatedly for bugs and glitches.Set up a website for your app that redirects to a download page.Anything else you believe can make your app successful.From here, the rest is in your hands. All that we can hope is that this guide on how to develop an app will have paid off and your checklist will be completed with ease.

            "answer_text": "Step 1: Get an idea or a problem. If you already have an app idea, move onto step two. If not, read on. Want to build an app but don\u2019t have an app idea? What you really need are problems, and they\u2019re everywhere! Step 2: Identify the need. Validation will prove that a demand exists for your app. You can validate your idea by using the Google Keyword Planner tool to look for the number of people seeking out what you\u2019re trying to do. You could also build a landing page that broadly highlights your app idea and seek user interest through an email signup. Step 3: Lay out the flow and features. Validation of your app idea means that you\u2019ve got something that people want to use. Now is the time to detail your product onto a document, or if you want to go the extra mile, use a wireframing tool. Step 4: Remove non-core features. From the flow and features document you prepared, start looking closely at features that you can remove. Offer only the core value of your app idea. Do not build features in the first version that are \"nice to have\" and can always be added later as an update. This will help keep the initial costs of development down and also help you get to market quicker. Step 5: Buy incentive traffic This is a good way to get high-volume traffic of installs for your new mobile app and rank it on Google Play or App Store. For this reason developers choose companies like CPIMobi or WhiteMobi that provides incentive installs from real users from all around the world. Hope it helps. ",

To read the full story click: How to make an app? - George Batschinski - Medium How to make an app? A mobile app in 13 steps | back4app blog Lesson 01 - Start planning your app and refining your idea Before coding, please make sure you have a clear vision of the problem your app solves. Lesson 02 - Start with an MVP and avoid complex implementations The first version of your app should take no longer than 90 days. Simplify as much as you can, and publish the application.  Lesson 03- Talk to customers as soon as you can Please don\u2019t wait until your app is fully coded to show its customers. Talk to users since day 01 and get feedback. It will help you to refine your product vision.  Lesson 04- Invest time designing your app This one is a very cool step! You will enjoy doing it and learn a lot. Iterate with customers as much as you can! Go to events, talk to other founders, etc. Lesson 05 - Code your backend Most likely, this one will be the most expensive piece of development. Try to automate some steps using backend automation platforms like Back4app (my current company, for full disclosure). Lesson 06 - Proceed and create your frontend Hybrid development usually provides a better balance (cost x performance) in comparison to pure native or web apps. Lesson 07 - LP + Analytics + SEO People need to find you, and an app landing will support you in this process. Optimizing your app for SEO will help as well. Make sure you implement analytics tools like Mixpanel to measure the performance of your app. Lesson 08 - Test + Test + Test Please don\u2019t publish an app with bugs! Test your MVP and make sure it works properly. Lesson 09 - Publish your App Simple step on Google Play Store. I will cost only $25/registration, and the approval process takes only a few hours. Lesson 10 - Lay down on the beach and wait for the money to come in Not really! Your journey is just beginning, and you still need to work your ass off to have a successful app. Do some promoting and get as many user feedback as you can. Incorporate these feedbacks on the new app releases. Continue this process forever. ",

            "answer_text": "Developing your own mobile app is a great thing to do, particularly as mobile usage continues to grow. Just having a mobile web presence isn\u2019t enough. In 2017, 86% of mobile time was spent within apps, rather than the mobile web.  You have several different options if you want to develop your own mobile app. You could use open source options such as Apache Cordova or Phonegap to develop your own mobile app. If you know how to code, you should be able to grasp how to use them quite quickly and develop your own app. But if you don't, you may have a tougher time or need a lot of guidance. You\u2019ll still need to handle the publishing of your app too, which can be a complicated matter too. We created a guide on how to create your own app with no programming knowledge, which should help you get started and figure out the best options to consider before developing your own mobile app! You could hire a freelance developer or an app development agency. These are options that can provide you with a high quality app, but expect to pay for it! For an agency, anything from $15,000 to $50,000 for a high quality app is what you can expect to pay. For freelancers, expect to pay between $30 and $60/hour. Another potential option, if you already have a website, is converting that to a fully native mobile app. You can use an all in one solution like MobiLoud to turn your website into an app that maintains all of your existing functionality. It\u2019s faster than developing your own app with open source options, and more affordable than traditional app development services. You\u2019ll also receive timely and regular updates when needed to maintain your app\u2019s functionality and to make sure your app works with new app store regulations! You can learn more here!

In general, if you want to get a new mobile app developed, you're either going to have to (personally, or as an organization): do the design and development yourself, or have someone else do it on your behalf.  You may or may not need to learn things about mobile application design, mobile web design and development, cross-platform app design and development or native design and development for two platforms (given iOS and Android listed above), as well as many lower-level skills (objective-c, swift, auto-layout, Xcode, android studio, java, css, ruby motion, phone gap, etc).  Alternately, you may or may not need to learn things about finding an individual or firm qualified to do all of that on your behalf. Without knowing anything you or your organization and what you're trying to learn it's hard to make concrete recommendations. If you clarify a bit more about where you're starting from and what direction you need to head in and what you're trying to answer here, that'd make it possible to be more concrete. ",

I would like to share complete process that I shall follow in order to code the mobile app. a) Front end development \u2013 As designs are provided by you, I will slice them and implement them over mobile phone. A static prototype will be developed with dummy content and shared with you for approval with the flow and user-friendliness it carries. You would be able to install it on your device and play around with it. c) Technology stack implementation, DB modeling and server configuration \u2013 Once we have approved static build, , local DB in SQLite will be implemented. Addition to this, server will be configured and master DB with tables similar to local DB will be created and the server and local environment will be synchronized so that real time storage and retrieval of information can occur. d) Web based admin panel development and API configuration \u2013 Admin panel in PHP will be developed that will comprises of all the requisite modules to manage and monitor the mobile application. Admin would be able to manage users, activity log, advertisement logs, referrals, invitations, free apps, payments/rewards, transactions, etc. While to get this information in admin panel from mobile application, APIs will be developed (REST APis) so that real time data can be communicated to master DB and admin console. Below is the admin dashboard panel that I made for client to be able to manage & supervise & control everything (add/edit/remove) www.omninos.com e) Mobile app development \u2013 Once we have the approved static build, environment developed, APIs ready to implement, completed real time app will be created for iOS mobile users, tested, quality assured and deployed on app store for users to download and play around with. Hope the above mentioned detailed solution and project life cycle is self explanatory. So if you are looking to start mobile App development project then, I am ready to start right away and assure you that the app will be technically polished, gorgeous to look at and will provide a great user experience. - I am available to get started immediately. - I will work solely on your project and devote 40+ hrs/week. - I will assist you to submit your app to App Store. - I will provide post development support to your app. - I will share Regular status reports with you.

If you want to cross app, you have to use hybrid development framework such as cordova, react, adobe air .. What is the difference native app between hybrid? Which is the better? If u want good performance, access to new feature quickly, good development support, more tutorial and custom object absolutely you have to develop your app as native. If you want to minimum delay and min code, min cost, no custom animation, simple app, develop 3D or 2D game, you have to develop your app use hybrid technologies. If you known any programming language, you can start Android or iOS app development. You find a lot of mobile tutorial and videos on youtube.

The current year has seen dramatic evolution in the app development regime that is expected to flourish further in the upcoming year.  Here is a list of considerations to keep into the mind. Keeping the code modular Embrace TypeScript Open source platform that makes learning easy As the technology is improving, the developers will be using more innovative tools to meet the demands of the customers. Moreover, the availability of two different frameworks offers a chance to developers to write seamless codes and save a significant share of their time, which could be utilized elsewhere.

Even after that course most people fails to develop and App/Software. Simply it is almost impossible steps for a non technical person to develop a full functional App using Android SDK or iOS SDK. People did not mention in their steps that you must have to learn a programing language like Java (Android) or Swift (iOS). Which is very tough task and can take more that an year. If you really want to go this way then you must need coaching from and institute or you may have continue self study at least for an year. After that I think you may develop basic App. If you want a simple basic App without learning all above engineering things then you can search on google \u201cAndroid App Creator Tools\u201d it will result you many website where you can create simple apps by drag and drop. I think any any non technical person who has basic knowledge of computer can create Apps using these websites. But remember there are limited/pre defined functionalities you can achieve these websites. ",

In most cases, this question comes from someone who isn\u2019t a software engineer by training. But if you are, you can write code yourself instead of hiring developers.  To be transparent, I am biased. I started and work for a no-code app maker called AppSheet. While AppSheet lets you build apps from data in spreadsheets, other no-code app platforms offer different approaches. You might investigate some of these alternatives. Almost counter-intuitively, for a broad class of business apps, it is not just quicker, cheaper, and more efficient to use a no-code app maker. The app created is also almost always more stable, scalable, and performant than an app created with custom code. I know developers who read this might feel offended, but the truth is that there is far greater testing and quality control for a widely-used platform than will likely be invested for a single app created for a custom use case.
