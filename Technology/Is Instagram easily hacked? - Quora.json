            "answer_text": "Anything and everything can be hacked. Until robots with AI take over the future and create all the services with mathematical precision, utmost attention to detail, and lack of error, software will have bugs which manifest as vulnerabilities. As long as there are humans writing code, there are opportunities to hack anything. Companies can do some things to lower their risk of vulnerabilities, such as: Have a secure development life cycle that defines the security activities that go into everything they build.Define secure coding standards and enforce them, to try to squash bugs that continue to plague the industry, like SQL Injection and XSS.Train their entire organization in the importance and practicality of application security.Create an Incident Response team that helps to clean up a problem when it happens, as quickly and cleanly as possible.",
