            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 yes. There are downsides to this. I have a traditional cycling computer which I find to be very accurate and extremely reliable. At the moment, I have it removed from my bike, waiting on standby for the inevitable Bluetooth failure of my 4 year old Wahoo Bluetooth bike computer. This particular bike computer provides me with more information than I probably need while cycling. It is Bluetooth linked to the Wahoo Fitness app on my phone. Here\u2019s the problem. If my phone dies, the bike computer goes blank and ceases to function. If an update to the phone software disagrees with the app, the bike computer won\u2019t link with the app and then there is this whole reinstall/forget device/pair dance that I have to do. PROSUsing your phone for a bike computer has its benefits. The direct link to Strava or whatever fitness app you use is the primary one. Mapping is easier if you like to explore while riding (I do this). CONSIf your phone dies, you loose your tracking and fitness info. Plus, in the case of an emergency, you have no phone. If you crash, you can wreck your phone. I now travel with a battery backup when I ride. One of those little emergency charger things that will boost the power level of your phone. Like this\u2026\u2026  I did a ride last week where my battery level on my phone was only 35%, so I plugged this thing in and went for a ride. Even though I was using the app, which had real time mapping, I was still able to boost my battery level to 70% by the time the ride finished. So now I always carry one of these with me. I also mounted my phone to my handlebars and I couldn\u2019t be happier with the mount. I got this one and it is rock solid.  Amazon.com: XOSS Bike Cellphone Holder, Mobile Support for Mountain Bike Bicycle Handlebar & Stem Cellphone Holder Aluminium Alloy Adjustable Mobile Phone Mount for Highway Vehicles (Black): Cell Phones & Accessories I can\u2019t recommend this thing enough. So yes, you can use your phone, but\u2026\u2026 be careful and have a backup with you. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I rode like that for quite a while. The battery life for tracking rides is actually entirely fine in airplane mode which dramatically extends it, but even then there was a problem: the phone would overheat and shut down in the sun. Possibly a \u201cout front\u201d phone mount where it would have unrestricted airflow rather than the top tube bag I was using would have worked better, but as it was I had overheating issues which made me switch. Linking sensors was not a problem, tons of Bluetooth sensors nowadays, especially from Polar which uses it for their bike computers (which don\u2019t have ANT+ support). Using the phone to track rides has an advantage of carrying less stuff overall: it\u2019s a phone, a map, a camera and a bike computer all in one. In favour of a bike computer, it tends to measure altitude using a barometer which is more accurate than what Strava on the phone does, and the bike does look cleaner with a small computer in a \u201cout front\u201d mount than with a typical smartphone mount - few smartphone mounts actually look good.

            "answer_text": "I did for several years. I used MapMyRide app which will pair your phone to sensors for speed, cadence and heart rate if you wish, or just use GPS. Mike Winslade is right about the discrepancies between real miles vs GPS. If the ride was on the incredibly flat area west of Houston, TX probably little or no difference. But rolling hills will increase the error. Battery life is a problem. I got a battery that could be mounted on the top tube that would keep the phone at 100%. It wasn\u2019t needed on my rides from home, but on group rides over 2 hours the phone battery would get dangerously low. As Mike Winslade wrote some people are extreme about the tech they have on their bicycles, that\u2019s me. Others like a friend of mine are minimalist. He has no kind of electronics on his bikes. Well his primary discipline is marathon running. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, absolutely. It won\u2019t be as convenient or as good as using a dedicated bike computer, but it can work. Things you should be aware of before deciding to do this, though: A handlebar mount for phone probably won\u2019t fail and cause your phone to fall off at high speed, but it can. And if you crash with your phone mounted to the handlebars, you might not be able to call for help if your phone is damaged.The battery on your phone usually will have enough power to keep the GPS running through a ride - with the screen on so you can see the map, but sometimes it won\u2019t \u2014 especially if you start off on a long ride without a full charge.Google Maps is pretty good for navigation most of the time, but it will sometimes take you on some pretty strange routes, including dirt roads that you may not really want to ride on. And it can\u2019t use the pre-mapped routes that you can download into GPS bike computers, and which are what you\u2019d want to follow if you\u2019re going on organized rides.With that in mind, programs like Strava and RideWithGPS can track your rides. They won\u2019t get data from standard ANT+ heart rate monitors, speed or cadence sensors, but they\u2019ll track your miles and speed quite well without it - and there are some Bluetooth sensors available. With a paid membership RideWithGPS can follow pre-saved routes that you download into the phone, and it can give you turn-by-turn directions by voice over Bluetooth \u2014 but please use a bone-conduction headset, not in-ear or over-ear. I actually have a helmet with Bluetooth bone-conduction built in. I use it in combination with RideWithGPS on my phone for navigation and a Garmin GPS watch that connects to a heart rate monitor and speed and cadence sensors and synchs the data to Strava. I keep my phone in a pocket and in a good case, so it\u2019s much better protected than it would be in a handlebar mount. I don\u2019t have a bike computer - but frankly, it would save me a lot of effort if I did. ",

            "answer_text": "Can the average cyclist just use their phone instead of using a bike computer? Yep. And plenty do. In my experience, the data collected by the phone is not as accurate as a dedicated bike computer and often (depending on your setup) not as comprehensive. I ride with guys who have the very latest Garmin everything and with guys who have the most basic Cateye cycle meter (speed, time, odometer) and with at least one guy who uses a Wahoo RFLKT (which looks like a bike computer but is more or less a screen to show what your phone is measuring). In my limited experience, the guys using their phones show they have ridden further (and therefore faster) for the same ride. When you look at their GPS track, it zigs and zags more than my track does, which explains the extra distance. It makes very little REAL difference, but it hurts my ego a little to be \u201cbeaten\u201d by someone who was riding alongside me all the way. ",

Cellular screens are far less visible in direct sunlight than the transflective LCDs used on bike computers. I can\u2019t read mine.Cellular phones are often limited to four hours of screen time which is inadequate for many rides over 100km when new and shrinks with age. Mine has run out in just a couple of hours with GPS navigation apps running.You won\u2019t be able to make emergency calls on your cellular if you exhaust its battery using it as a bike computer.Cellular phones use capacitive touch screens triggered by water and ignore finger presses with some gloves. Resistive screens on bike computers don\u2019t have those problems. This is an issue when it starts raining and you want to navigate home in a hurry.Few cellular phones interface with the ANT+ sensors commonly used by cyclists, and software support is missing on some with the hardware. $400-$1000+ for a new power meter is much more expensive than a new bike computer.None of the apps I\u2019ve seen accommodate my display customization. On my bike computer I have a page for training which adds lap time, distance and power. For navigation I have a screen which adds next turn and distance remaining to it. My map screen has just the two relevant fields for pacing - power and heart rate.",
