            "answer_text": "I'm taking it that you mean change it for the better! It's pretty easy to change it for the worse. I think a large portion of it is accurately negotiating with yourself. What are the biggest antagonistic forces in your life? Poor health? Toxic people? Overburdened with work? Under-burdened with work? Boredom? Ambition? Low expectations? Feel like you're just reacting to life and having trouble keeping your head above water while drowning in the mundane? If you can answer that question, you can then get honest with yourself about why these things are still antagonizing you. Are you refusing to admit that they bother you? Have you tried to deal with them and failed? Have you convinced yourself that it is just your lot in life and just something that everyone deals with? Do you have two values which are in conflict with one another? Do you lack a coherent system for planning that you can really trust? Now you can ask why it is that other people don't have that problem. The first, easiest answer would be that due to luck or natural temperament it's not an issue for them. Ok, but what about the people whom it was an issue to them, but no longer have the problem? What did they do? Do some research. Of the people who seem to have solved the problem, what did they do? Chances are, there are a few conflicting camps advocating different strategies. So hear them out. Take a side and then try to prove it right and then try to prove it wrong. Find a podcast on the issue and listen to episodes as you walk between classes, grocery shop, or wait in lines. You'll get up to speed quickly on the major points of contention and you'll probably be drawn a certain direction. Now formulate a plan. It might be a controlled experiment where you literally make one change for a week and measure the results against a control week. It might be that you read the top two books on that subject and implement the most compelling change. It might be that you just go with your gut. Trust yourself and try it. Most people don't have unique problems. You don't necessarily have to invent the answers to your problems. I think that for most people, the biggest challenge is in admitting that it doesn't have to be the way it has always been, and eliminating the excuses that crop up to stifle the will to change and solve the problem. For example, \"I have diabetes and I'm 70 pounds overweight. Well, I've always been big my whole life. My family is big. I've tried eating healthy and exercising and it didn't work and I was hungry all the time. I eat pretty healthy now. I have a medical condition that compounds it. I have a slow metabolism. I've gotten old. Etc.\"  These excuses are all half truths. So address these excuses head on with the full truth in order to disprove them as excuses. Plenty of overweight people, who have been overweight their whole lives and their whole families are overweight have gotten fit. People have reversed their diabetes. I've tried one theory of healthy eating and my own home-rolled exercise program that didn't work for me, but something else could and I don't even know enough about the alternatives to make a judgement. Other people with slow metabolisms, age, and compounding health problems have solved this problem.  Once the excuses are emasculated, you can actually be honest with yourself and come up with helpful problems. \"I don't know where to look. I don't know who to trust. I have financial constraints.\" These are all solvable issues that only require you putting forward persistent effort and thinking. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was 28 years old I was so depressed I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. It wasn\u2019t like I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. It was I couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t get out of bed. I was married. Had a job. Had a place to live. Had friends. Had family. Had a life. Yet I was lifeless. The depression took my job away. I stopped talking or responding to my husband. I didn\u2019t take calls from friends of family. I laid in bed staring at a brick wall. It wasn\u2019t like I was staring a brick wall. I was staring at a red brick wall through my bedroom window. All I thought about was ending my life. A listless, un-animated body in a queen size bed. This lasted several weeks. It was the culmination of a depression that had been building, developing, and taking hold of me over several years. One day walking to the bathroom I passed the bookshelf in the hallway. I caught a glimpse of a book I had purchased years before while I was in college. It was the biography of Diane Arbus, a woman photographer who had taken her life at 48 years old. I hadn\u2019t read it, yet I had kept it all those years, through many moves between the east and west coast. In an inexplicable moment of reprieve and what one could only call hope, though I didn\u2019t know it at the time, I picked it up, went back to bed, and at some point that day began reading it. (It seems it\u2019s always a miracle when we choose to truly live.) I completed the book in three days and slept with it under my pillow for three months. The book had saved me. It wasn\u2019t a self-help book, sacred book, tell me what to do or be book. No one told me what to do, that\u2019s what worked for me. No one was telling me who to be, that\u2019s what worked for me. The book was human. I began relating human being to human being. I think it was Louise Hay who said, \u2018Depression is having nowhere to place our Love.\u2019 In reading that book, my heart was opened. There\u2019s a part of me in you, and part of you in me, and there comes a point in time when these parts speak to each other in order to receive our love. In hearing your question, I also hear the answer. I AM CHANGING MY LIFE. That\u2019s what that depression can do. It changed my life. It gave me the opportunity to discover the Love that was deep inside me. It wasn\u2019t the question of \u2018HOW?\u2019 It was the question of \u2018WHY? Because I matter. Because that photographer mattered. Because you matter. Because at some level we all matter to someone, at the very least let this mattering be to ourselves, first. There will always be people who tell you differently. There will always be someone who comes along and says, \u2018You know, you really don\u2019t matter.\u2019 They break your heart. Let your heart stay open as the wise poet said. Because people are usually wrong about things. I\u2019ve been wrong about things. You\u2019ve been wrong about things. Like me, you\u2019ve probably been all wrong about yourself. I was wrong when I bought into other people\u2019s opinions of me. When I bought into other people\u2019s world-views for me. When I bought into people\u2019s behaviors towards me, and thought that was who I am. I have been so wrong about so many things. Maybe I\u2019m even wrong to write this answer. Maybe this is the wrong answer to your question. I\u2019m okay with being wrong about things. I\u2019ve learned human stories heal. I left my husband. I raised my daughter. I received an advanced degree. I use it to help others. Not by telling them what to do or who to be. But by letting them hear themselves, be themselves, love themselves wholly and completely, regardless. People often exclaim, \u2018How does this work? Why do I feel better now? This is crazy!\u2019 The answer is simple: you have found a place to put your Love. You have liberated your Love. You have been using it to serve yourself, and paradoxically, miraculously, mysteriously, and profoundly, this very ability has not only changed your life but also the world around you. May you love and be loved well and courageous in your Loving. ",
