            "answer_text": "The short answer is no. At the very least you will need an Internet router (like a cable modem or a DSL switch) and both of these are special-purpose computers. So, even at the basic level, you need a computer. But having a router sitting there without anything else in your house connected to it is pretty flashing lights that won\u2019t hold your interest for very long (well, I don\u2019t know you, so I am making an assumption ;-) To do anything useful on the Internet you will need other computers like a smart TV (which is actually several computers), a Cable TV box to watch TV over the Internet (which is also a computer, you see the thread here), an Amazon Fire TV box, a Google Chromecast, an XBox, an Amazon Alexa, a Google Home, a Playstation, a laptop, an Android tablet, or a thousand other devices. All of these are computers, of varying complexity, that let you use different parts of the Internet. Why is this? The Internet isn\u2019t one thing. The Internet is computers, connected by copper, fiber, satellites, microwaves, and other technologies. \u201cBringing the Internet into your house\u201d is the process of getting access to those other computers. Some of those computers hide their \u201ccomputerness\u201d quite well, like the Amazon Alexa and Google Home to which you can talk in (somewhat) natural English and will answer you in (somewhat) natural English. Stuff that you might think of as being \u201con the Internet\u201d such as Quora, Netflix, Google Music, Spotify, Websites, e-mail, etc. are just different applications running on computers owned by various companies or individuals. They sell you (in one way or another) the ability to use their services (talk to their computers), but you need a computer of some kind to consume them. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends what you mean by \u201ccomputer\u201d. You can certainly have internet at home for your smart TV, security cameras, and phones as all of those technically contain a \u201ccomputer\u201d, even if they don\u2019t have a keyboard or general user interface. However, you may find it hard to configure your internet router without at least borrowing a laptop. ",
