            "answer_text": "This plan has been in development for 4 years. Gee it must be incredible, I dont know about you but I have been waiting for a long time and I was so excited to hear about it. So let\u2019s take a look at how this plan is going to revolutionize health care coverage in America! Let\u2019s start with what Sec of Human Services Azar said, \u2018It is what it is\u2019. What is it after 4 years of talking and saying what a great healthcare plan it is. $200 drug discount cards to Medicare recipients - well that solves nothing. No roll back on costs with big pharma, no change in the ridiculous prohibition on Medicare where they cannot negotiate prices with the pharma companies meaning outrageous prices that are sometimes 20X the rest of the world for the same drugs made in the USA! No money to pay for it as there are no appropriations, remember Congress appropriates money not the President, he cannot just conjure up anything. And who in the heck thinks that anything will be solved by $200 prescription cards which will disappear in a nano second. SO ZERO ON THAT PART.2nd is Out of network costs should not be allowed. And it is the policy of the USA to not have preexisting conditions. No legislation, non binding, no nothing, completely meaningless. ZERO AGAIN, PERFECT SCORE SO FAR.The ACA is up for a Supreme Court vote and it all hinges on ending the individual mandate which Trump and the Justice Dept both have said, (Trump in the same speech he touted his plan said he is getting rid of the individual mandate), which means THE ACA WILL BE DEAD WHICH MEANS 30 MILLION WILL LOSE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE, WHICH MEANS OVER HALF OF THOSE FOLKS HAVE PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. Wow that is less than zero, he not only took away those who are paying in like young folks but he killed the ACA so he did exactly the opposite of what he said he would do on point 2; HE TOOK AWAY HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. Brilliant move Herr Trump.That my friends is that, literally nothing more. I read and reread it several times trying to find something I might have missed. This guy is worse than the salesman selling snake oil, it is like saying you have snake oil and the bottle is not only empty but full of spiders ready to kill you if you open it. The crowd by the way cheered him on. Mostly as always they looked bored, Trump talked in circles and Fox said afterwards he was brilliant. It was followed by commercials and memes saying he should have yet another Nobel Peace prize. He took bows endlessly while those outside with preexisting conditions realized that he is the cancer that is far worse than anything that they have. VOTE FOLKS NOW, IF YOU DON\u2019T AND YOU DIE BECAUSE HE TOOK AWAY YOUR HEALTHCARE AND GAVE YOU POISON SPIDERS TO EAT INSTEAD IN THAT SNAKE OIL BOTTLE, IT IS YOUR OWN FAULT. Vote like your life depends on it, because in many cases, millions in fact, it does. ",
