            "answer_text": "Tesla gets a lot of range out of their designs, and lots of other important traits, that combined make them far more appealing and far more profitable than any other electric vehicle on the market. Great aerodynamics. The Coefficient of drag (Cd) of the Model 3 is about 0.21 which is the best Cd of any production vehicle, or was at the time of launch. That makes it slip through the air more easily, with minimal drag. The Model 3 also has a pretty modest frontal cross section, which reduces the amount of air that has to be pushed out of the way.Reasonable weight reduction. The Model S and X used a lot of expensive light-weight aluminum to have big battery packs and still be a reasonable weight. The Model 3 was able to reduce the weight of the battery packs and use affordable ultra-high-strength steel in very clever shapes to keep weight down.Best in class battery cells and packs. Tesla realized early on that a great EV battery needed to have high energy/kg, high power/liter, lose very little energy charging and discharging, low risk of fire, charge quickly, work at a wide range of temperatures, retain most of its charge capacity after 8 years/100,000 miles, and be affordable. They solved this problem with many many innovations and refinements. They use thousands of little battery cells and shift the load between the cells to minimize strain and maximize life span. They have great active cooling to preserve the chemistry. They charge smarter, with great software to manage the battery functions automatically. The actual chemistry is important, but only a small part of the total solution. They improve the chemistry and cost-efficiency by about 10%/year on average.All that said, other manufacturers can still deliver ~300 miles range if they really wanted to\u2026but few of them are even trying. Most of them are content to make a ~200 miles range compliance car that they lose money on and call it a day. They\u2019re content to make their profits on lightly-regulated, over-priced pickup trucks. When Tesla disrupts the pickup truck market in ~2021/2022, that strategy is going to look a lot more misguided. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Many small reasons put together. Tesla in general puts larger batteries into its vehicles. Top Model S and X have 100 kwh batteries, competitors like the Porsche Taycan 93 kwh or Audi eTron 95 kwh.Tesla generally allows more of the battery to be accessed by the user. For instance a Model 3 with 75 kwh battery can use up to 73 kwh. Bj\u00f8rn Nyland Tests Tesla Model 3 Performance Battery Capacity While an Audi eTron appears to only allow 83 of its 95 kwh capacity. Does Audi e-Tron Really Only Use 83 Out Of Its 95-kWh Battery Pack?Higher battery energy density - this either means more batteries for less weight or the more energy for the same weight as competitors. Tesla Model 3 2170 Energy Density Compared To Bolt, Model S P100D Less weight means more efficiency.More efficient motors, better aerodynamics - Even with equal amount of power, how its used can translate into more miles per kwh. Tesla Model 3 gets about 131 eMPG. A Porsche Taycan gets 68 eMPG. So with the same amount of energy available, the Tesla will go about twice as far. A Model 3 has a Drag Coefficient (Cd) of 0.21. A Jaguar iPace 0.29, Audi eTron 0.28, lower is better.Additional usage efficiencies - keeping the batteries at optimal temperature for use. Hot batteries are inefficient and cold batteries can\u2019t discharge fully. Tesla uses a unique \u201csuperbottle\u201d all in one heating and cooling solution. Some companies like Nissan use air-cooling which is less efficient meaning the battery can more easily be out of optimal operating temperature. The Tesla Model 3 'Superbottle' Easter Egg Is a Fascinating Packaging Solution This also reuses waste heat from one system to heat another (heat from motors used to warm the batteries) saving on energy use for heating without having to use extra heaters.High degree of computer control. Tesla\u2019s battery control system is unmatched, meaning it can keep the battery in optimal condition for use much more closely than other brands, meaning less energy is wasted.Overall weight is usually less. Less weight, less energy needed to move it. Model 3 Performance 75 kwh battery- 4,100 lbs. Audi eTron - 5,754 lbs. Nissan Leaf - 3883 lbs (62 kwh battery), Porsche Taycan - 5,132 lbs.The secret is Alien Dreadnought. The machine that makes the machine. By having a high level of vertical integration Tesla can design parts and systems that work and mesh finely together. The Superbottle is the ultimate example of that with 3 separate heating and cooling systems combined into single integrated unit. Also by designing the car as an integrated whole from a clean sheet of paper, rather than various pre-built modules that have to connect to each other at discrete points, efficiencies in weight and energy use can be created. By ensuring things like its battery supply it can bring down manufacturing costs and offer bigger, more dense batteries for less cost than its competitors, rather than having to purchase batteries from a battery company that also has to make a profit.
