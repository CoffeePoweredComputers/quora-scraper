An alternative approach would use a BETWEEN clause to select a specific months worth of data using a freestanding column name. This query can be accelerated by an index: select * from t where datecolumn between \"2016-01-01\" and \"2016-02-01\"\u00a0This can be improved upon using INTERVAL syntax: root@localhost [(none)]> select \"2016-01-01\" as mon1, \"2016-01-01\" + interval 1 month as mon2;\u00a0+------------+------------+\u00a0| mon1       | mon2       |\u00a0+------------+------------+\u00a0| 2016-01-01 | 2016-02-01 |\u00a0+------------+------------+\u00a01 row in set (0.00 sec)\u00a0root@localhost [(none)]> select * from d.t where datecolumn between \"2016-01-01\" and \"2016-01-01\" + interval 1 month;\u00a0...\u00a0You can also use EXTRACT to group by month, again without index acceleration: select * from t where somecondition group by extract(month from datecolumn)\u00a0",

Make sure to index the date or datetime field of course. Just select all records within a month by using something like: WHERE dateime_field LIKE \u20182017\u201312%\u2019 This is less of a hassle than having to determine date intervals or using date extraction functions.

            "answer_text": "Okay, I realize that this question was from 4 1/2 years ago, but to me, the question implies grouping by month rather than constraining by month. Since the question doesn\u2019t really include an example, I\u2019ll answer it as if my assumption is correct. Let\u2019s say you have a table named \u201creceipt\u201d that has columns for id, timestamp, and whatever else might relate to a purchase, and a related table named \u201creceipt_item\u201d with columns for id, receipt_id, price, and whatever else like item number, description, etc. If I wanted to see the total purchase amount by month for this year, I would use a query like this: select monthname(r.timestamp) as `month`, sum(i.price) as total_amount\u00a0from receipt r\u00a0join receipt_item i on i.receipt_id = r.id\u00a0where year(r.timestamp) = year(now()) -- this year\u00a0group by monthname(r.timestamp);\u00a0",
