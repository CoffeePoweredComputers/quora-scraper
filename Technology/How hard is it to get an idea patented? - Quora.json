            "answer_text": "This is a shortened version of my longer post here on how hard it is get a patent. How hard is it to get a utility patent? An \u201cidea\u201d can refer to a lot of different concepts, but the implication here is that an idea is functional in nature (I\u2019ll address design patents further below). So if we\u2019re talking about utility patents, then it will be difficult for approximately 90% of utility patent applications. This statistic was based on a Yale study where only 11% of utility patent applications received an allowance without any rejections (first action allowance). Basically, 9 out of every 10 utility patent applications will receive at least one rejection known as an Office Action. Most patent Office Actions will contain claim rejections based on the prior art, meaning that the USPTO patent examiner thinks your claims are unique enough in view of prior patents and publications. Responding to patent Office Actions may require a combination of claim amendments and arguments explaining why the prior art references cited by the examiner do not show what you have claimed. As others have mentioned, this can be a long back-and-forth process of give-and-take where applicants must decide on whether they are willing to add further claim limitations (which will narrow the claim scope) and, if so, what type of limitations would be acceptable without giving away too much, especially in the independent claims. If expectations are reasonable and based on the reality of a long uphill battle, utility patent applicants should not feel disappointed when they receive rejections. Instead, applicants should study the cited prior art references closely with their patent attorney and form a strategy for response. If it makes sense, get your patent attorney to talk to the examiner prior to filing the written response by conducting an Examiner Interview. How hard is it to get a design patent? Design patents cover ornamental features of a particular design (i.e., how it looks - as opposed to how it works). Unlike utility patents, design patent applications enjoy a high allowance rate of over 84% (fiscal year 2020). Since the \u201cclaim\u201d in a design application essentially consists of the drawings, design patents are generally visual in nature. So for a design patent application to get rejected, which is rare, the patent examiner would need to find a prior design that looks quite similar to your design. ",

            "answer_text": "You cannot patent an idea, it must be an invention. To apply for a patent there are two ways; the first, a PPA (Provisional Patent Application) which does NOT mature into a patent, but gives you the all-important priority date for ONE year - during that year, you are expected to \u201cperfect\u201d the invention, such as \u201ctweaking\u201d it, trying the market, etc. The second is a \u201cstandard\u201d application which must teach an independent user to \u201cpractice\u201d your invention with a minimum of experimentation. You may apply yourself (and that may be a good plan for a PPA) or retain an agent or an attorney - an agent will do a good job on the \u201cmechanical\u201d aspects, you will need an attorney if any issues of law are encountered, such as case law on the patentability of some things such as software programs.
