            "answer_text": "Well\u2026. it depends on the angle. If what you care about is the stock price, Apple is much better. The stock value is at its highest, and that happened under Tim Cook\u2019s supervision. Innovationwise, it\u2019s about the same. They come with some great new stuff, and some stuff that sucks. Focuswise it\u2019s worse. They are forgetting developers. They are forsaking pro users. They are doing some things the whole wrong way. No new Mac Pro in the las 5 years? A new MacBook Pro which has nothing of Pro? An overhyped iPad Pro which does the same as a normal iPad\u0010? (yes, sure, the pen and the speed\u2026. well, not enough, sorry!) The way I see it, the problems are connected. Steve Jobs focus was products first and Wall Street later. The current management appears to be focused on Wall Street first and products later. That\u2019s why they focus on nifty gadgets without much additional value. Apple Watch, for example. Yes, it\u2019s cool. Yes, it\u2019s nice. No, it\u2019s not a game changer. The iPhone was a game changer. The Mac was a game changer. The Apple II was a game changer. Even the iPad was a game changer. Steve Jobs was not perfect. But he listened to the market. He was against expansion ports, but he knew the market wanted them. He was aware that for a machine to be Pro, it had to be expandible. Sure, Pro machines don\u2019t make as much money as new, cheaper gadgets. But they are necessary, since it is with those Pro machines we build the software for the nifty gadgets! Wall Street doesn\u2019t understand that. All they see is money. If the nifty gadget makes money, focus on that. Steve Jobs understood the tecnhological ecosystem. I think the current management does too. But Wall Street doesn\u2019t. And the current management is paying too much attention to Wall Street demands, while Steve Jobs paid more attention to keep a healthy ecosystem. ",

            "answer_text": "No, far from it. Remember, Steve Jobs died when they introduced iPhone 5. iPhone 6, 6 plus, 6S and 6S plus, SE are all awesome products, by no means just a little advance. Apple watch is awesome. Great battery life and the activity alone is more than worth the buy. Then you have the notifications, all great. The Macbook is underpowered, by design, and it is a spectacular machine by every single measure. The new Apple TV is so much fun, games, apps, videos, netflix, sure they could improve the password input, by hey, it is so great. All Apple software is improving by large margins, Xcode is just getting better, iWork package is great and getting better. All the iCloud stuff is improving leaps and bounds. Apple has become the worlds top 5 company, worth more than most oil companies. They make more money than drug lords or even whole countries. They have so much money they could buy Hollywood movie companies, almost all of them, in cash. Steve was surely the captain who lay out the course for the company for decades to come. Tim is the man who gets the ship there, on time and under budget. No, just because you have not seen a new Macbook Pro or Mac Pro updates, doesn\u2019t mean Apple is stopping, not by a long shot. Intel has not been able to deliver Skylake processors and is having great problems overall. Quite a lot of laptop makers are having serious issues with their machines. The current Macbook pro is still awesome machine and is still the best laptop you can buy. People forget how Steve Jobs introduced \u201cnew\u201d machines, all based on 500 MHz PowerPC cpu, year after year, no improvements what so ever, Dalmatian iMac and so forth when they had great issues with getting PowerPC cpus in any numbers and they were stalled. With Apple TV, Apple Watch and the whole Apple eco system, things have never been better. We are just spoiled by years gone by. ",
