            "answer_text": "Well most of the websites I utilize on a daily basis are already bookmarked, but yes I still use Google constantly when researching a topic. According to Net Market Share (as of April 2017) the global marketing share percentage, in terms of the use of Search Engines heavily favours Google, with over 77%. This again reinforces that fact that Google are the market leaders, however it also highlights that the \"Others\" such as Yahoo, Bing and Baidu etc still hold a large audience and it would be silly to simply ignore them. It's interesting to note that Google's large market share is still on the increase. Last year we saw a 67% market share for Google, so Google has taken another 10% of the market from its rivals in just the past 12 months.

I only use Google on my Nintendo DSI because that is one of the only search engines that actually works on there. I use swisscows the most though. If you want more privacy, I would recommend Swisscows die alternative, datensichere Suchmaschine. and Qwant - The search engine that respects your privacy . Swisscows blocks violent and adult content, because their focus is not only privacy, but also family friendly content. The only thing about qwant is that they have a \u201cbot checker\u201d when you search a lot of things at once; it is harder to click on the circles or squares on my flip phone. ",
