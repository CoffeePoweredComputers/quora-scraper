ImageNet is an academic image dataset used for benchmarking image recognition algorithms. There are over 14 million images in this set that have been manually annotated. And the Inception model is up there with the best in the world in terms of speed, accuracy and memory usage as this comprehensive CVPR 2017 paper shows. ",
