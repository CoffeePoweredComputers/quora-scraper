            "answer_text": " There are two issues here: Transferring Courses The time to figure out how to transfer courses was BEFORE YOU ENROLLED in CC. It drives me nuts here on Quora when students ask, \u201cI just spent three years and $20,000 at Podunk Community College. I want to transfer to Big Bucks U. What should I do now?\u201d At this point it may very well be too late to do anything. There are things called \u201carticulation agreements.\u201d You needed to figure out how they worked before you enrolled at CC. Hope for the best, and go talk to your faculty advisor. College is a Competition Colleges get paid whether or not you learn anything, graduate, get a good job, or go broke in the process. Half the young people who graduate with bachelor\u2019s degree today end up under employed or unemployed\u2014not to mention that 70% of them are in debt. Nobody has explained to you that today college is a COMPETITION for a few good jobs. Only one in four students who matriculate at a four-year school graduate and get a good job. With a GPA of 2.6 you are competing for that job against a lot of young people who are academically stronger than you. This is a HUGE red flag. Have you identified a marketable major? If not, that is a second red flag. Are you going to be borrowing money? If yes,\u2014another red flag. I understand that this is not \u201ccool,\u201d but my advice would be that you stop worrying so much about being accepted at a good college and start thinking about how you are going to transition from a dependent adolescent to an independent adult. Dr. Kevin Fleming, \u201c(RE)Defining the Goal: The True Path to Career Readiness in the 21st Century,\u201d explains where the jobs are: \u201cThe true ratio of jobs in our economy is 1:2:7. For every occupation that requires a master\u2019s degree or more, two professional jobs require a university degree, and there are over a half a dozen jobs requiring a 1-year certificate or a 2-year degree, and each of these technicians is in very high-skilled areas in high demand.\u201d My suggestion is that you find a marketable, technical certification at your current community college, earn THAT, and get a job.

            "answer_text": "Most community colleges have articulation agreements with one or more nearby state schools. In some states, public universities are required to accept any student who graduates from a state community college, though individual majors can be more selective. Your community college should have either assigned you to a faculty advisor or have an advising/ transfer department. Check with them to see what your options are. By now you should know what your major will be; they can help you find schools with that major available. Start the transfer process now, or you might find yourself waiting a semester for a spot to open up. ",
