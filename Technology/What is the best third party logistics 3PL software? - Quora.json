            "answer_text": "There are various third party logistics 3PL softwares available in the market. But the one that stands out is shipsy. Shipsy has come up with innovative solutions to mangage the delivery of consignment to the end user in time. It has a unique feature of live tracking of goods per trip. Based on ai technologies it can easily find optimised rotes thus reducing the cost by 10%.It also precalculates the amount of cargo that a vehicle can handle to prevent any wear and tear of vehicles or any kind of obstruction during the journey. The excellent feature of live tracking of goods and non delivery reasons gains the trust of the user ,further increasing the user base. The most difficult phase i.e. the last mile delivery is efficiently handled by shipsy. RTOS(return to origin)of products mostly happen during this phase. It provides the end user with the facility of rescheduling their deliveries ,leading to lesser RTOs and maximising the first time delivery. That's it! Thank you for reading this answer:) ",
