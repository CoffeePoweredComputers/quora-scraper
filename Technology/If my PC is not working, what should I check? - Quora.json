            "answer_text": "When PC is not working, proceed step by step: 1.Check power, power cable or UPS, if using one. 2. PC on-off switch.when switching on check the LED indicator (Red led). 3. Check monitor, display cable (VGA cable) connected to PC. 4. If powering on, still you don't see anything on screen, it may be some hardware issue. Have to check inside your PC, i.e. RAM in most of the cases. 5. Otherwise it may be of motherboard issue. In this case, you have to take it to the nearest service center. 6. If you see some display on screen but not able to see Windows. Then probably, Windows OS is corrupt. 7. You can run recovery or clean install, but be sure of your data, it can be lost during process. If you are not sure,what to do, take PC to nearest support center.Though he may charge for this work to be done. Happy troubleshooting\u2026 ",
