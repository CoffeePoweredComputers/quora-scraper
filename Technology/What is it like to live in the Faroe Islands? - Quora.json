            "answer_text": "I was born and raised here, and there are many pros to living here. We may not have all the famous fast-food chains and clothing stores, but we have peace. We don\u2019t have any brutal wars including bombs, people rarely get murdered and brutally hurt (there are a few cases though). We have the right to talk and do as we please. Every time someone gets their salary (after having earned a certain amount of money in total) approximately 40% of your money gets taken away. This may sound like a bad thing, but trust me, when I say it\u2019s good, because a part of that money, you get back after you\u2019ve retired. This is only to ensure that when you actually have retired, you will still get money to pay all your taxes, food etc. Also it is pretty much not allowed to be poor here. If you are in a situation where you really aren\u2019t able to get a job whatsoever, the government will help you get just enough money to provide food and a place to stay in. Never in my life have I ever seen anyone live on the streets here, and that is because there are none. In worst-case scenario, you will find a shelter to sleep in. You never have to worry about dying from hunger. Another thing is the nature. No matter where you are, you will always see at least one mountain. It does rain ALOT, but on the sunny days, it will possibly be one of the most beautiful views, you have ever seen. Another good thing is that we get cold tap water for free, because we get it from the mountains instead of digging down after it. The hot tap water does cost though. We don\u2019t have poisonous animals. Bees and wasps have recently entered, but that\u2019s about all, then there are only house flies and daddy-long-legs. We do have to pay for food like fish, sheep, pig, cow etc. but that\u2019s not the case with pilot whales. I know there are many controversial cases about is killing pilot whales, but I recommend you just ignore all those pictures and facts you see. They get killed in one cut (we won\u2019t let them suffer, like you\u2019ve probably heard). Once they\u2019ve been cut up, the parts are divided and given out, to the people who participated, for free, and then they often give some to their relatives. My point is that we are quick to share what he have. I don\u2019t really know what else there is to say. I hope this is a good answer :) ",

            "answer_text": "During my eight years on the Faroes, it is a mixed bag. I have experienced both love and hate. I have also been treated as a token. The greatest irritation has been the silence people take when they witness a horrible act by a few people. Racism doesn\u2019t fit the Faroese people, but the few that are racist and hateful end up representing the Faroese people. The greatest people on the Faroe Islands are fishermen. They are the salt of the Earth, and it is they who should represent the Faroese people. The tax system is exhausting. You are told 10% of your income taken by the state isn\u2019t a tax. You are not given information in whole. You must hire a good accountant to get anything back. Finding a job requires a strong network. Forget applying to a job advertised. It will go to a friend of a friend instead. Housing is impossible. Too few houses, and sky high rents. There are few language classes, and their quality is improving. Living here can be troubling, and it is a preserve for the strong. ",
