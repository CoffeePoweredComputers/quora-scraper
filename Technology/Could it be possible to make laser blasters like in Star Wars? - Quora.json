The reason why the Star Wars franchise blasters are so much more effective is because they can fire much longer their our current projectile weapons before they have to be replenished with gas charges. Plus they are very deadly especially to unarmored foes from point blank range to quite a ways off. Blaster/Legends ",

            "answer_text": "Well, blasters aren\u2019t actually a laser. laser technology is used in their design, but they\u2019re actually a high energy particle beam. Basically, a blaster passes a laser through a dense packet of tibanna gas. Tibanna gas is kind of weird, it acts as a multiplier for any energy that\u2019s passed through it. The beam fired by the blaster is actually a bolt of condensed, highly energised gas mixed with a laser to make the aforementioned particle beam. ",
