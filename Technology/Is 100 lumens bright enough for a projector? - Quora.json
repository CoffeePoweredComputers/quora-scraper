            "answer_text": "Typically expressed in lumens or ANSI lumens, brightness specification is an important reference when selecting a projector. However, the practical meaning of projector brightness and how to choose a projector for your specific installation needs can be confusing. If you\u2019d like to watch movies using a projector on a 100\u201d~120\u201d screen without ambient lighting, around 2,000 lumens of projection brightness is ideal. If you need to turn on ambient lighting or if there are bright light sources in the room, a projector with 3,000 lumens or more will display clear images. ",

            "answer_text": "No!! Even if you have a dedicated home theatre room with no light coming from anywhere. I would say for crisp movie watching 100 will be too less. Anything below 300 would be low in my opinion. For good picture quality and brightness contrast atleast go for 1000 so you can enjoy even in a partially lit room ",
