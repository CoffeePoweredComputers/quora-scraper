            "answer_text": "I appreciate that you put forth your thoughts in this direction. Very few defence aspirants think about anything else except sacrifing themselves. Why does one need to ? So, I will try to answer your good question with best of me.  #1 Why just 10 years ? Why don't you opt for PC ? (if there is any for females, I am not sure) As a permanent commissioned officer, I do not think you would be having any difficulty financially or socially in your life. You will be earning well enough. You will be carrying a glorious rank on your shoulders. So, well enough ? #2 Okay, lets make it for 10 years only. Tell you what, just SSB and its preparation have given me so much to apply in my life. 10 years in armed forces will take you to another level of intellect, physical fitness and a productive mindset. Other answerers quoted well about higher studies' plans. I know a navy officer who got in IIMC and he was paid salary during two years' tenure. Have you ever heard of any company doing such an honour to its employees ?  #3 There are plenty of career paths one can choose after 10 years in military. Dealing with manpower, working in a team, getting work done in any circumstances, and what not you would have learnt through the way. A start up maybe ? Or management in IT ? Writer ? You will be having kids too, no ? So teaching them ? Or a better idea, teaching at schools ? Coder ? You will be a free soul with so many options to choose among. #4 Experiences. Adventure. Toughness. Challenges. Hardship. Pain. Competiton. And finally, contentment. You will be much more contented than the other girl sitting in a cubicle 9-5. The only adventurous thing she would have ever done in entire lifetime, be eating 20 gol-gappe in one go. Try and compare. You will find yourself much happier, stronger and lively.  Good luck.Jai Hind. ",

            "answer_text": "I highly doubt your identity here.A) you mention that you're an IT engineer that means you'r already working in IT industry. (Maybe you meant to say you're doing B.Tech in IT).B) You say you're a lady in the final semester (8th) of your B.Tech Both statements contradict my dear lady! Anyways, for your question here is my answer: Serving in the armed forces is simply not about a settled life and a decent job. It is more than that. If you're concerned about \"giving away your youth\" then may I suggest you ma'am to pursue something else. In case you are genuinly interested to serve our nation, you are going to live a great life ahead. People who retire from armed forces as an officer be it male or female, are treated in high regards in the society. Plus, you're an engineer so you can join any of the corporate firms after your short service tenure is over. You will undergo lot of training and courses which will make you the champion of administration and management by the time you complete your defence tenure. This will help you to settle in any industry without any problems and above that you're an engineer so don't forget that! However, I'm pretty sure that down the line in next 14 years (normal tenure in defence for ladies) you may be given option to convert your commission of job to permanent which means you are entitled to serve till full retirement age of 60 years. It is your choice to decide the fate of your life. And if you dream to serve our nation by being the part of the armed forces, you will be highly appreciated for that by a billion Indians.  Don't you think that is worth enough of spending our youth energy? Think over.If you need any help, reach out to me. One fine day, I hope to see you in uniform miss!  Jai Hind. ",
