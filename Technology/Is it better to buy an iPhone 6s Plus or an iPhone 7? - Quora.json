            "answer_text": "There really is no clear answer between these two phones. The iPhone 7 is newer and therefore will be supported longer. It also has a faster processor and brighter and more color accurate screen. It also includes stereo speakers as well as water resistance. The iPhone 6s Plus has a larger screen with higher DPI and a headphone jack. It also has a longer battery life. As far as everything else goes the two will perform pretty similar, they even have almost identical cameras with the 7 including optical image stabilization which previously only plus models featured. The 7 will include an extra year of software support from Apple but the 6S will still have two or three more years left at this point. Between these two phones the most significant difference would be the screen size. If the size of the Plus will bother you then I would go with the 7, if not then I would suggest the 6S Plus to get that extra screen space. I assume you are not including the 7 plus due to cost so one other option to consider would be to wait for the next generation to be released later this year, and then get the 7 Plus at the same price as a 6S plus now. This way you get a much better screen as well as the dual camera setup which is a massive upgrade in my opinion. Edit: I see you added about the 7 lasting longer and the lack of headphone jack. If by last longer you mean in software support then yes, that is something to consider if you plan on keeping the phone a while. The 6s should still be good for around 2 1/2 years based on Apples previous pattern. You have an S6 now so I assume you are on a two year cycle meaning the 6S should last long enough to get you through. If you use a headphone jack for a single set of headphones then the included adapter can be left on your headphones. If you need to use it with multiple devices, especially devices you do not personally own then this can become a hassle and is a good reason to add to the 6S Plus benefits column. This edit does not really change my answer though, I would still recommend the 6S Plus as long as the larger form factor will not be an issue. ",

            "answer_text": "iPhone 7! Because big screen is of no big use and it is always better to buy latest affordable phone! Also iOS 7 and iPhone 7 work better together! The iPhone 7 is deeply unusual device. They are full of aggressive breaks from convention while wrapped in cases that look almost exactly like their two direct predecessors. Even that continuity of design is a break from convention; after almost a decade of Apple\u2019s steady two-year iPhone update pattern, merely retaining the same design for a third straight year plays against expectations. Inside that case, everything else about the iPhone 7 is a decisive statement about the future. The dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus promise to usher in a new era in mobile photography. The iconic iPhone home button is no longer a physical button, but instead a sophisticated ballet of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that simulate the feel of a button. The new A10 Fusion processor blends two high-power cores that rival laptop performance with two low-power cores that combine with a much larger battery to extend run time by up to two hours. There\u2019s really no getting around it: the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus look more or less exactly like the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus from 2014. They are now water resistant, which is nice, although they\u2019re not fully waterproof \u2014 keep them submerged in a meter of water for more than 30 minutes and things might not go your way. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7 and Note 7 are technically even more water resistant, but I think it\u2019s basically a push \u2014 you can get these phones casually wet now without catastrophe, and that\u2019s a big win. If you want to go snorkeling with your iPhone, you should probably get a case anyhow. you can check the specifications and prices here: Smartphones / Smartphones & Basic Mobiles: Electronics ",
