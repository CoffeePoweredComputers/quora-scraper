            "answer_text": "This question is ambiguous as written. \u201cIs technology innovation flattening\u201d could mean Is the growth of technology flattening the rich/poor divide around the world (I thought it meant this but that may not be your intention)Is the acceleration of technology slowingIs technology growth flattening economics because it\u2019s both deflationary and exponentialQuestion 1: In some ways, if we look at the cost for a \u201cgood\u201d cellphone, or a computer, or a flatscreen TV we can see that the deflationary price/quality of these items flattens out data access for much more of the population of the world. Over time data becomes cheaper. I believe we\u2019ll see this with power as Solar PV and batteries follow Swanson\u2019s Law. In this sense, technological innovation is flattening the rich/poor divide (though in other aspects like rents, utilities, healthcare, access to travel, it is not) Question 2: No, technological progress is accelerating. Most of this is invisible because we\u2019re going through several big changes (from x86 to ARM processors, from standard RAM to next-gen RAM, from server rooms to cloud computing). You can only see the expensive new technology as expensive new devices, but like the $17,000 flatscreen in 1997, eventually, they\u2019ll come down in price and become commodified (the same TV would cost less than 1/50 of its 1997 price). Question 3: Yes technological innovation is flattening economics, as you can see in my answer to question 2, along with accelerating automation technology innovation is flattening economics. ",

It causes Digital divide - Wikipedia and in numerous cases contributed the social unrest. Qualities such as trust (Trust (social science) - Wikipedia) or honesty (Honesty - Wikipedia) lost their meanings on the Internet. Cybercriminals flourish. It has too much in too short a period of time. This publication http://www.cs.laurentian.ca/wkoczkodaj/p/SIR2018.pdf has evidenced  Gov agency (where the metadata are posted) uses NIA (number of individuals affected) but there are just victims: over 173 millions of medial records \u201clost\u201d, stolen, or sold to cybercrooks. NB is the number of breaches. Most reactions have been: I do not care. ",
