            "answer_text": "Haptic technology is an ensemble of technological devices enabling the stimulation of the sense of touch. It may be compared with both audio and video reproduction techniques with the whole technology ensemble enabling the reproduction of video and audio stimulations. Within the term Haptic Technology there is a number of techniques which enable a particular stimulation, which, a part from the vibration stimulus in smartphones, are fundamentally disregarded by the technological community. It is possible to name: vibratory stimulation by smartphoneindentation stimulation by braille screensshape simulation by active polymersfriction modulation by electrovibration or ultrasonic vibrationspain stimulation by electrostimulationThe complicated matter around haptics is that the tactile information is encoded by the mechanical displacement of the skin, which in the case of the finger assumes a rounded shape. To reproduce a fully realistic tactile sensation, the correct encoding of the shape of the touched object, as well as the vibratory pattern induced on the finger, may be necessary. At this point, it has not yet been found a technology able to reproduce the whole range of sensation, and, pardon my view, the vibrational signal performed by smartphones is probably the most archaic and less efficient way to stimulate the finger on flat screens, where friction modulation techniques provide a far better ability to reproduce real sensations. As Rohith mentioned in another answer, it has been proved multiple times, and it is clear from a logical point of view, that the absence of a well designed haptic feedback by the device induces a mismatch between the expected tactile sensation and the obtained one. For example, if you have a leap motion, try to grasp an object with your hand, you will develop a lot of strange and unnatural techniques to perform the task, and all of them will fill unnatural to you.

            "answer_text": "Haptic is a Greek word which means \u2018able to come into contact\u2019 or \u2018anything related to sense of touch\u2019. The technology where the sense of touch is recreated through vibration or other means is known as haptic technology. Haptic technology saw one of the earliest applications in large aircrafts, where controls surfaces were operated through servomechanism systems, a system which provided negative feedback when it sensed error. The servo systems was not equipped enough to let the pilot know of any external threats. The servo systems were modified with weights and springs to allow sending vibrations to the controller in the pilot\u2019s hand, whenever threats were detected by the servo system. Modern haptic technology utilizes sensors to measure the amount of force exerted, by the user, on the user interface and then sends a feedback. The market for haptic technology is growing at a very fast pace, primarily owing to the growing demand for various consumer electronic devices globally. Haptic technology is now a common feature in most mobile handsets such as smart phones and tablets. It is also being used in various laptops. It has also being seeing growing applications in gaming consoles. The increasing penetration of internet of things (IoT) coupled with rural penetration of internet in emerging economies has been boosting the growth of smart phones, tablets and laptops market. This in turn has been positively impacting the growth of haptic technology market. Additionally, haptic technology is also being utilized in vehicular electronics and medical electronics among others. Furthermore, various research institutes and research and development (R&D) divisions of corporations have been focusing on improving haptic systems and also to develop newer applications for haptic technology. Considering all the positive impacts of the above mentioned factors, the market for haptic technology is expected to grow at a fast pace. PDF For Detailed Anaysis of Haptic Technology ",
