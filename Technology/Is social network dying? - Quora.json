            "answer_text": "First, permit me to clarify some terms. Despite the movie title, I dislike the term \u201csocial network\u201d intensely. A network of people (as opposed to networks of wires and cables) is, BY DEFINITION, social. Therefore, calling something a \u201csocial network\u201d is redundant. I believe what you are referring to are \u201csocial media platforms\u201d. This is a generic term that refers to any website on the internet where anyone who joins can post information, and dialogue with other members. This includes websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Quora, etc. If your question is whether or not social media platforms are dying, then my answer, in a word, is NO. Social media platforms allow people to express themselves, more or less anonymously, in a \u201csafe\u201d manner online. This is an opportunity that clearly most of the world\u2019s population seeks to take advantage of, and this is why I believe social media platforms will not die. Individual social media platforms may evolve or even disappear (does anyone still use MySpace or Second Life?), but the concept itself will stay. ",
