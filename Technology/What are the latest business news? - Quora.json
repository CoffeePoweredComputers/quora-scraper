            "answer_text": "Business news #1 - August 8, 2020. 1) The Madras high court fined Patanjali INR10 lakh for chasing profit by exploiting public fear by projecting a COVID-19 cure.  Where actually \u2018Coronil\u2019 is not a cure but rather an immunity booster. They wanted to do marketing their products however the court permanently banned \u2018Coronil\u2019. It is nothing we all know that it is marketing by saying the product is a cure or anything else. 2) Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das on 6 august Thursday said that India\u2019s forex reserves have increased by $56.8 billion to $534.6 billion in the current financial year between April to July.

Our foreign exchange is growing contiguously. 3) The Indian Railways launched the first \u2018Kisan Rail\u2019 coaches on Friday. \u2018Kisan Rail\u2019 will help for faster transportation perishable farm produce including vegetables and fruits in refrigerated. The inaugural train was flagged off from Deolali in Maharastra to Danapur in Bihar.  It will help farmers effectively and cheaply transport their produce to consumption markets. :) A great decision has taken by Indian Railways. 4) After US President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning the US transition with WeChat\u2019s owner Tencent, over $45 billion USD was wiped off from the Chinese firm\u2018s market value.  It\u2019s stoke on Friday plunged over 10% and they lost over $45 billion USD market cap in one day. 5) Jeff Bezos has sold amazon shares worth $3.1 billion USD and will take home an estimated $2.4 billion after-tax deduction.  In 2020 he sold approx. over $7 billion USD Amazon shares. 5) Google Inc. has decided that 200,000 employees and contractors should be working work from home until June 2021. A remote work ordered issued 4 august Monday by CEO Sunder Pichai.  I think a great decision taken by them. Although it would be more than a year after June 2021 if they don't take back it. 6) Also, Amazon has decided that its corporate can work from home until January 2020.  7) Sony Pictures Entertainment\u2019s CEO Tony Vinciquerra issued an order that the company's employee can work remotely due to amid coronavirus pandemic.  8) US media reports that Facebook is also letting workers tend to their jobs remotely for the rest of this year. Facebook's updated.  ",
