            "answer_text": "Hello,  Nowadays there are plenty of \u2018free stuffs\u2019 like software and apps are available online and someone should not spend money if his/her utility has been fulfilled with the free offers available online, especially if it is a matter for your personal computer or a laptop. Because for personal or small office use, you can\u2019t afford to buy a lot of paid software and that is not making sense too. I have sorted out few of thems which seems legit to me and I was able to download my desired software without any further issue, the list is here as under: www.download.zone (a small website but gives an easy to find download button)cnet (one of the pioneer website, lot of ads and took more time to load)filehippo (a lot of software available, but a bit tricky to download)Softpedia (a good website to download free software)Filehorse (another good website for software free download, redirects on another page while downloading)Softonic - (A lot of popups and unwanted redirects)Uptodown - (site full with popups and extra download offers)This is my own personal observation and has had experience with all the above websites for our various software download requirements. I hope, it helps. Stay safe, ",

            "answer_text": "I will suggest two torrent sites:1. Kickass. 2. The Pirate Bay. Generally no viruses or malware in the software. And if there is then, you get to know that by reading the comments on the torrent.  Note: Download only trial software from these websites. If you like the software after trying, buy it.  Caution: I will warn that these websites are not for under-18 community as there are adult adverts displayed. ",
