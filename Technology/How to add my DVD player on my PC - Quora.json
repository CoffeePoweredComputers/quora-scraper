            "answer_text": "Unless you have only an external standalone DVD player with video outputs, you\u2019re MUCH better off using either the internal SATA connections or external USB connections which keep the digital video information intact. Neither of these is expensive these days, and trying to take the video output (composite, component, SVHS or HDMI) into the computer would not only lose video quality, but also cost as much for the external video adapters (typically dongles that attach to USB) that it\u2019d actually be cheaper to just buy a new external USB DVD player/burner. Then you can use Handbrake to copy the DVD, or VLC to play the video files, both freeware (last time I checked) available for many operating systems. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t understand this question? You realize that a \u201cDVD Drive\u201d for a PC is like ~$20 So are you asking about a \u201cstand-alone DVD player?\u201d Why would you buy one of those for a PC? They\u2019re basically a mini PC attached to a DVD drive. Instead, you should get a DVD/Blu-Ray Drive for a PC. They\u2019ve got External USB DVD Burners/Readers for $30. For ~$50 you can get a Bluray Burner that goes in a Standard 5.25\u2033 Drive Bay you can find them on Sites like Amazon, Newegg, etc. The answer is yes it\u2019s possible there are \u201cVideo Riping Cards\u201d but you\u2019re far better off just getting a Ripping program (like anydvd) for a backup of your videos on to HDD. Perhaps using a free program like \u201chandbrake\u201d to encode it for whatever device. There is plenty of software out there for this stuff. And just using an inexpensive Blu-Ray/DVD Burner is super easy! Good Luck. ",
