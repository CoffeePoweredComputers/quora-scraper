            "answer_text": "It\u2019s useful in many ways for architects and interior designers. With the updated apps like sketchbook pro and many others it makes it easy. 1. The Apple Pencil Reportedly, Steve Jobs once told his biographer that if Apple ever made a stylus \u201cthey blew it.\u201d Clearly, Tim Cook is thinking differently, as today Apple announced the Apple Pencil to accompany the new iPad. According to Business Insider, the stylus \u201ccan capture more of a single stroke than your average stylus\u201d and is precise enough to highlight a single pixel - not easy given the new iPad\u2019s 5.6 megapixel display. The ability to work with that kind of precision is completely new on the iPad, and for architects and designers, it\u2019s a crucial addition. If there has been one issue preventing a wider uptake of architecture apps on the iPad, it\u2019s been the fat-fingered lack of accuracy implied by Steve Jobs\u2019 hands-only model. As Business Insider puts it, the Apple Pencil \u201cis a clear indication that Apple's thinking has moved beyond fingers and thumbs.\u201d 2. Side-by-Side Apps When taking a design from concept to completion, architects usually need to use a number of programs with different capabilities, transferring work and ideas over from the previous iteration of the design. 3. Improved Graphics With architectural and designer work often being very graphically intensive, Apple\u2019s claim that the iPad Pro\u2019s graphics offer double the performance of their previous installment is a big one, supposedly making its graphics 360 times what was offered by the original iPad. The iPad Pro also brings their latest Retina 5K display over to the iPad family, making it \u201cthe most advanced display we have ever built,\u201d according to Apple Senior VP Phil Schiller. 4. New Apps from Adobe In what the Verge calls a \u201csurprise addition to Apple's iPad Pro announcement,\u201d Apple invited Eric Snowden from Adobe to demonstrate two of their apps running on the new device. The first was a brand new app, known as Adobe Fix, which allows users to retouch images quickly, while the second was an update to their Adobe Sketch app which allowed it to work more smoothly with the new Apple Pencil.
