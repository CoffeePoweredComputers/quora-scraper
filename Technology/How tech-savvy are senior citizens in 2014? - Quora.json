            "answer_text": "I was recently watching a gentleman in his 50's use his computer. While he's not quite in the age group that you are discussing, I would still lump 50-somethings into the same group in terms of computer savvy. I sat beside him as he hunted and pecked on the computer to compose a simple email. Then I watched him flutter his mouse all over the screen to find the Forward button. I also observed that this age group (mind you - just one test case -- but still probably very representative) has developed odd processes to get to the same end-result that us younger folk can accomplish in one or two clicks of the mouse or a simple key-stroke. To paste an email address into his To: field, he highlighted the address by dragging his mouse over it, then he right clicked on that same address and selected Copy. Then he went into his email and clicked Paste. You and I would have just double-clicked the address, clicked Ctl-C and then Ctr-V into our To: field. Now, this isn't an extreme difference, but it represents the longer routes the older computer users take to get to their desired results. These long routes add to the frustrations that the older people have with computers. I have often thought of teaching a class to senior citizens on keyboard and mouse short-cuts. I think minimizing the steps would help them adopt computers more widely and feel more comfortable with them. ",

            "answer_text": "Seniors are a broad demographic and it depends on the age group and income level.  For those 74+, 30% of them are online.  The senior demographic just below them, 65-74, has 58% online though.  That shows a tremendous increase in internet usage.  As the younger seniors age, it is @going to shift the usage trends for older demographics higher.  Plus, more seniors are being pushed online by their families who want to stay connected via email, Facebook, or video chatting.  There are more facts and figures at: The Scientific and Social Importance of Internet Access in Senior Communities, http://blog.silverfoxbroadband.com. Additionally, new technologies and companies are coming about that make technology adoption easier for seniors.  The iPad, for example, has a highly intuitive design with a high-contrast screen that makes it both easy to use and easy to see ( http://blog.silverfoxbroadband.com/?p=1 ).  My wife\u2019s grandmother received an iPad and she is now on Facebook every day. I\u2019ve actually talked to more seniors that are using video chat to communicate with their families than I have people in their 40\u2019s.  The facts are pointing to  bigger increases in social media use by the seniors because they have the time to engage in it and it is the only way many can routinely stay connected with families that may be thousands of miles away.
