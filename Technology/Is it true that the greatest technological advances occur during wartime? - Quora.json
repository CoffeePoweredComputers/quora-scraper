            "answer_text": "Wartime can focus and apply resources and thus shorten time lines but\u2026technological advances are dependent upon the creativity of the human mind and the ability of those minds to develop the technology they and others created. The ultimate example\u2026. If it were not for Enrico Fermi who created the first nuclear chain reaction on the 2nd December 1942, then the plutonium bomb could not have been developed. The implosion design was incredibly complex, far more than the Uranium 235 bomb was which was a simple device but depended upon centrifuges and vast amounts of work and time to collect a critical mass of Uranium\u2026 Here the Plutonium was plentiful but the complexity of the bomb was groundbreaking and difficult. This all consumed a great deal of resources - money over one billion dollars and it consumed another vital gathering of resources - minds\u2026 Enrico Fermi was an Italian who was married to a Jew, Laura Capon Fermi who was subject to anti Jewish racial laws in Italy so he fled Italy for America. Einstein was a Jewish refugee from the Nazi\u2019s and his letter to FDR started the Manhattan Project and it was his theories that laid the foundation for atomic energy and atomic weapons\u2026 many other Jewish physicists, mathematicians and engineers contributed in major ways to the development of the Atomic Bomb\u2026 You see it is minds that create and develop technology and yes it takes Money to do it faster and on a commercial scale\u2026 but all innovation starts in the human mind and having the right minds to do the work is critical to success. America gathered scientists including Jewish scientists\u2026 America spent the money and America won the war. But\u2026. America had another billion dollar development project - the B 29 - a high altitude, pressurized bomber - the delivery system that was used to carry the Atomic Bomb\u2026 This too involved money, engineering and time to create and had WWII not occurred the development of such aircraft would have taken longer to do\u2026many years longer - wartime and the focus of resources shortened the time line dramatically for the development of technology\u2026. There were thousands upon thousands of pieces of technology but the principle remains the same\u2026 Resources of money to shorten time and focused human minds to create and develop that technology into practical deliverable results.

            "answer_text": "Wars can have beneficial effects on technological development. In general, wars tend to accelerate technological development to adapt tools for the purpose of solving specific military needs. Later, these military tools may evolve into non-military devices. A recent example of this is radar. The first practical radar set was in 1935, and was used it to detect aggressors during the early days of World War 2. It became an important tool in militaries around the world. In turn, radar's adoption required countries to adapt to new warfare strategies. It also prompted the United States to invest in research and development for new ways to confound radar. The result was stealth air craft technology. On the civilian front, radar played a different role. A scientist made an interesting discovery while standing near a magnetron -- a device that powers radar sets. He had a chocolate bar in his pocket. The bar began to melt when He stood near the magnetron. This piqued the scientist's curiosity and he began to examine what was going on. This led to the invention of the microwave oven. The Internet itself began as a military project. Beginning in the 1960s, the U.S. Department of Defense funded a project called ARPANET. The purpose of the project was to develop the technologies and protocols necessary to allow multiple computers to connect directly to one another. This would allow people to share information with each other at unprecedented speeds. A computer network could also have another benefit: national security. By creating a robust and flexible network, the United States could ensure that in the event of catastrophe, access to the nation's supercomputers could remain intact. ARPANET's protocols allowed information to travel across different routes. If something happened to a computer node along one route, the information could take another path to get to the right destination. Another example of how the possibility of war affected technological development is the space race between the United States and what was then known as the Soviet Union. On Oct. 4, 1957, the Soviet Union succeeded in launching the first man-made satellite into the Earth\u2019s orbit. Its name was Sputnik, and it spurred on an intense, focused era of innovation. Part of that research went into projects like ARPANET. Much of it focused on getting the United States' space technology ahead of the Soviets'. Several factors fueled this race. One was fear -- if the Soviets could launch a rocket with a payload the size of Sputnik into orbit, it was feasible the country could launch a missile attack on the United States from across the globe. Even though there were plenty of scientific reasons to pursue the space race, on one level it boiled down to saber rattling between the two nations. While the motives behind the space race may not have been purely founded upon a desire to extend our scientific knowledge, that in no way diminishes the accomplishments made by both countries. The space race was a symbolic conflict between both countries and put pressure on the scientists and engineers developing the systems and vehicles necessary to put men and women into space. Some of this technology later evolved into other forms, and was eventually adapted to serve civilian purposes. (How Stuff Works) ",
