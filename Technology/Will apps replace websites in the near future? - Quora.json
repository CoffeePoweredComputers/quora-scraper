            "answer_text": "No. Although this theory has been around for awhile, it is not likely it will come true. Both are completely different approaches to display contens/interactions. While Websites have benefits in their openness and easy access (you just need the browser, no need to require to \"Download\" it first, like an App), Apps are perfect for real, repeated interaction between a service or other users. What already happened, and will continue in the future, is the change of using both of them. Just look at websites 5 years ago and today. They have become a real commodity and many just look the same. But they are still great for gathering quick information about, e.g. a company. Apps created a whole new business, but i like to think of them as a kind of bridge technology, as they are basically closed sandboxes with mostly limited capabilities. I suppose in the future we will see something more interoperable, \"Apps\" that talk to each other and make use of \"network effects\" between different Apps you use. Google Now's intelligent newsfeed gives a hint on where the development might go. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually we\u2019re moving in the complete opposite direction. Progressive web apps enable websites to be added to devices and even work offline. They get more device specific functionality and in the works they\u2019re going to be able to do much of what apps can do now. Web apps have a huge advantage over native apps - they automatically work on every device. Yes us developers have to deal with some minor bugs in different web browsers, but even still, this is a lot easier than what traditional app developers have to do when porting their projects between different operating systems. You\u2019re also not limited to the hardware - for example a PWA for video editing, doesn\u2019t have to do any of the rendering on the device itself, it makes it easier to handle it all in the cloud, enabling low end hardware to compete with top of the line hardware for doing the same task. The other advantage is the file size - PWAs dont need to take up much space because the complex rendering part of the app is already stored on your device as part of it\u2019s web browser. PWAs also have the benefit of security, they\u2019re not native apps, they\u2019re sandboxed like tabs in a web browser meaning they can\u2019t affect other files on your device without your specific consent to do so. Understand though we will likely never go fully web only or fully app only. There are positives for both, and you always need a web browser on a device for PWAs to work, that means a native app. The lines are just getting blurrier and it\u2019s great. ",

I can\u2019t really and if I would catch myself without my phone on me, I\u2019d be terrified. Not enough? Such thing as portable phone power banks exploded on the market, making sure your phone never dies. Some say this has to do with a narcissistic addiction to social media and staying in tune with all the stuff going on around but does it? Today mobile apps start your car engine, sync with your watch, provide you with music(like your friends used to before), watch your diet, control your account and manage your expenses, take care of your commuting, and are just the extension of your eyes, ears, hands and what have you. It feels like there an app for everything. And whenever you come up with an app idea, whoops\u2026 it\u2019s already been done. It wasn\u2019t always like this though. Ten years ago, mobile app development was a Wild West and nobody knew what the heck they were doing back then. Mostly there were apps designed by programmers in a purely functional manner. But that had to change. The market is sensitive to new stuff especially coming from the Silicon Valley oven. So aesthetics came into play with designers turning their gaze on mobile application design. ",

I think the web needs to be replaced, but apps aren\u2019t going to do it. It needs to be some sort of platform where you can just render anything you like, similar to a web browser, but with all the crap taken out. ",

They are easy to develop and not limited to specific platforms, but rather, as software improves, will become a one-site-fits-all solution. ",
