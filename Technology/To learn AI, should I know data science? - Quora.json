            "answer_text": "1- What is data science?  With the emergence of big data coupled with fast computing power, many decision-makers of businesses are trying to identify different ways to attain their business goals. These days, whenever they want to launch something new, they\u2019re looking to data science professionals in order to get demand, market, target demographic, among others. You can think of data science as an umbrella term for all methods and techniques that professionals use to analyze huge amounts of data in order to derive insights from them. It\u2019s the general practice of utilizing scientific tools and techniques to draw insights from or find patterns in data. Almost everything is covered by this field \u2013 from preparing raw data for analyzing to presenting insights gained from analytics. 2- What is artificial intelligence?  Artificial intelligence or AI is a broad term. At its core, it attempts to make machines think like human beings. Any algorithm, code or technique that enables computers to develop, demonstrate, and mimic human cognitive behaviors or abilities falls under the category of artificial intelligence. An artificial intelligence-powered system can be as complex as driverless cars or as simple as software which plays chess. Within artificial intelligence, there is machine learning which is considered the most exciting part of the field today and for reasons. With the help of machine learning, artificial intelligence has made a significant number of breakthroughs which once seemed nearly impossible. It\u2019s the key reason that computers can steer a car or spot one of your friend\u2019s face in a photo. 3- Data science and artificial intelligence \u2013 How they are different  Here are some of the major differences between data science and artificial intelligence. It\u2019s important to understand that both of these are extremely popular choices in the tech landscape and the differences mentioned below are completely based on their operational nature. Data science is all about capturing, analyzing, and deriving insights of massive amounts of data whereas artificial intelligence involves providing the machines with data in order to train them.Data science involves identifying patterns in data whereas artificial intelligence involves observing intelligence in data.In the graphic aspect, data science involves representation in different graphical formats whereas in artificial intelligence, algorithm network nodes are used in the representation.4- The relation between data science and artificial intelligence  Data science is an interdisciplinary domain which requires concepts and skills used in disciplines like statistics, visualization, machine learning etc. Data science is a general term for methods and process which analyze and manipulate data. It empowers artificial intelligence to identify appropriate information and meaning massive volumes of data with higher efficiency and speed. As for the term data science and artificial intelligence, it\u2019s quite easy to become confused. Unfortunately, both of these terms get discussed frequently and casually by some people more interested in hype instead of solving problems, making the scenario even more confusing. If you want to step into any of these fields, here is the think you need to keep in mind \u2013 forget the term artificial intelligence for the time being because machine learning is the biggest and most practical application for this field today. So, machine learning is the technology businesses expect candidates to understand. You can consider data science as the way you wish to implement that machine learning. It\u2019s the real-world application of artificial intelligence with the objective of developing products/services for people. One may argue that data science professionals were working long before the appearance of artificial intelligence as a functional option and there\u2019re applications that don\u2019t exclusively benefit from contemporary artificial intelligence. In the context of data science, the problem with the conventional approach is that there are massive amounts of data to be analyzed and a limited number of data science professionals to do it. Non-intelligent methods are very time- and talent-intensive. They can make a huge to come up with results when answers are really time-sensitive. As a matter of fact, artificial intelligence does need data science professionals to set up and monitor, but real-time analytics can be powered by its algorithms. And this shortens the gap between the time data is produced and the time it\u2019s interpreted into valuable insights. If you want to learn about an example that uses both data science and artificial intelligence, you can think of IBM Watson. It\u2019s an AI technology which helps physicians identify key information in the medical records of a patient quickly to offer relevant evidence, as well as, explore treatment options. It takes in the medical records of a patient first and then comes up with personalized and evident-based recommendations fueled by information from a collection of 15+ pages of texts, 200 textbooks, and 300+ journals that provide the doctors with instant access to a huge amount of information personalized to the treatment plan of the patient.
