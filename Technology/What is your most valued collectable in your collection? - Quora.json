And damn, that\u2019s valuable!\u201d In that sense, despite the fact that I have a very few CDs that have become sought after, they are not usually my prizes. I struggled for a long time to find this disc set: Darius Milhaud (Composer), Quatuor Parisii - Darius Milhaud: The Complete String QuartetsI have both performances of Opus clavicembalisticum - WikipediaNot everything is rare. Much to my surprise, the recent release of Quatuor Danel, Dmitri Shostakovich, __ - Shostakovich: The Complete String Quartets has become one of my favorites. It\u2019s $25 for five discs.I plan to leave everything to the Boatwright Memorial Library. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really know, its not until you sale the item that you might find out, but if nobody at the time wants it it can go for nothing. The best answer is what piece, would I miss the most if I lost it? thats an 8inch figure of Buddha that I talk to almost every night he has such a look on his face that one feels humbled by him.He has lost both his hands and most of his gilt but those eyes, that face wonderful. I have in my collection a Palestinian wedding bonnet with 40 silver thalers on the back of it, its bespangled with beads that I know would fetch monies. I do have hundreds of items in the collection but I prefer a lot to one of two valuable pieces , which might turn out to be fakes one never really knows until one goes to sell them! ",
