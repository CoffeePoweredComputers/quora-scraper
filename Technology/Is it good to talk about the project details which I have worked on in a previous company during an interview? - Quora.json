And my answer to it revolves around the details and challenges of the projects I have worked on. I have given more than 50 interviews in the last few years of my career and in more than 85%of them, I have spoken about my previous projects. I do not see why one should not speak about them, in fact, I opine they work in your favour. When you speak about the previous projects, you let your interviewer know about the kind of work you have done and how it falls in line with the interviewer's requirements. So, to answer the question, yes, it is good to talk about the details of your projects. ",
