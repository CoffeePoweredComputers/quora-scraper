            "answer_text": "Depends if 1) they have a monopoly and 2) they are abusing the monopoly. And no, I don't think there is any good reason to break up Google. US law is not against monopolies. Copyright and patent law exist to create monopolies. Anti-trust laws don't exist to break up monopolies. Anti-trust laws exist to punish companies that leverage a monopoly in one market to gain unfair advantage in another market. If Google has a monopoly in search or ads or chat apps and uses that monopoly power to increase market share in cosmetics, fossil fuels, or fad children's toy manufacturing, then Google could be fined or forced to accept a consent decree, or most dramatic of all, broken up. I'm not an attorney and Google legal doesn't want me to do legal speculation. The determination of that would come down to a lawsuit. Have to wait and see, I guess. ",
