If you went to Best Buy, there are a few technically knowledgeable sales people, but usually they have a tendency to push you in a direction if you aren\u2019t on top of what you need, so I suggest using the net to look up \u201cten best printers\u201d or \u201cwhat printers compare to Hewlett-Packard?\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll get some good feedback. I might be looking for a new car soon, so first I need to know what model do I want - I have a 2.5 year old Black Lab who goes everywhere with me, so an SUV is what I need. Then, I research the most reliable SUV, one that holds its value, one that appeals to my aesthetics, and so on. Do some research so you can make a smart decision. Best of luck, Mahir! ",
