            "answer_text": "Someone has a homework assignment! I\u2019ll help with a few points. You can consolidate the various answers to write your own paper. Positive impacts: Space/Satellites satellites with Earth facing sensors have given us access to a lot of data that helps us with \u2018big picture\u2019 views of Earth\u2019s different environments. For example, we have historical views showing deforestation between the first satellite images and recent ones. At the same time, satellites are used in agriculture to help farmers grow crops more efficiently. This helps maximize the use of farmland to feed our population. Also, technological progress has led to greater machine efficiency. Generally speaking, we require less energy for the same amount of work from machines in the past. Negative impacts: As technology has progresssed, consumer electronics have become more prevalent throughout modern society. The materials used in those have to be mined. That mining process tends to have negative impacts on the environment. Even in places where it\u2019s standard practice to reclaim mines to return then to a natural state; the area is still altered significantly from its original state. Also, eWaste has become problematic. Electronics, with their batteries and other toxic components in landfills can pollute water tables[1]. Good Luck. I\u2019m sure other answers will have other points. ;P Footnotes[1] E-waste disposal effects on the aquatic environment: Accra, Ghana.",
