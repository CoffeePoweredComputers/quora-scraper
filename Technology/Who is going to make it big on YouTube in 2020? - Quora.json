            "answer_text": "I'm hardly ever on YouTube these days. I don't have time. As a general rule, Australia is big news for the Bush fires and the whole anti feminist conversation going on, so folks like Sydney Watson, the Buttsmarn, Bettina Arndt who just got an Australia day honour for her tireless work on Men's Rights. So all things Australian should be trending until June. Then Daisy Cousens may have a wedding coming up that will be a bigger event than Scott and Charlene in Neighbours in the late 80s. Generally youtubers who keep their videos below 7 minutes do well. Youtubers who avoid incurring the wrath of certain celebrities or influencers. Staying well away from any conversation about race or ethnicity seems to be wise. I can't name too many names as I am out of the loop these days. ",
