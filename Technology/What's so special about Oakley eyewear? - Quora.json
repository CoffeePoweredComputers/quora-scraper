            "answer_text": "Mostly style. Oakley is a brand of fairly well made sunglasses that has over 600 patents. They came to prominence in the 1980s and 1990s by getting famous athletes to wear them because the sunglasses and goggles would stay in place during strenuous activity. They also look pretty cool. Image from Oakley.com  While the company had modest roots and most frames are still designed at headquarters in Lake Forest, CA, the brand is (like most major eyeglass brands) owned by the Italian company Luxottica. While their sunglasses are very expensive (as of Jan 2017 the pair above is $200 US), they are well made and stylish. However, I have done UV and blue light testing that shows a pair of $80 sunglasses blocking 100% of UV light and >90% of blue light, and a pair of $6 sunglasses that blocked 100% of UV and around 80% of blue light. So don\u2019t buy them thinking that they have the best sun protection, but I have taken a tennis ball to the eye while wearing the 1990s version of the glasses below (M frame) and it protected my eyes pretty well.
