            "answer_text": "No, it isn\u2019t. Entrepreneurship is about taking risks, solving new problems, working directly with customers, selling, marketing a solution, dealing with financial reports and legal cases, building a product that ends up being maintained by a small team turned into a company which keeps growing steadily. It takes time, money (capital), and effort. It\u2019s more exhausting and outright stressful as compared to a regular job. Most people don\u2019t want to bother building a business of their own. Sure, they are tempted by the idea of: Being their own boss.Working whenever they feel like it.Earning 10x or 100x their regular salary.None of that is even remotely true for 99% of the entrepreneurs out there. Entrepreneurship isn\u2019t a 9-to-5 job that comes with the comfort of family and friends time in the evenings, or traveling and watching TV over the weekends. It\u2019s an effort that usually requires a massive commitment and a multidisciplinary approach for handling dozens of activities at the same time, from branding through technology to accounting. It requires an odd sense of curiosity and the inner urge for solving problems. It\u2019s a competitive sport that isn\u2019t comparable to being an employee of the month at the office. Over 80% of the businesses fail. And most people have a very hard time dealing with failure. They also invest in mortgages, leasing cars, or other personal ventures that require ongoing capital on a monthly basis. Those who are truly passionate about an idea and are willing to spend years validating it day and night, and making it happen can jump into the startup ecosystem. But that\u2019s a small chunk of the population which is genuinely willing to risk it all and spend their precious hours on hard work and burning the midnight oil. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think it is. To be an entrepreneur you need to be: Seriously thik skinned - you will get plenty of rejections, you will make plenty of mistakes, you will fail so many times to loose count \u2026 but you must keep goingHighly resilient - following from the above, when failure in one shape or another happens, you just have to move one. You can\u2019t take days to sob over it. You\u2019ve got to pick yourself up and get a move.Willing - as an entrepreneur, one day you\u2019re all dressed up in your taylor made suit and tie meeting the big CEO of a multibillion dollar corporation and the next day you might be in your overalls wiping crap from your office or factory\u2019s bathroom to save on plumbing bills (ok, that might be a bit of a stretch but you get the idea).Curious: you\u2019ve got to be immensiley curious about everything. You need to have that drive to learn about anything that is shaping the world as we know it.Multi-disciplinary: I hate sales with all I have, but yet, I\u2019ve got to do it. Other people I know love sales but hate development, yet they\u2019ve got to do it. Especially at the beginning, when you\u2019re building a team, you\u2019ve got to be a bit of a jack-of-all-tradesThere are many more traits to add to the list, but the above 5 should be sufficient to justify my answer. I know plenty of people who are excellent corporate employees but would make louzy entrepreneurs, and viceversa. You shouldn\u2019t judge either. ",
