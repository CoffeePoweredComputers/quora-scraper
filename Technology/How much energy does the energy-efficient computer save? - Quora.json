            "answer_text": "This is a difficult question to answer because it depends on the computer's usage pattern and settings.  Modern CPUs can throttle its clock frequency as required and a user can configure various power parameters in software - when to dim or turn off the display at idle, stop the HDD, turn wireless on-off, which are all features available to minimize power consumption when maximum performance is not required.  You can measure the difference between maximum performance vs. minimum energy consumption by way of an inexpensive energy monitor.   ",
