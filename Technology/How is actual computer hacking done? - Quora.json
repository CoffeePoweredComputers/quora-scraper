            "answer_text": "There are a great many ways to \"hack\" a computer. Here are a few of most significant (this is not an exhaustive list by any means): Exploiting a known security flaw in un-patched software running on the computer. These are known flaws for which an update has been released but due to laziness / complacency / ignorance / logistics a great many computers will not have applied the update. Exploiting a previously unknown security flaw (otherwise known as a \"0 day exploit\") in software running on the computer. These are security flaws which are not yet widely known about, particularly by the software's author.  Social engineering - ie tricking someone into giving you their password or installing some software on the computer. (Facebook posts asking you to cut/paste some code into your address bar are a good example of this) Physical access - if you can get physical access to the actual computer (ie \"the box\") it's relatively trivial to hack any computer. Privilege escalation - using exploits to \"escalate\" a low level of access to higher one. (eg normal user level access to \"admin\") Trojans - software that purports to do some useful thing so that it gets installed on a computer but also does some other secret purpose for the attacker (ie installs a \"back door\") Man-in-the-Middle - This is where an attacker controls a computer that is routing network traffic to other computers. If the network traffic is not encrypted, the \"man-in-the-middle\" can read the network data (to extract passwords) or change the data (for example to add malicious code to any software transmitted over the network) Brute forcing passwords - many people continue to use simple easy to guess passwords. There are a variety of techniques for using programs that \"guess\" billions of password combinations until a correct password is discovered. SQL injection - Some (many?) web applications (especially those built by new / naive programmers) contain vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to pass database queries in a url (or a form or a cookie) and have them executed by the web application to bypass the applications built in security. Cross Site Scripting (XSS) - badly written web applications may allow malicious javascript to be added to a page that is executed whenever a web visitor accesses that page. If a web site administrator accesses the page the javascript can execute any action that the administrator could do himself (such as change the admin password) Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - this is where some JavaScript on \"Site A\" (a malicious or previously compromised site) uses the fact that a visitor is also logged in to \"Site B\" to send a bogus request to \"Site B\" to perform some action. If \"Site B\" has not been programmed to defend against CSRF attacks it will carry out the requested action (for example, changing a password) without alerting the user. Unconfigured servers - this is server software that has been installed with default settings / passwords and then forgotten about. Attackers constantly probe all internet connected computers for unconfigured servers. ",

            "answer_text": "The only entrance requirements for becoming a hacker are an inquiring mind and plenty of time. These are things that young teenagers - especially, though not exclusively, boys - tend to have. The classic - and outdated - picture of the hacker is of a teen sitting in his bedroom, obsessively coding something impenetrable on his own, waiting to unleash a terrible virus that will wreak havoc on computers around the world. ADVERTISING In fact modern hackers are a gregarious bunch, who have grown up in a world where instant messaging and video chatting makes it possible to be connected to people at all times. Hacker conferences are often friendly events: Eric Corley, published of the hacker underground 2600 magazine (who styles himself Emmanuel Goldstein, after the figure of hate in Nineteen Eighty-Four), is a watchful but otherwise outgoing person. Conferences tend to be fun affairs, with people showing off their latest hacks. The newest trend you\u2019re probably missing is the manipulation of social engagement for SEO purposes. For example, lets say you get a backlink on the website ABC. Google sees the backlink, as does everyone else. Now, you tweet out that URL to try and push traffic to it, but you\u2019re really just adding some social signals to that backlink so it looks better in the eyes of search engines. Using automatic retweets, you\u2019ll have another 20-100 people retweet it and Google, as well as everyone else, will see all those social signals on the page that backlinks to you, which increases the value of that page and that \u201clink juice\u201d will flow to you. Imagine now, tweeting and sharing all of your good backlinks over the course of time, each backlink will increase in value and juice overtime, all of which flows through to your website. You can buy automatic retweets, facebook likes, followers, and even linkedin endorsements and YouTube views. One of the biggest reasons people dont buy fake followers is because they dont come with engagement. Buying automatic engagements are actually cheaper than the fake followers, and it gives your entire person or business Social Proof, demonstrating that you have customers and a real following. Most people know about buying fake followers, but hardly anyone knows about buying automatic retweets. To take it further, you can strategically tweet using medium-difficulty-level trending hashtags and get to the top of twitter, introducing your brand and message to the thousands of people on Twitter. \ufffd\ufffd\u0019!\ufffd\ufffdZ\ufffd\ufffdKn\u0014\" ",
