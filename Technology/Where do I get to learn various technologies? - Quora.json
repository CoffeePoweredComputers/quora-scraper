            "answer_text": "This is a complex question since I follow different approaches because I'm active in multiple forums and that give me hints. Also, I'm subscribed to some topics from Accenture, StackOverflow, Microsoft and Google. Additionally, I have geeky talks with some experts in multiple fields. If I see something interesting in any of all things that I said before or in the news, then I start to google them and do a small research in forums, GitHub, Wikipedia, tutorials, etc. I checked some statistics and rarely, I jumped to the official examples, which in some cases are too complicated if you don't understand well, what they are talking about. In other cases like Machine Learning, first, I tried to search for tutorials (too complicated). Second, I tried reading introductory books (sure they don't exist) or for dummy ones (more or less worked). Third, I tried to approach some data scientist that I know to understand, but they couldn't give me a hint where to start or what I missed since I'm an already experienced developer. Later, I tried some courses from Coursera for non-technical people and later I move to a more technical in Udemy and this was the key to enter in this game. However, I mostly rely on tutorials when I'm already good in something, right now, I'm learning Angular and I mostly rely on tutorials that I found, but what helps me identity good or bad tutorials is my vast experience in Web Development since I have worked with JavaScript, Java/Spring, PHP and ASP.

            "answer_text": "I believe that the best way to learn about technology is to try them out yourself. For example, if you are interested in learning the ins and outs of android phones, buy them, study their software inside out, look into the settings menu and understand every options that\u2019s available to you. Try flashing a custom OS onto the phone, physically take the phone apart and put it back together. Those are examples of what I think is the best way to learn about android phones, the same methodology can be applied to technology. Recently I\u2019ve been learning about digital business card app because of covid-19. First I\u2019ve looked into the QR page on wikipedia, then the vcard page. After that I\u2019ve downloaded all the digital business cards in the app store to play with them and to learn more about them. From doing this I\u2019ve learned a lot about the current state of digital business card technology: It is hard to find a good digital business card app because only a few of them are doing it right. There are 3 types of digital business card apps: This type of digital business card apps require the recipient of the card to install the same appThe second type takes the recipient of the card to go to a website where the recipient has to enter their contact information in exchange for the sender\u2019s contact informationThe third type embeds a vcard in the QR code so the recipient of the digital business card can get the sender\u2019s contact information directly into their cellphone without having to go to a website to copy and paste or download an extra appThis is how I learn about technology and the results from my learning, I hope this helps.
