            "answer_text": "It's no about the sensor, but how the data is processed. It all depends on the measurement hardware and the machine learning techniques used. You can use the famous xbox Kinect sensor array as many hobbyists and engineers have done. It all boils down to one question, what would you like to detect, and in what environment? Will you need a wearable IMU or use a Kinect sensor (which only works indoors in reasonably low light) Your queion is so broad, that I have a feeling you'll need to dig into deep neural networks and machine learning algorithms. You can use a webcam as a gesture sensor with the right software running in the background. A good webcam and OpenCV running would be a good start. Welcome to ML(machine learning). ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re thinking waving your hand or something like that, there\u2019s only Kinect. There are 2\u20133 versions of the device, and you have to connect it to a PC. If you want to do it yourself, you need a web camera, openCV, programming skills, a relatively powerfu PC and a lot of patience :D ",
