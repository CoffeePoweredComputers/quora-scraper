            "answer_text": "Sometimes you have to think before you act and sometimes you simply have to act. Simply act- do that for the easy things you encounter throughout the day. Toss the junk mail, put something away as soon as you are done with it and cleanup as you go. Other times it is best to think things out and develop a strategy to accomplish tasks. Difficult tasks are easier to do when they are chunked out in stages. You usually know what you are expected to do each day, week and month. There are things that also need to be done yearly as well. Find a quite place to think where you won\u2019t be distracted. Take a note book and pen with you if your phone is distracting. Jot down ideas to try out. Think about your responsibilities. Let your mind wonder and try out different scenarios. Most workers are either a morning or afternoon people- that\u2019s when they have their peak energy time. If you are able, that\u2019s when to schedule the difficult work. In some cases that\u2019s all you are responsible for, daily work assignments. Other times you will have weekly, monthly and yearly activities as well. For weekly tasks, set a time every week to do them. For monthly tasks and time consuming projects, break them into small stages and schedule them on your calendar. Hold yourself accountable for getting them done ahead of schedule if possible. Thinking and planning can make life easier. Find the fastest way to get things done to get the projects done satisfactorily. That means sometimes you need to think outside the box. Also, doing the unpleasant tasks quickly at the beginning of your day allows for a much nicer day. ",

            "answer_text": "To be efficient, is to reach a sought out goal in a way that uses the least amount of energy, time, and material you need to achieve the goal. There must be nothing wasted to have accomplished your goal with ultimate efficiency. There are several things that can be done to improve efficiency. Since everything done contributes to the efficiency of the process, I'm going to list a number of things that refine it. Focus on the heart of the task first. Getting the larger and potentially more difficult part of the project out of the way will set the stage for the following tasks. Plus it boosts moral.Maintain a thought out schedule. Set dates for when things should be done and do your absolute best to stick to it.Do not multi-task. This goes hand in hand with the first 2. Perform each step of the process to completion. Jumping back and forth between tasks will waste time.Learn from successes, as well as mistakes. This is pivotal in the grand scheme of achieving ultimate efficiency.Use appropriate communication. Everyone should be aware of what's happening. Also when it comes to communicating efficiently, sometimes less is more.Be sure to have all the material you need; whatever it may be. Do not waste any material. If there is a mistake made, do your best to repurpose the material.It is best to stay neat and organized. A cluttered environment makes for a cluttered mind.Break sections of the objective down even further into smaller tasks. Facing bigger projects can be daunting, and can lead to a sluggish and unmotivated work flow. It is better to feel accomplished more often with smaller tasks; this way every bit of progress can be appreciated.The strive to maximize efficiency will never end. There will always be ways to improve; even if it is in the slightest manner. Reaching ultimate efficiency is about putting the bare minimum amount of recourses in, and getting the absolute maximum result out. Working everything down to a science, and following through consistently with the routine is the best way to keep efficiency up. Doing this takes a great deal of attentiveness and effort. I find some irony in this because you are essentially putting effort towards putting the least amount of effort in. Sort of like your question. Using efficient tactics, to become more efficient, might result in a lack of efficiency. That would be like blazing a new trail, off the short-cut you already took, and only making it halfway there. You must put conscious and cognitive effort into maximizing efficiency. Be willing to make changes as parts of the project move, and as better techniques are discovered as you go. Time, energy, and the recourses that we need are all very valuable. We don't want any of that to go to waste, and we want to see the absolute best results from our efforts. The sensation of fulfillment and a job well done is a whole new value in and of itself. Thank you so much for reading my entry. I hope your find value in what I've written, and that it helps you maximize your efforts in all of your endeavors. -Garrett C. French ",
