            "answer_text": "What I feel is that .... IoT with Raspberry Pi is lot easier than with Arduino.If we are talking of IoT then having an easy access to internet is must, and we all know that how easily we can connect Raspberry pi with internet. Raspberry Pi eliminates the need of GSM/GPRS modules and thus save us from their complex interfacing instructions.Now people would say that connecting devices with Arduino is easier but the fact is that it is even easier with Raspberry Pi if we are well acquainted with python and raspberry pi's GPIO.

The only drawback is sensors can be easily used with arduino as compare to pi. ",
