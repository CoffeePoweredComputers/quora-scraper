            "answer_text": "Hello, If you work internationally or you travel every month or so, your United States number won\u2019t change at all. If people dial it - they will reach you. Wi-Fi incoming and outgoing calls should be free. As the calls will use packet switch and travel across the public internet to their destination, and do not have to travel across the global telecom network - you won\u2019t have to rent circuit to deliver your call, your voice call will transmit like every other piece of internet information (facebook status update, youtube video). If you use the Google Hangouts app you find no charges for calling USA numbers, and inbound calls from the USA. You pay a basic rate of $20 a month for unlimited talk/text in the USA, so calling your home country from Hangouts or via WiFi should be free. It may cost 20 cents a minute, though, as you\u2019ll be on a visited network. Google uses Google Voice rates for international calling. Google Voice: Calling Rates To be brutally honest it depends on how the call is route. If the call goes via the normal cell phone network route, it will connect to a G-MSC. This will then contact a HLR (a database with the location of every mobile in the network) and it will see you are in a different country. It will send the call to a international gateway switch, and to the roaming network you\u2019re using. The cost should be normal for the person calling you. If using the VOIP network, it will use a border gateway node. This will basically be the same if they called a landline in your city. VOIP lines are portable, but the phone network doesn\u2019t know if they have moved about. The charge to call your VOIP number when you are in the other country will be a normal, domestic fee. Long distance charges may apply, if someone has Plain old telephone service: if they live in Texas, you live in Georgia, they would be charged long distance as there phone provider would have to route the call to you via a Interexchange carrier, this is basically a long distance calling carrier.

            "answer_text": "Yes you keep the existing number. Call rates will be different from your home country. I am in the USA and get charged $20 for talk and text per month. The call rates could be from $0.01 to $0.20 depending on whether I make calls via WiFi or cellular network and the country I am calling to. If I call the USA from my phone through WiFi it would be free but for other countries there will be a charge per min. https://fi.google.com/about/rates/?country=IN ",
