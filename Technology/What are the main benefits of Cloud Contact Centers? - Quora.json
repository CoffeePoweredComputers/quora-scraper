            "answer_text": "Top 5 Benefits of a Cloud Contact Center 1. Improve customer experience All of the benefits of a cloud-based contact center ultimately come back to this all-important one: improving customer experience. Let\u2019s say your business runs an inbound contact center. Your customers are reaching out because they want something they can\u2019t find on your website or app; perhaps they need tech support or want to place an order. Regardless of whether they contact your business by phone, in-app chat, or via a social channel, your customers expect to connect to someone who can help them right away.  2. Scale your contact center elastically It\u2019s natural for business needs to shift over time \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t be constrained by your licenses and hardware. When you build a contact center using APIs, you can simply scale up or down with no penalties as your needs and use cases fluctuate. Ready to connect with your customers in new ways, such as in-app chat or video? Adding more agents to your contact center? Because APIs scale automatically, you\u2019re in control of creating the customer experiences you need to stay competitive. And you can do so with little to no telecommunications knowledge. 3. Add communications channels easily Digital technologies have changed communication styles. The majority of your customers would prefer to connect with your business in other ways besides the telephone. In fact, research shows that nine out of ten users worldwide want to use text messaging to talk to businesses. With API-based contact center software, you don\u2019t need to replace your whole system in order to add new channels like SMS/MMS or social messaging apps. Since APIs work like building blocks, you can add new channels to your existing contact center with ease. 4. Frequent iteration Great customer experiences are not built in a day. Chances are, your customers\u2019 needs and desires will always be changing and evolving. To provide an ongoing superior customer experience, you need to experiment, gather customer feedback, look at the metrics that make sense for your company, roll back the things that didn't work, and keep the things that did work. Ideally, you should test and measure the components of your contact center just like you do with your webpage or mobile app. 5. Global reach When you expand your reach to multiple countries and regions, cloud-based communications provides a deep local inventory of numbers and unrivaled reliability through global carrier connectivity. This allows you to skip the contract negotiations with carriers in every country in which you do business. Because APIs are based in the cloud, you can get instant multi-region connectivity and on-demand phone numbers from one platform. This global infrastructure lets you provide a local experience from anywhere in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t know already, cloud contact centers provide a level of flexibility not seen by premised based systems. Because the cloud isn\u2019t confined to a box. Rather, the features and benefits grow rapidly as the needs of the consumer changes.  What\u2019s impressed me is how simple or complex cloud contact centers can be. If you\u2019re a small team that needs to respond to the email and phone needs of your customers, it can be done. Organizations wanting to get sophisticated by adding social media and SMS channels can also do this with cloud based contact centers. For agents, the cloud has eliminated the need for specialized phones and software to field request. As long as an agent has an Internet connection and a device to receive calls (computer, tablet, smartphone, desk phone), they\u2019re good to go. Other benefits listed in no particular order: Work from anywhere enablementFuture proof scalabilityInteractions provides data for businesses looking to make more intelligent decisions to satisfy customersMaintenance freeIntegrates into existing business applications and processesIn addition to having the right team in place, cloud contact centers elavate the ability to deliver high levels of customer service. Which allows business to stand out from the rest of the competition and stay top of mind for consumers. ",
