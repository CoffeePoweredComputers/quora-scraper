            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve always been a collector. When I was a child, I collected stamps (it was the 1950s in Britain) and rocks. At one point I thought I would grow up to be a geologist (I didn\u2019t). When I was about twelve I began collecting coins, but they were really too high for my budget, even though I was collecting very basic ones. I did stumble on one amazing find: An anti-slavery token from the 1790s. I purchased in a saucer of pennies that took my whole allowance for the week. I remember protesting to the antique shop owner that it wasn\u2019t even a real coin and what was it doing there, but he just shrugged and told me there would be no discounts. I think he just wanted kids out of his store. Anyway, today it\u2019s a prize possession.  In my 20s I moved to the U.S. and became a citizen. When, in 2001, George W. Bush became president despite the fact that Al Gore had won the popular vote, I was incensed. To add insult to injury, I was living in Florida and it was all Florida\u2019s fault\u2014the whole hanging chad thing, if you remember. I felt personally responsible in some weird way. I was looking on eBay for something completely different and came across a 1920s figure of an American WWI officer. He\u2019s about 3 inches high, made of iron, and he has a clipboard in his hand. He looks worried. I identified with him. He was going to write a letter of complaint, or he was checking to make sure all his people were okay, or he was going to have to live with some repugnant order that he was reading. I liked him. I think I paid $8. Then I started looking at other American vintage toy soldiers. A lot of them were just regular guys doing mundane support tasks, like peeling potatoes or frying eggs, or they were radio operators, or trench-diggers, or banjo players. I thought they were charming. I decided I would only collect the peaceful ones. Then 9/11 happened and all the madness and horror around that, which has expanded outwards from the destruction of the Twin Towers. I began collecting fighting soldiers and nurses\u2014all made of lead or iron (I\u2019m too much of a snob for the plastic ones.) This phase went on for a long time\u2014I collected hundreds of them\u2014and then we began to see and meet soldiers wounded in Afghanistan and I began to feel differently about them again. The soldiers I have (due to the restriction to vintage only) were WWI-Korea/Vietnam, none later, but they seemed emblematic of everyone since then too. I decided, no more fighting. I put together a victory parade of marchers and bystanders that was actually based on various YouTube videos of the WWII victory parade held in London in 1946. As far as I can tell, there were parades in small towns across the US at that time, and a tickertape parade in New York, but nothing on the scale of the British one. So this is the parade that should have but never really happened. It honors all the people who fought a good fight for the Allies and wounded soldiers are among the onlookers. Nurses are marching as boldly as the men (as they did in London). It honors everyone\u2019s courage, the hideous waste of life, and the people everyone was marching for\u2014the fallen comrades as well as the hopeful children waving flags. Every period has a marching band, the Legionnaires are there, marines of all vintages, and WWI mounted cavalry. I don\u2019t have jeeps or other equipment\u2014the people are the point for me. It\u2019s poignant\u2014almost all those who would have marched as living people are dead now anyway. They worked and fought and died for their ideals. They had hideous experiences, they did terrible things, heroic things, mundane things. They forged life-long friendships. They were my parents or my friends. They had their limbs blown off or they had no visible injuries but debilitating PTSD. Each of my little figures stands for thousands of real people. It makes me love them all. They are marching all around my office as I write. I made a not-great video of them that is available on You Tube if you are curious.  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve answered a similar question on Quora, but I\u2019ll talk about a different collection than the ones I listed in that answer. When I was a child, I collected angel figurines. None of them were pricey, but I would often receive these figurines as gifts. Fast forward to my newlywed period. On our first Christmas together, my husband gave me a large M.I. Hummel angel figurine named \u201cHeavenly Angel.\u201d I had never seen such a beautiful angel figurine! When my birthday came around one week later, he gave me three small Hummel angels. These angels were the beginning of an all Hummel angel collection, which I never stop enjoying. They come in many sizes and motifs, but they are all beautiful, in all of their handcrafted wonderfulness! One of them is a clock tower which is also a real clock. Little childlike angels blow their trumpets as they lean out of the upper windows. The clock chimes on the hour, and I can choose the tune it plays should I wish to hear one. Now that many years have passed, I don\u2019t see Hummel figurines for sale very often anymore. That is OK, as my collection doesn\u2019t really need to get any larger. ",

I have over 300 in my collection. I have nothing ivory in my collection. My turle collection started about a year after I started to collect elephants. I mostly collect, sea turtle items of the 7 species of sea turtles, which like the elephant, ate extremely endangered. My 3rd collection is my Hard Rock Cafe pins, When I go on vacation, I look on line to see if there is a Hard Rock Cafe and I must go. If someone goes somewhere and the is a HRC*, I ask the for a pin. For example, my oldest sister's husband went to Germany for work and found the HRC and got me a pin. I started my collection with a pin from the HRCZ in TIMES SQUARE in New York City. I have close to 200 My last collection is refrigerator magnets, like the HRC pins, I get at least one magnet from the place I go to. That is what I collect. *- HRC is short for Hard Rock Cafe ",

I was listening to my radio when I came across some programs I wanted to keep. I bought a radio with digital tuning that could be left on and not drift then connected it to my VCR to record the radio programs at specific times. When the tape was full after recording six hours at half speed, I copied it onto cassettes. I went digital about twenty years later, downloading podcasts and listening to them first on my Palm Pilot then later on my phone. ",

I pick up the odd Mattel WWE figure. Depends on the wrestler. If GI Joe continued with the 25th anniversary style, that would be my collecting priority. ",
