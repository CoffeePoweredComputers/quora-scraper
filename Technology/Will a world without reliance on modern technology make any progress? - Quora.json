            "answer_text": "Q: Will a world without reliance on modern technology make any progress? Simply put, a world where we stop using our \u201cmodern technology\u201d is a world where we\u2019ve already surpassed the ability of our regions to sustain us. It\u2019s not just cell phones and Facebook. Modern agriculture depends heavily on technology, as do the transportation of goods and the manufacture of even basic necessities like preserved food and medicine on the kind of scale needed to support our population. So the only progress the world would make if it reverted to the (for sake of argument) 1800s technology would be to rapidly depopulate itself to reach a sustainable population. Problem is, as wars over limited resources and global famines raged, as diseases long reined in resurged and lifespans plummeted, what remained of civilization would undoubtedly regress further all the way back to hunter-gatherer and simple agriculture. That sustainable level of the global population would be a moving target, and the earth would be minus the majority of its humankind when it finally did hit it. For better or worse, we\u2019re married to the present and maintaining or increasing our technological sophistication is our best and possibly only path to the future. We\u2019re coming up on 8 billion people globally now, which means we\u2019ve almost doubled since I was born. That\u2019s a timebomb waiting to explode even in the best of circumstances, and limiting our current ability to provide for those masses in any way would simply be chucking that bomb into a fire and standing there waiting for it to blow.

            "answer_text": "It depends entirely on what you mean by progress. If you mean technological progress, then the answer is likely no. But there are plenty of ways to progress, many of which don't require technology. For example we could learn to not war, not have poverty, make people more free, have less depression and suicide, have clean food and environment, become happier, etc. Technology has arguably hurt our progress on all of these points. MLK Jr. summed it up nicely with his famous quote: \u201cOur scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men.\u201d ",

We are constantly being expected to text back immediately, respond to email, check social media and answer the phone everytime it rings. We don't need that. Before answering machines, if you called someone and they didn't answer it meant YOU had to call them back later because they weren't home or didn't want to be bothered. Your other choices included snail-mail and actually talking face to face. Life was good. Less pressure, less expectations. Now you have four or more communication paths to stay on top of.\u201dWhy didnt you go to the meeting?\u201d. \u201cYou didn't tell me\u201d. \u201cI texted you.

Ideally we (re?)learn telepathic communication, get rid of crime and take up bartering instead of currency. If financial or materialistic gain is a sign of progress, then the world would probably suffer due lack of verbal communication and data access. ",

In the Stone Age that would probably have been a stone, usually a flint, crafted into an axe, it might have been the wheel or a stick with a sharp pointed end. People will always rely on modern technology to make progress and if they don\u2019t someone else will. ",
