            "answer_text": "Attached is a link of another great answer to this question! : (Samy Mejri's answer to How do Apple fans feel about the company admitting to deliberately slowing down older iPhones?)* This is a reply to Roberto Santocho, who just removes any comments made on his answer, to make him seem right. He is clearly biased towards apple products and he is closed-minded, denies the people who are asking the questions to gain other people\u2019s insight on his answers. Thus, I am posting my comments as an answer, as some might find it useful\u2026 \u201cQ: How did Apple get caught slowing down iPhones? A: Apple did not get caught slowing down iPhones, you are misrepresenting an important, useful feature iPhones have the ability to slow down the processor Slightly when your battery is old and is dyingThis is a Feature to help you so you can get more life from your battery before it doesThat means that you spend Less money on battery replacement because each battery is lasting longerApple is Helping you by saving you moneyThe media read a report about this feature and the Apple-Hating media Misreported this feature, fooling people into thinking that there was a conspiracy to sell more iPhones, obviously this features causes owners to buy Fewer iPhones because they last longer, but the media fooled ignorant people and it became a huge headline a long time agoAn Apple hater filed a lawsuit against Apple (you can file lawsuits in the US for any reason, even if they aren't truthful, as is the case in this situation)The feature in iPhones is still there, because Obviously it is Useful and in addition, owners can simply turn off that feature if they want their battery to wear out fasterSome people actually switch their iPhones to low power mode because it saves a significant amount of battery power, so their iPhones last significantly longer each dayThose users report that they cannot tell that their iPhones are running any slower, so that feature is useful and is not intrusive in any wayThis has been explained many times before.\u201dApple do slow down older models to force users to upgrade to newer models. Many older models still have excellent battery life, thus there is no need to \u201cslow down the processor\u201d to extend the battery life. \u201cThis is a Feature to help you so you can get more life from your battery before it does\u201d This is simply incorrect since the iphones become incredibly slow and unresponsive rendering the phone useless anyway. It doesn\u2019t matter if the battery is still healthy or not. \u201cThat means that you spend Less money on battery replacement because each battery is lasting longer. Apple is Helping you by saving you money\u201d. Not quite, apple indirectly force you to upgrade/buy a new iPhone since the older model has been rendered useless by the software slowing it down and apps that are not supported anymore. \u201cThe media read a report about this feature and the Apple-Hating media Misreported this feature, fooling people into thinking that there was a conspiracy to sell more iPhones, obviously this features causes owners to buy Fewer iPhones because they last longer, but the media fooled ignorant people and it became a huge headline a long time ago\u201d. People will buy apple products no matter what the media says, that media outlet just stated the facts that a majority of apple users/ fanboys refuse to believe. \u201cThe feature in iPhones is still there, because Obviously it is Useful and in addition, owners can simply turn off that feature if they want their battery to wear out faster. Some people switch their iPhones to low power mode because it saves a significant amount of battery power, so their iPhones last significantly longer each day\u201d It must have a pretty small battery/ inefficient processor if the battery does not even last a day. I thought apple made such great phones of which the battery last for days. Why isn\u2019t the OS optimized to maximise battery life from the get-go? Apple only caught up with their battery size with the release of the iphone 10 and 11-series. Every iphone before that needs to be charged daily since its limited battery. What else do you expect from a battery that is less than 2000mah. \u201cNo, Apple does not slow down older models to make people buy new models. they slow down older models so little that no one noticed it for MANY years, so no one bought a new iPhone. They slow it down SLIGHTLY so that the battery lasts LONGER so you DON\u201dT have to buy a new battery. Get your facts straight, we just ignore clueless people like you.\u201d * Quotes/comments from Robert Santocho ",
