            "answer_text": "hello from the year 2020! Where you probably don\u2019t need me to answer this question anymore but I\u2019m going to anyways!!! Since you posted this question Oculus has released 2 headsets that can do this, but even better because you don\u2019t need a phone!! You don\u2019t need them to be plugged into any device to work! The newer model Oculus Quest, I would say is equal in power to the Oculus rift, is a little pricier than the other model I will tell you about but it is a fully capable standalone Vr headset that requires no crazy gaming computer to use. It can do almost everything a Rift can as far as I\u2019m aware. It is priced at 400$usd The oculus Go is a much more toned down version, it has one controller and can\u2019t play crazy games but it definitely can run Netflix and other streaming apps. I personally think it\u2019s a great sort of intro device into vr and you can do a lot with it for what it is. It is also priced at a very comfortable 149$Usd. ",

There are also vr headset apps that connect to your pc, which will also have support for netflix and other internet browsing features. The steam app \"virtual desktop\" allows you to use windows in vr - allowing you to play games, watch movies and more. ",
