            "answer_text": "I could tell you about what I would build if I simply had the resources such as my custom camshaft design, but that wouldn't be in my best interests and with current materials it is simply not good for too much anyway, so instead let's go and hear about what I assuming I had more engineering knowledge and resources would consider creating. I would probably build a nuclear fusion reactor capable of producing more electricity then it consumes using it's fuel. I would solve the neutron problem simply by hybridizing the design with the that of a gaseous core fission reactor and incorporating nuclear fuel into the lining as well to take advantage of the neutrons and prevent too much of that energy from being wasted. My design would most likely be some variation on the spheromak. Frankly rather than introducing such a reactor as is I would probably give the design to warring countries in a weaponized form ironically enough simply to insure that it would eventually see use in the civilian market after all hard to ignore something if too many people are being hurt and many civilian products were originally used by the military. You might argue that fissionable fuel would be expensive, but when you have a good neutron source such as deuterium and tritium fusion than becomes less of an issue as fission in nonfissile fuels like U-238 or Th-232 can be carried out via neutron bombardment.

            "answer_text": "I would have a GPS System set up to sync with all Traffic lights and Emergency Services. When an ambulance leaves a property headed for the hospital they would hit the home button on the Navigation system in the vehicle. That would then set the route and send a signal ahead of time warning all traffic lights that a Emergency Vehicle is approaching. The lights would have an extra colour light ( say purple for example) which would activate when the Ambulance was within a certain distance from those lights giving motorists enough time to move safely out of the way allowing the Ambulance to have a clear path through the intersection. This would save seconds, minutes all which are vital and could mean so many more lives saved as well as less accidents and confusion on the roads when an emergency vehicle is trying to get through the traffic to a Hospital or accident to save peoples lives ",
