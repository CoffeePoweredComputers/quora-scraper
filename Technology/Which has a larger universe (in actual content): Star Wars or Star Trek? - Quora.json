            "answer_text": "Objectively, Star Wars has a larger universe. Although SW only has 7 movies (thus far) plus the cgi/animated TV shows, the governmental entities in SW are on a galactic scale - the Galactic Empire, the Galactic Senate - indicating that the world of SW goes far beyond Tatooine, Hoth, Endor, Coruscant, Kashyyyk, Alderaan, Jakku, Takodana, etc. This means that there is a lot of content that has only been hinted at and has yet to be explored in depth. While Star Trek expanded to the Gamma and Delta quadrants with Deep Space Nine and Voyager, the area of these quadrants that was actively explored is quite limited. Even the Alpha and Beta quadrants, where Starfleet and the United Federation of Planets is located, are not fully explored in Star Trek canon so Trek cannot even claim  that half of the Milkyway Galaxy. However, due to five live action TV shows and 12 films (so far), Trek has probably shown the territory it covers with more depth.  The debate gets a bit fuzzier if you want to include books, comics, and other materials. Paramount and CBS definitively do not include any of the novels, comics, or video games as part of Star Trek canon (and there is some debate about other material like the Animated Series and even elements from the live action shows). Although there are official reference books for Trek, they pretty much exclusively reference the TV shows and movies. This is not true for Star Wars: Star Wars canon includes a number of novels, comics, and even video games. With this additional material, Star Wars is able to cover significantly more territory and go more into depth about it. All told, in terms of canon, I believe Star Wars has more content. If you want to include material that is not necessarily considered canon by these properties, the result is probably closer to a wash.  ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming you're referring to the scale of the actual universes, I'd say equal.  Both are supposedly set in the Milky Way Galaxy.  Both actually only show an infinitesimally small chunk of said Galaxy (which they should, galaxies are huge.) But both also tell stories that broadly flesh out or allude to the entire thing.  There are occasional mentions of extra-galactic threats, but they're deviations from the norm.  Given that these other galaxies obviously exist though, we can assume that the rest is probably out there too. If you're referring to the size of the works within each... Star Trek almost certainly wins.  But it's hard to see that as mattering too much in the grand scheme of things.  It's only by a technical fault that they're even considered to be in the same genre - Star Wars is basically a fantasy story told with spaceships, and as such gravitates towards sweeping vistas and fantastic concepts.  Star Trek is primarily a work of science fiction, albeit no longer the hard science fiction it was originally intended to be, and thus spends almost as much ink on explaining how things work as it does what they're being used for. The result is that Star Trek has a lot more depth to its worldbuilding while being considerably more focused on specific concepts and settings, while Star Wars accepts being more shallow in exchange for offering a greater breadth.  There's probably near comparable amount of material in both, but they look different enough that people could go back and forth arguing the point in perpetuity without really arriving at an answer!
