            "answer_text": "Hi, I would like to share a story with you all first. A couple of months ago I saw a post in a Facebook Group.  Can we save data from a WiFi Zone for later use? One guy was asking how he could save internet data while he was in a Wi-Fi zone so that once he steps out of the area he could use the data he saved onto his device. First, it sounded like a great idea. How great would it be if we could save internet access from a Wi-Fi zone and use it later when we are on the street where there is no Wi-Fi connection. It\u2019s almost like filling up your water bottle when you are near a fountain so that you have water when you travel to a desert. But it is not possible. Then how can we get free Wi-Fi? The easiest and socially-accepted way to get free Wi-Fi is to go to a restaurant that has Free Wi-Fi. But you must order something first to sit in a restaurant. If you are low on cash, you might try going to a public library, they have a free Wi-Fi connection. You can also spend a couple of extra hours at your university if you don\u2019t have internet access at your home. Every education institute has Wi-Fi connection. Can Elon Musk give us all Free Wifi?  A view of SpaceX's first 60 Starlink satellites in orbit (Image: \u00a9 SpaceX) Apart from building reusable rockets, Elon Musk also has plans for providing internet access to everyone on this planet. Project Starlink aims to launch 12,000 satellites into earth\u2019s orbit. This project will still take a couple of years until its fully functional. (expected the finish year 2027) Once its complete everyone on this planet will have high-speed, low-latency, and affordable internet access. This might also help us establish a universal standard for internet packs. But this project might not provide completely Free Wi-Fi for all. ",

            "answer_text": "There used to be dial-up services such as NetZero which would allow you to connect up for free. Some of these funneled a lot of ads to you, often to the point where the service was almost (but not quite) unusable. I am pretty sure all of these are gone, and even a 56Kb/s dial-up connection is going to be too slow for almost anything these days, even just reading email in many cases.You can have free Wi-Fi if you camp out at some place that offers it. Some, like Starbucks, will let you sit there all day. McDonalds will kick you out after a few hours. Your local public library might have free Wi-Fi and you are probably OK there all day. Your best bet there for \"Free Internet at home\" is to live over a shop that offers it and you are just their freeloader upstairs.I guess the next best thing is a neighbor that will let you camp on their connection.Final suggestion: I heard about a 20-year employee of a cable company that got connected for free. No, they aren't going to hook you up year 1, but maybe after proving how valuable an employee you are they will get you a free connection. ",
