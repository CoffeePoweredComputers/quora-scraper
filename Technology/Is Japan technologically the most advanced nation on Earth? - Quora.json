            "answer_text": "Japan has really cool robots and stuff, yes. You go to the museum of future sciences and you are left speechless by the things you see. But you would be surprised by how old-fashioned some basic stuff is. Offices still use fax machines and computers that look like the one I had in secondary school. Flip phones are still pretty popular. E-government is a joke. So while there is a lot of innovation, its applications in everyday life are not as numerous as you might think. ",

            "answer_text": "Japan certainly has the edge is a number of applications, but overall I would say no. The United States still leads in numerous fields - astronautics, aeronautics, pharmaceuticals, computers and AI, chemical research, and of course weaponry. But America often classifies a lot of its technology for the military, while Japan doesn't. That's why you see a lot more development in Japan. If the US released all the tech it's sitting on for civilian applications, the world would be knocked on its ear. ",
