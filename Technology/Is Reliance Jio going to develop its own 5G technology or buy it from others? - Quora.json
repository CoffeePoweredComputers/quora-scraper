            "answer_text": "Typically, mobile operators do not develop the technology they need. It is better for them to use technology developed by specialist vendors (Qualcomm, Samsung, etc); instead, they usually design their unique solution and get the technology they need from others. The primary reason is that it costs a lot of money to develop technology and the only way to justify the technology investment is to target all operators. Besides, the technology has to conform to agreed to standards, so an operator is better served by focusing on innovative solutions using standard technology from the vendors. ",
