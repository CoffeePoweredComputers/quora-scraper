            "answer_text": "The number of personal relationships an ordinary person needs to function in society is the lowest in the history of this planet. In an era where you can order groceries, manage your bank account and send people gifts online, it\u2019s nearly possible to exist only interacting through technology. You can restrict the number of people in your tribe to the closest family, neighbors and colleagues. There are people who have lived in their apartments for years and don't recognize their neighbors. There are people who work remotely, whose best approximation of work relationships is a Skype call. There are emigrants who see their families only a few weeks every year, if they see them that much. Facilitation? New technologies support shrinking personal interactions. They make life easier, but they make it also less sociable. Take, for example, the virtual shopping cart - it is a vehicle of economic trust. You don't need to trust the guy with the small website very much as long as he is connected with ClickBank, which guarantees your money back if you are not satisfied with the product or service you receive. The main goal of technology is to make life easier and perform daily tasks more efficiently. It does this job very well, but it robs you of the small opportunities to bond with others.  Technology also stepped boldly into the world of entertainment. Video games, movies, television: all are amazingly effective in eating our time alive.  I know something about this: I'm a computer game addict. Though I have largely curbed the problem, it is something that used to eat up a great deal of time that could be used for more enriching pursuits. Even as an adult with my many occupations - father, husband, church community member and employee with a three- to four-hour commute - I was still able to play more than 24 hours of Civilization IV in a month.   Games are everywhere. Mobile devices are more popular with each passing year and now you can carry your own entertainment center with you. It is easier than ever to be distracted at any time, day or night, at home or on the go. Attention span of a goldfish Nowadays, you have access to the whole world, but at the same time, the whole world also has access to you. It seems like everybody wants your attention: political parties vying for your vote, activist movements who want you to support their cause, charities who count on your generosity and companies who want your money. If your firewall is not raised very high, if you haven\u2019t cut yourself off from these unwanted messages, you are exposed to a myriad of communication, and each one eats a piece of your attention and your time. In effect, you have less time and attention for the people around you. All of those attention thieves make you more indifferent. These attention thieves alienate you further from strangers, makes them seem even further outside \u2018your tribe'. What is left of your time, you give to the close circle of people you know very well - usually your family and colleagues.  ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever wondered about the impact of technology on our relationships, whether they be romantic, friendly or familial relationships. Our dependence on social media and technological communication has to be changing the face of relationships and communicating, as we know it. The first major change that has happened within communication is that now we are able to communicate with each other at any time, there is no romantic wait for a hand delivered-letter, no waiting by the phone for a call from your date. You\u2019re far more likely to receive a text or an online instant message. This is somewhat positive, as communication is always important in a relationship, and technology takes some of the anxiety out of early communication, but it has also lost some of the romanticism, such as the butterflies when the phone rings. Perhaps less positively, technology and the advancing of social media and networking apps and websites mean that there is really no need to \u2018get t know each other\u2019, as, usually, all of the basic information about another person is laid out for the world to see.However, this does mean that you are both free to start exploring themore intimate details of each other, without having to waste time learning birthdays and number of siblings, etc., you can get straight to the childhood memories, the most embarrassing moments and the first loves. Whether this is a good or bad thing, depends on your personality. Perhaps the most positive part of technological advancement and the age ofsocial networking is the widening of your options. You can build friendships and relationships with anyone, from anywhere in the world. It is amazing to have a best friend , who lives on the other side of the world, who you met through a forum or social networking group, by discussing your passions and interests. Building international relationships really does broaden your horizons, and we have technology and social media to thank for that. ",
