            "answer_text": "If there is a disadvantage, it is that people no longer need to think for themselves or reason things out. I am reminded of the early 1970s when calculators were becoming common. So many feared that this would mean that kids would no longer need to know how to do things such as multiply (or subtract in order to figure out how much change to give back). These fears turned out to be valid, but the impact of this fact was minimal and more than made up for the speed (and accuracy) that the answer was made available. Back to your question. People don't have to think and reason to arrive at an answer - just Google it. But the benefit of this is that people are provided with perspectives that may not have occurred to them and include factors of which they were not aware. What now exists is a world where people need to determine the validity of what they see. People need to accept that just because most other people feel a certain way does not mean it is the best way. In some aspects, this means people need to do MORE reasoning, in a different way, and not allow themselves to be sheep. The world has been transformed by information technology, and only those who can adapt to it will adjust properly. ",

            "answer_text": "If the computer system shuts down, power fails or you get a virus, then every computer in the school is shut down. This can ruin lesson plans, it costs a lot to fix and to install. If school admin is on computer systems then if some kid mucks about in ICT and downloads a virus, then school records can be lost. There are concerns of over reliance on technologies (children using spell check for example, rather than practising their own spellings), some parents are cautious as to what their children are exposed to (for example if children are doing research tasks they are often given a free roam - the school can filter most websites but bits and pieces still get through), the actual productivity levels of what is expected from an ICT lesson is questionable - a lot of time is spent keeping children on task. It is also interesting to see the disadvantages to children with SEN. Some students use laptops for longer writing tasks in class, and the go on to really struggle in exams as they are not used to writing long pieces. Also, some SEN students find it very difficult to multi-task their time for example, watch a video and write notes at the same time. The amount of actual learning that occurs in those sorts of lessons is not always clear.  There is then also the administration system side of a school. All contact details and medical notes about students are kept on an ICT database. Any power cut or problem on the system can leave a school in a very vulnerable position. ",
