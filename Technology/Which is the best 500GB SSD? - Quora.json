            "answer_text": "Looking for the best SSD for gaming? In this video, we\u2019ll break down the top SSDs available whilst comparing them for price versus performance. Before we get started with our video detailing the best SSDs for gaming on the market, we have included links in the description for each product mentioned, so make sure you check those out to see which one is in your budget range. 1. Samsung 860 EVO.  Samsung may arguably be most famous for its Galaxy phones today, but this Korean giant also manufactures some of the most popular SSDs out there, in addition to its wide selection of other products. First, we will be taking a quick look at an immensely popular SSD of theirs, and one of the most popular SSDs in general \u2013 the Samsung 860 EVO. This SSD is pretty much what you would expect an average NAND SSD to look like \u2013 clean, minimal, with a thin 2.5-inch frame and a matte black finish. The 860 EVO comes with a total of five storage options: 250 GB, 500 GB, 1 TB, 2 TB, and 4 TB. It also has a 540/520 MB/s read/write speed, which is extremely fast when compared to hard drives but quite average for SSDs in this league. Finally, it interfaces via a SATA III connector which is the standard for a lot of internal SSDs available today. All in all, the 860 EVO is not the very fastest SSD around nor is it fit for professional workstation users, but it is more than adequate for gaming. The 5-year warranty that Samsung offers for this model is quite encouraging, too, though, at the moment, there are newer SSDs available that can actually offer customers better value for their money than the aging 860 EVO. 2. the Samsung 860 QVO.  Following the Samsung 860 EVO, we have another newer yet very similar SSD, and it\u2019s the Samsung 860 QVO. Unsurprisingly, the QVO looks very similar to the EVO, although it trades the matte black exterior for a simple-looking gray one. Performance-wise, it lags behind the 860 EVO a bit, but what makes it stand out is its storage capacity. Namely, this SSD really pushes the envelope when it comes to the kind of storage capacity that we can expect from mainstream SSDs. The 860 QVO comes in three storage variants: 1 TB, 2 TB, and 4 TB. As for the performance, it offers sequential read and writes speeds of 550 and 520 MB/s respectively, which is more or less the norm with NAND SSDs that interface using SATA III. As stated previously, what makes the Samsung 860 QVO stand out is its capacity and pricing. Considering that SSDs as small as 240 GB or even 120 GB was the norm a few years ago, seeing Samsung offer an SSD that starts at 1 TB and costs just over $100 is quite something. However, it isn\u2019t as fast as the older 860 EVO in practice, despite the on-paper specs being identical, though this difference is negligible at best when it comes to gaming. Our only real issue with this SSD is the relatively short warranty period. Usually, Samsung offers a warranty of 5 years on their SSDs, but the 860 QVO gets only 3. Needless to say, if you had your eye on a higher-capacity model that you wanted to last in the long-term, this limited warranty period is hardly encouraging. PLEASE UPVOTE IF YOU LIKE THE BEST SSD ",

            "answer_text": "As far as performance and reliability is concerned, Samsung has ruled the top end for several years now. However, some NVMe makers have begun to match Samsung as of late 2018. These include, unsurprisingly, WD Black and the ADATA XPG SX8200. My order of preference for 500GB NVMe from the best regardless of price would be: Samsung 970 ProSamsung 960 ProSamsung 970 EVO PlusWD Black SN750Samsung 970 EVOADATA XPG SX8200 (480 GB)Samsung 960 EVOIntel 600PSamsung SM951ADATA XPG SX8000Mushkin Pilot Pro EnhancedI have highlighted the models in bold that often offer the best value when they are on sale. This will change daily, but the XPG and the Mushkin Pilot can often be found for less than $90. For me, it is difficult to recommend any SATA SSD as a \u201cbest\u201d option when all of the NVMe drives listed are about six times faster than a SATA SSD. However, if I were to recommend a SATA drive it would be either the Samsung 860 EVO or the Crucial MX500. ",
