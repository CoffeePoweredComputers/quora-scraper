            "answer_text": "No,it is not possible for any brand to do so if we are talking about a liberal economy. Any brand has a Brand personality with which they attract their customers and connect with them. For Apple,it is about sophistication and competence.That is the market segment that relates with Apple and Apple do own a large chunk of that segment. But there are other segments too.For some,money may be the deciding factor.Some people may go for relatively unknown brands if they are offering a similar product at cheaper rate. What we see in present day world is cutting edge competition because of the innovations that take place on a daily basis.So,it is even a challenge for Apple to retain the segment that it owns.For that also,Apple needs to innovate on a regular basis. To own other segments,entirely new and different stretagy with regard to product,policy,promotion and marketing will be required. So,I don't really think it is possible for any Company to own everything. ",
