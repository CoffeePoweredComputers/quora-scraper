            "answer_text": "CryptocurrenciesDid you know that there are worldwide around 200 government issued currencies (Dollar, Yen, Euro..), but over 5,000 cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin, Dogecoin are just two of them.I learned that at a Bitcoin conference a year ago, and it was just mindblowing. Back then in the first three months of 2014 VCs had already invested $90Mio in cryptocurrency startups and it was expected to reach $700Mio for 2014. The reason is simple: many banks make tons of money with exchange rates and fees for money transfers. Sometimes, when you send $100 into some unbanked countries, only $30 reach the person you wanted to send the money. Also it's ridiculous that it takes several days until the money is there. Financial ServicesHave you ever used a service such as e-Trade, Ameritrade or Charles Schwab? It's full of jargon, three-letter-acronyms, charts, numbers, and can be very off-putting. Such tools require from you that you are very familiar with the financial market and the instruments. But this is depriving people who are professionally successful, but not at all interested in learning the intricacies of finance to not use those tools. It's no surprise that 80% of users of such platforms are men. So we leave out large parts of people with money.The reason for that is that banks think they are the center of the universe and everyone knows about this stuff or is eager to learn about it. Not true. The people designing such systems are not all using empathic design methodologies such as Design Thinking. Instead of putting the financial jargon in the center, they should focus on the financial goals or better \"dreams\" that people have and that they can achieve through saving. Thats why we came up with a design that changed that completel: we called it Pinterest-style FinancialsA pinboard is nothing else than a savings goal, and every pin represents a thing to buy with a price. Such as buying my first house. Each pin is then movers, furniture, kitchen, house, other expenses and off you go saving. InvestingCrowdfunding like with Kickstarter etc. has been disrupting the venture capital industry. Some great startups don't need VCs anymore, they just get funded from outside. Banks are not involved in lending, as private people start lending (e.g. LendingClub). NoteI am of course biased. The financial services industry and the financial crisis from 2008 has shown that banks and financial insitutions are not adding value to societies and economies, but actually deeply destroyed it. The livelihoods of millions of people have been destroyed. And all that because they lost their epic missions. Not helping people realize dreams and keeping the economy liquid was their goal, it was just their own profits. From an intrinsic motivation to an extrinsic one. And this is never working well. I am very much looking forward of getting them disrupted. They are ripe for that. ",

            "answer_text": "Customer relationships and experiences are being changed by disruptive technologies across various industries and banking is among the ones taking the most out of it. In order to keep up with their customers, banks need to take note and get to grips with the latest tech trends. Some of them are: AR/VRFor banking AR/VR could mean higher workforce performance and more meaningful customer engagements. AR can help increase workers\u2019 productivity by helping salespeople view and analyze large quantities of data faster, thanks to more intuitive AR interfaces. For customers, VR/AR technologies can redefine their relationships with banks and also serve as a time saver. This the growing popularity of online banking app and digital-only bank, eventually customers who can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to visit bank branches, won\u2019t have to. For them, AR technologies will soon make it possible to have person-to-person virtual meetings with bank officers from the comfort of their home or any place in the world. AIArtificial Intelligence is probably the most popular tech trend to be discussed in the banking industry and other financial sectors. It has been making headlines and stirring debates about its potential to cut countless jobs. Indeed, countless companies have been guilty of making shocking predictions about the number of its employees to be replaced by AI. Deutsche Bank chief executive went as far as to predict that half of the bank\u2019s 98,000 staff will be replaced with robots. Whether any of these predictions are anywhere near the reality only time will show. But today AI has made a very prominent place for itself in the banking industry. A recent survey shows that 79% of bankers believe that within the next two years AI will work alongside humans as a colleague, advisor, collaborator. Design ThinkingOne of the freshest trends to raise in the banking sector is Design Thinking. With numerous fintech startups popping each year, the banking industry has little choice but to adapt to the new startup culture and start thinking like one. That\u2019s where Design Thinking can help. Having little to do with only aesthetics, its focus is more on how the product works, helps customers and solves their problems. Design Thinking achieves its objectives by applying design principles to the way people interact with the world. The process involves trying to understand a customer\u2019s behavior, a way of thinking and behaving (empathy) in order to get to the bottom of their problem and see if there\u2019s a common issue among numerous users (definition). It allows total freedom for brainstorming (ideation) to see through feedback on your prototypes to see which of the crazy ideas work and which don\u2019t (prototyping) and finally verify your assumptions with real people (testing). Big DataFor the banking industry, where banks have traditionally possessed large amounts of important and confidential information about their clients, partners, services, data security is especially important. 84% of bankers that took Technology Vision survey concur that their organizations rely heavily on data to drive automated decision-making. At the same time, 77% of respondents note that most organizations are not ready to face the implications that come with corrupted insights, bad decisions, and possible compliance failures. BlockchainBlockchain has been stirring innovation across various industries and banking is no exception. Nine out of ten banking executives say that their bank is currently exploring blockchain use. Blockchain allows to track every transaction and provides accurate information from any point in the network. When fully adopted by banks, it will allow sufficiently quicker and accurate payment processing at the same time reducing its cost. And as the technology further develops and matures, it has the prospect to replace banks\u2019 legacy systems in the future cost-effectively. Banks are already expressing strong interest. Right now banking organizations are at the early stages of adoption, either focusing on developing their blockchain strategy or working on the proof-of-concept. Some of the banks are wasting no time. The Central Bank of India created a league out of firms that are responsible for 80% of financial transactions in the country and used blockchain for interbank transactions. By sharing distributed ledgers between institutions, banks can provide faster access to funds for their clients as well as more efficient processing and as a result, save some money for themselves.

FI\u2019s are also able to extend their service hours and serve more people with less employees. For consumers, video banking provides more convenience and the ability to bank more when they want and how they want. It gives the experience they need. The problem with most video banking solutions is all you can do in a video chat is talk. You can\u2019t actually get anything done aside from building a relationship. That\u2019s where POPin Video Banking comes in. Alongside the highly engaging video connection, you have the ability to collaborate and actually get business done utilizing POPin. That means CSRs have the ability to screen share, co-browse, share presentations, request documents (drivers license, w-2), review and sign contracts all while in a face-to-face video chat. This can take place in the branch, on the consumers home computer and even on their phone. Basically anything you can do in a branch visit you can do using POPin with the exception of dealing with cash.  Imagine visiting a branch in the palm of your hand\u2026 that is POPin. ",

            "answer_text": "Banking and financial services are developing at a break-neck pace faster than any other industry in the world. A lot of it is mostly because of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and automation. These two sectors of the economy can impact and benefit the most by AI and machine learning tools. Artificial Intelligence in the finance and banking sector is one of the most technological trends that bring about total revamping and help in the renewal of industries.

            "answer_text": "Omni-channel banking - Until the early 2000\u2019s, customers had multiple channels available to do their banking, namely the traditional bank branch, ATM\u2019s, online and phone banking. But these channels were limited, they were unable to complete a task by themselves and required customers to refer to another channel to complete an action. This left customers with a disconnected service experience as banking channels were incapable of interacting with each other. Today, with the advance of technology, there are significantly more devices available for customers to do their banking activities. This, together with rising customer expectations is leading many retail banks to move toward an omni-channel approach. By utilising this strategy, banks ensure the continuity of their customer service experience. This means that all the channels available fit together seamlessly, giving customers the ability to start a transaction in one place & finish it in another. Omni-channel is all encompassing, so whatever device a customer uses to perform an activity, there is a way to complete it on each channel & also continuity between each of the channels. ",
