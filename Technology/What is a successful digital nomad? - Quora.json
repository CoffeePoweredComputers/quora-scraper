            "answer_text": "On a philosophical level, I\u2019d argue that a successful digital nomad is someone who is happy. Many of the influencers you see on social media, etc are doing what they do to impress others and if you pull back the curtains on their lives, things may not be as perfect as they seem. However, all that aside a successful digital nomad could be thought of as someone who has earned their freedom to be able to work and live in the location of their choosing (or has the financial freedom and location independence to travel to the countries they want). This works in levels. In the beginning, digital nomads may only be able to travel to countries or cities where they can afford to live in on lower budget (ex. $1000-$2000 a month). But as earnings increase, so do options. I think you\u2019re successful when you have options to design your life in this manner as you wish and aren\u2019t restricted as much by finances or time. ",
