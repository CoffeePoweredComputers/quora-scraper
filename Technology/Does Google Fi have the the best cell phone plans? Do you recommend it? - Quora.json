            "answer_text": "It depends greatly on what you want from your service. For my particular desires it's fantastic. It is a cheap way to get comprehensive coverage (Sprint + Tmob + US Cellular at a minimum) if you don't use much data. Or, if like me, don't mind a nudge to not use it when there's a whole world out there to otherwise experience. International travel is cheap and seamless. And obviously it'll fully support whatever Google's next phone project is, which I usually end up buying. Also I'm philosophically in favor of what it represents technologically\u2026 that your phone \u201cjust works\u201d on whatever network is available, which should really be a thing regardless. **Previous answer said that the coverage was nowhere near Verizon\u2026 well, your milage may vary, I've had coverage in places I previously struggled with Verizon and AT&T. Now it wasn't an A/B comparison since time had passed between experiences, so take it for what it's worth. I've also consistently had better signal in high density environments like concerts and sporting events than I've ever had before (and I've used everyone for at least 6 months). Again it wasn't side by side so it's purely anecdotal. ",

            "answer_text": "Google fi uses the better of cellular ( Sprint, T-Mobile, consumer Cellular) or wireless connections. This means that I get great service anywhere there is wireless coverage for less than 30 dollars a month. It also means that I get no coverage on the roads in many locations in CT. I often go without coverage for many miles including large sections of CT state highways. If you don't need coverage everywhere you go, then fi is a great choice. If you need coverage like Verizon offers then fi is nowhere close. ",
