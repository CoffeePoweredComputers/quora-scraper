            "answer_text": "Is this a new condition for an old phone? If so, you may need a new battery. Typical smartphone batteries last 1\u20133 years depending on your use. There are some good answers here, so I\u2019m not going to repeat everything. Let\u2019s take a look at what eats a phone\u2019s power the fastest, and see if you can at least understand what\u2019s going on. First is your cellular modem. A typical phone can transmit at very low power, or it can transmit at 350mW or more. When your phone transmits, the cell tower analyzes the power it\u2019s receiving (dubbed Receive Signal Strength Indication, or RSSI) and instructs your phone to increase or decrease transmit power, depending on how it\u2019s being heard. You have no control over this. If your signal strength is weak, 1 bar or less, you might see your battery dying before lunchtime in a typical day. At full power, you might well have a 75% charge by the end of the work day. It\u2019s that important. What can you do about it? Not much. Turn off cellular and just use WiFi, if its available. Change carriers. Bring a big USB battery or get a wall plug and keep your phone charged. Next one is your screen. After the celluar radio, the screen can be the biggest power hog. To save power, dial down the brightness, or at least set it in auto-bright mode. And finally, what do you do with the phone? If you\u2019re playing games, that\u2019s going to eat phone battery. That runs the CPU faster than normal, kicks in all some or all of the high-performance cores in your multi-core CPU, and turns on the GPU. There\u2019s nothing you can do to reduce high power use of your phone other than to not run the higher power applications, or only do that when plugged in.  Use the battery meter (or whatever the equivalent of this is in your OS, if you\u2019re in the 20% of the world that isn\u2019t using Android) and see how your phone\u2019s power is being used. This will help you find out where the power is going, and at least understand what you need to change to save battery power. But you still may need that charger or extra battery. If your cellular signal isn\u2019t strong where you use the phone, the phone will die fast. ",

WiFi will use a lot of battery power trying to connect to poor WiFi signals.Reduce the frequency of your apps sync to a minimum.

You may be able to work round problems by installing alternative, more frugal apps. These can replace the ones you don\u2019t want.

            "answer_text": "Hi, thanks for A2A. It is possible to reduce battery draining problem. All you want to do is keep some regular actions in your smartphone. Keep in mind that battery problems are happened due to your charging method, usage of phone. 1. First keep your eye on while charging your phone . Do not let it to dry. please charge your phone before it dies. 2. Plug off your phone after it reaches 100%. Do not leave it in charging, after it is charged. It will make heating problems which is harmful for batteries. 3. Use your phone as far as you can until it uses battery saver mode. 4. Do not plug in your phone when it has 40% or more. Just maintain charge between 40 to 80 %. It will help to prolong battery life. Once in a month let phone switched off and charge it. 5. Do not expose your phone to extreme cold or heat conditions. 6. Kill the apps that you do not use frequently , after you used it. If you left as it is, then it will run in background so that battery will drain quickly. Closing and re opening of the app that you use very frequent will demand more power from battery which causes little more draining. 7. Reduce screen brightness to your vision power. 8. Deactivate vibrate options in phone calling, notifications etc. 9. Deactivate Gps,location settings in your phone. 10. Do not play movies often in your phone. 11. Always keep your wifi, bluetooh and mobile data connections in off state after you used. 12. Restrict unwanted apps running in back ground. 13. Reduce volume to the extent that you can here clearly. 14. Clean cache files regularly. 15.Disable auto downloading in whatsapp and other social networks. 16. Disable auto updates of apps in playstore. 17. While downloading use high speed net instead of 2G or 3G. 18. While surfing use low speed net such as 2G or 2.5 G. 19. Reduce screen lock time in mobile. 20. Disable special features like shaking phone to turn on screen or double tapping, and camera opening by special accelerative methods. 21. Do not play games often. Do not use heavy size apps. Hope it helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, Draining of battery is a serious problem in the smartphones. Hence newer smartphones come with a better battery and you can always switch over. Meanwhile you can try these options Check the open apps and try as frequently as possible to close unwanted apps. You can also use apps such as Cleanmaster or Greenify.If not using JIO or other 4g services, change your network to 3g or 2g. This not only ensures a lasting battery but also helps in coverage in areas where 4G network seems to drop often. You can always turn back to 4G when needed. Keep all accesss to internet off when not needed. You gain some you lose some.Keep your screen brightness as low as possible for you. I would also suggest keeping Auto-brightness on, always.Since Li-ion batteries do not lose their quality so quickly, the best way to keep them useful is to charge them as often as possible. You can learn more here : Charging Lithium-Ion Batteries. But do remember to discharge it full once a month for optimum performance.While charging your phone try to keep it on Airplane mode if you can afford so. Time is money.You can always convert to battery saving modes which are being provided in all recent smartphones.These are all the things that come to my mind when talking about conserving battery. Keeping your phone in room temperature also helps. And yeah, do try to keep your homescreen and lockscreen as dark as possible. I know it isn\u2019t much but everything that helps is good. And for the sake of battery please do not use animated wallpapers. May the charge be with you. ",

For AMOLED DisplayIf your phone have an AMOLED or any LED display use Pitch Black Wallpapers or similar dark wallpapers. Because in LED displays for Black pixels it means LED is OFF.   Turn OFF GPSTurn your GPS ON only if you need Precise location keep it OFF other times. GPS drinks hell lot of juice out of battery.  Sync-OFFTurn auto-Sync OFF. But be aware if you turn it OFF e-mails don't arrive and Contacts and other datas won't be synchronized automatically unless you sync it manually. This includes backup process of contacts and other settings.  VibrationTurn OFF vibration for touch interactions and other things. Every time your phone vibrate keep in mind that a motor is running inside it.   Time-OutKeep your screen timeout as minimum as possible. The more the screen is ON the more battery is drained.   Keep it UpdatedKeep all your apps updated regularly. All the apps are given updates for better performance that includes minimum CPU usage and power usage.  Disable Stock appsIf you own an Android phone, your ROM might be having some unwanted apps which you may never use (excluding apps that OS rely on). You can disable them in app settings.   Battery SaversNever use any battery saver app unless it is recognised and used by the developer community. Such apps may harm your firmware.   Android UserIf you use an Android phone, you can get the best juice out of your battery by getting SU Access. For that you need to Root your phone (It voids warranty).If your phone is rooted try any custom ROM, custom Kernel, change I/O schedulers.  PS: Rooting your phone not only void warranty but if you screw up something it  might result in bricking your phone (It can only be used as a toy). ",

Your eyes will get damaged if you turn it brighter, you know? Adjust accordingly when you're outside.Turn off WiFi & mobile data when not in use. Focus on your life more than others.Close apps properly. Take note that social apps (Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp) & some graphic-intense games are running on the background even though you press 'Back' button. If you wish to disconnect, close it by swapping out from 'Recent Apps' or force close at Settings section.Turn off Bluetooth. Maybe you forgot to switch it off after using that hands-free.If your phone has AMOLED screen (usually found in Samsung devices, please check on your phone's retail box), use dark or black wallpapers & screensavers (if available). The pixels on your screen will not light itself up if it's dark.If your phone starts to heat up (usually when playing games), exit from your games/apps and let it cool down. Your battery is draining faster when it's heating.If you feel the battery is depleting faster than usual, replace it. Insist on original ones. You don't wanna let your phone explode in your hand.Finally, don't use your phone if it's not necessary. Find another hobby...Thanks for A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone has said pretty much everything, so I'll just jot down the points they missed.   Go to Wifi->Advanced->And uncheck 'Scanning always available'. Google Android keeps checking for Wi-Fi networks even when it is switched off to give better location based data. Unfortunately this keeps your phone always awake even you've switched your screen and Wi-Fi off and drains juice like anything. Unchecking that box will solve it though.Check for apps that force your phone to stay awake and manage them accordingly.There are apps in the market that alternately switch off and switch on your internet to check for notifications after every certain period of time when the screen switched off. Additionally there's also a Night Mode included in these apps that switch off the internet entirely at night when screen is off.Don't charge your phone with chargers with high ampere output. Usually a 1A-5V is preferred. Not more than that. Slow charging is good while fast charging can be dangerous for the battery. Do not bump charge the batteries.Hope this helps.  :) ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, Thanks For A2A. I don't really consider myself a know-it-all person but I know this about smartphone battery and believe me, this thing works : 1) The number 1 and the most influential tip that nobody gives you on how to retain battery life is by using a slow charger. (please try) This is how it works, so when you charge your smartphone, you might charge it using a really fast charger, let's say it's 2A (find that out in your AC Adapter, by looking at the Output meter there), get a slower charger than that, I recommend getting a charger of 550mA to 1A.  The longer it takes to charge the smartphone, the longer it develops the capacity to retain that charge. I've had my own experience with it, as well as I have read that on multiple scientific papers. I have a Samsung Galaxy S5, which comes with a 2.1 A charger which charges the device in an hour and half approximately and gives a decent backup of more than 8+ hours, but when I use a Samsung charger rated 0.7A, I get a noticeable difference of +2hrs. But, it also charges slowly taking 3hrs to get a full charge.  This has been my experience with charging my smartphone and likewise, sharing it with you today I really want you try this and please reply to this answers so as we all can know is this for true. I will keep updating this answers as I get more insights to it, and also I am looking forward to making a explanatory video about it, explaining as why this happens but before that I need feedback, if this works, we might help people on this.  Thanks for taking time on reading this. :) ",

Go to settings and unlock the developer options.You can now set your phone on power save mode and accordingly choose the processor mode too. This option can be found in many phones very easily amd is bery useful.2. Also there are a few battery optimising apps than completely optimise the battery but require rooting the device which is not preferable for people who do not know very well how to flash or ropt the device.3. You can always reduce the maximum frequency of the processor,  this would also decrease the heating of the cores. P. S.  A little performance has to be compromised. 4. Maintain battery from 15 to 95%... Generally considered to be best for li-po batteries. ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on how old the device is you might want to see about having the battery checked to see if it needs replacing. Most batteries only have a 3\u2013500 cycle count before they start to need replacing. That is about 2\u20133 years of normal usage, about a full charge or less every night. If you are draining a fully charged battery and then recharging to full and draining it again then you are using two cycles in that one day. Therefor shortening your cycle count before it needs replacing. A simple thing to go by with smartphones is to limit background activities. Not having social media apps on your device is one way, limiting their use and not allowing them to run in the background is another. If you are gaming on your phone then plug it in when you're gaming. The battery is a replenishable item just like the tires on your car. How you use it will depend on its lifespan. You can also turn down the brightness, the display is one of the biggest power draws of you smartphone. If you have the brightness at full on a 4K screen at 120mHz refresh playing Fortnight then no wonder the battery is draining fast. ",

Once the cycle limit for the battery is reached, battery is over heated while charging or pretty much anything to do with the battery no longer having full capacity can not be fixed by any method. Lipo/LiFe batteries have a useful life span, once that cycle limit is reached they degrade very quickly. Once this happens it it irreversible. Charging while too cold/too hot can also impact the lifespan before they start to degrade, sometimes it wont happen instantly, it can impact the cycle limit. Short charging is bad for you battery. By this I mean charging when battery percentage is above 20\u201330%. Or \u201ctop up\" charging where you top you battery up a little, not complete a full charge cycle will impact the amount of full charge cycles before degradation sets in.

I have noticed app like UC browser and Shareit runs in background and drain battery a lot.Always charge you battery properly. To do that always use the proper charger provided by the manufacturer. Always charge your battery when it is at 15% or below and never unplug the charger until it is 100%. This makes battery life longer.If you have phone with OLED display, use dark theme and wallpaper.Finally avoid excessive use of smartphone, It will save the battery and your eyes.",

To get a better understanding of what makes your battery tick, go to Settings > Battery. If you find apps on this screen that are using up more battery than they should be, close them by tapping Force stop. Also, check out this AVG report on the apps that drain the most battery - you may be running several of these on your phone. If you want to go into more detail about your smartphone's battery usage, you'll find a number of apps in the Play Store that provide statistics and detailed information on battery consumption. We recommend GSAM Battery Monitor. Once the app's installed, it takes a couple of days to gather data on your smartphone and battery usage, then after that it'll give you a great overview over what's using how much battery on your device.

The next best thing you can do is to turn the brightness down. The screen is by far the biggest user of the battery, the brighter your screen the more battery it takes. If you have an oled/amoled screen. You can use a lockscreen or desktop background that is mostly true black. This is because for those kinds of screens they only turn on the pixels that are currently in use. And to make a true black pixel they turn it off. So if your background screen is 90% true black, then it's 90% shut off, and 90% of those pixels aren't using electricity to make light. ",

Batteries that that charge in a very short time are approaching open electrically. That means they have vented losing precious moisture. As soon as that moisture is gone they will no longer take a charge at all. This goes for all batteries; lithium, Nicad, even lead acid if you fast charge them and the charge controller is bad they will vent water and electrolyte if left on past a complete charge. I question if the charge controller is bad. Have the phone serviced and give them a description in writing of the problem specifically ask them to replace the battery and check the charge controller. If the phone is under warranty or on a contract you may get it fixed free. If not check NetFlix there are some who advertise there that they will fix them for 50% of a new one. Remember it is a good thing to take any device off charger if it is charged. ",

Continuous charging, and charging upto 100 does not degrade the battery life, but usage of the battery completely like 5% will make the battery life degraded. do not use any of the battery saver apps. make sure that the screen on time is less, it will certainly help the battery life.

If apps still keep running, you can stop them in the settings. Prevent them from popping annoying notifications, 2. You could switch on battery saver mode. In more extreme cases, you could turn on a plane mode (you could even faster charge your phone like that), 3. Make your screen brightness automated, if possible. Or change that from time to time in need, etc. ",

Almost all battery problems can be traced to one of two things: The battery is at its end of life and no longer has an adequate capacity.One more applications are running in the background, sucking the power out of it.There are tools available to help you diagnose this. Use Google to find them. If you still have problems take your phone to an authorized service center for the brand of your phone and have them run a diagnostic. ",

It could also be that your phones battery has been damaged by over charging or being used while charging. Check to see that your battery is not swollen. If it is then get a replacement. Another reason could be that too many apps are runing in the background, brightness is too high or you are conected to wifi or mobile data. this functions drain the battery very fast so look out for them.
