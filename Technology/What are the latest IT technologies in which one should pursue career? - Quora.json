            "answer_text": "Top jobs for pursuing career include anything in big data, mobile development it can be ios or android developer , cloud computing, Front end developer etc. Mobile Application Developer - \"Mobile is the biggest factor changing IT right now,\" says Stewart Tan, vice president of information risk management and security at Accretive Solutions. \"Building mobile apps, architecting mobile strategies, and securing those devices\" are the top concerns facing the enterprise today.Based on the listings showing up on IT employment sites, Tan's words sound almost like an understatement. One of the most common new titles we've run across on IT job sites sounds more like a general cry for help than an actual job listing. In response to the flood of new mobile devices, companies are desperately seeking \"mobile technology experts\" to bring order to the chaos.If you have serious IT experience deploying and managing fleets of BlackBerry, Android, and iOS devices, there's ample work ahead. The listings we've reviewed consistently seek people evaluate mobile platforms for enterprise use, research and draft device specifications, and support users and developers within the enterprise. As data of websites sites are getting huge day by day some other post are also coming like Data scientist  Bigdata - that is, the glut of unstructured or semi-structured information generated by Web clickstreams, system logs, and other event-driven activities -- represents a huge opportunity. Buried in that mountain of data may be invaluable nuggets about customer behavior, security risks, potential system failures, and more. But when you're talking terabytes that double in volume every 18 months, where do you start? That's where the data scientist comes in.On the business side, data scientists can open up new opportunities by uncovering hidden patterns in unstructured data, such as customer behavior or market cycles. On the dev side, a data scientist can use deep data trends to optimize websites for better customer retention. Within the IT department, a skilled data scientist can spot potential storage cluster failures early or track down security threats through forensic analysis. Cloud architect Ask IT managers whether they're \"in the cloud,\" and they'll tell you they always have been. To them, \"cloud\" is just a trendy way of saying \"data center.\" But with business executives and investors now tuned into the cloud concept, demand is growing for IT pros who can lead the charge to deliver on the increased efficiency and agility promised by the private cloud.\"There's so much positive momentum toward cloud integration,\" says Ron Gula, CEO of Tenable Network Security. \"People who can really identify the architecture from a simplicity point of view are going to be in demand.\"In our searches of tech job listings, we turned up dozens of calls for cloud architects, with the majority originating from enterprise IT organizations. Most of these listings call for familiar skills and certs associated with networking, virtualization, and SAN design. Without question, the more advanced your understanding of virtualization networking and management, the better your chances. The ability to explain how your private cloud will increase visibility into IT costs is a big plus.In addition to establishing and managing a private cloud infrastructure, Gula says cloud architects will increasingly need to be experts in choosing public cloud services. \"When you get into the nuances of SLAs, you become less of an IT person and more of a lawyer,\" says Gula. The ultimate goal is the hybrid cloud, where cloud architects and business management decide which cloud services make the most sense to run internally and which should be farmed out on a pay-per-use basis.Gula says any business depending on outside companies for significant chunks of cloud infrastructure needs a cloud expert capable of taking on the odious challenge of deciphering the terms of a license agreement to assess the veracity of any service provider's guarantee. These skills will prove critical in risk management, which, according to both Hill of Dice.com and Ripaldi of Modis, is another rapidly growing IT field. This are the few latest technology in which one can pursue career.Good Luck. ",
