            "answer_text": "The language of mathematics is huge. There's an unlimited quantity of mathematics yet to be developed.   Even so, computer programs can be written to eventually spew it all out. Such a program would, however, spew out the bad with the good, and there's a lot more bad than good.  What's bad mathematics?  Anything that's uninteresting, and the uninteresting kind far outweighs the interesting kind.   For example, write down any complicated function at random.  Let it involve trig functions, logs, exponents, roots, composition, etc.  It's almost certainly uninteresting.  Although symbolic integrators might be able to give you its integral, that will be even more uninteresting.    What determines what's interesting?  In part, that's a matter of personal taste, but there are some common themes.  If the mathematics can be applied to science or other parts of mathematics, it can be interesting.  If it's a question people have looked at for a long time, it's interesting.  If it's something new, but when you show it to mathematicians and they consider it interesting, then it is. Can a computer program tell what's interesting math?  That's a question for the experts in Artificial Intelligence.  If you let the decades keep on coming, then the answer might eventually be yes. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think so. In a very meta-circular way, my reasoning for this depends on what might be the most important open question in mathematics and computer science. Does P=NP? I won't necessarily go into too much detail here because it's covered so many other places but the implications of P=NP are huge. Effectively, any problem to which a computer can recognize a correct answer \"quickly\" belongs to the set of NP problems. Any problem that a computer can actually generate a solution to very quickly is a member of the set P. Proofs to mathematical theorems are the primary creation  of mathematicians and these problems belong to the set NP. Once a mathematician has given me a proof of a theorem, I can easily verify that it is true, possibly with the help of a computer, in a very short amount of time. Creating said proof, however, requires an amount of creativity that has alluded computers. If P=NP these proofs could be generated in an automated way which would likely put mathematicians completely out of business. I don't, however, think that this will ever happen because the vast majority of people who have studied the topic believe that N does not equal NP. ",

The race will in the end be won by the rational computer, provided the irrational humans do not cause the end by destroying the natural resources and ending the evolution of the computers. Sciences currently use the mathematics with no realization that there is no requirement that mathematicians utilize scientific method, without it there no chance that sciences will be done rationally. Only a very few mathematicians throughout history have confined themselves to rational mathematics. Mathematicians have invented a branch of mathematics which they have coined as irrationality, which was done with the use of irrational logic called absurdity. The only hope we have of surviving it is computer science, because computers will not function if irrationality is allowed in their operation. Physicists employ the irrationality of mathematics without realizing it does not conform to scientific method. This is why computer science is now outpacing physics:?( Buckminster Fuller is turning over in his grave because humans are still not aware Mother Nature can not construct a circle, nor can she construct a continuous line, the computer is not allowed to attempt a representation of a continuous line. Irrational numbers are alway replaced in their program by some symbol the programer conjures up. If that is not done the computer goes crazy and crashes. ",

But we haven't been able to develop an computer or robot that is intelligent enough to be creative enough as humans, to think and to discover which is why currently people like scientists and mathematicians cannot be replaced buy computers and robots, but if we are able to create an intelligent computer that is able to innovate and Discover then that will be the invention of the history of mankind where robots in computers will be able to do everything and the only thing that will be remaining for humans is the rest. But that day is far and we need to research a lot to reach that so I think if you are able to do that then yes computers can replace mathematician but for now I don't think they can. ",

In other words, if you would reduce mathematics to calculations, then the answer could probably be yes. However, mathematics is much more than this. Mathematics is a creative act, created by humans and progress in mathematics is made by creative human who come up with novel solutions by a trial-and-error process. This aspect of mathematics would be very hard, if not impossible to replace with computers. I don't know what will happen in the very long term, but I don't see AI replacing this kind of intelligence within the next 30 years. The importance of computers in mathematics will almost certainly increase, but they will not replace the human factor. ",

I bought a new LG phone, and I can see that when I talk in English, French...provided that its connected to its \"brain\" (cloud), it can understand 90% of what I say. I have a strong french accent but the cloud's brain is already superior to 90% of Britons as far as it concerns understanding my approximate english. Also, computers are already excellent at heuristics (chess), can solve formal equations... anything that has some form of algorithms or logic is by definition at the computer's reach. Worse, for \"intuition\", understand \"exploring parralel thinking through branches\", computers are superior to humans. Any relation to the description of the beauty of the nature (forms, curve...) is also at reach for computers. What is left to the human is \"his\" needs: he develops maths on the basis of what he needs to describe. Is it possible to explain to computers xhat sort of maths is useful, and how to sort out and deliver to humans the maths that are useful to us? ",

If you think that mathematicians spend their days evaluating integrals, determining derivatives, calculating sums, products or differences, and solve equations, you are wrong. Those are things that a computer can do, and we're glad that computers are taking over the tedious part of mathematics. The beautiful part of mathematics is the discovery and proofs of new theorems by synthesizing together other established results. Until a computer can start doing this effectively, it's safe to say that mathematicians will not be replaced by computers anytime soon. ",
