            "answer_text": "There are multiple ways to make your 3D-printed parts tougher - both tensile strength and toughness. 1. Increase shell width What is the shell width? The shell is the number of perimeters going around the edge of the print. It has been tested and proven that it is more efficient to add more shells than to add more infill.  2. Infill You may know that increasing the infill density will make the print stronger, but you may not be aware of the different types of infill. It has been tested and proven that cubic infill is the best infill because it is a type of 3D infill.  3. Increase layer height It turns out that there is a trade-off between strength and quality. Thicker layers prove to make a stronger model, but thinner layers make better quality by hiding layer-lines. This is because more filament is pumped out at once making thicker solid lines going throughout the model.  4. Print settings If needed, a brim or raft can help prevent a model from warping and/or give you a levelled print surface. Always remember to have a method of priming the extruder - print a skirt or line prior to starting the print. Good Luck! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Print Quality Guide the above page is generally considered the go to for most of us when trying to solve problems in print quality but a couple of gems below will help as well. a well built, maintained machine is the best start, make sure the frame is tight and square, place cushioning under it to absorb ringing and reduce noise.slower prints help quality of the outer perimeter, i make this adjustment within the slicer, my perimeters print the slowest and is easily noticeable when watching a print.quality filament, make sure its not soaking up humidity, that its good a good even diameter all the way through (you can visibly and tangibly tell pretty easily when a filament is going to be rough, and can usually turn down the flow rate a bit to compensate but avoid these rolls for quality prints)",
