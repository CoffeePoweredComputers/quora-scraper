            "answer_text": "Some reasons to not buy the laptop would be: The applications that you use regularly do not have a Mac version or equivalent.You do not need the hardware prowess of the MacBook Pro.You are looking for a laptop to game exclusively, in which case a MacBook is a wrong investment.For you a computer has no more utility than reading a PDF, browsing the web, and typing documents and making spreadsheets, then the MacBook Pro is overkill and you will be satisfied with something at half the price.Otherwise I see no reason to not but it if it is within your budget. I do not buy the price argument, since any equivalent computer costs about the same or more than a MacBook Pro on the Windows side, e.g., Razer Blade Studio, and Lenovo ThinkPad P Series. A solid aluminium body, 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports (which is at least 1 more than any other device that I know of), i9\u20139980HK, and a decent AMD GPU costs money. Lack of ports is an issue, but if you are looking to spend MacBook amount of money on a laptop, a dongle is a small fraction of it. If you need to use Windows occasionally for casual gaming or something, MacOS has Boot Camp to allow you to have MacOS and Windows in dual boot. ",
