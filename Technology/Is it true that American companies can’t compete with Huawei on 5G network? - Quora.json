            "answer_text": "Competition has numerous facets: competition in terms of price, price/function quotient, delivery, spare parts, support, etc etc. As far as what goes now, Huawei is the leader in 5G, full stop. I think more than enough has been said and countless questions on this topic has been raised in Quora and answered. I see no need to repeat what others had said. For any country to adopt non-Huawei 5G products means intentionally setting back the development of the country with implications on job numbers, companies going bankrupt, layoff, political instability, going down the competitive league, the best place to do business leagues, etc. As I had said in other answers: China is using 5G to help in its effort to fight the Covid 19 and Huawei has done the work brillantly, supporting doctors in Beijing to discuss cases with doctors in Wuhan and treat patients via 5G. Such would not be possible if the virus occurs in other western cities. ",

American companies invented cell phones and cell data and gave it all away to the rest of the world for freeThen American companies moved on to innovate new technologies before 4G was deployed, so there is no interest in building commodity hardware today",
