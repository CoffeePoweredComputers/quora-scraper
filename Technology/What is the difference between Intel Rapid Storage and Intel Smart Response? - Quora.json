            "answer_text": "In Broad Sense,RAID is a collection of algorithms by Intel which helps in using your hard disk more efficiently to increase security, reliability, & performance as well. Though they claim that even Desktop users will benefit from it but they didn't described how. On multi hard disk configuration, this technology helps in increasing the performance by simultaneously accessing two or more drives to fulfill a single task.eg.Suppose you need to access a single file of very large size, then instead of retrieving the whole file from a single drive it will instead access chunks in parallel from all the available disks thus reducing read or transfer time. SRT:It is more like a cache management technology which helps to make & store cache of frequently used data or bits to a higher speed storage in order to reduce the seek time for the same. ",
