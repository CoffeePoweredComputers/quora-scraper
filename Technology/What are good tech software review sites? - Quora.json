            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been researching social media management platforms lately and found Capterra, G2 Crowd, and GetApp to be really helpful. PC Mag also posts reviews, which I\u2019ve used in the past, but I find user reviews to be the most helpful when trying to decide between solutions. Users will give you a straight answer and really dig into all the minor annoyances, favorite features, etc. because they use the tools on a daily basis. A few awesome features you\u2019ll find on those three review sites are: G2 Crowd\u2019s G2 Grid, which maps out all of the different software options in one grid by leaders, high performers, contenders, and niche solutions (based on user reviews). It\u2019s also a great way to see all of your options in one place rather than running a Google search and sorting through several software review articles.Being able to filter solutions by different factors like price, star rating, etc. I like being able to easily look at the negative reviews to see why a user disliked a solution. I have to say, though, some of the negative reviews lack depth. These sites claim to have strict guidelines for reviews, but I\u2019m surprised a few of the reviews were approved.A quick view into the Pros and Cons of each solution.A rundown of the feature set for each solution, which is often scattered about on vendor sites.",
