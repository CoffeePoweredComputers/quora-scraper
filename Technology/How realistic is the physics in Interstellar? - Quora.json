            "answer_text": "33+8 collapsed = 41 answers, and nobody pointed out the pink elephant in the room. So, here goes. The black holes, white holes, worm holes, stuff is bogus. Not every physicist realizes this yet, so, please be aware that what I am going to say is not totally accepted yet. But, it is not just my perspective, either. It is a growing perspective within the physics community. There are many ways to go about dealing with this, but since everyone here is raving about Kip Thorne\u2019s book allegedly proving the physics is correct, let us use his best work on the subject:  Kip Thorne\u2019s decision to call it exotic matter is illustrative of the sort of mentality he has. He is implying there is \u201cmatter\u201d with negative energy. As an example he implies that the Casimir effect proves that negative energy exists between two conductive plates.. While it is true that many physicists thought that the 1948 paper by Casimir and Polder proved the existence of vacuum energies pressure me use that bible itself to show the problem. Here, in his beloved book he describes someone like the protagonist Joseph Cooper entering the black hole in the movie:  Let\u2019s just read the green underlined text. Consider Murphy. She is Cooper\u2019s daughter, left back on doomed planet Earth. Based on the above text, and really any knowledge of black holes, from her perspective, before Cooper enters any black hole, she has to experience an infinite amount of time just for Cooper to get to the event horizon, let alone get past it. The point is that before Cooper gets to the event horizon, his daughter is dead of old age. The Sun explodes too. For sure, Cooper can\u2019t come back out of it and see his daughter alive, since she already died before he even entered the black hole. It takes eternity just to get to the edge. I guess the problem within the black hole physics community was that they for some reason have an issue with realizing that Einstein was wrong. He wrote that all reference frames are OK to solve problems in. The problem with this is that other reference frames do exist. Specifically, our universe does exist. And so does everything in it. If you use another reference frame, namely Kruskal\u2013Szekeres coordinates that has our time going past infinity in it, as Misner and Thorne explained in their book which I read in junior high school, you aren\u2019t doing anything related to our actual universe anymore. It is just wrong. At best, it is fantasy. That\u2019s the problem with classical black hole physics. And, the error is made very clear by this movie and the fact that it was blessed by a so-called GR physics God that everyone else is either too mentally weak to see as wrong or is just too afraid to expose. Anyway, this is why there cannot even be singularities in the first place. They would take forever to form. There are just these black hole-like objects. It\u2019s a technical question if they should be called black holes or not, but real physicists who do GR simulations of their formation will agree that they are largely frozen in time with smooth mass density functions; there is no infinite density as viewed in our reference frame, and assuming our universe exists, there\u2019s no way to form a singularity. Kip\u2019s papers and books are wrong. To summarize, if you think physicists like Kip are right about black holes, then OK, this aspect of the physics is correct for you. But, historically speaking, sometimes physicists have disagreed. And, good physics are unsure of many things. And, sometimes they change their minds, and think they were wrong. In this case, I think Kip is wrong, but so is a growing sector of the physics community, too. I attempted to published this result back in 1983, but the paper was rejected. Since then, other physicists have published similar papers, but there is a lot of politics on this hot potato, so it may take time. Some get it. Some don\u2019t. To me, it is plain as day, and I think anyone intelligent who reads this post objectively will understand. One thing I was very happy about was that Kip didn\u2019t lie about the past. Their views have not been altered changed. (When confronted about the time dilation issues, some other physicists I spoke with would try to downplay and rationalize things by claiming, \u201cWell, you\u2019re right, but everyone knows this doesn\u2019t really happen that way, etc.\u201d) The movie solidifies the problems with black hole physics, and hopefully it will help speed up the rate at which people realize that most popular views of black hole physics are wrong. At the very least, physicists can use the movie to make their points, just as I did here. That\u2019s just the problem with the black hole. The movie is actually largely based upon a worm hole, which is different. The worm hole as idealized has a different problem. To construct the worm hole used in the movie, there would need to be something Kip and others call exotic matter. It is matter with a negative mass. Many physics, me included, do not thing exotic matter can ever exist. Kip and other \u201cpro worm hole\u201d physicists have written several papers the primary purpose of which is to argue in favor of exotic matter being possible. However, many physicists, me included, view these papers as mere hand waving arguments, not rigorous proofs of anything substantive. Thus far, matter having a negative mass has never been observed in any laboratory. In my own opinion, worm holes cannot ever be constructed, and I\u2019m not alone in my opinion. I missed much of the movie, so I won\u2019t comment on too many other physics issues with it. It is just too old, and there are already other answers here addressing many of the other errors. But, a few of the more glaring potential issues: NASA scientists are not backstabbing jerks. Sorry, the fight in the movie is unlikely to happen. Sorry this isn\u2019t a physics issue. It is more of a science issue. The tides. You\u2019d get tidal locking in no time, and it would be dry or wet, not shallow and then super deep. As I wrote, I missed the first part of the movie but I didn\u2019t get why some equation solution encoded in Morse code saves Earth. It is tempting to point out that fixing whatever environmental issues we have is much easier and more energy efficient than moving light years away, so the core plot is also probably unlikely for this reason. But, I don\u2019t mind this since that\u2019s what allows lots of good SF, and of course there are reasons to go out there regardless. If Cooper can move the watch second hand, he can directly interact too. So, he can just encode a computer text file, which takes less force, or probably even pick up a pen and write it all out. Whatever it is. (I didn\u2019t see him deriving equations, so where is he getting anything?) Then again, I think his daughter would have been dead and he could never get into the worm hole let alone out, so I guess I will stop here. Despite all this I thought it was a good movie for Hollywood, albeit a little dark. Upvote, follow, and share to spread the word! ",

            "answer_text": "To a good extent! We don\u2019t know about the rest. (below content is highly scientific) .1.Red shift  Every planet shown in it were tanned to some red color, because of the Gravitational red shift. Below given is the google image for the red shift formula. The last one on your right is the formula.  .2. The miller\u2019s planet can exist! I saw many people below commenting that how, for science\u2019s sake can a planet exist this close to a black hole thanks to tidal effects. That\u2019s where i say that it can exist, not because it was suggested by kip thorne or anything, nut it\u2019s due to the concept of ISCO or Innermost Stable Circular Orbit. For black holes, this is the innermost orbit region where it is possible to find something stably orbiting a black hole. As the black hole\u2019s Angular Momentum increases, this region decreases. So that might seem to support you but think about it. If this is the innermost stable orbit, Miller\u2019s planet must be on some other level of stable orbit or simply put, Out side Gargantua\u2019s Ergosphere, where such orbital concepts are possible. Also it\u2019s orbited by some un-named Neutron star that can cause overall gravitational balance to it.  .3. Accretion Disk It\u2019s just more of a proof. It\u2019s accretion disk isn\u2019t leaving any jets or GRB\u2019s because it hasn\u2019t gobbled up a star for millions of years( it\u2019s disk color say\u2019s it all). So that can allow un-hostile conditions to exist near the black hole system. .4.Tidal Effects The waves at miller\u2019s planet and Hans Zimmer\u2019s brilliant music combined together, gives chills right? Now some might question such large tides, but mathematically, and for your luck, by Newtonian mechanics itself, gravitational tides concept has been proved. Being near a black hole can cause such effects. .5. Time dilation Since miller\u2019s planet was near a black hole, being in it\u2019s gravitational well caused the massive time dilation. Also the planet had to have some high amount of mass to survive those effects ( God helps those, those who help themselves). So all of this can be combined to get the time dilation. Also when cooper orbits Gargantua, They get so close that yet again time dilation shows it\u2019s work and 51 years pass. All these are accurate. .6.90% Black hole stuff The back hole stuff like photon bending in the gravitational field(Gravitational lensing effect) and By calculations of Kip Thorne, Gargantua is about 100 million solar masses, placing it firmly as a supermassive black hole. Furthermore, it is an edge case in that it's somehow spun up to maximum minus 0.00000000000001 of the maximum, dragging space around it as it did so. Several of the visual effects were toned down severely from what it would actually look like; the event horizon would be warped and red and blue shifted. Miller's planet would have been under the level of the accretion disk and the event horizon would have covered 40% of the visible sky. By those same calculations, orbital transfers to Miller's would likely require slingshot maneuvers around intermediate mass black holes at both the start of maneuvers and at the end, as the energy requirements seemingly preclude other methods of getting the required energy. Partially alluded to in movie by the short reference to a neutron star being useful for slingshot maneuvers. \u201cBut yeah even i felt uncomfortable with cooper not dying in a black hole, but we don\u2019t know what\u2019s in one. So leave it or take it. Upto you\u201d -Neil de Grass Tyson. and i share it too. But black holes being used as a wormhole was the idea of a genius and i didn\u2019t really see that coming. .7. Wormhole Wormholes can exist theoretically and mathematically, their existence is proved. It all comes from General relativity.  It might seem really weird and complicated at first sight, but remember what does it appear similar to?\u2026\u2026 The black hole metric. Yep. This is called the Wormhole metric and Einstein found it and declared that this solution was indeed free from singularities and hence was free to traverse through. It was shown accurately (At least from the outside i believe).  Now let\u2019s deal with the people\u2019s complaints. Some were complaining on why does the movie have a former NASA guy on farming and human\u2019s technology stuff , firstly they showed that human race has advanced but not that much that it could undo our effects(the effects done by this generation).Also the farming stuff was done for a reason which can be clearly understood if we watch the movie. If you didn\u2019t in case, understood why, he did so because there was food scarcity and also NASA was officially shut down by the government. So cooper was left to farming, as the world needed produce. Again some people down in other answers were like \u201c Why did they want quantum gravity\u201d and blah blah blah stuff. If you want to know, consider 2 things, one that the earth is about to end and second is that you need to send billions to some system far away from earth. Still don\u2019t get it? Look at the budget of sending astronauts to space. Sending someone to space with food that lasts for few weeks is already in billion that too for a group of few people. So if they reconciled quantum field theory with gravity and marry gravity to the standard model of physics, we could understand gravity and then easily learn to control it. That means reducing the cost and efforts to lift billions off the planet and save them. Then i saw someone saying that couldn\u2019t the scientist find someone to talk about this in 40 years. Firstly he belonged to NASA and it was undercover and he was in a wheel chair and NASA\u2019s location was secured very tightly ans it was a secret. So hardly a chance that he could find even find a new student, let alone a worthy student. Even if he could, he would have talked some relevant points that the student could have discussed about. Its not even of a big issue.  Then someone said that The movie\u2019s Exo-planet science was Sh!t. Why ??? provide the reason. Nevertheless, I would provide my reason on why it was top notch. I have described Miller\u2019s planet. Coming to Mann\u2019s planet, the planet does have 67 hour-long days and 67 hour-long nights. No surface was ever found, in fact, the planet is honeycombed with seemingly endless layers of frozen ice-cloud crevices and mountains. Dr.Mann surmised this from the sublimating ice clouds, which, after a while, would totally evaporate. Therefore, the clouds must freeze and evaporate repeatedly, which Thorne believed could be caused by the eccentricity of Mann's orbit. The planet's gravity is 80% of Earth's gravity. It is so cold that even the clouds are frozen, giving the disconcerting view of vertical mountains. While the planet has water and an atmosphere, it is thick with ammonia, making it deadly to breathe. Probably surface atmosphere is able to breathe due to low altitude. The surface temperature is not cold enough to be fatal instantaneously during the day. I do believe that these arguments giver by Kip are accurate. Nextly and finally, let me deal with this famous Higher dimensional beings problem. It\u2019s not real! It\u2019s how Cooper conceives them. What my theory says is that basically while cooper falls into the black hole, time is so severely dilated, that brand reaches Edmund\u2019s planet, develops a civilization over there, with them figures out how to control gravity and Brand and her beings place such an effect in the black hole. Since control over gravity means control over time, it could be equally true that Cooper traveled across the Space-Time dimension where time became literally a physical force. That\u2019s where the strings came from to move the hands of the clock.  After this, it\u2019s just the wormhole concept which helps Cooper move to a time before he even entered the hole, because of the Tesseract. The tesseract was set by that time thanks to brand to make sure that Murph would make it through and humanity would survive. That\u2019s all what i have to say. Many other things could have happened for plot sake, so don\u2019t take this seriously and enjoy it. Whenever people hear the name Nolan or scientific accuracy, they go all in it. Like it\u2019s a lot of pressure. Tell me how many good movies you guys have watched that doesn\u2019t obey many of physic\u2019s laws. Like in which world can people survive car blasts, drive bike over skies, and survive so many impossible situations in action movies. In so many movies you ignored it. I know the 5D thing seems a bit new, but it\u2019s not complete scientific accuracy, but it\u2019s called creativity. Whenever anyone shows creativity, You guys go all out for his talent, his team\u2019s hard work. Then why not his? Why always target Nolan? I dont get it why, when nolan shows his creativity , You guys search for sense. Doesn\u2019t that mean that for same cases you are showing different justice to different people. This movie was a masterpiece but it\u2019s appreciation was largely overshadowed by it\u2019s haters who came with things with simple logic and no science stuff while they can watch someone else make flying car blasts and flying persons and guys from planets making their way by flying, and appreciate it. It\u2019s called Showing partiality. With this i would rest my case and rest is left upto you guys. I am not any astrophysicist but i aspire to be one and i am studying it side-by-side with my education and i plan to pursue it too. But yeah this information is accurate aand the higher dimensional human\u2019s thing is my theory(already stated). Thank you guys and may you have a nice day or night, from wherever you are reading this. And for those who are saying that wormholes and black holes aren\u2019t real(seriously i saw a comment saying that black holes are way too absurd to believe. I mean \u2026seriously), remember this: \u201cSpace is larger than anything known to mankind. There is always something out there waiting to be discovered, Waiting to be studied. It is eagerly waiting to reveal it\u2019s body\u2019s secrets and as a curious breed of organisms, we have a duty to investigate about it.\u201d Some objects that are yet to be discovered by us are: Quark starsworm-holesNaked singularitiesUniverse\u2019s largest Super-cluster\u2019s cosmic web shapeIntermediate Stellar Mass black holes.Exo-planets with lifeGuys all i want to say is\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Space is so large that even objects beyond are wildest imagination exists. Interstellar is just a trailer of them. Also, Don\u2019t worry, I too believe that love being a dimension was crappy but that was it\u2019s only fault. ",
