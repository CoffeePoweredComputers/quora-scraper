            "answer_text": "1. The new banking generation: Monzo, Revolut, Starling Bank. All founded around 2013-2015 and now being valued at over $1 billion valuations. These apps are revolutionising the way we bank. Their advantages against the big banks are their zero fees e.g cash withdrawal abroad and payment in a different currency, higher interest rates on savings and 24x7 contact chatbox. Monzo, Revolut and Starling Bank have raised, respectively, $324M, $837M and $400M up to date.  2. Getaround Airbnb for lending cars. Most of us use our car for the journey to work only and the car is parked there for the whole day. What if you could lend your car to others for a fee? You'd save money on parking and revenue extra cash for lending your car for people who need renting a car for a few hours. Well, that's what Getaround do: Rent cars by the hour from people around you. Founded in 2009, Getaround have raised $403 M up to date.  3. zeux: 5% interest rate being promised Zeux, a UK financial institution has launched Easy Access Money Pot, a mobile solution which gives app users 5% interest AER. (This is up to 25x higher than some high street banks saving interest rates). The Easy Access Money Pot, your savings account alternative, is guaranteed by two financial institutions, Zeux Ltd and Wecash. The way Zeux has set up its savings-like account is widespread and popular across Asian countries, and works in a similar way to Alipay\u2019s \u201cYu\u2019e Bao\u201d. As it was founded in 2018, Zeux has only raised $2M so far, but its tech is truly promising. With the money raised from average investors (app users), it applies to Asian loans where interest rates are much higher than in Europe. It takes the difference as revenue and then returns 5% to the lenders from the app. It's pretty much a hedge fund open to the public. Finally, it also does what every other digital bank like Revolut, Monzo, Starling bank does as well as facilitating cryptocurrency transactions.  4. Stockpile Founded in 2010, Stockpile enables you to gift stocks, or like they enjoy putting \"The gift that keeps on giving\" and charge only $0.99 per trade. They allow you to buy gift cards of specific stocks e.g Nike, Apple, Tesla for a fraction of the cost so that you can give away 1/3 of a Nike stock so that you gift $30 rather than $90. It also enables parental control over the account when gifting to underaged. Stockpile have raised $45 M up to date and has no real competitor! Stockpile operates in the US only even though it's has already been around for 10 years! I asked via email if they had any plans to come to the UK and the answer was no.  5. Robinhood Robinhood, founded in 2013, have raised $1.2 Billion and is coming to the UK as its next target. They are is a commission-free platform. They don't charge you fees to open your account, to maintain your account, or to transfer funds to your account. They make money by the spread when you buy and sell an asset. What that means is in return for executing buy or sell orders, Robinhood will charge a difference between the bid price and the ask price for the trade. The difference between the bid and ask price is the Robinhood's spread. Companies like Schwab and Fidelity have followed suit in the US and are now also commision-free.  6. Drover Founded in 2015, raised over \u00a37.5M. Drover makes car ownership digital, flexible and all-inclusive. You can rent a car for a month or more on a subscription basis, all digital. Most of its clients are Uber drivers who actually don't own their cars, but rent from Drover instead.  Conclusion Most startups are based on the sharing economy enabling everyone to create extra revenue streams. They are also driving down costs very steeply which is great for us consumers but it also means that disruption has never been more present. ",
