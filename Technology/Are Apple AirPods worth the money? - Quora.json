            "answer_text": "I didn\u2019t want them. I\u2019m anti-wireless when it comes to my audio. I\u2019ve been using the wired EarPods for a few years now and have found them very pleasant to listen to when corrected by a 20 band EQ and using an audiophile music player that provides 32-bit float high resolution software support. I found them very impressive for $30 once you flatten the frequency response a bit. So my logic for awhile has been \u201cThe AirPods and EarPods have a very close acoustic design. I don\u2019t see the benefit in going to the AirPods at their price with the cost being significantly higher.\u201d And what did I end up receiving as a gift this Christmas? You guessed it! A pair of Apple AirPods. I didn\u2019t jump on using them right away. Once I was back home at my apartment, I finally decided to set them up. Once out of the box and charged, I started testing tracks. I noticed the sound was actually a bit better than the wired version! Then I tweaked the EQ a bit more. It got even better! The sound was noticeably more open than the wired version with a clearer midrange and better low frequency response. They could handle a slight boost in low frequencies where the wired version had to be taken down a bit to keep from muddying up the sound slightly. Then, once they broke in a little bit they sounded even better! Now if Audio quality isn\u2019t super important to you, let\u2019s talk about using them. So far my experience using them has been great. I\u2019m coming to appreciate the convenience of wireless headphones. The charging case is a very nice design. The pods drop in and stay put with magnets and charge them when they are low enough. As long as your Bluetooth is on, they will instantly connect every time once you put them in your ears. If you open the charging case near the phone, it will also connect independently so it can tell you the battery life of the charging case. So if I go to pull out my pods with BT on, once the lid opens an image appears on the screen indicating the battery life of both the case and pods. The image for the case disappears when you close the lid. When you place the pods in your ears, a pleasant tone comes out informing you they are connected. I have had no issues with connection cutting out and the range is surprising. Battery life is very good and I\u2019m just charging the case now after a week and a half out and about. If you are the type to leave your headphones in your ears all day, you will be charging the pods and case more often. I only take mine out when I plan to listen to music or take a conference call. I thought the price wasn\u2019t worth it at first, but my mind has been changed. The overall quality is very impressive. And to all the people who crap on Apple\u2019s prices, these are actually a fair deal. I mean think about how much technology is packed into each tiny AirPod? You have a lithium ion battery, accelerometers, infrared sensors and the W1 processor in that tiny shell. The pod also needs amplification. And let\u2019s not forget the entire headphone driver itself. The W1 processor is really what differentiates the AirPods from other BlueTooth headphones. They are very smart headphones that are very easy to pair and know how to conserve battery. I can honestly say $160 is a fair price for these given the technology and quality they provide. Oh and if the EarPods fit nicely in your ears, you won\u2019t have to worry about the AirPods falling out. Mine haven\u2019t gone anywhere\u2026..yet. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Are Apple AirPods worth the money? Two things to consider : 1 - What does money mean to you? How much do you have available to spend, and what to you think is expensive? 2 - What do you want or need from the Airpods? Do you want to look cool in an Apple product, matches your phone, latest \u2018High Tech\u2019 from a brand name? Or do you want HiFi sound a a great quality audio component without a care of what it looks like or the fashion statement? Without those two considerations made clear it is lt to give an answer that suits your intentions. From a purely audio quality, Airpods are very poor audio products. The sound quality is not what I would expect for their cost, and Apple really should and could have done a lot better. It is clear in Apple\u2019s acquisition of the beats company that they have little if any regard for sound quality. Apple always overprices it\u2019s products and keeps very tight control over compatible products of other manufacturers to maintain control over it\u2019s market share. By having such a low audio quality standard, they leave a very low bar for the competitors and so even they (the competitors) do not make huge attempts to improve the audio quality considerably, except for reputable audio brands that have a reputation and a desire to serve the audio community. So, if the audio quality is your concern, find a real audio brand name that makes the pods that will work for your device and enjoy! I t will not be cheap, but I think in the long run it will be worth it due to better quality sound (more enjoyable) and better quality build (last longer). So, this means that the Airpods are not worth it. If however, you prefer something that works well, but is cheaper, be careful of really cheap stuff as some if those will not work properly, or will be poorly made. Just do your homework and fin d what will meet your needs at a reasonable price. This will save you money and it means that the Airpods are not worth it! If you like the brand matched phone and Airpod and feel the price is justified even though it is high, and you can easily afford it, then they are worth it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I think they are. If you have an iPhone. They sound pretty good, sure. They have a pretty nifty charging case that keeps them going all day long. They have good microphones so you can actually be understood while on the phone. But the real reason they are worth every penny is ease of use. My AirPods are not the first wireless Bluetooth earbuds I have owned. The lure of wireless listening and talking has convinced me to buy at least two different sets of them in the past. Shortly after receiving them, I stopped using them. Today they are both sitting in a junk drawer with dead batteries. Why? They\u2019re just too inconvenient to use. Pairing and unpairing them every time you wanted to use them was just too much for them to be useful. Apple has solved this. At least for iPhone owners. They added their own secret sauce on top of the Bluetooth to make pairing and unpairing almost instant. When I get a phone call, I answer my iPhone like normal. Once I realize it\u2019s going to take more than a minute or two, I pop an AirPod out of the case and put it in my ear. By the time I have the second one out of the case, my call is already transferred to them. Perfect. And when I\u2019m done and I put them back in the case, my iPhone goes back to using its own speaker and microphone. This may sound like a small thing but it is not. In terms of making Bluetooth earbuds worth using, it is everything. ",

            "answer_text": "They are expensive but after using them for four months I find my life is not as easy without them. I lost the left air pod about two weeks ago and while the right one works fine independently. I miss hearing out of both. Ive tried to search for the second one using the Find my AirPods feature but I could not locate it. Yet I know it is in my home. Now it has no power I\u2019m sure and the \u201cfind\u201d feature will not work. I hesitate buying a new pair because I think the left one might appear. At one point I will take the dive to buy another pair. I figure I have some type of back up if I lose the right one of a new set. But if I lose the left again, I am in trouble. Apple should sell insurance on these since they are easily misplaced. They work seamlessly with my other Apple products and I never thought I would become as attached to them as I have. After going back to corded headphones I keep snagging the cord in things and they are always in the way. When I had no other alternative to corded headphones I didnt complain. But now going back to the primitive cord is bothersome and I tire of them constantly being pulled out of my ear when I catch it on a zipper, pocket, drawer handle, car hand brake, etc. ",

Whether they are worth it to you is an objective and personal decision nobody but you can make. Walk into your nearest Apple store and try them out for yourself if you aren\u2019t sure. Complete strangers can\u2019t answer this question for you. How long they last is something you can easily find with on Apple\u2019s website, or even on Quora, since it\u2019s already been asked and answered about a thousand times already here. In fact both questions have been asked and answered here many times. Asking duplicate questions like this only creates more work for the rest of us who get to gleefully merge your duplicates. Please stop doing this. Search before asking. From Apple\u2019s website: AirPods deliver an industry-leading 5 hours of listening time \u2014 and now up to 3 hours of talk time \u2014 all on one charge. And they\u2019re made to keep up with you, thanks to a charging case that holds multiple charges for more than 24 hours of listening time. Need a quick charge? Just put AirPods back in the case for 15 minutes to get up to 3 hours of listening time and 2 hours of talk time. To check the battery, hold the AirPods next to your iPhone or ask Siri \u201cHow\u2019s the battery on my AirPods?\u201d More than 24 hr. of battery life with charging case Up to 5 hr. of listening time on one charge Only 15 min. of charging provides up to 3 hours of listening time And before you ask, yes, those are realistic statements, as many people who actually use them (including me) will tell you.

I purchased the AirPods about a year ago and in my opinion, it\u2019s probably the best purchase I\u2019ve ever made. You really do get what you pay for. Classes are ten times easier to get through when you can easily listen to music or anything of that sort without anyone noticing that you\u2019re wearing them. The sound is good, but not great if I am going to be completely honest with you, but I think the other features make up for that. I\u2019ve dropped my AirPods countless times and they are still as good as new. I also once dropped them in a parking lot and went home, but I used the find my iPhone feature to locate them and get them back. Battery is always a question that I\u2019m asked about and to this day, I\u2019ve never completely run out of battery. Sometimes I go 2\u20133 days without charging them. TL;DR my recommendation is to buy them. They are 110% worth it. ",

The form factor and especially that beautifully compact charging case is a thing of beauty. It has not been matched yet by any other manufacturer. Now in terms of sound quality Airpods are average or i would say below average for the price. But you\u2019re really not buying into Airpods as for much for sound as you\u2019re for convenience. I usually take a lot of calls especially being in long-distance relationship and they make my life easier as my hands are always free. I\u2019m not saying its not possible on other Bluetooth pairs, but i like that they are not in-ear modules and hence comfortable to wear over extended hours. Most of the times i would forget I\u2019m wearing them. The ease of connectivity, lightweight and call quality are things which make them worth for me. I\u2019ve lost mine recently though and would I \u2018love\u2019 to buy one more - Hell Yes. Will i buy one more - Hell No! (got no money..lol) ",

Sound quality is high quality considering they are such small earpieces. Sounds even better than the wired ones in my opinion. Easy to drown out any noise if you turn them up loud enough (I go about 3/4 volume if that). The battery life is fantastic, and recharge time is quick as well, so no issues with battery for me. I often find myself using one earpiece and listening to music while doing other activities around the apartment, and I can still hear anything going on or someone talking to me. Speaking of talking I have taken multiple phone calls while wearing these and there are no issues on either end. Mic seems to work perfectly. The ability to customize how the \"double-tap\" feature works is nice. I have it set to my left earpiece is pause/play and my right is next song, when wearing one piece you can only access that one piece's ability though.

Sennheiser makes even nicer sounding headphones, but at more like 2x the price\u2026and again my pair get very little use because the Airpods are way simpler to put on and off\u2026and the Sennheisers bug my ears after an hour. The Airpods I have literally gone looking for only to find them already on my ears from something I listen to hours before.

Talking about Case 1: So if you have an iPhone, you must be knowing how it's earpods sound. Well AirPods is just slightly better than that. It's sound quality is no where even close to that of other $150 headphones/earphones. But it has the Apple's W1 chip along with a lot of sensors and touch features. Those are fabulous for taking calls and listening to casual music. To sum it up, if the features, design and the truly wireless approach is your highest priority, choose AirPods. ",

If you can wait either the middle of the year or end of the year I would hold off, if not then as long as you have an iOS device I would recommend a pair.

Though a minor disclaimer I will add is that there are rumours of another lite model of AirPods coming up in this month.

Wired earbuds work one hundred percent of the time without one glitch. AirPods Pros have a penchant for falling out of the wearer\u2019s ear, no matter the task at hand, when they are in your ear long enough they routinely loosen and fall out. AirPods are a good tool for situational circumstances. When you need both hands, or when you need to freely move. AirPods pros are more discrete than AirPods and wired earbuds are common place, they are socially acceptable in most cases. It is best to have both. ",

AirPods and all apple headphones are just not comfortable and they don\u2019t even have very good sound quality. People like them because they\u2019re wireless but the point of headphones is to listen to music, and I had a friend lose one in a manhole on the sidewalk and she could r do anything about it. If you really want wireless headphones, go for the Bose Soundsport or the new Beats, both of which I love mostly because of the sound quality and the rubber grips to your ears. AirPods are the cool thing but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re worth it! ",

The battery life varies on what you do with them and how much you use them. The bluetooth is great. I walk around my whole apartment without losing connection. $160 is more than worth it for a pair.

This might sound surprising but $12 billion dollars is more than the combined revenue of twitter, snapchat and spotify in 2019. Infact if Apple's airpods were an independently listed company on the US stock exchange, it would be the 256th biggest company. However the most surprising thing was that an astounding 18% of users reported to have lost one of the two airpods within a week of its purchase. So finally after all this, would you be willing to buy a $159 airpod? ",

I strongly recommend BOSE to buy earphones in terms of durability, sound, battery backup, i am using BOSE products more than a year, I know taste of sound. Bose is worth buying. Bose will buy back your earphones for 25% on its original price. If you want to buy a Mobile phone, Brand: Apple. If you want to buy earphones or headphones, Brand: BOSE. If you want to buy a power bank, Brand: Dura cell. Like wise there are respective brand for things. Adidas and nike are worlds top brand but they are recommended when it comes to buy a college bag.
