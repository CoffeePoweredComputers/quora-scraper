            "answer_text": "First remember folks\u2014 everyone cannot work from home\u2026  And that little bit of humor aside\u2014 Productivity will still be an issue\u2014 If you not a denizen of the C-Suites or one of the core-elite, the reality is Management won\u2019t accept a low-level WFH employee\u2019s word for How Incredibly Productive they really are. I was just reading an article about how young professionals were now deciding to leave Urban areas and head out to the \u2018Burbs, or considering buying that quaint old farmhouse out in the sticks because they now see the Future of Work will be from the comfort of their Livingrooms or convenience of their Kitchen\u2026 That, thanks to COVID, the age of the Commute is Dead. Mind you\u2014 and only for KNOWLEDGE Workers, BTW. I slowly shake my head\u2026 Again\u2014 only the folks in the C-Suites and the Core-elite Knowledge Workers can take this option with little worry of unpleasant side consequences. If WFH grows as much as folks imply or imagine\u2026 Remember that it isn\u2019t necessarily an Employee Paradise. Does anyone remember when NetCams were some EXTRA doodad you had to buy, plug in and install to your PC? Consider that pretty much ALL laptops now have that near invisible Lens/Mic as a standard feature. Perfect for Remote Work Monitoring. Remote Work Monitoring will also grow. Everything from key clicks, to cameras to Browser activity & History and Remote Viewing of the Desktop. It will pretty much end up being the case that if you WFH\u2014 you must utilize a company-supplied Laptop with Monitoring Software installed\u2026or if you use your Home PC, you MUST install the Software. Just Google: Remote Work Monitoring\u2026 That will give you just a small idea of the capabilities being sold directly to Small Business & Corporate IT Managers. A Lot of people, especially young workers, casually assume that the PC they sit down at in the office is THEIR PC. It isn\u2019t. Neither is the Network. Neither is the Internet Access. If you WFH\u2026 and you need to use a Company supplied Laptop or need to install Monitoring Software on YOUR PC\u2014 the same proviso applies. Who already lives in this Brave New World? A Lot of Customer Service Reps. Many folks already have dealt with a Customer Service Rep wherein you are courteously ignoring the sound of children in the background\u2026or the Rep politely says: \u201cExcuse me\u201d and then you hear them quietly tell the child: \u201cMommy is working. Not Now.\u201d They are not \u2018Free\u2019. They are Working, Working, Working. One Call after another after another after another\u2026 And the Monitoring Software is TRACKING their Productivity far better than ANY tyrannical Hand-Print Time Clock ever could. And remember: from Management\u2019s POV\u2026yes\u2014yes\u2014yes, they are REALLY paying you for your Skills and Knowledge. But your Boss, Your Manager, or HIS Boss and HIS Manager measures what you do via your PRODUCTIVITY. And at its simplest, Productivity is measured in TIME & PRESENCE. And Yes\u2026. I know, I know. It isn\u2019t always RIGHT. It isn\u2019t always MEANINGFUL. But it is What IS. Some employees that WFH may find themselves measured NOT necessarily on Tasks Completed\u2014 but JUDGED on TIME & PRESENCE regardless. That means You answer your Office Chat, Emails, Phone calls & Texts when received. The Zoom Meetings are attended whenever mandated\u2014whether you consider them time wasters or not\u2026and believe me, I have discovered that for SOME people, what would have been a quick 15 minute \u201cHere we are Update!\u201d in person can be dragged into a 45 minute \u201cBut I was thinking along these lines\u2026\u201d infinite zoom session. That when your Boss decides to click thru some Vid captures from the Remote Software, that they see your face in the camera. That they see windows open on your VM Desktop and the mouse is moving. In the actual office, you are there for a casual question or query. The Boss may not care that you may be bogged down or passing time waiting for something: You are THERE\u2026Just in Case. The Managerial itch has been scratched, so to speak. But when you WFH, everything can be LOGGED for future perusal. It\u2019s your Livingroom, but you might as well still be in your cubicle. But as some of the other Authors in this topic note\u2014 Business will \u2018Find the Balance\u2019\u2026just don\u2019t presume the \u2018Balance\u2019 will be in your favor\u2026 And on a Darker note\u2014 HR actions become easier\u2026 If the Head Office needs to trim some personnel fat\u2026 the EASIEST comparator will be the Productivity Stats of TIME & PRESENCE\u2026but not necessarily RESULTS. In your Livingroom, you may not know who that OTHER employee is who got the IMPORTANT Tasks & Projects. You won\u2019t know who made that extra effort to actually GO REGULARLY INTO THE OFFICE to make certain the Boss SAW THEM\u2026 \u2026And let me tell you \u2014 It\u2019s Human Nature for the Boss to remember the Face they saw at their Desk versus the name on the Remote Work Login List. You can be fired via email with a click of a mouse\u2026 Right there in the comfort of your Livingroom. As a Personal Note\u2014 I am the Operations Manager and IT CTO/CIO of my small medical clinic. We have remote working capability\u2014 I use it myself all the time! But it also means I\u2019m almost ALWAYS logged in when I\u2019m at home. That said, I STILL have to go into the office on a regular basis. (When the Network is Down\u2014 you can\u2019t fix it from home.) There are a few staffers in the back office to whom I OFFERED the ability to Log in Remotely. I\u2019ve known then and worked with them for many years\u2026 They refused. One told me that as far as she was concerned, when her day was over, or if she was home, She was NOT at work. Work was Work and Home was Home. She did not want to blur those lines. So folks\u2026 don\u2019t count on the Downtown Office Towers becoming empty post-apocalyptic shells just yet. My last little bit of advice: If you Work from Home and plan to do it on an ongoing basis\u2014 ASK for a company PC/Laptop. Keep YOUR Personal business on your HOME PC. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends entirely on you industry and field. Software development was already heavily off-shored and many of us here in the US work on the 7/24 time clock. Working with not one but many time zones. Personally, I constantly juggle the Europe and Asian time zones almost by mental math these days. Someone below or above brought up GRC and sensitive information regulations as being a potential problem, particularly HIPAA. Don\u2019t worry, your real restriction is having a completely separate room, no printer, print outs etc. I have audited WFH offices many times, providing enough information to the IRS that this really is a separate space used for nothing but work. Thanks for reminding me as this is a write off. Take 3\u20135 pictures of your stand alone work room/office showing no bed or outside of the room furniture like deskspace, filing cabinets, etc. In other words a true office and you\u2019ll pass the audit just fine. My office does have a parrot cage and a parrot in one corner but I moved it before the picture was taken, moving it back as not to give even the slightest hint at dual purpose. Companies may own or lease a great deal of space sitting empty but leases can be broken and buildings sold when need be. Nothing beats sitting at a 40 person desk, most everyone wearing headphones and listening to pod casts and music all day, elbow to elbow at work. No commute and no need to be in the office for senior level folks has been an amazing perk. I see lots of \u2018For Lease\u2019 signs on formerly occupied buildings here in the North suburbs of Chicago. Go ahead, tell me how much you miss those two hour one way drives to downtown, let alone the three hour one way train trips while you did nothing productive on the train but watch your wallet on the \u2018Red line\u2019. Yeah, those were the good ol\u2019 days weren\u2019t they? Depending on the nature of the work, meetings and production (presentations, analysis and designing systems in my case, production is way up. Even I am amazed how how much more I can get done, WFH. I changed my mind and see no reason to go back into the office. Rarely miss attending a meeting on time because of racing through the hallways to get to \u201cthe other meeting holding me up\u201d. No traffic problems to deal. Less wear and tear on my vehicle and I have a little more time to reinvest into myself by studying in the evening after I put my 12 hours in. No, not 8 but 12 like a good cubical dweller. Tack on the 2\u20135 hour commute I am used to doing and yeah, I will fight for my WFH perk and can pay for it in savings and productivity. Sorry, see no reason for much office time these days. Some but not much. ",
