            "answer_text": "You can throw away any camera making it disposable. You will never see the pictures from it. There are one-time-use cameras with photographic film loaded in them. The camera is delivered to a photofinisher so the film can be processed. Nearly all of the parts are re-cycled. The last project I did at Kodak involved designing a new film for one-time-use cameras. With declining sales, it was estimated that there would never be a need to make new camera bodies. Marketing wanted some new news. The easiest way to do that was to re-design the film. We managed a small improvement in sharpness and a reduction in manufacturing costs. ",
