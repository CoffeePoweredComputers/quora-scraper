            "answer_text": "The key to understanding this question is the other person whose \u201cexpense it is at\u201d is usually arguing for what they want to be happy at the expense of the other person. A parent who wants to choose their child\u2019s college is choosing their happiness over that of their child. The child who resists is choosing their own happiness but it is not at the parent\u2019s expense because it is only the parents\u2019 perspective (often based on some elevated view of continuing a family tradition that served them but won\u2019t serve their child well or keeping up appearances of some sort). Couples who fight about which toothpaste to buy are wanting the other person to give up their happiness in order to make them happy. This is stressful which leads to an interesting outcome. It\u2019s a simple matter for each member of the couple to use their preferred brand and not share the paste with their partner making everyone happy but stress reduces our cognitive abilities. I\u2019ve seen couples fight about this for years even though it is so easily resolved. Anytime you find yourself thinking someone is putting their own happiness over that of someone else\u2019s, switch the situation around and check to see if the people or person complaining aren\u2019t only arguing for what will make them happy at the expense of the person who isn\u2019t currently making them happy. The key is to develop psychological flexibility and not be rigid about what other people do or don\u2019t do. If you attach your happiness to certain outcomes that you don\u2019t control, you\u2019re setting yourself up for unhappiness. You can control your response to what other people do\u2014you cannot control what they do. This does not mean you have to let people walk over you. If you have a monogamous marriage, you can choose to leave the marriage if your spouse is unfaithful. But in either situation, being in a marriage or divorcing, whether or not you are happy depends on your perspective; it does not depend on the other person\u2019s actions. I am in a monogamous marriage. If my husband were to be unfaithful (he won\u2019t, this is hypothetical), I would end the marriage. That does not mean I\u2019d be unhappy. It means I\u2019d have to reconstitute my view of my future, with the aim of creating a vision of a future I will enjoy. That would allow me to quickly find joy and happiness on my new path. If I clung to what might have been, I\u2019d remain unhappy as long as I allowed myself to stay there. Relationships shouldn\u2019t involve bondage. I\u2019m referring to restrictions on what you can do or become within the marriage. I\u2019m not referring to role-play \u2014 that\u2019s up to the participants. Whether it is a parent/child, friend/friend, spouses, siblings, or another type of relationship, if the relationship creates rules you do not want to agree to live by, it is a form of bondage. My husband and I have a monogamous marriage because we chose to have one. Our vows even nodded to the fact that we had other choices available and consciously chose monogamy. We didn\u2019t do this from a position of moral superiority but from a reasoned decision that it was the way we wanted to live. There is a huge emotional difference between making a conscious and deliberate choice vs agreeing to something due to social or personal pressure from someone. I encourage any engaged couple to differentiate between vowing monogamy because it is expected vs because they chose it (or another option). The feeling of being trapped and not having a choice disappears when you chose the option you want to choose because you want to choose it instead of because it is expected. I have a couple of examples from my marriage of freedoms many marriages would have not allowed or that would have created friction. Two years ago, my husband decided to stop working and go to grad school to earn his Ph.D. On the surface, the move doesn\u2019t appear rational. He was 63-years-old at the time and a highly paid consultant. But our vows specifically left us free to grow and evolve: \u201cWe have intertwined our lives with our shared love, dreams, and desires. Although forever bound by love, I do not bind you to who you now are. I leave you free to learn, grow, and become that which is your full potential. I will strive to keep my eyes on the full beauty of your self-realized potential thereby uplifting you with the power of influence as you uplift me with your power of influence.\u201d  My husband will graduate and become, amusingly, Dr. Phil, in less than a year. I\u2019ve received a lot of flack for allowing him to stop working to pursue additional education at his age. I have not jumped on that bandwagon. I\u2019m proud of him and his determination. It\u2019s not easy to go back to school when you\u2019ve been out for forty years. It\u2019s involved sacrifices on both our parts but that is okay. There are also benefits and that is where I focus my attention. I also take pleasure in living up to my words. I like to be a woman who keeps her word and his choice allowed me an opportunity to demonstrate that. When you live up to your definition of yourself, it reinforces and strengthens who you are. (It works the other way, too, in people who don\u2019t think well of themselves.) Lest you think I\u2019m the saint in our marriage, giving up a lot to support him, I will mention that he is doing the same for me. I have a rather crazy dream of walking the width of America sharing information from published research that isn\u2019t reaching people fast enough. Today, when it is pharmacology, technology, or medical advances with a potential profit motive, it reaches people quickly. But the current pace of dissemination of published research about soft skills, things that can\u2019t be converted to profits easily, is slow. Today, journals are publishing this type of information every day. This information has the potential to increase human thriving and reduce human suffering. Some of it has the potential to do this quickly\u2014far quicker than so many failed social policies and with far less expense. But at the current pace, some of that research published today won\u2019t reach college textbooks until children born today graduate from college. That means we have the information we need to help a whole generation that won\u2019t benefit from the information we already have\u2014from research that is already published! He is being incredibly supportive supporting my upcoming walk despite the fact that it will cause us to be physically separated for the better part of a year. I am free to become who I want to be in my marriage. Would my husband prefer I stay home? He could certainly take that perspective. But he chooses to take the perspective that I am following my dream to speed up the dissemination of this life-changing and life-saving information, following my passion. Some of the same people who gave me flack about allowing him to pursue his Ph.D. are giving both of us flack about my upcoming walk. They were present at our wedding. They heard our vows but they did not understand them. We did. Within my marriage, there are many opportunities for people to say one of us is putting our individual happiness before that of the other but our own perspective is that we are each becoming the most we can be in the best ways we know to do that. Everyone has the ability to choose their perspective on any situation. If they fail to choose a perspective that preserves or supports their own happiness, it is not the other person who is depriving them of happiness. They are doing it to themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "This question contains a metaphor based on the medium of exchange. Happiness at the expense of others hints at a detriment or sacrifice. At the same time if something is done at the expense of others, it is only achieved by doing something that could harm these people. If you have to put other people through hell in order to experience a state of well-being, is it really worth it? The answer to this question depends on whether the individual reaping the undeserved reward has a conscience, wants to live with guilt, can sleep at night knowing that the happiness one experiences came at an awful price. Excluding self-interest from moral motivation isn't always easy, but it ultimately awards the patient individual with a greater sense of satisfaction. To quote Christopher McCandless from Into the Wild, channelling Tolstoy, \u201cHappiness only real when shared.\" ",
