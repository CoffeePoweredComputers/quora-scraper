            "answer_text": "Technology is changing the way students learn but also the way professors teach! And this is great news. Times are changing and technology is everywhere, putting this reality to the benefit of education is a must and the benefits from it are real! Technology can bring many benefits to education such as using these mobile devices that usually distract your students in class to a better good. This can be done by improving participation and interaction with your audience. One great benefit is for instance, the fact that technology enables very effective audience response systemsin classrooms. Audience response systems are a great way of increasing the level of participation and interaction with your audience and students tend to enjoy the class more and remember the content better.

            "answer_text": "Choosing the right instructional technology can reduce the time you need to spend on a subject when teaching, or it can bring your subject to life in a way that plain text cannot. Using technology for technology's sake is not recommended, but using technology judiciously can make a big difference in making your subject matter memorable, meaningful and motivational (to borrow from Michael Allen). The book, e-Learning and the Science of Instruction by Ruth Colvin Clark and Richard E. Mayer, describes in great detail when to use technology for instruction: when to use animation, when to use visuals, when to use audio. I highly recommend it! ",
