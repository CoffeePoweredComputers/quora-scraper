            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Are you buying the reconditioned phone from a reputable source, such as Apple, or Best Buy? If so, then it is a good deal. Go for it. If not, check and see what the warranty is and do you think the company from which you are buying the phone will honor the warranty if there is a problem? Regarding whether 64GB is enough storage, only you can answer that. You had your old phone for 5 years. Was it an iPhone? How much storage did it have? Do you take a lot of pictures? What about video?   ",

            "answer_text": "I would definitely go for a refurbished iPhone, if it is from an Apple Authorized Provider. In the United States, an example would be Best Buy. Obviously Apple doesn't sell refurbished iPhones, they only give them for replacement devices under AppleCare or AppleCare+. And yes, 64GB is a lot of storage- if you are more comfortable buying new, buy the 64GB. It is totally worth it; don't ever go for the 16GB model! ",
