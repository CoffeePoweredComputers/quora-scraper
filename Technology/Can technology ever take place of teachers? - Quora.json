            "answer_text": "No. It's true to say that the sales forces of every technology company since the development of the wire recorder has claimed this. And it's true to say that governments would love to replace all their expensive and awkward teachers with simple capital purchases of the latest tech. But the problem is, human beings are still on software 0.9c and don't tend to learn very well things they're not currently that interested in without another human being present to keep them in task and with minimal disruption. Teachers will be needed, schools and classrooms will be needed despite what Apple and Google would like to sell you for at least the next dozen generations. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes technology can take the place of teachers for a few students that do not want to be socially engaged. Many of the best teachers are socially invested and make connections with their students. School as a whole can be very social for the average student. Schools do a lot more than just depart knowledge into students. I would hate to be a part of a society that has all its students learn via technology. Humans as a species are social. What would fill that social gap? ",

            "answer_text": "Technology can replace teacher - bad teachers. Teachers that are tape recorders and teach the same thing in a loop year after year. Technology cannot replace a good teacher. A good teacher is knowledge that can be shared to every mind sitting in the class without differentiation. The ability to teach is gift that only a few possess. In my lifetime of sitting in classes, good teachers are hard to come by! Most of the teachers are just recordings of previous lectures. Internet can replace every single teacher in every single classroom and college in India without any exception. All you need to teach a student is the language, and the tools required to research and leave him with an aptitude for eternal research and he would never need a teacher ever in his life again. Teachers must be made obsolete, they have become obsolete but we are not willing to give up our old methods of teaching. The class room has become obsolete, the lessons have become obsolete and the teacher by the logic of induction has become obsolete. The teaching systems have become outdated. The schools can\u2019t keep up with the progress of technology anymore. It is not a radical thought anymore that we don\u2019t need teachers! ",

            "answer_text": "No. Technology can show us what parts of teaching can be replaced or augmented \u2014 but in general, it shows why teachers are so important (and how they can be even more effective with technology!). For example, just because Duolingo can help get you started learning a language\u2026. that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need a tutor. In fact, many students find that after learning with it and passing several levels, they NEED a teacher to both confirm their past learning as well take them to the higher more abstract levels. At TutorMandarin, we use real Chinese teachers still for all levels. Plus, with the advanced technology of our virtual classroom, now students can learn from all over the world as if they have their own private Chinese tutor right on call. Heck, businesses are starting all the time with platforms like this. ",

            "answer_text": "Not true, technology is merely an enhancement to the learning process. Machines are not capable of what humans are, they can do many things and do them faster and without mistakes, but teachers are teaching much more than what a machine/technology can such as social skills, humor, relating previous experiences and much more. Just think of what they said when calculators replaced slide rulers for engineers. You might have to research what a slide ruler is, but believe it or not, we didn\u2019t always have calculators. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, Technology basically means internet. But teachers are real life tutors. They can understand your situation and feelings. Yet technology can\u2019t really get what your\u2019e thinking. Technology only gives you results of the question you search on Google or other websites. But teachers can mentor you, they can help you out in many things. Think about the people who worked hard for years to get a job, and if you replace them with other stuffs then it can make a big wastage of those people\u2019s time. But in the other hand, we also need technology. So I think it\u2019s better to have a teacher to teach you in the first place and you can have technology also, as it can help in many things too. ",

If we closed up all of our junior and senior high schools we would have almost no school shootings ever again. The kids would be old enough to eat their own breakfast , then log in to class from home. A teacher could set programed lessons, interact remotely . Class size concerns and layoffs would be non existant . security could easily be provided for the smaller children and dances for the older ones could all be done at the same school buildings. With billions waisted through the federal education administration , their time is up comon core was the last straw. ",
