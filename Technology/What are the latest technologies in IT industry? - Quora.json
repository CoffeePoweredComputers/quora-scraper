            "answer_text": "IT industry is growing rapidly today. New technologies are introduced for the ease of people . Number of technologies as well as applications are launched which perform the tasks that were like dreams in previous years. Mobile apps are now an integral part of digital strategy and the demand of mobile apps is increasing rapidly around the globe and we can find millions of Business apps, lifestyle apps, educational apps, on-demand apps etc on the Google Play Store and the App Store. Technology in the area of mobile app development is getting advanced day by day. Number of new trends have introduced this year. Following are the latest technologies in IT industry: Augmented reality (AR) Technology The approach of regular applications or traditional games is completely changed with the help of Augmented reality. This technology in mobile application will receive new impetus in 2018 and probably become mainstream. The Apple and Google have launched their own augmented reality kits i.e AR Kit and AR Core resp. And it help app developers to create high quality mobile apps. 2) Beacons  Among the common users, the technology of beacons becomes more widespread. More applications with beacon-based features will be created for users, and - starting from informational sources, virtual guides and ending with location-based games and much more. However, it is unlikely that users expect a technical revolution in this direction. Beacons continue to expand in use cases covering more and more areas where a person could get all the necessary information in the right place without having Internet connection. 3) Artificial Intelligence  Artificial intelligence seems to be a game changer in mobile app development. Apple allowed developers to integrate Siri into their applications only in 2017. Soon, artificial intelligence will be utilized for a wide range of activities. So far, only large companies can afford to develop mobile applications with artificial intelligence onboard. In 2018, the rules must change. 4) Internet of things (IoT)  The Internet of things isn\u2019t a mysterious technology anymore. Analysts predict significant changes in this area in 2018. Home appliances like smart electric kettles and everything that has the prefix \"smart\" can be combined into a single infrastructure for authorized users. 5) Blockchain  Blockchain is so much more than just the technology behind cryptocurrencies. A digital account book of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value. Blockchain can add value in so many ways to the way in which we currently go about our lives and do business. Expect to see this technology become more and more prevalent in everyday life and business. 6) Data and security applications  Probably, the most important element on this list. New security requirements of Apple are changing mobile development. Google is likely to present something similar for Android. The latest trends in this area are connected with blocking. Together with two-factor authentication and other methods, you can significantly increase data protection. 7) Cloud Based App Development  Now-a-days number of mobile app development companies are using Cloud-based app development. So they have better streamlined operation, collaboration and increased productivity. These type of mobile apps reduce the load on the internal memory by fetching the data from cloud and therefore this can prove beneficial for app developers and business owners. 8) On-demand mobile app development  On-demand services are just one of the many things that are made possible thanks to the advancement of technology; in fact, you could say that on-demand services are our world. We can use on-demand app at our convenient and at anywhere. The market for on-demand services is continuously improving and providing more and more services, each better and faster than the last. Majority of on-demand app falls under category as food ordering app, car cleaning app, taxi services, laundry service, renting app etc. 9) Digital Wallet apps  While doing online shopping most of the people use internet banking or credit/debit cards for payments. Also customers prefer to pay digital cash even doing offline shopping from grocery stores or shopping malls. That payment is done through digital wallet apps. People gradually shifting to m-commerce with the introduction of Google Wallet and Apple Pay. This trend is getting more stronger day by day in 2018. With this the organizations can harvest data and offer in-depth analysis about clients in good way. Customers will get more comfortable with this payment option. 10) Chatbots  Chatbots technology is growing very rapidly, with the market growing at the CAGR of 37.11%. It is forecasted to reach a booming $6 Billion by the end of 2023. When business bots are combined with mobile app, offer a way of creating simulating customer interaction for business. According to the statistics, in 2018- 65% of US consumers are likely to interact with chatbots. The mobile app industry is continuously expanding at the rapid speed with the introduction of these mobile app trends. Huge competition among the developers and mobile app makers will will be there than ever in 2018. You must consider all these app development trends before you start working on your app otherwise you would be left behind in the race. Now,don\u2019t forget to tie every product launch to these mobile app trends. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve launched many apps and SaaS platforms for entrepreneurs and early-stage startups who\u2019ve gone ahead and made hundreds and millions of dollars using these platforms. If you have an app idea and not sure where to start, I can help. Feel free to connect with contact details in my profile. ",

            "answer_text": "The technology is now evolving at such a rapid rate that annual trend forecasts may appear outdated even before being published as a blog post or published article. As technology advances, it enables even faster change and progress, causing the rate of change to accelerate until it finally becomes exponential.  Tech-based careers don't change at the same rate, but they do evolve and the IT professional knows that their role will not be the same. And a 21st century computer scientist will constantly learn (out of necessity, if not desire).  The latest technologies in IT industry are: 1. Artificial intelligence (AI) Artificial intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of attention in recent years, but it's still a trend to watch because its effects on the way we live, work, and play are only in the early stages. In addition, other branches of artificial intelligence have been developed, including machine learning, which we will discuss below. AI refers to computer systems designed to mimic human intelligence and perform tasks such as image recognition, speech or pattern recognition, and decision making. AI can perform these tasks faster and more accurately than humans. AI is part of what we generally call automation, and automation is a hot topic due to possible job loss. Experts say automation will cut 73 million more jobs by 2030. However, automation creates and reduces jobs, especially in AI: Experts predict that jobs in 'AI will be 23 million by 2020. 2. Machine learning Machine learning is a subset of AI. With Machine Learning, computers are programmed to learn to do something they are not programmed to do: they learn by discovering patterns and ideas from data. Although Machine Learning is a subset of AI, we also have subsets in the area of Machine Learning, including neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning. Each of these subsets offers the opportunity to specialize in a professional area that will only grow. Machine learning is rapidly being implemented in all types of industries, creating a high demand for qualified professionals. The Machine Learning market is expected to reach $ 8.81 billion by 2022. Machine Learning applications are used for data analysis, data mining, and pattern recognition. On the consumer side, Machine Learning optimizes web search results, real-time advertising, and network intrusion detection, to name a few of the many tasks it can perform. 3. Automation of robotic processes or RPA Like artificial intelligence and machine learning, robotic process automation, or RPA, is another technology that automates work. RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as application interpretation, transaction processing, data processing, and even email response. RPA automates the repetitive tasks that people used to do. These are not just the subordinate tasks of a low-paid worker: Up to 45% of the activities we do can be automated, including the work of financial managers, doctors, and CEOs. For you as a forward-thinking IT professional trying to understand technology trends, RPA offers many career opportunities, including developer, project manager, business analyst, solution architect, and consultant. And these jobs pay well. Job Search Engine says the average RPA salary is $ 73,861, but it's the compiled average of salaries from junior developers to senior solution architects, with the top 10% earning more than $ 141,000 a year. 4. Cybersecurity Cybersecurity may not seem like an emerging technology, as it has been around for a while, but it evolves like other technologies. This is in part because threats are constantly new. Hackers attempting to illegally access data will not give up any time soon, and will continue to search for ways to carry out even the most stringent security measures. This is also partly because new technologies are adapting to enhance security. 5. Internet of things (IoT) Many \"things\" are being built with WiFi connectivity, which means they can connect to the Internet, and to each other. Hence, the Internet of Things, or IoT. The Internet of Things is the future, and it has already enabled devices, appliances, cars, and much more to be connected and exchange data over the Internet. And we are only in the early stages of IoT: the number of IoT devices reached 8.4 billion in 2017 and should reach 30 billion in 2020. As consumers, we already use and benefit from IoT. We can remotely close our doors if we forget when we go to work and preheat our ovens on the way home from work, while following our fitness in our Fitbits and welcoming Lyft. But companies also have a lot to gain now and in the near future. IoT can enable better security, efficiency, and decision-making for businesses as data is collected and analyzed. It can enable predictive maintenance, accelerate healthcare, improve customer service, and deliver benefits we don't even have ",
