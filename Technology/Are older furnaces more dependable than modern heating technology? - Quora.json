            "answer_text": "Well when you consider how few fail safes the old furnaces had I suppose one could argue that have less to go wrong. It was pretty easy to diagnose the old furnaces. Most problems came down to the pilot or the gas valve. Occasionally a blower motor went bad or the thermostat. Today\u2019s new furnaces have numerous fail safes, any one of which can malfunction and prevent operation. There are draft inducers for more efficient airflow through the more modern heat exchangers. That\u2019s the whirring noise you hear before the gas ignites. There is a sensor to tell if it actually came on that can fail. Hot surface igniters have replaced pilots. They crack occasionally. Then there are condensing furnaces which have a whole new set of issues on how to handle the condensate, prevent corrosion etc. So, dependable is relative. They may have been more dependable by at the cost of safety and efficiency. If there is a safety feature on your furnace it\u2019s a good bet someone\u2019s death inspired it. ",

            "answer_text": "New furnaces are much more efficient and do not fail as often as the older ones. The older furnaces had carbon build up issues, the heat exchangers would need cleaned more often and there was plenty of failures to deal with. The newer ones have more sensors, electronics, computers and require a technician with up-to-date training; but, they save lots of fuel cost and are safer than the older ones. Many older mechanics like the old cars that they could work on; but, the newer computer controlled fuel injected engines last longer and are far ahead of any car ever made in the good-ol\u2019-days. You may have to search high-and-low to find a technician that knows what he is doing\u2026 treat him well, pay him extra, take him to dinner and be his friend, good help is hard to find. In the long run you will save money, stay warmer and drive further with the new furnaces and cars. ",

            "answer_text": "Rather than trying to improve on Tim Hinds' answer (I can't), I'll just echo it. Yes older furnaces are more dependable than newer ones. Fewer parts = fewer things to fail. They were incredibly basic appliances, usually around 50%-60% efficient. I really enjoy working on newer furnaces precisely because they're complicated, but with more parts comes more chance. They seem to be modern Rube Goldberg machines, but every single part on a modern furnace is functionally or safety related. ",

            "answer_text": "In some ways, yes. Older furnaces tend to be made of heavy duty cast iron. Newer furnaces are often made with thinner materials, and especially cheaper gas burners have a limited life over this. The newer furnaces are much more regulated and trimmed, so they\u2019re much more environmentally friendly - and are precision engineered. They\u2019re like fine tuning instruments, where the older furnaces are more like a sledge hammer. So\u2026 dependable, perhaps yes. But the dependability has a price, too. ",

The old residential Warm Air Furnaces often had a problem with the heat exchanger rusting, especially during the summer in a damp basement, especially if the basement had a dirt floor. Years ago a small hole in the heat exchanger was not a major issue because the houses were drafty. Diff. story today. Any leak is a problem. Many furnaces today use stainless steel heat exchangers.
