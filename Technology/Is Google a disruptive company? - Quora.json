            "answer_text": " Yes. Big Time. Google rules the world by an iron fist in a velvet glove. In 2015 Google's straight motto \"don't be evil\" had been replaced by enigmatic \"do the right thing\". This reflects shifting Google's value system, which once was refreshingly new and even insanely progressive but has since mutated into something frightfully familiar. This company, which was founded in 1996 by two Stanford PhD students Sergey Brin and Larry Page, has developed into 2 billion lines of codes Sphinx, who greets every human being on this planet, who wants to enter into Planetary Castle of Knowledge, by its enigmatic smile and legendary riddles. This Sphinx tries now to induce itself in each and every potentially profitable niches of human activities related to information, data and computing. Alphabet's Brain Empire is unprecedented in humans history and far more consequential that those of Rockefeller's, Morgan's or Geits'. At the same time Google's management makes everything possible to deflect public attention from its factual monopolistic position on the market. So far Google has been able to avoid or to win all of its legal battle and to keep its positive image in the eyes of public. However, that situation can't be sustained for a long time as the new generation of rationally greedy technocrats, bred inside of this smiling colossal, is gradually replacing old idealists on top managerial posts.
