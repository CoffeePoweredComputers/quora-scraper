            "answer_text": "\u201cCORRECT ANSWER IS RIGHT HERE\u201d Just call \u201c121\u201d form. your airtel registered number Follow the IVR instructions to your fixed line account deactivation process Then it should ask you to enter your \u201cAirtel Account Number\u201d. Now mind you, your fixed line number Or dsl number is not your airtel account number. Check for the confirmation slip that was given to you at the time of installation of the broadband by the person who installed the broadband at your house, on that slip there would be a number Written as Account number which will be different from your Dsl number and Fixed line number. If you couldn't find your confirmation slip or may be lost it, just look for your detailed bill in airtel thanx app, there will be a number listed as \u201cRelationship Number\u201d. That \u201cRelationship Number\u201d is your \u201cAirtel account number\u201d. Enter that number, then it will ask for your landline number. Enter the landline number with the STD code and you are good to go. I successfully temporarily deactivated my airtel broadband recently and hence I know it to be correct for sure. I hope it helps. Thank you. Kindly Upvote. ",

            "answer_text": "I just deactivated my airtel broadband connection a few days ago, so I think I can answer this question. Please find the steps below the only method to cancel the connection is to call customer care and speak with \u201ccustomer care agent\u201d hence request them for which they will try to deviate by either making you hold for a long time/assuring you to call-back/trying to convince you for hours to retain the connection.if you succeed to convince the customer care guys don't think that your job is done yet, you will get 2\u20133 calls trying to convince you to retain the connection/relocate.then if you are lucky enough your connection will be disconnected or else they will just convince you that connection has been disconnected over the call but you will be billed continuously which you will have to pay. So keep checking the connection and airtel thanks app too.Thanks, RoMy :-) ",
