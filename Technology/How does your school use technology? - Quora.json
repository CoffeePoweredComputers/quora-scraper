            "answer_text": "I work at a Finnish high school. We use many kinds of edtech: data cameras and projectors, digital learning platforms, laptops etc. The open wifi connection is available in all school classrooms. We do not have smartboards or programmable robots, but I know some schools have those as well. Mostly, this technology is used for studying different kinds of subjects like math (with programs like Geogebra), creating for example videos, audios, texts, games or sites or for collaboration in school projects. Teachers use Google Drive to plan together. Most exams are digital, and we have a platform for creating and grading exams. This is done through a linux based USB-stick for each student computer (and the server computer connected to these computers via a separate wifi connection). Mostly, the technology we use is normal information age technology without anything fancy or fabulous. Students and teachers are supposed to use many programs and devices for working. Most use their own smartphones at least for some learning tasks. For younger kids, the technology education is more advanced. Students can try to build their own devices or create science projects, maybe wortk with robots or make something unique. ",
