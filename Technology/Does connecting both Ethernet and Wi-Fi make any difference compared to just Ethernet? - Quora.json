            "answer_text": "No, none at all. In theory could the bundling of the two transfer systems improve speed, but as far as I know no generally used operating system uses that posibility. And the next question would be. Why! Very few have Internet capacity higher then 1Gbit/s so for it to be useful you need a 10Gbit/s Internet access and if you have that you will have a 10Gbit/s NIC. Then we are back to the start again. For home/office use, if you would have a 100Mbit/s NIC in a laptop and a 54Mbit/s WiFi it might make sense, but a USB 2.0 Ethernet NIC would still be better. And if you have the knowledge to play around with this, your gear is at least 1Gbit/s capable. So what could be the use of having WiFi and Ethernet thru cable in one device then. To have a second way if the normal way breaks. But to me it is just plain stupid and make zero sense, except from having it as an alternative way to Internet if the ordinary fiber connection breaks down, just set up a WiFi hot-spot in you cell phone and use that in case of normal Internet comes to be non functional.

            "answer_text": "Actually, in some cases it makes your connection slower. In some cases, when there are 2 network connections, the system will try to \u201crationalize\u201d the two connections, meaning that the faster wired connection will be slowed down to match the slower wireless connection. Before running s system with 2 network connections, try each one individually to see what the performance is of each on their own, you may be surprised. Generally speaking (unless there is a cabling issue) a wired connection on its own will be your best performance. ",
