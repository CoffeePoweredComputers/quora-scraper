            "answer_text": "If you could go back in time and live in any era of your choice, which would it be and why? This is going to be a free-for-all question, with a lot of answers. Here\u2019s mine; I\u2019d live right now, today, in the United States of America. And I\u2019ll tell you why. I\u2019m a cancer patient. I was diagnosed with a type of cancer 20 years ago that would have killed me a few years earlier; as it was, my first round of conventional chemotherapy was ineffective. When my cancer reappeared in less than 2 years (I\u2019m doomed), new treatments and new types of chemo had just been approved that did prove effective (I\u2019m saved). I give God the glory that if I had lived at any other place, or in any other time, my life would have ended then. Modern medicine is an astounding benefit to humanity. It would not be at all inaccurate to say that in the last 150 years or so, on average, modern medicine has given us an extra lifetime worth of years to live. There are amazingly many things that could kill you in past eras that we don\u2019t even think about today, thanks to Western medicine. We talk about Bubonic Plague, but in past times, tens of millions of people used to die of the flu. Spanish flu - Wikipedia The dread disease Smallpox, the killer of millions, is eradicated today. So is rabies. I remember seeing Polio victims, as a child growing up; you don\u2019t see any now. Malaria killed untold millions, maybe billions, of people throughout human history; do you know anyone who has had Malaria? CDC - Malaria - About Malaria - History And so it goes. Until Louis Pasteur made his discoveries in the mid-1800s, doctors did not know that germs caused diseases, and it was in the mid 1800s that general anesthesia was invented as well. If you pick a historical time before 1850 or so, a deep puncture wound anywhere to your body could be fatal due to infection. Heart procedures that are almost routine today were not done at all; no vaccinations; doctors wiping dirty tools on their pants before they cut into you, etc. And you\u2019ll see them wipe those tools, because before 1849, you\u2019ll be awake when the doctor cuts off that arm or leg to keep the infection there from spreading. Let\u2019s not talk about dentistry. Time would fail if I got into the dangers of drinking untreated water (cholera, diphtheria, typhus, dysentery), or eating contaminated food (Hepatitis all kinds, parasites). Persons with diabetes were doomed to a short, sickly life. Persons with almost any cancer were doomed. Dying of old age was a rare treat. Pick any era to live in if that makes you happy, but keep that time machine hidden and the keys in your pocket, because if you get sick, you\u2019re going to want to come straight back to the United States of America, 2018. End of story. ",

            "answer_text": "We start with the Cambrian period: there is nothing on the land. The land is just rock, not even soil, just sand, and rock. It\u2019s empty, extremely hot, and I would suffocate. Next period, Ordovician. Also nothing on the land except for some new tiny primitive land plants, but overall pretty much the same as the Cambrian just some new stuff in the ocean. Next period Silurian. Still no forests or land animals. Next period, the Devonian is more manageable. It sees the first forests and first amphibians and first arthropods on land. I guess I could live off of fish and maybe some kind of fern or tree but would be deficient in many different nutrients. Just whatever you do, don\u2019t get in the water!  \u201cJaws ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 on me\u201d Next period, the carboniferous has too much oxygen (yes, you heard me), so forest fires would be a huge threat. I also have an irrational fear of bugs and arachnids so it would be like hell seeing these things buzzing around  and these giant things crawling on me while I sleep  Next period, the Permian will also have high oxygen levels if it\u2019s the early Permian. In the early Permian, I might be able to survive off of Edaphasaurus  \u201cTastes like chicken.\u201d But I will have to compete with Dimetrodon  \u201cNOT CHICKEN! I REPEAT, NOT CHICKEN!\u201d Dimetrodon would easily be able to kill me if I\u2019m unarmed. If I\u2019m alone, I can only survive so long with guns because they need bullets from the present. Once I run out of bullets I am screwed because have no idea how I would create tools because there weren\u2019t the same types of trees there are today so I\u2019d have to figure out on my own how to use the Permian forests to make tools. Now, if it was the late Permian, I would just die of heat stroke shortly after I get there. If not, then I will die of thirst because Pangaea is a giant empty desert with some small water holes. Next period, the Triassic is extremely hot as well because Pangaea is still together and the great dying just heated up Earth drastically. I would also suffocate as the atmosphere is littered with Co2 from the Permian-Triassic extinction aka the Great Dying. The Jurassic would be doable but it was warmer than today so I\u2019d have to be careful when running. But prey could be easy to find because there is no evidence that sauropods cared for their young. But that doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t. The cretaceous period would be pretty good. I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about large theropods like T. Rex because I would be such a small and pointless meal. I\u2019d only have to worry about large dromaeosaurs like Dakotaraptor, the second-largest land predator that lived in Cretaceous North America 81\u201366 million years ago.  (The one on the bottom is Dakotaraptor). If I was prepared for surviving alone in the wild then I\u2019m sure I could defend myself against them with spears. The Paleogene period would be difficult because most of the animals are still small and don\u2019t make a good meal and there would be large predatory flightless birds I\u2019d have to worry about.  \u201cBawk bawk, bitch.\u201d Neogene would be very good because there are plenty of prey animals and the trees would be the same as they are today so tool making is possible. I might even be able to find a group of homo sapiens and survive with them. Depending on the continent I might be able to survive with the Neanderthals. Hopefully, they don\u2019t get aggressive. The Quaternary would be almost like today (except for civilization, obviously) and would be just as easy as surviving in the wild today. But I\u2019d rather stay in the present because I have a roof over my head and internet and food at any time of the day. And all of this stuff about surviving using tools wouldn\u2019t even work on me alone because I don\u2019t even know how to make tools. Lastly, human history? Hell no! I don\u2019t want to be enslaved! ",
