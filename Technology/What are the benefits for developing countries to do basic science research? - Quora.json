            "answer_text": "I guess, If the basic research topic is a \u201cneed to know\u201d in that country they will profit from it, by preparing the ground knowledge for other practical research and inventions- like knowing the soil bacteria which can later be used by practical agricultural studies. Also even if a country plans to use the basic research produced by other first world countries (say using new particle physics findings for developing a new technology), it still makes sense to have some level of basic research in those fields because at the end if you have the techniques for basic research available, you can build the new technology faster. But I think if the research is just general, global, human basic questions like the distances of galaxies (in a country that has no serious aerospace program) that funding can be used in better places, like education or developing new technologies. Some would also argue that there is a level of prestige and proud involved if one country can have more basic research results. I am curious to know better answers to this question. ",

            "answer_text": "Research in developing countries are constrained by a small budget as the importance of it is not fully appreciated.  Research in such countries ought to be focused on understanding the locality, be it in terms of agriculture, biodiversity, geology. The key is to promote understanding of the land and making the data public. Many developing countries fail to understand their surrounding environment. Research promotes understanding and better guides the efficacy of its people's ventures and efforts. Capitalize upon understanding by making it available to all, not just a select few; regulate if necessary.  If research is viewed positively, others will be encouraged to become involved in the sciences. At the very least, instilling curiosity.  \"The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding\" (Proverbs 4:7). ",
