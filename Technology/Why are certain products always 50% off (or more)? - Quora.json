            "answer_text": "There can be several reasons for this: New products in the market for people to get familiar with.Products that producers see are dropping in sales and need to be boosted.Products that need to be sold quickly (for example new version of the product/new batch of product is being produced already).Simply seasonal marketing campaings.Etc.The main logic is that usually it happens in the co-operation between producer and retailer. Both of them have their margins cut down to certain point but even with that in mind they both make profit. Margins are initially calculated while keeping promotions/campaigns in mind. ",
