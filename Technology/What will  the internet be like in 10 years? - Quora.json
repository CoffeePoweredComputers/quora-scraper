            "answer_text": "I would like to see more free applications built into the operating system that provide mind-opening opportunities to the consumer-citizen. For example: Programmable Heuristics by Nathan Coppedge Some of this would be about making not just windows, text, and specialized material generalized across the internet, but also the ability to analyze and integrate with the user\u2019s main motives such as making money and feeling fashionably intellectual. The simple commercial way to do this is to integrate education and Starbux with additional fantasy elements. Ideally this is most compatible with an economy that is doing very well. At minimum, there should be some public \u2018installations\u2019 or implacements similar in their role to ATMs which can provide special clues about how to live and improve one\u2019s life, and how to use the local environment. This means smarter cities, more citizenship options, and short writings designed to benefit and entertain consumer citizens. I think the electronic paper revolution is a missed opportunity. It is possible to imagine lower-income people who could own one piece of electronic paper and engage in an intriguing personal education using these public installations. Right now the internet is not designed for standardized entertain-ucation, but it should be. One of the big opportunities is to cull the best examples of art and writing, and make them expressly available for entertain-ucation. If the program is good enough, people will be willing to pay small amounts of money just to get the best quality information and services. I think one of the keys will be to make cities more interesting, with public interfaces that provide a medium of exchange between businesses, government, institutions, and consumer-citizens. It will be important to have consumer functions and incentives which are not merely \u2018official and boring\u2019. The public interface should be tied into any free income and multi-tiered entertain-ucation programs that are locally or nationally available. An important key will be to use physical resources efficiently. So, for example, instead of buying textbooks or building a new building, the services will pay for a certain amount of electronic paper which can circulate and be re-used, as well as a public terminal that can update the electronic paper. If the writing is exciting or useful enough, like special selections from Nathan Coppedge\u2019s writings on Quora, then there will be a big boost to the feeling of urban intellectualism which supports the belief in technology and the futuristic. The electronic paper and incentives can also serve a psychological function, preventing criminal and deviant behaviors or providing pop-up messages about structured community events. It will be important to be very sensitive to people who would not assume that a given event is important, or who would not assume they in danger of being a criminal or a victim of one. The resources can be used for mental adventures, and for giving people the right assumptions to avoid bad behaviors. It will be important to be very optimistic-sounding, intuitively deep, and stimulating. After all, people who are not interested in reading the material at all are less likely to be thoughtful and intuitive. The internet will partly be a communications service which performs some actions automatically, when they have a special benefit to the consumer-citizens. Things that improve optimism without destroying authenticity should be supported. There will be consumer options as well, but it must fit with the economic system. Perhaps some kind of virtual credit system could be used for people who do not have much income. Also, the internet of things will become more major, and there will be more opportunities to interact with electronics built into the environment. This will be an extension of things like public interface, electronic paper, academic computers, and terminals, but will provide general enhancement services like information and therapy, say to someone sitting on a park bench. Another option might be tasteful music or an explorative sound effect. Some of these services can be designed to be short and to-the-point in order to get the best results over time. Another aspect will be that there will be some high-end services used more rarely that allow certain citizens to buy into the economy on a consumer basis. Certain periodic outputs or information access is guaranteed in exchange for an initial investment. In this way, the economy can have more human structure, and such services should be designed to be low-commitment, and high-incentive. Another aspect is the way the new infrastructure works for corporations, institutions, and government. There will be more information available about consumers, or at least more information about consumer behavior, which is something businesses can act on. It will become easier and easier to provide high-quality services, and since services make things easier for the government, the government will have an incentive to provide infrastructure which benefits the consumer experience, whether that means more brilliant zoning (for example, my suggestion of combining hospital and resident zoning), additional services, or particular ways of integrating the environment with the consumer-citizen to make things more fashionably intellectual. In my mind the most important thing will be that consumers have something significant to think about. My suggestions are that there will be an elaborate network of philosophical and spiritual systems hooked into visuals, gamification, consumerism, and education. There will also be great new discoveries like the supportive city, space travel, and perpetual motion which will make future cities more vibrant and intellectually interesting. The future internet is just communication with visuals, and the various structured services and consumer functions which make education and citizenship possible. That is my vision. AN EXCITING NEW ERA IN HISTORY IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Over the next 10 years, I think, firstly, every website in the Web will become more and more like a web-based platform on which we are enabled to build contents, service, and applications and are also enabled to install applications, service, and contents. As a trend, web-based platforms might turn into a universal, standard, widely applicable website for delivery, like today Microsoft Windows is delivered to everyone and every organization. Secondly, everyone and every organization will have a web-based platform that is operated by themselves, like today they operate their own computing platforms (computers), on which applications, services, and contents are mainly purchased and installed from some stores. As a result, individuals or organizations can be relatively equivalent nodes on the Internet as big companies that have dominant public web-based platforms. The number of websites in the Web will become huge. Thirdly, web-based platforms can be connected together and built relations, like today computers can be networked, so that resources can be shared across websites. It means the Web cannot remain as just a collection of websites among which there are short of connections and relations. In other words, in 10 years in the Web, \u201cnetworked\u201d personal web-based platforms will take place of personal networked computers as more Internet-centric external information systems or even control systems along with our brains in the upcoming future.

            "answer_text": "The field of programming is very quickly improving and web development has seen many improvements in the past few years. There is a long list of choices of technologies you may prefer to learn. A lot of frameworks and libraries are created in past few years including jQuery, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Django, Reactjs, Vuejs and many more. These additions have also made web development easier and added many new features. A web developer in 90\u2019s may spend days or weeks to do a task that can be done in an hour or half today and some websites today are the main base of a commercial merchandise like Amazon. This was not even possible in 90\u2019s. Now to see where we are going in the next 10 years\u2026 Well, I think in 2028, you won\u2019t probably need to code anymore to build websites. A piece of software may provide an user interface using which you may add all the functionalities you need. There is also an example of it in the present. I am talking about content management systems like Joomla, WordPress, etc. Currently, these CMS\u2019s lack the feature to add some functionalities and most of their code for specific purposes is written by amateur programmers. If some improvements are made to these CMS\u2019s(maybe in the near future) it may seem like an end to the career in web development but I don\u2019t think so. The point is, you may need to develop some kind of software or content management system like WordPress. More CMS\u2019s may be created. If you have started your career in Web development, it\u2019s a possibility that after 10 years you may be working in software development company as an employee for creating a new CMS that may provide users with countless features and easiness. Hope your question is answered\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "In recent years, there has been a strong movement with all the emerging frameworks in which we try to find how to work and build web applications/websites easier and more efficiently. That happens due to the fact that web development is so open that you can literally build the same thing with limitless ways. That brings frustration and makes web development, a painful and time consuming process. I believe that in 10 years we will eventually have a couple of \u2018standard\u2019 frameworks/libraries in which we will heavily rely upon to develop web applications. These frameworks will provide everything you need to quickly build your projects from top to bottom with ready to use, extendable and customizable components that can work together seamlessly to achieve the functionality you need. Think of it like the Bootstrap framework but for your whole web application. This could enable us to build projects faster, easier and less prone to errors. It could also help us evolve the standard libraries for our own benefit and eventually stop reinventing the wheel. Of course, I don\u2019t think that alternatives will go away and you will still be able to use different languages/frameworks in case they better meet your needs. To sum up, I believe that many tools/languages will still be available (much more mature this time) but we will also have something that we currently don\u2019t: a few standard all-in-one frameworks that are universally accepted as great and in many cases best solutions for web development.

I've been in internet since, i don't know, maybe 2000 at its fullest, and in every stage of it i've seen a lot of pages going down just because they had anything else to offer in their current time. Just take a look at them: social medias offers everything by a single click. Games, groups, band pages, videos, pictures, notes, a box where you leave a comment and a \"like system\", besides the chat, obviously. In my opinion, it was much better when you had to open MSN Messenger, a Firefox tab for Fotolog, a Youtube tab, and even the myspace system for music. Having everything in a single place just makes the experience a lot more boring, simpler and stressful when it comes to personal statuses about topics that might alter your mood. (Quora is a place for this, you ask, we answer and viceversa, and debates can be generated with total respect).Coming back to your question, i think that there will be a lot of changes beside the social medias, the only thing i can say i hope for the future of this, is the correct location of everything, everything in its own place would be better, at least for me.
