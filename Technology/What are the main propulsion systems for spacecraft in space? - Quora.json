            "answer_text": "We can pretty much sum up moving in space to one of two methods, that we know of: #1 - Eject a small mass behind us, at great velocity, and the vehicle will move in the opposite direction (but not as fast) to conserve momentum.  This is the foundation behind the rocket. #2 - Allow an outside force to propel us.  This is the foundation behind solar sails and gravity slingshots. Any propulsion that follows #1 needs a propellant source - something to provide the energy of the expulsion and something to expel.  The common methods of doing that are: 1)  Chemical rocket - an oxidizer and a fuel are combined in an explosion that sends gas down a nozzle at great velocity.  We do that one of two ways - using liquid propellants of solid propellants.  The Space Shuttle is an example that does both.  The SRBs burn a solid fuel made from aluminum and ammonium perchlorate and the SMEs use cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen.  The Russian Proton uses nitrogen tetroxide and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine.  That is an example of hypergolic fuels (meaning they don't need an ignition source, they hate each other that much they explode on contact).  The Saturn V used LOX and kerosene. 2) Inert gas jets - many satellites use small jets that fire inert gas.  The gas is built up to high pressure by a pump and then sprayed though a nozzle.  The main advantage is that it has a good shelf-life - since it is non-corrosive it doesn't eat through the fuel lines.  This is particularly valuable for a satellite with a long life-span. 3) Ion engines - there are several kinds, such as Hall Effect thrusters, electrostatic ion thrusters, and arcjets.  The basic idea is we inject gas into a chamber, ionize the gas, and then use an electric field to accelerate the gas out a nozzle.  The incredibly high escape velocities mean we can use a lot less fuel than with a conventional chemical rocket, but we need a powerful electric power source to run the engine.  That can come from solar power or nuclear power (for example). 4) Nuclear propulsion  - Project Orion is an example.  The premise is that we explode a nuclear bomb behind the vehicle and have the shockwave push us forward.  This is a natural transition to method #2. The two key examples for #2 are: 1) Solar sails - the basic idea is that the sun emits a lot of light.  Light has momentum.  Therefore that momentum can push us.  We erect a large sail to catch lots of light, and sail away.  There is also a theoretical design for a magnetic sail. 2) Gravity slingshots - technically not a propulsion method, but it is used to accelerate spacecraft.  The idea is that by closely approaching a large body, like a planet, we can steal some of the planet's momentum and accelerate ourselves.  We've used this on most of the outer solar system probes. There are other theoretical ideas, but the ones above are the ones that have been tested, practically. ",

            "answer_text": "Currently, propulsion systems in space consist mostly of monopropellant chemical thrusters.  Other ones also in use include resistojet thrusters, electrostatic thrusters, and Hall effect thrusters. Most American spacecraft still use chemical thrusters, while the electrical thrusters have been used a lot by Soviet bloc spacecraft. Most chemical thrusters are quite inefficient, require large masses of propellant for a given thrust, but the electric propulsion systems, while requiring little propellant mass, require large amounts of energy for a given thrust. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_propulsion ",
