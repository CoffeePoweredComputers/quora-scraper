            "answer_text": "Okay, this hits home for me, I need to enact my own advice because I spend too much time on Quora!  Mindfulness. - Be aware of your actions. All it takes is to stop and think for a moment before clicking a link. Every click. Stop. Feel your breath, look around the room. Check the time, and how long you've been in front of the computer. You will get more conscientious with practice, so it's a matter of constantly coming to a full stop before a click. Sometimes I even think to myself, how on earth did I get to a YouTube video of puppies bobbing their heads to techno music? I was searching for information about Dylan Thomas... With mindfulnes we get to hear these thoughts and take actions to stop browsing.Restrict your use. - If you're unable, there are apps that will do it for you. But I think we can all get qmlittle more proactive in our self-control issues, so my advice is Just Don't. Just don't go to Facebook twenty time a day. Go there five times, on a rough timeframe or schedule -twice on the morning, at lunch, once in the evening and once at night. Done!- so that the rest of the time you can spend it looking at the real world. I personally don't check my Facebook for months at a time (yeah, I'm that guy), but I feel free from the addiction. Curtail your bookmarks. - If you're already on an \"Every click. Stop\" kind of diet, it really helps to prioritize your browsing with bookmarks. I like to organize my bookmarks carefully, with as many folders as possible so that when I'm in the mood for reading I know where to browse, and if I need resources for writing I know where to go too. If you haven't categorized your most frequently visited pages into bookmarks do so. If you have, it's time to open the bookmark manager and see what's in there that's sucking out your brain. Move your most brain-sucking pages to a folder named BRAIN SUCKERS. At least when you want to browse YouTube you will have to see that tag and be forewarned.Set an offline schedule. - Yeah, I know, it sucks. But it works too. There is enough evidence backing this up, and i'm not quoting any sources, but schedules work if you make yourself follow them. Here's the deal. Set a schedule of oitdoor activitires, for as many hours as you spend online. Sure,'it's impossible. 'Cause we're addicts. But we should try. If I'm on quora for three hours straight, then I have to pay it off with three hours of pond side walks, mountain climbing, hiking, jogging, monkeybar-swinging. Whatever. Go with your partner or friend, especially if they're also web crawlers. Turn it off. - There's no easy way to say this. I know you love that laptop or tablet or phone, as if it were born of your very loins, but, turn it off. Like me, right now. The world outside the screen is in 3D and full of awesomeness. I've answered, so I'm going offline now. Thanks for the A2A! ",
