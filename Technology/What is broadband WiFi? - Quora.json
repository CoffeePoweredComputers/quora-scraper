            "answer_text": "Broadband and WiFi are generally two separate things. Broadband typically is a high speed internet connection from an ISP. It can be via cable, DSL, fiber-optic, or a wireless uplink. WiFi is a local wireless connection to a network. If the network has an active internet connection, you can reach the internet from the WiFi. Broadband in its most general sense just means wide band or high bandwidth. When configuring WiFi you can select channel used and the channel width. The wider the higher the potential throughput, but also the more likely you\u2019ll experience interference from other wireless signals nearby. Whatever channel you select for WiFi is just the center frequency of the section of spectrum being used. That is why 2.4GHz WiFi\u2019s most popular channels are 1, 6, and 11. They are far enough apart that they don\u2019t interfere with each other when using the typical channel width of 20 MHz. 2.4GHz WiFi can use a 40MHz width, but that changes which channels interfere with others.  5GHz WiFi has more channels and has channel widths up to 80MHz, or even higher. It is possible that broadband WiFi could be referring to WiFi using a larger channel width or just high throughput WiFi. WiFi 5 (802.11ac) and WiFi 6 (802.11ax) are both capable of speeds higher than 1Gbps in the right circumstances. ",

            "answer_text": "Before you can spot out the differences between both, you should know that WiFi is a wireless LAN technology that enables you to access the net. The downside is that it operates over open spectrum at low ranges which means that you need to stay either in the same room or nearby to use the WiFi. A few companies have even started boosting their WiFi signal so that customers can access the same over wider area. Broadband is also wireless, where you would be able to access your broadband connection through your phone or with broadband cable. The other down-side to WiFi is that it is often subject to interference which is not the case with broadband. Broadband enables you to connect online at high speeds; it comes with various options from ADSL, to cable that you can access at any time and also comes with a connection that is never switched off. It should be pointed out that while the terminology of broadband is not all that surprising, not many are aware of the fact that broad band\u2019s opposite term, narrowband has been used for dialups and modems alike. There are various advantages to both, which you may want to take a closer look at. But before that, you may want to know that WiFi essentially uses radio technology and is therefore subject to interference in case of severe solar storm, for example. With WiFi, connection is often established with the help of a router, and with the help of a wireless adapter to create hotspots. What\u2019s more, with WiFi is, you should be able to connect more than one device to the network, and once the WiFi is on, it should start emitting frequencies between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. What has helped to make WiFi popular is the fact that it is compatible with almost all operating systems and just about anything else. Just remember that if you are connecting online using WiFi, then you would be sharing the connection with many, and the speed may be limited depending on the strength of the signal. //Mohit_Dev ",
