            "answer_text": "Infor probably runs 28 to 30 different ERP programs, from companies acquired over the last 15 years or so. More company info in a 2015 answer here Gene Hammons's answer to What does a company called Infor do? So some Infor ERP products are quite good, some are not really supported for new sales at all - mostly sunsetted and Infor encourages current customers to move to the more supported and development oriented ERP packages. And while Infor has made some progress in new development over the past few years, they\u2019re still notoriously hard to work with - my consulting team helps companies evaluate, select and purchase ERP - and even though I one time was an Infor employee, I can\u2019t even buy Infor products without 2\u20134 weeks of trying to find the right sales team within the organization. Imagine how a company who doesn\u2019t do this for a living would fare? Latest word on the street is that Infor is focused on an upcoming IPO and that\u2019s the primary strategy of the current management - which makes sense because they\u2019re not exactly \u2018sales\u2019 focused. So - if you know which ERP products Infor is showcasing with new development and features, you can end up with a great ERP package. I\u2019d not attempt to get into the Infor forest without a guide who knows a bit about the company. ",
