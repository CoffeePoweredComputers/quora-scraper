            "answer_text": "No, not with any technology that\u2019s at all similar to what we have now. For three reasons: Step 1, the grapnel would have to stick. But there\u2019s no real-world device you can attach to a rope to make it easily spike into or hook onto or glue onto what it\u2019s shot against, so reliably that you could shoot the line and then risk your life swinging from it in the next second. Mythbusters tested this and completely busted it. (Real grapnels often have to be launched several times before they hook onto something, and carefully tested that they won\u2019t come loose. Spidey\u2019s weblines work because they automatically stick.)Step 2, you\u2019d need to swing and keep swinging. Even if the line stuck and you swung out from a building, can you carry enough cable to shoot another line and keep swinging, and then another and another? Without the miracle chemistry that makes a whole swing-line out of a couple of drops of web fluid, you\u2019d be stranded in midair.Step 3, you\u2019d need to land. But swinging anything more than a short distance builds up the kind of momentum that would smash a person all over a wall, unless they had spider-strength to catch themselves with. (And it helps if you could land anywhere on a wall and just stick there, and not worry about grabbing a ledge.)Proper web swinging would require shooting dozens of webs, that could stick to any part of the wall and never slip, to let the hero move in the right arcs to actually swing between buildings and keep going\u2014and still have the raw muscle to land. Note that the live-action Batman stories (unlike the comics and animation) mostly don\u2019t try to show Batman swinging. He only uses that \u201cStep 1 grapnel\u201d to zip up or down a wall but not out into the air, because that\u2019s just too unsafe for a stunt man to film\u2026 and even that always-quick-sticks grapnel shouldn\u2019t work. What you really could do is to shoot a line and take a minute to be sure it\u2019s secure, then swing from one building to the side of the next (or just maybe crash through its window), and stop there to climb up or down it. That\u2019s what a real Batman could do, and what soldiers actually do. Spider-Man swings freely among buildings, because his webs (and his muscles) are better than anything we can do with real technology. Hundreds of years from now it might be possible, but that would be science we can\u2019t even imagine now. ",
