More options doesn\u2019t hurt any buyer and due to the stiff competition, companies are required to maintain their standards. The Vector SmartWatch is up for release and it promises to be quite a device based on the flawless design and the most important feature that is a one month long battery. The good part about this smart watch is that it is the first ever SmartWatch which works for all three important Operating Systems : iOS, Android and Windows. Features of Vector SmartWatch:The Vectore SmartWatch was launched by the company at the Watch show Baselworld. The best feature stands out to be the promising 30 day battery which mocks the Apple Watch\u2019s battery that is supposed to last just a day or so. The Vector comes in two form factor types and is compatible with all major OS. You can choose to go with the rectangular Meridian design for the watch or the round faced Luna design. There is also an option to choose from the various steel and leather straps. The bands for both these watches are interchangeable. You would be surprised by the 30 day battery life that Vector boasts of. This long battery life is made possible by the combination of Monochrome memory LCD screens and the low power custom Operating System. Some more info about Vector:Vector is the creation of former Timex CEO Joe Santana who brought along with him Steve Jarvis ( infamous for the ugly Time Ironman and a former design head at Nike.) This team is completed by CTO Andrei Pitis. It was announced on 19th March and the watch is slated to ship to the public pretty soon. ",
