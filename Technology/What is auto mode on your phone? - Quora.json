            "answer_text": "There\u2019s more than one \u201cauto mode\u201d on many mobile phones today, one being where the screen automatically increases or reduces screen brightness due to the brightness/darkness of its surroundings. Another is where the display changes from portrait to landscape, depending on which way the phone is held, vertically or horizontally. Some phones automatically change their displays to \u201cnight mode\u201d, which is where blue light is removed. This is said to help in aiding sleep. Obviously the phone would revert back to normal daytime mode in the morning. ",
