I'm talking about hologram that you can see from any angle (360 degrees), but cannot touch it (like a ghost). Absolutely! I bet you\u2019re hoping for this, right?  However, when you say \u201ccan see from any angle\u201d I think you also mean \u2018projected\u2019 like in the above. Most holograms look like this:  By Georgy Palpurin ShareBulgaria team - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, File:Holographic autoportrait, Sofia.jpg Now, in the picture above, it doesn\u2019t look that good, but when you see them in person they are amazing - truly 3D, visible from any angle:  Full color holograms exist as well. Of course, because they are flat and hang from a wall, it\u2019s hard to get all the way behind them, so that might not fit your original question. If you are looking for a volumetric display, which you can walk around, which would also mean \u201cyou can see from any angle (360 degrees),\u201d then yes, they exist also and have for a while. See below:  By Haggispizza - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, File:VX1 DICOM.jpg They are called volumetric displays. Ok, grumpy rant: people often make up a terms when there\u2019s a perfectly good one already there (not you, you heard it from somewhere). Volumetric 3D displays are usually autostereoscopic, meaning you don\u2019t have to have 3D glasses on (not an HMD, I mean shutter glasses). HMD is what you\u2019re thinking of when you think VR Headset. Anyway - there\u2019s a lot of detail here, check it out: Volumetric display - Wikipedia TLDR; Yes, they exist, but they aren\u2019t really what you\u2019re thinking of; physics still makes it hard. They are called Volumetric Displays. ",
