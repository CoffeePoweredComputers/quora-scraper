            "answer_text": "It is the most appropriate one for the environment the house is in. Too often we look for simple, one shot answers to rather complex problems. The energy source for heat often carries very different economies and environmental impacts in different geographies. In some places a wood burning stove is most appropriate because burning wood is carbon neutral when the wood is locally sourced, but in a place where wood suitable for burning is scarce that solution wouldn't apply. Where gas is prolifically available it is often the most economic mechanism and it has advantages because it can be used to heat water on-demand rather than heating water unnecessarily. Solar thermal is good for heating water but it isn't economical for space heating because it can't be used at night. Electric space heating is generally not as economic as burning fuels locally. Where fuels are scarce or electricity is cheap then electric heating could be effective. Ground source heat pumps were fashionable a few years ago but they are expensive to implement and the efficiency of them has recently been questioned in comparison to simpler and cheaper air-source heat pumps.

Both use passive solar principles and thermal mass to heat and cool a house. The Earthships maintain an internal temperature between 60F to 70F  all year long in an environment where it get triple digits during the day in the summer and freezing at night in the winter. Earthship Biotecture - Radically Sustainable Buildings  This is the website of someone I know. They do beautiful houses. There is a fancy three story straw bale house Howard did in Chattanooga.
