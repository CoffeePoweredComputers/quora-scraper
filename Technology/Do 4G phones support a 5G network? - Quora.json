            "answer_text": "Absolute it would \u201csupport\" 5G. I remembered how American carrier propaganda their 4G years ago. In China, all 3G, no matter UMTS 384kbps/3.6Mbps or HSPA 7.2Mbps or HSUPA 14.4Mbps, or even further HSPA+(21mbps) and last DC-HSPA+ in 2013(42Mbps, it is actually faster than many USA carrier's 4G). China Unicom ceased their plan to develop last edition 3G (84Mbps) due to 4G LTE first Gen came out and it was only 100Mbps\u2026 Then, I came to USA for my college. Dear TMobile told me HSUPA is 4G, and 3G is a particular network UMTS(384Kbps)\u2026. Same thing would happen again. Real 4G/LTE have 3 edition 2014 LTE, 100mbps DL, 50Mbps UL Then LTE Advance, 300\u2013600M Finally LTE Advance Pro, would goes up to 1.4Gbps. And the first Gen 5G would be 100Mbps at least. It would not be that amazing. It is just a marketing trick.however, after 2\u20133years. 5G would beat all 4G. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not quite clear to me, what you actually ask. one fundamental statement to begin with: despite all the marketing propaganda of the operators, there is not a single 5G network up and running out there. 5G standard has just been released by 3GPP (this summer!) and still needs to get ITU-R approval. Spectrum is being auctioned \u201cas we speak\u201d; i.e. 2019 in most countries. Rollout of commercial network kit will start in 2020, and will not be complete before 2025 for the first wave. At which time we will already see a 6G on the horizon (:-). No functioning 5G phone is available in stores. 5G macro technology is very closely related to 4G \u2014 actually it is a continuation of 4G. But some of the physical parameters are changing to allow for higher bandwidth and shorter latency. An NO, you current 4G phone will not support communication with 5G networks. But there will be 4G around for quite a while, as there is still 3G and 2G out there. Forthcoming 5G phones will surely support 4G (by means of extra antennas and receivers) but not the other way round. ",

            "answer_text": " Image : Credit 5G is nothing but the next generation of 4G technology and hence all the 5G phones should be backward compatible with 4G just like the previous generations of 3G and 2G. So as far as a 5G phone is concerned it should work seamlessly with carriers that support 4G. However, you must remember that if you are using a carrier that only supports 4G you are not using your 5G phone optimally in that situation because you are compromising on the 5G speeds by using your 5G phone on a 4G carrier. But it is also a matter of fact that 5G is still at a developmental stage and there is also some time left before the commercial rollout of 5G and mass production of 5G phone begins. So there is nothing to worry about as all the 5G phones will work on carriers that only support 4G.  Hope it helps! OKportal Technology ",

To use 4G you must have a phone that has support for 4G services. This is the same case in 5G . You have to buy a 5G supported phone. If you look in smartphone market brands like samsung, oppo, oneplus and others have started preparations for 5G . It is because of the given/integrated modem in the phone if it has the support of 5G services you'd be able to use 5G and if not go for a smartphone that support 5G otherwise i don't think there is any way..
