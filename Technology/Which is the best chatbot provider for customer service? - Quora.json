            "answer_text": "Currently, the market is flooded with various chatbot platforms aimed for customer service. Most of them integrate with Messenger, and if you want to use a bot only on this channel, you can pick and choose. However, if you need a bot that can serve customers on your site, Messenger and other communication channels, the range of tools that can help to solve your problem is much smaller. I don\u2019t know exactly what kind of functionalities you\u2019re looking for, however, when it comes to chatbot platforms for customer service, in good conscience, I can recommend ChatBot. It\u2019s a multiplatform framework that enables you to set up bots on Messenger, Slack, or LiveChat without coding. You can also connect it with other tools with Zapier. The app comes with ready to use chatbot templates and tutorials thanks to which even rookie builders can set up bots with ease. However, if needed, your dev team can make use of the webhooks or the open API to extend the functionalities of the platform. I tested ChatBot and think that its features can be a great help for customer service teams. Rich messages Bots created using the tool can send not only text but also rich messages (buttons, product cards, or carousels) that help to show off lists of options, articles, products, and services. But most importantly, they offer users a choice. In effect, the service provided by the bot is personalized and results in better user experience.  The web view in the chat window What\u2019s more, ChatBot allows you to open a web view to load any web application inside an ongoing chat. Namely, your users can display an interactive calendar and schedule a meeting in the chat window, manage the shopping cart, authorize transactions, view articles or even watch support tutorials on YouTube without leaving the window. I think that this functionality rocks and makes the experience a sight better. Chat transfer Additionally, ChatBot supports customer service teams by handling simple cases; however, whenever it\u2019s needed, the bot can transfer a customer to a human agent. Thanks to this, the work in your team can be wisely divided: the bot takes care of repetitive cases and spams, and you engage only into bigger problems. Reporting It\u2019s vital to mention that ChatBot was equipped with good reporting and users sections. Its dashboard shows a list of people that have chatted with your bot, their names, email addresses, collected attributes, and more. Moreover, users collected by ChatBot can be added to custom lists, sent to your mailing lists or databases and utilized for your sales or marketing purposes. All in all, I reckon that it's the tool worth testing. Footnotes [1] https://www.begindot.com/best-chatbots-for-small-business/ ",
