            "answer_text": "Well here in Australia the European trucks have a few followers who are prepared to pay astronomical prices for spare parts and wait weeks to source some metric bolt that no-one stocks. We had Mercedes for a while and the V\u2019 series engines were a total flop with things like constantly breaking injector lines and \u201coil Leaks\u201d not to mention the electrical Nightmare of \u201cElectric Everything\u201d. To give you an example of parts cost when back in the 1970\u2019s I was charged $525.00 for a Stalk mounted light switch that goes on the side of the steering column. Maybe you can justify paying $125.00 each for wheel-studs which will cost maybe ten bucks each for a Mack. I don't know where you got the idea that Euro-Trash is economical as we were running V10 Mercedes alongside of V8 Cummins in International [Navistar] and the the 903 Cummins was never economical but it used less fuel than the Mercedes and led it all the way down the road. When the ambient temperature gets up over 100 degrees then the Mercedes would overheat if you wanted it to actually hook in and Pull in those conditions. Maybe there were some Modifications necessary for using them in hot weather. Another drawback was their resale value was zero. Scania on the other hand seem to perform rather well out here and although I have never been near one myself I haven't heard any negative feedback about them and they have been out here for probably 40 years. However I won't even comment on \u201cVolvo\u201d and to anyone who has a Volvo may I say \u201cDeepest Sympathy\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "American trucks for the most part have an extended hood from what I have seen European trucks are cab over engine, American trucks are no longer built that way because of the ruff ride cab overs produce here in the states also driving a conventional yields more miles per gallon also remember that conventional trucks are by far easier to work on. Last I checked America dominates in the conventional area of trucks. Accidents in a conventional are usually survivable but cab overs are usually fatal. Which is where the phrase first one on the scene of an accident comes from. If the European market wants to sell us cab overs we'll buy em because we love nostalgic trucks cars but they better step up their game because conventional trucks are here to stay! ",

They can come with an incredible number of bells and whistles. Or can be basic day cabs with only the essentials. 600HP is about the highest factory truck you'll find with very few exceptions. 425-500 I'd far more common. I've read about some pretty crazy high output MB rigs over the pond. ",
