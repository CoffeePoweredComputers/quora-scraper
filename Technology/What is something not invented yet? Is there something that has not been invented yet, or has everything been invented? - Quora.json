            "answer_text": " Wrist watch multimeter It seems like anytime you want a multimeter, you don\u2019t have one. Existing models remain the size of a sandwich, but if you look under the cover the electronics inside the huge case are tiny and all in one corner. In all the world, not a single electronics company will listen to their customers, even after it some grad students built one, no one would produce it. I would pay a lot for this function in a wrist watch, but no one is willing to make one.   Socket bit screwdriver set \u2013 lost technology This was the best multitool screwdriver and socket driver I\u2019ve ever seen, but it went out of production and it really shouldn\u2019t have. I have no pictures of the device itself, so I\u2019ll list out the features as seen in other similar products. First off it had a three inch long, square drive shaft with a spring loaded ball bearing on the end like this: Bitts stored in the handle like this ^, and three double ended socket drivers that rode on the shaft at all times size (16mm,-14mm), (13mm-12mm), and (10mm - bit driver) for the bits in the handle. The three sockets together let you press down on a socket and carried the force to the handle while the spring loaded ball on the tip kept the bits from falling off. To change bit size the user would slide off all three sockets, rearrange them to put the needed socket on the end and slide them all back onto the shaft. This one tool fit easily in any toolbox and did most of what a socket set does but without the heavy brief case full of sockets.  Household sized VLM for storing kitchen gear, shop tools and clutter. How nice would it be to have not one kitchen counter or shop workbench, but five or ten or twenty, all with power and tools set out and ready for use? These are already widely used in industry, but no one makes a house hold version yet. And while this isn\u2019t technically an invention\u2026 Tax incentives for designing cars that are easier to repair Anyone who has ever repaired their own car knows how unnecessarily difficult they are to diagnose and repair. Engine bays are far too small, parts are designed for ease of manufacture, not ease of replacement, and the OBD2 system has all the speed and graphics of a DOS computer from 1985. Modern computers are capable of very advanced diagnostics, and repairability can be designed in, but at present there is no reason for any of the auto makers to do so. The poor and poorly educated in our economy seldom have the luxury of buying new cars. They, those most vulnerable to scams and most in danger of job loss and financial collapse due to automotive breakdowns are the group who get to maintain and repair our oldest and most worn out vehicles. Those better off can learn or pay someone to repair their cars, but those most affected by reparability are also the least prepared to cope. I would propose changing the tax structure for the auto companies \u2013 not raising or lowering taxes, just shifting the balance. If a company turns out cars that are easy to repair, they pay less tax. If a company makes cars that require unbolting the engine and 6 hours of work just to change the spark plugs, they pay more taxes. The total tax income in a year doesn\u2019t change, but each year a representative sample of vehicles are submitted to undergo common repairs, and the ones that make the mechanics wish for a flame thrower cost their parent company more in taxes.
