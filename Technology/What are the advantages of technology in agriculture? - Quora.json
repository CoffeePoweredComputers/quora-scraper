            "answer_text": "Agricultural technology bring about so many improvements to the world of agriculture, which without the world of today won't survive. Among these are;  Production of resistance variety :Lets take a good example. A bacterium known as \u201dBacillus Thuringiensis\u201d acts like a reservoir , it enables crops to be insect-resistant , so these genetically modified crops will grow without any interference from pests.Use of machines : with machines nowadays a farmer is able to cultivate a large area of land within a short period of time May be within few days depending on the land area. Unlike the prior system when you will see fivety men cultivating a single land.Animal feed : most animals of the current system are provided with a balanced diet that contain all the necessary nutrients. Campared to our animals years back, when you hardly found an animal with a full body condition score.Hybrid production :Most of these genetically produced animals will produce more milk or fur compared to normal animals. This benefits the farmer because their production will be high. Cross breeding is very good in animal grazing, cross breed animals are more strong and productive. These hybrids grows faster and yield more than the local ones.Irrigation technology : before agricultural commodities are seasonally produced, but With the exposure to the technology agricultural production continously flows. Advanced water sprinklers are being used to irrigate big farms and this helps the crops get enough water which is essential in their growth. Some farmers mix nutrients in this water, so also improves on the growth of these crops.Improved transportation system :With modern transportation, consumers in Dubai will consume a fresh carrots from Africa with in the same day that carrot lives the garden in Africa. Modern transportation technology facilities help farmers easily transport fertilizers or other farm products to their farms, and it also speeds the supply of agricultural products from farms to the markets where consumers get them on a daily basis.Pest and disease control : with the evolution of agricultural technology control of pest and disease becomes easier. Currently now symptoms and signs of disease are clearly known and the majors for control and prevention are provided. Many pesticides are developed.Improved variety: similar to hybrid in animals improved variety in plant are a product of crosses between different plants varieties. These yield more, matures very early and depending on the character improvement mostly yield lager fruits. A clearer examples is seen in our nowadays mangoes, guava, and cashews etc.Lastly with the increasing population of the world which is espected to reach about ten billion in the 2055. Without introducing agricultural technology everything will collapse, because taking the current issue into consideration not everywhere in the world is food secured with a good example being most of the African countries. What make them food in-secured is the failure to adopt technology in their production (both livestocks and crop). Surely technology is needed to overcome problems like increasing the urbanization that reduce agricultural land, increasing birth rate, and the issue of droughts. Good luck.",

            "answer_text": "Technology has the potential to help farmers in terms of access to profitable markets, access to finance, and access to quality inputs at the right times of the season. For example, in Rwanda, the Ministry of Agriculture has been tracking input needs and markets over time, and has worked with financial institutions here to work along the value chain to provide fertilizers, seeds, and other necessities at the right time, in the right amounts - and of quality - throughout the season. At the same time, there are NGOs tracking market prices and developing systems (here it would be USSD), that help farmers to access that information. I know that there are several - eSoko and another developed by World Vision - currently being tested. There is a ton of potential. To some extent, just having a phone and internet access combined with knowing how to use these for business makes a huge difference for farmers who have traditionally farmed mostly for their own consumption, but to some extent for sale. Just to let you know, this is an area that is ripe for a breakthrough in tech. I do quite a bit in terms of product design and helping people to understand their capacity for credit, for example, but I\u2019m not a techie. But an enterprising person with a tech background who could find the right partner here would be able to make a major change in the way ag works in Africa. ",
