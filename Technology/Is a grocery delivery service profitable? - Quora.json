BUT this is just one perspective; the Toronto market will be differentmy reference is for nationwide operations operating at scale; it may be that 99% of Torontonians will not pay you to deliver groceries at C$10 a delivery. BUT 1%WILL, AND YOU CAN MAKE MONEY FROM THATSome might recognise this as \u201cturnover is vanity, profit is sanity\u201dis it regular groceries, to regular homes, with regular delivery, or are there some high value niches?for example, deliver healthy, homemade soups to offices, where office workers have made a new year\u2019s resolution to eat healthily, might be a profitable niche or specialism you can exploit right nowor for elderly people who don't want to go out in the cold, and want you to collect prescription medicines at the same timeor for \u201cwealthy\u201d but tired and busy (new?) mothersGood luck in your endeavours.
