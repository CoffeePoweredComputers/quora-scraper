            "answer_text": "The self-driving feature in cars will definitely take over. Cars WITHOUT a manual override option are a long way ahead though. Imagine the following scenarios: It's Friday 6:00 pm and you are leaving the office. You reach the door of the office building and the car is waiting for you with its doors open. Your wife is already in there and your kids are in your wife\u2019s car right behind. You get in, the windows go dark, you pull down the TV screen attached to the roof and choose the Netflix title of your choice. The seat turns into a bed and you go to sleep. The car alarm clock rings and the blinds slowly open. You watch the ocean waves hit the shore and thank god for the invention of the self-driving car.You go for a few drinks after work. You drink a little too much. You grab your phone and yell \u201cSiri, bring my ride!\u201d. The car comes to the door of the pub, you jump into the backseat and pass out only to be awaken at your garage in the morning by the car!Your teenage kid comes back from a party at 4 a.m. You program your car to pick them up at 3:50 a.m. By 4:30 the car calls you to tell that your kids are safely delivered at home with footage of them getting out of the car.You get to a restaurant. The valet is charging 10 bucks to treat your ride poorly and change the driver's seat and mirrors configuration. You simply jump out of the car and it goes to find a parking lot by itself. By the end of the meal, you take a look at your phone and see that the car is parked five minutes away. You call it while paying the bill. By the time you are outside of the restaurant, the car is waiting you with its doors open.You purchase a state-of-the-art self-driving electric RV and prepare it to a month long European tour. In the middle of a night drive you decide that you want to play a video-game with your children, or you feel like taking a better look at the view in the right side of your window, or dinner is ready. You put it on auto-pilot and go do your thing. While you\u2019re visiting the destination, the RV will go look for an outlet to charge itself for the next leg of the trip.Wouldn't you want those features as an option? I know I would! And that\u2019s just in the personal-car markets. If you count the millions of commercial drivers that could be replaced by the technology, it\u2019s really a no-brainer.  ",

            "answer_text": "There was a highly ridiculed Quora thread in 1912 that asked if automobiles were the future. Horse heads (people that were really into modding horses, not the actual horse heads themselves) were outraged. They saw the rickety, raucous buggies bumbling along, smoke billowing and owners cursing, and were convinced it was all hokum. Unrelated and decades later, a host of thoughtful, intelligent scientists and engineers announced that few people would ever own a computer. They were the size of a room, the cost of a house, and less useful than a canker sore. The impossibilities of yesterday are stacking up as the common of today. We continue to find that if physics doesn\u2019t explicitly limit something, it\u2019s likely going to come to pass sometime. The moon? Been there. Test tube babies? Common. Artificial body parts? Coming along slow, but steady (humans are tough to experiment on). The list keeps growing. Let\u2019s face it, if we could make cars ever safer, climbing that linear path toward mishap-free conveyances that anyone can operate, afford, and maintain, we\u2019d be doing that. That\u2019s not happening. These last 10 years are as safe as we\u2019ve been in almost the last century, but we have continued to kill and maim at high rates. We\u2019ve modified and improved every aspect of the vehicle save one: the operator. Until we do that, we\u2019re going to continue to condemn millions every year to death or debilitation. Unfortunately, no one is willing to invest in better mandatory, periodic training and harsher penalties for transgressions (which is understandable when 75% of people consider themselves superior drivers). When you look at the amount of resources being thrown at the computer side of the problem, it\u2019s astounding that so many people are pessimistic about the outcome. We live in the age of miracles! Of course, we also live in the age of the Kardashians and Twitter trolls, so I can see how it might be easier to just assume the worst. Since we don\u2019t have very good auto-driving systems now, it\u2019s easy to be blinded by the slow progress. This might be rooted in our view of the past. Progress has been going at a certain pace, so it\u2019s natural so extrapolate that, making it look like a linear climb. But that\u2019s not how progress works. It\u2019s exponential. People in ancient Greece would likely fit in pretty well with those living in the 17th century, but our founding fathers would freak out if you dropped them into 1945. A couple decades ago my grandparents couldn\u2019t even get their VCRs to stop flashing 12:00. Today, our kids don\u2019t have to plan anything, because they can text and access maps on the fly in real time.  Auto driving is not only going to be \u201cthe future,\u201d (echo-y voice), but it\u2019s going to come quicker than most realize. Once cars can drive around on nice streets on clear days (meaning right now), they are going to really learn what driving is like in the real world. There may be times when the conditions are such that they have to pull over, but that\u2019s only going to be because they are programmed better than we are and have a realization of the risks at every point in the drive. They aren\u2019t going to pound a few beers and head home based on having done so dozens of times before. They aren\u2019t going to forget to look left and just pull out absentmindedly due to changing the radio because it\u2019s the Perry Como hour. They aren\u2019t going to have this inherent optimistic blind spot that we have (\u201cI just assume that person coming at me sees me, too, and will stay in the other lane\u201d). I love to drive (and I\u2019m better than average at it). Of course, I don\u2019t love to drive in bumper to bumper traffic, nor in poor conditions at night. I\u2019d also like to have a beer when watching the game from the nice little brewery down the street and not walk home in the rain. It would also be nice sometimes if I could just send the car to pick up my daughter from practice. Once folks get a taste of these aspects, auto-driving cars are going to be like cinnamon-maple pancakes with a side of bacon and sex. Soon, it\u2019s going to be nice to be able to finish reading another of Tim\u2019s dumb Quora answers (not the ones from the \u201860s\u2014too much LSD and free love) while you head to work. Then there will be a thousand better things to do instead of juggling 370,000 joules of death, Facebook, and that cat in your lap. The adoption is going to be slow at first, like everything else, then rise rapidly, curtailing off toward the top as the hold-out Luddites pay to drive on private roads (which will pop up, like amusement parks). As soon as the insurance expense climbs high enough, the few who don\u2019t see the benefits will be economically forced in. Once legislation opens up the roads\u2014which is already happening\u2014and as cities vie for the obvious benefits of fewer fatalities, less traffic, and more productive citizens, we\u2019ll see the sluice gates open and all the cool kids will be doing it. As soon as I can get in my electric car and tell it to take me to get pancakes and sex, I\u2019ll know I\u2019m living in the future.  I\u2019m adding the bad stuff below the fun comic. During this change, because Autos are going to adhere to the rules of the road and safety aspects, traffic is going to get worse. The early adopters, especially, are going to have a rough go at it. Drivers will be cutting them off, boxing them in, and shunting them farther and farther back in traffic. There will eventually need to be laws that restrict the most egregious actions, like teams of drivers boxing in and stopping Autos for a lark (maybe even to highjack them, but with all the cameras, it\u2019s going to be well-documented). It\u2019s going to be ugly and if you think the large trucks \u201cicing\u201d electric charging stalls and \u201crolling coal\u201d over EVs is bad, you haven\u2019t seen anything. Once the technology takes off and really starts messing with the American love affair with driving, what hits the fan will be wet and loose. ",
