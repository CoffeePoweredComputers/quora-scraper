            "answer_text": "Lived as a student in both the cities, currently working in Singapore now. So, here is my opinion: This question is subjective, so forgive if my opinion is not the same as yours. You can choose what are important to you, and decide. Weather and cityscape:To live in a place is different from touring one. So weather and cityscape are important to be noted.  Source: NEA (Singapore). Dubai: It is sometimes not so hot, but very hot otherwise! But, January-February is the best time to tour because the climate is better, and there\u2019s the city-wide Dubai Sale. Singapore: Temperature is pretty much the same throughout the year - humid and hot. Rains though, are never consistent, with stormy evenings common after a sultry day. Yet, you can go out a bit more comfortably with just an umbrella and sunglasses unlike Dubai. Singapore is called the Garden city and rightly so. By law, buildings need to have as much greenery on them as it was before any construction. So it is not difficult to spot apartments with trees on balconies. Dubai, I feel, is very artificial even with their splurge on fountains and gardens to convince you that it is not a desert. Public transportation is better in Singapore too. Round 1: Singapore 2. Cost of living:  (Source within the picture) Dubai: It is not even on this list of World\u2019s most expensive cities as on Mar 2017. Malls are bigger and Dubai is coming up with a \u2018mall city\u2019 for the future. Food diversity is better, but public eating during Ramadan is not allowed. You could rent condos in Dubai for the price of a single cramped room in Singapore. Cheaper to own a car. Dubai is tax-free on incomes, while you will have to pay extra for certain Government fees and such. Yet, you can still save a lot. It is mandatory for foreign MNC/businesses to partner with local companies in Dubai, and it comes with its own set of challenges. Singapore: The most expensive in the World. Individual income tax is not too high though. And, you could earn accordingly as well. For companies and entrepreneurs, Singapore is better to operate in, given the ease of doing business there and the civil laws in place. Round 2: Dubai for people (Singapore for businesses) 3. People and culture: Dubai: Islam is the major religion. Yet, Dubai is one of the most liberal places you can stay at. It is very safe for women. As long as you don\u2019t scratch their backs, you are fine. Most people are expats. But, it\u2019s always better not to get in trouble with the locals. I have had some racist encounters while they have preference for whites. No expat, unless permitted by the Kingdom, can become a citizen and stay here indefinitely. Even if you were born in Dubai but to non-locals, even if you lived 50 years of your life, you would need to leave once you retire. Singapore: Mostly Chinese influenced, but a lot of expats live here as well. It is as liberal but less intrusive compared to Dubai. Also, the people, especially the younger generations are more westernized, so people from some countries might find this more suitable and easy. Very crowded though, as it is an island-country with more people but less space. I have never faced any racist encounters in my time here. Also, it is as safe as Dubai for women. You could easily exhaust all entertainment/outing options in a few weeks in both the cities. But Singapore is closer to many other places like Bali, Thailand, Cambodia and more. Singapore has Sentosa too if you have enough money to spend on entertainment. Permanent Residency is possible but chances are slimmer compared to other countries because of the size of the country. Round 3: Singapore 4. Education: Dubai is not bad by any means, but Singapore is known for its existing educational centres, which are one of the best in the region. But Dubai is coming strong with its dedicated \u2018Academic city\u2019. Still, it is far from the quality and exposure one can get from Singaporean ones. Round 4: Singapore 5. Freedom of expression and press: UAE has not signed numerous Human Rights treaties though it is a member of the UN. By law, freedom of speech and press are restricted. That\u2019s just how this part of the world works, and if it\u2019s not for you, better to stay away. Singapore isn\u2019t very different as well. Though punishments by law differ. Again, it is how these countries have built their justice systems to be like. If you are a foreign national, better to stay away if it does not suit you. Round 5: Tie (Though United Arab Emirate ranks better as per Press Freedom Index) In conclusion, while Dubai is a great place for a vacation filled with great shopping or a career focused on money, Singapore is equally good or sometimes better in every other aspect.

            "answer_text": "Singapore. Note: This is a very broad question and there are a number of other answers on Quora that explore the benefits of both Singapore and Dubai against specific, yet highly subjective criteria such as food, healthcare, transport, cost of living, family-friendliness, working conditions and safety. Clearly, \u2018a better city\u2019 means different things to different people in different contexts. So here are some comparisons drawn using four \u2018meta-attributes\u2019 that I believe define the foundations of a modern, world city: 1. Social and civic equitability Dubai, like the other GCC and MENA nations, looks largely to Islamic Shariah law as the basis for its legal and civic framework. For those who do not practise the faith, this system creates an unequal playing field. When Dubai chose Shariah law and coupled it with the doctrine of Arabization and the practice of Kafala (where a foreign worker\u2019s entry, exit and movements within the labour market are regulated by a sponsor), it drastically lowered its ability to become a truly equitable society, especially for the foreign majority that it desperately needed to help run the country. Singapore was founded on the principle of keeping religion and State separate. This simple but powerful choice allowed it to provide an equitable basis for all people, regardless of religion or ethnicity. The rule of law reigns supreme and everyone is equal under the constitution. In turn, the country was able to meld differing cultures and social behaviours into a harmonious social advantage. 2. Natural environment and ecosystem Dubai is built on a desert that sees temperatures soar to excess of 45\u00b0 C in the summer. The struggle to keep the city looking clean and well-moistened is evident. The desert is not going anywhere and whatever urban planning and improvements Dubai makes (amazing as they may be) will have to contend with the unforgiving odds of a desert clime and its vicious sandstorms. Singapore is a tropical island with a consistently warm climate, plenty of rainfall and fertile soil. It is filled with a variety of naturally-occuring flora and fauna. This creates a certain natural \u2018balance\u2019 for the humans who live and work here, offers higher attractiveness as an international destination and presents several avenues for simple, everyday enjoyments that may be difficult in Dubai (e.g. daytime outdoor sports and family activities in the summer). The country recently topped the charts for maximum % of urban green spaces and canopy cover, effectively putting paid to the notion that \u2018Singapore is a concrete jungle\u2019. 3. National governance and leadership Dubai is an absolute monarchy. It relies on privately nominated members of various councils to manage state affairs. The success of this style of governing is contingent upon, and limited to, the merits, abilities and availabilities of specific individuals. And while one may view this system as a necessity given Dubai\u2019s unique political history and culture, it comes with a high degree of inherent subjectivity and bias. In the absence of vox populi, the system cannot attempt to guarantee the adequacy and proficiency of the government machinery as a whole. Singapore has a highly effective and credible governance capability that, for the past 50 years, has not only charted the country\u2019s course to economic prosperity but has also become a paragon of modern nation-building. Several other nations, including Dubai, have modelled whole or parts of their national governance mechanisms after Singapore. Its leaders are elected on the basis of merit, via a democratic voting process and are highly incentivised to perform at world-class levels of excellence. Corruption is dealt with swiftly and severely and the national image is upheld at all times by those who serve the constitution. 4. Human and citizen development Dubai relies largely on an expatriate workforce base (~85%) to attend to most capital-intensive development efforts and run the country\u2019s infrastructure and services. Its citizen base (~15%) is highly dependent on foreign labour as well as state-sponsored subsidies and funding. There is a clear divide between these two groups and the former has little to no chance of finding a pathway to citizenship. While the going has generally been good for most Emirati citizens in Dubai, this skewed demographic is a dependency and a severe concentration risk that is not likely to help in the long run. Singapore derives its strong work ethic from the many immigrants who came to the island from the various Malayan provinces, China and India - all of whom found (and still continue to find) a pathway to citizenship. These citizens contribute to a state coffer via a central provident fund and have their \u2018skin in the game\u2019. An established, merit-based selection of foreign talent has helped augment the majority citizen and permanent resident base (~70%) that can be relied on to run the country\u2019s essential infrastructure and services. In addition, Singapore has placed a long-run emphasis on all levels of education, advanced research, innovation, sports and nutrition, mandatory military service for males (which in itself is a great inculcator of national values and personal development) and a result-oriented work ethic where dignity of labour (be it as a waiter, taxi driver, teacher or businessman) is recognised and respected. Summary Singapore is a city that has been, and will always be, reinventing itself. Singapore was born and forged in a tumultuous age of South East Asian history. It saw British colonial rule in the 1800s, barbaric Japanese occupation during WWII, an unceremonious expulsion from the Federation of Malaya in 1965, civil strife and communist insurgency in the 60s as well as a barrage of economic struggles on its way to attaining its present state. The one consistent feature in Singapore\u2019s meteoritic rise has been the need to change and evolve in a hostile neighbourhood. Singapore\u2019s government is deeply aware of how fragile the nation is and does what it does because it has to, not just because it can. The nation believes in the power of education, merit, integrity, hard work and wealth as necessary ingredients for overall nation-building. For this reason alone, I believe Singapore will chart its future successfully in its voyage to becoming \u2018a better city\u2019. ",
