            "answer_text": "It depends on what you want a watch for. Do you just need a discreet way to check the time? Buy a normal watch. Do you work out? Buy a smartwatch. Beyond that, it gets complicated (ha ha watchmaking pun). A smartwatch is a wrist-mounted computer, not just a watch, and you can get very creative with complications. Games, custom watch faces, messages and notifications, health monitoring \u2014 there\u2019s a ton of things that a smartwatch is good for that a regular watch can\u2019t do. But smartwatches also have a reputation for being bland or outright ugly, and because they\u2019re tiny computers, they wear out fast, especially their LiIon batteries. They aren\u2019t casual purchases, and buying one is a commitment to an ecosystem. Hybrid smartwatches take some of the pressure off, but also limit the functionality you have available. Regular watches can\u2019t hope to give you the same functionality, but they are also not going to give you as many problems, plain and simple. Most need a battery change every few years, but solar-powered watches rarely do, and mechanical watches have no batteries to change. Watches have existed for a good five hundred years, so you have many options regarding style, price point, technology, and even how they\u2019re worn; in addition to wrist and pocketwatches, there are watches that clip onto hiking packs, watches built into tools like rulers and multitools, and even little stick-on clocks that you can put on your refrigerator or a desk lamp that probably qualify as watches. It\u2019s really down to your needs. If you wear a watch strictly as jewelry, there\u2019ll be little point in buying a smartwatch; that\u2019s really the only hard and fast rule I can give you. Otherwise it\u2019s a question of budget and the functions you need. ",
