            "answer_text": "Yes, that could very well mean that we'll never go back to normal. I am a nurse practitioner currently working in an ER in Houston Texas. We have been wearing masks even in the nurses station since the middle to the end of February. We have discussed this exact topic at length amongst our colleagues and coworkers. I'm not sure that we will ever see a time where we can safely walk around without a mask. The covid 19 virus is still very new and we still have a lot to learn about the virus as a medical community, But one thing that we do know for sure at this point is it does not seem to be affected by warm weather like the flu virus. With that in mind it is very possible that this virus will continue to spread throughout the world and it may become just something that is a everyday thing. The thing about viruses as they're very quick to mutate. They are made of simple RNA sequences which allows them to mutate and adapt much more quickly than even bacteria which are single celled organisms. Just think about how long the aids virus has been affecting the human population. We are just now starting to get a handle on it and being able to treat it properly to get viral loads down to an undetected level. Why this is important is because the aids virus affects the T cells in the human body. The T cells in a human's immune system aid in developing immunity. Without an immune system to fight it, the aids virus has had no reason to mutate so therefore hasn't changed much if at all since it was first introduced to the human population. So in short the aids virus hasn't had a need to mutate because it kills the body's ability to remember it and work against it and it's taken approximately 40 plus years to develop a treatment that works effectively. Now when you think about covid that has already been proven to have mutated , this virus is likely to continue to mutate and change making vaccine development and reinfection a very likely possibility. Our best guess as a medical community at this point is the coronavirus will be here for a very long time and will hopefully end up mutating in a way that makes it weaker rather than stronger so that we can overcome it. But if you're asking if I think that we will get back to a normal that we enjoyed in late 2019 I highly doubt that will occur anytime soon. So get used to your masks and get used to a different way of life. I wish you and everyone the best of luck and I hope you stay safe out there. Remember there's a lot more to this virus then what the mainstream media portrays and it is certainly survivable for most people. Use due diligence and common sense and hopefully as a society we can over come this. ",

            "answer_text": "COVID-19 (a coronavirus) is comparable to FIP in cats (also a coronavirus) with a similar pathogenesis where the main problem is the allergic reaction to the virus. FIP in cats has been around since at least 1970. However, since cats are solitary individuals, with few benefits of Herd Health, then this might explain its persistence. And concerning a cat vaccine, an intranasal FIP vaccine, which came out during the 1980\u2019s, well, it simply doesn\u2019t work. In fact it has been suggested that it could even cause the disease itself. And this is based on the fact that like COVID-19 it's mainly the allergic reaction to the virus that causes its severe pathogenicity. Thus the appropriate treatment would be dexamethasone to suppress the allergic reaction, as originally suggested. But hospitalization seems to be the preferred treatment, not to mention the huge profit for hospitals at $3k-$5k/day. Another factor is the rapid mutation rate of a virus. Keep in mind that a virus does not want to kill its host, for then it too dies. The goal of all parasitic infections is to achieve symbiosis. It\u2019s simply a matter of time for the less virulent form of any virus to spread from one individual to another, and the Herd Health immunity will achieve this better than isolation. Also keep in mind that viruses are a part of our human genome, where through billions of years, many adenoviruses, retroviruses, and others form an integral part of our ability to manufacture proteins at the ribosomal level - the essence of life itself. A deadly virus is simply one that hasn\u2019t adjusted to its new host. And it too will die out leaving the mutated less virulent forms to replicate and spread to other hosts, also known as Herd Immunity. One final thought: Evolution and the biological advancement of the all species is based on the culling of the herd where the strong survive and the weak parish, thus ensuring that future generations will be stronger and more able to survive. And everything from wolves preying upon herbivores, to wars and viruses in humans, Darwin\u2019s Law facilitates this process. However, we do have science and medical advances to replace this natural evolutionary process, and with advances in CRISPR/cas9 we can change our DNA and thus eventually put an end to most diseases. And it has had success in crop technology, the outcome of which is known derisively as \u201cFranken foods\u201d, which are actually far superior to those of the natural evolutionary species. And vaccines aren\u2019t always the best answer, some can actually cause the disease. Killing the virus or interrupting its ability to reproduce is far superior. Thus antiviral drugs similar to the AIDS concoction of anti-virials may achieve superior success. Conclusion: if you are young, healthy, and active, then cast off your mask, mingle with the crowd, and follow the example set by Sweden. Their death rate is on the decline due to the benefits of Herd Health. But this is an election year and Biden plus the democrats are swift to pounce on Trump and the Republicans. And it\u2019s working, where they are ahead in the poles. And squinty-eyed Joe continues to blame Trump for his lack of ability to \u201csquash the coronavirus\u201d. Politics as usual, but in the process the self-serving democrats are ruining the economy. BTW: I have no political affiliations, just a casual observer drawing conclusions based on gathering a variety of opinions and facts in the field of virology, immunology, parasitology, and benefits of Herd Health.
