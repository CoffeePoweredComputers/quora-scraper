            "answer_text": "What do you mean \u201cspy\u201d? With a suitable warrant, law enforcement can get either a \u201cpen register\u201d authorization, which gives them every number you called, every number that calls you, along with date time and which tower. With a full Title 18 warrant, the content may also be obtained and recorded. Voice, texts, data sessions, in essence all activity on your phone may also be monitored. None of this requires that your phone be changed in any way. No hidden software is installed, no special device implanted, it all happens deep in the switching fabric of the network. There are applications that can be installed on a phone, that are commercially available, that allow authorized individuals (authorized by the phone owner) to track the phone location. They were originally developed to find a misplaced phone. So you install the software on two phones, and each phone gives permission for the other to find it. If you have an Apple device, this app comes preloaded. But all of these applications are visible to the phone owner, and the owner (or someone with access to the unlocked phone) must give permission for the other phone to track it. So, if you enable it for your spouse for example, only that phone can find you, no one else. I won\u2019t go much into illegal ways, but it is virtually impossible for anyone to listen in, watch your data traffic, read your texts, etc, because the phone moves, it has its own encryption key, which is different for every call, and in any event, is digital. Your voice is never sent. It is changed into ones and zeros. If you could listen to cell phone frequencies (and scanners for those frequencies are illegal to own, manufacture, or import to the US),all you would hear is something like a high pitched buzz, or whine. So with a warrant, yes. Without one, no. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but unfortunately for you, they probably don\u2019t even need to because you have already given up all your data voluntarily without realizing it. From a person\u2019s photo alone, in many instances I can find out things like their addresses and mobile numbers without breaking the law. There are many public websites that are not Google indexed - you just need to know where to look. Now for the icing on the cake: your phone can be turned on remotely with all the functions such as camera/microphone etc without enabling the screen (keeping it blank). Its not difficult to do and our friends at the alphabet soup agencies seem to have the most control over such functionality. If you are referring to a targeted attack by a professional hacker - there isn\u2019t really much difference and if you have something valuable enough, they will find your weakest point and exploit it. Tip #1: don\u2019t take your phone into the bathroom for your morning routine or you may regret all the legal activities that you broadcast. Tip #2 the only thing you can trust is pen and paper. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it\u2019s possible for someone to spy on your smartphone. However, in most cases, they need to install a spy app on your phone. Therefore, never give your phone to someone who you don\u2019t trust. Also, don\u2019t click on the suspicious links or access unsafe files. Nowadays spy apps are mostly used for the purposes of parental control. For instance, parents want to ensure that their children behave appropriately online. They want to ensure that their kids are away from online predators, and porn content. A spy app lets parents check children\u2019s activities on the phone, such as keystrokes inputted, websites visited, Facebook chats, WhatsApp conversations and more. Take iKey-Monitor as an example. It\u2019s a secure parental control spy app for iPhone and Android. Parents can use full logging features to monitor their children and ensure they\u2019re are safe online. ",

            "answer_text": "There are some ways to retrieve/intercept someone's text messages remotely. The first, and easiest, method is an app installed on the other person's (you in this case) smartphone. An app (I have no examples, as I've never used those kinds of apps) could be storing your messages and sending them on to someone else, either through e-mail or a website. Another method is to intercept the messages before they actually arrive at your phone, a so-called MITM (Man In The Middle) scenario. Imagine someone standing between you and the cellphone tower, intercepting all your data, storing it, and then sending it on again.That last method is very difficult, though, so the first one is the most likely. A solution to fix the hack on your device is by being calm and visit pacificEthicalHackers.com\u201d\u201d ((Type in your Browser. You can do it yourself, I mean you'll get a full guide on what to do The solution is not to reset your smartphone only. If you don't want to do that you should at least check your apps, and see if there are any apps that weren't installed by you or could be used to send your messages to your ex-boyfriend. ",

He exposed project Prism which is an NSA program which monitors our phone metadata and other things. Atnt, Version, T Mobile, Sprint, and others had backdoors in their software on purpose to allow the NSA to collect data on anyone. Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks also have these same backdoors. Julian Assange exposed a lot of these days collections over the years as well through his website Wikileaks. Governments are silencing those who share their deepest secrets and social media platforms are slowly censoring people who don\u2019t agree with them. Our society is descending into tribalism, because of social media. Left vs Right and so much more. It is up to us to find sources of news that have less of a bias in them. Overall, yes you are being spied on through every word and text you send are sent over a cell network which has a backdoor for the NSA to spy on you. Every Facebook and Instagram post is posted on a data server which the NSA again has a backdoor to access. Speak up for your freedoms and privacy or they will be continually be taken away from you.

They will intercept at the Telco switch or over teh air and you will never know, nor be able to stop it. Changing phones won't help.Possibly changing SIM cards might throw them off for a while -e specially is you can get someone else to register it for you... ",
