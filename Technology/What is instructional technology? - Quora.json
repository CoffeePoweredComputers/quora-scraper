            "answer_text": "The term instructional technology came in to being in the late 1960s and James D. Finn Professor at the University of California is considered to be proponent of this term. Instructional technology refers to the theory and practice of design, development, utilization, management and evaluation of the processes and resources for learning. It is used to improve educational and training systems in organizational settings, school systems, and universities through the application of research and best practices from instructional technology. The focus of instructional technology is in using tools to facilitate student learning. It is not simply application of tools but beyond that as well. The tools that are being used by teachers for instruction are wide and varied, and range from writing boards to the iPad. It includes a range of tasks, such as designing and organising the teaching content in relation to the tools being used for effective learning. All in all, Instructional technology includes practical techniques of instructional delivery that systematically aim for effective learning, whether or not they involve the use of media. It is a basic purpose of the field of instructional technology to promote and aid the application of these known and validated procedures in the design and delivery of instruction. ",

            "answer_text": "Instructional technologies are the methods, practices, techniques, and processes that instructional designers use to design instruction in all of it\u2019s forms. Instructional technology is the branch of education concerned with the scientific study of instructional design and development. What is is not is computer hardware and software that acts as a platform for delivering developed instruction. This goes back to the very development of instructional design models that were developed, largely by the military, for the training of large numbers of troops in WWII. While instructional design was used much earlier going back to antiquity (again mostly by the military), the methods developed during WWII were the first time training methods and regimes were systematically developed using a research. Later, as more research as done on the effectiveness of various training techniques, these techniques were added to the tool box of instructional designers and would be refereed to as Instructional Technologies.
