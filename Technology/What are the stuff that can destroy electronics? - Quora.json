            "answer_text": "Load of factors can destroy your electronics General cases Short circuitOvervoltage- most work on 5V or 3.3V (plus or minus a very small tolerance). Using more than the tolerance range can kill your electronicsExcessive heat dissipation either faulty IC or components.Polarities- a wrong polarity connection can kill the circuit instantlyEnvironmental conditions such as a damp/moist environment may cause a short-circuit as water droplets may form and create a short.Last but not least, ESD (electrostatic discharge): most people don't see this thing coming. But, if you are working with very sensitive electronics, then special care should be taken before touching such chips with bare hands and without proper grounding as the discharge from your body is enough to kill it. Eg. Computer processors.Edit- thank you Martin Pickering for the suggestions. ",
