            "answer_text": "Lots of ingenious tricks of the ancients were lost to us until recent times.   Some of them have just been rediscovered, others are still mysteries.    For example, we long knew that the Romans had a formula for concrete that would set UNDERWATER.   The formula was a mystery until just a few years ago until a teams of scientists finally cracked it.  (http://www.history.com/news/the-secrets-of-ancient-roman-concrete) Likewise, the secret of how Brunelleschi built his dome on the Florence Cathedral was lost to the world until a modern architect reconstructed Brunelleschi's method using old texts and a model in Georgia.  (http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2014/02/il-duomo/mueller-text). The mysterious Antikythera device was discovered in 1900 and dates from 205 bc, but we only recently figured out how it worked and what it did. (Antikythera mechanism) The mystery that most intrigued me was the secret of how Jan Vermeer painted his masterpieces.  It turns out that he used an optical device, which he kept secret from all other painters.   An inventor named Tim Jenison figured out how Vermeer did it and the device has been replicated by modern toy makers for the masses.  .  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim%27s_Vermeer) Other secrets are still lost.  For example, we still don't know the exact formula to Greek Fire, or how the ancients projected it under pressure at enemy ships.  We also don't know how Archimedes pulled off his famous \"heat ray\" to sink ships at sea. We do know, however, EXACTLY how the Egyptians built the pyramids and we've come up with several easy and feasible ways that stone age peoples could have erected the Easter Island statues or the paleoliths of Stonehenge.

            "answer_text": "Eyewitness accounts of many events that nobody wrote down at the time. The gospels of the Bible were written long after the events took place, by people who were not there. Construction techniques. We have a general idea of how the pyramids were built, but not a precise idea. We're pretty sure there was a ramp that was later removed, but no idea exactly where it was. Certain named objects for which we have few further details. We know that in medieval times armies made a substance called \"greek fire\" that they would light and hurl at each other with catapults. This substance supposedly could not easily be extinguished, though some thought that urine would put it out better than water, and collected up urine in pots for this purpose. But nobody knows exactly what greek fire was made of. Similarly, there was a kind of catapult called a springald, but few drawings of it survive and they're not very credible, so we don't know quite what it was. Languages that we can't translate any more because everyone who spoke them is dead and no bilingual documents have been found (so far). The Rosetta Stone enabled us to understand Egyptian hieroglyphics for the first time in centuries, but there are several others that we don't know yet: Linear A and Cretan hieroglyphics, for two. The origin of the Basque language. It is not like any other language around it and does not seem to be related to any other known language. The purpose and use of certain large structures such as the Nazca lines in Peru, or Stonehenge. We have partial, but not complete, notions about this because the people who built and used them were illiterate. Unsolved mysteries such as what exactly happened to the Princes in the Tower. ",
