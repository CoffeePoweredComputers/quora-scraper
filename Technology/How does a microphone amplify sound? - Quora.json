            "answer_text": "How does a microphone amplify sound? They, in fact, do not amplify the human voice, or musical instrument, or any sound picked up by the microphone. The way they work is that there\u2019s a vibrating diaphragm in the microphone that vibrates when sound waves hit it. These vibrations of the diaphragm, which is held in place by magnets, cause changes in the magnetic fields of the magnets, producing an electrical signal. That signal then gets sent to the amplifier or PA system, that then amplifies that signal. From there, that amplified signal gets sent to the loud speakers that vibrate in the exact same way that your voice does, producing sound waves, and consequently, sound. In other words, a speaker works like a microphone in reverse. You can actually turn a 12 inch speaker into a microphone, typically used for picking up the extreme lows on a kick drum, by reversing how the speaker works. A simple reason for why microphones don\u2019t amplify sound is that if you unplug the XLR cable for them, you don\u2019t get any sound. Not only that, but microphones are used to pick up sound not just from the human voice, but guitar amps, bass amps, drums, and all sorts of things. The microphone isn\u2019t amplifying them, though.

            "answer_text": "Microphones don\u2019t amplify sound, they pass a small electrical current to an amplifier, more commonly known as a \u201cMic pre-amp\u201d which raises the signal to a more usable level. The original electrical current is generated by a thin sliver of metal (or coated plastic) within the microphone called the \u201cdiaphragm\u201d, which vibrates as it is hit by sound waves. This vibration causes a coil of wire to move within a magnetic field, generating an electrical signal. This is almost exactly the opposite way that a loudspeaker turns an electrical signal into sound. They are actually so similar that you can play music through a microphone, or use a speaker to pick up sound! Although, that is generally not recommended if you are fond of your mics and speakers\u2026.. ",
