            "answer_text": "Every company will fall. It\u2019s a matter of time. And Google is no exception.It\u2019s very hard to predict how a company might fall under an attack from other companies using the same technology (internet search) and it\u2019s even harder to predict how the company might fall from a new technology (unknown).But when you look back into history of one technology being replaced by another you can easily identify benefits of a new technology. As a matter of fact, you can easily explain to a 10 y.o. how internet search is more advanced than a printing press as a way of distributing knowledge.When I make a crazy guess on improving knowledge distribution, I think of this explanation to a 10 y.o.: \u2018Imagine you make a repeat action every day, for example, brushing you teeth. Do you search for a brush every morning? You don\u2019t, cause you already know that you\u2019ll need brush and you leave it in the place where you can grab it quickly without spending time for searching for it. You from today just helped to save time You from tomorrow. Now compare this to information: information search is a repeat action as we have lots of similarities as human beings and our needs. For example, word \u2018dog\u2019 will be searched for about 1.5 M times on Google next month. If that were just you who needed to get this information multiple times, you won\u2019t search for this 1.5 M times, right? You probably would search 1, 2 or 3 times, find the best information and then organize in a way that is easy to reach for the next 1.49999 M times you need it (make notes, or a list of bookmarks, etc). The same action as with toothbrush. The benefits are obvious in both examples. The only reason why we do the same with 1.5 M searches for a word \u2018dog\u2019 in Google in next month is because these searches would be done by different people. But if people would find a way to share information between each other in a same way you would save it for yourself, than they should be able to reap the same benefits as you did. One person helping another one. Furthermore, interests of people are more aligned to each other\u2019s comparing with aligning to interest of commercial companies (when you type \u2018dog\u2019 in Google 5 from top 10 results are coming from commercial companies, and another 3 from encyclopedias which are not so useful for many people typing \u2018dog\u2019 - they don\u2019t usually excited to learn that dog is a member of the genus Canis that is part of canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore as Google suggests based on Wikipedia). All of a sudden, Internet search is not so obviously efficient, right? So my guess is as far as we learn how to share and organize information instead of searching it, Google will fall. Benefits seem to be obvious.  ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe government taking control of the internet? It's hard to say, Google is a monstrous force. (Not in a bad way, more like in an unstoppable way.) Their search algorithms control how most websites develop and design their sites, and in today's world having a website that shows up high in the results is crucial to getting ahead. If you're on page 2, you're not likely getting much traffic, and if you're on page 3 you may as well not exist. I think Microsoft gave it a decent shot with Bing, but we all know how Bing did/does. I think nothing short of a global disaster would stop google. ",
