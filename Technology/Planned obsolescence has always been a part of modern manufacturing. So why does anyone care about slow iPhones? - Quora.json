            "answer_text": "Part of Apple\u2019s positive reputation is that iPhones receive software updates for many years while most Android phones receive hardly any software updates at all. Apple\u2019s decision to enable iPhones with batteries in poor condition to throttle in order to preserve battery life was the right decision, but media headlines made it sound like Apple was slowing down old iPhones to make people buy new ones. It\u2019s always in Apple\u2019s (and any other consumer goods company\u2019s) interest to get people to buy new phones but if you spent $600 or more on a phone you expect to get at least two years of useful life out of it (and with modern phones many keep them 3\u20134 years). Appearing to intentionally make your products not last as long (in reality fixing the battery would make older iPhones faster) is never a good way to get repeat customers. If you spent $50,000 on a BMW and your engine either stopped working or BMW wrote software to make your engine run slower in a short period of time would you buy another BMW? You would look into other brands at that point. There have long been conspiracy theories that Apple intentionally makes old iPhones slower and Apple\u2019s power management software at least appears to validate that theory for many people. In this case the fix to their reputation is relatively simple but it has to come out quickly. What Apple needs to do is to release a software update that lets users know that their batteries need to be replaced (for many customers, especially under warranty, it would be a free replacement), and should give users the option of worse battery life or better performance if they charge their phones more frequently. Since the recent media reports were harmful to their reputation they should do more of these battery replacements for free until the bad press dies down. ",
