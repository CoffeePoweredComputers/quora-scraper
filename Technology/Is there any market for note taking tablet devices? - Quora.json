            "answer_text": "Yes, obviously! I'm searching for one right now and my cheapest option seems to be the Samsung A with the Stylus. Other options are Lenovo Miix, Samsung Galaxy S3, iPad pro, Surface pro 4. I hate Samsung products. Don't like Apple os due to its extremely limited approach to user settings. I really like what surface pro has to offer but it's too costly. Although I might have to get the Surface, I still wish there was something in the 30k-40k INR range, Android / Windows and a reliable customer support. ",
