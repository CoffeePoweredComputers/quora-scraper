            "answer_text": "Firstly, why do you want to change your S I M card? Understandable if it is faulty. If you are sick and tired of receiving strange after midnight calls or messages, I emphasize with you. Go to the Telco to get a New Phone number. You need a New SIM card from the Telco. So take your Smartphone with you to their Service provider and get them to give you a NEW phone number and at the same time request them to install the NEW SIM card for you. It is that Simple if they provide GOOD Quality Customer Service. Hope you are happy with my suggestions. Have a Fantastic weekend! ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on your device there should be either a tray (on the left or right side of the smartphone) or a back panel leading to the card slot. If you own an iPhone or Newer android device with a closed back a tool or small paper clip is needed to open the tray. Let your carrier know before switching cards yourself. Simply put the tool in the small hole and slide out the tray the rest is self explanatory. Good luck! ",
