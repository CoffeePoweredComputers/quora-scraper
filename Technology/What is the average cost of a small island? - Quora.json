            "answer_text": "There is no average price for a small island. Pricing depends so much on where the island is located, amenities on the island, access to the island, proximity to an international airport and so much more. Are you planning a resort or looking for a place to live or just a place to hunt? Do you want to just be able to say you own an island? Does it have to be in your country or can it be anywhere in the world? Those questions are what makes it impossible to answer your question. ",

You can pay hundreds of millions for something better. All depends on how much money you have and what you want. ",
