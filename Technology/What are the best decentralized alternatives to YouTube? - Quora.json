Anything that relies on the \u201cinternet\u201d as we know it cannot truly be decentralized. That being said, the most decentralized alternatives I\u2019m aware of are PeerTube and perhaps IPFSTube. IPFSTube doesn\u2019t really have an interface, you could only really share a link to a video. PeerTube on the other hand gives you a ton of options and is very much a decent platform. ",
