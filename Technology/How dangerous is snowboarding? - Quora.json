            "answer_text": "* I am answering from my Smarter-Than-Me phone so please forgive spelling and grammar issues- I do the best I can (may have missed some auto correct changes too...I ducking hate auto correct) It generally depends on the user but there are a few things to know. First, if you \"catch an edge\" while skiing you can feel the edge take the ski and have a moment to prepare for the fall. Not always true with snowboarding; when boarding I've caught my backside edge slowing to a stop on a green run and I flipped back and bounced off my head with enough force to crack my helmet...all with no warning (went from upright to down slope before I knew anything had happened). Next, when you do fall with skis on, the skis come off and you just tumble through the snow. That is a pretty broad statement: \"just tumbling through the snow\" means different things if you are on a green beginner run versus skiing a 40\u00b0 pitch through trees versus dropping a cornice into a 55\u00b0 chute (I've lost skis on all three...unfortunately). But a snowboard is always attached so, no matter what kind of boarding you are doing, you are at the mercy of that plank of wood and fiberglass spinning your legs and knees down the hill. I know several Ski Patrollers (I am OEC certified as well) and the one thing the OEC instructors and other patrollers I know had in common with regard to snowboarding was that the greatest number of serious injuries they encountered on the mountain were snowboarders. Some were Park and Pipe, but they were scraping them up and calling birds in to medivac from all over the mountain with more frequency that skiers. Finally, you have a greatly limited view since you are facing one way. Most people assume this is why snowboarders cut people off but usually it is because snowboarders tend not to know what a fall line is and so have no concept of following one making them unpredictable (whereas skiers generally ski in an \"s\" pattern which can be anticipated, snowboarders just kind of go wherever whenever without thinking to check for other people, kind of like that arrogant prick weaving through traffic at 70mph without using a turn signal). The limited view just means that you have a harder time being aware of your surroundings so you can't see those around you as easily even when you are checking. Combine that with snowboarding not inherently having the built in mechanics around which mountain etiquette was built (the use of a fall line to ski turns in equal arcs on either side of) and you end up with a lot of collisions. All this being said doesn't mean that skiing isn't dangerous, or that skiers don't have the same problems. Beginner skiers still learning to turn won't do a lot of fall line work so they similarly tend to make random turns all over the place. Advanced skiers try to avoid beginner/green runs when navigating a mountain simply because they can be a shit-show to navigate with the chaotic manner in which early skiers move around there slope. A lot of parks where snowboarders tend to concentrate empty onto green runs so many snowboarders have the experience that skiers cut them off all the time when it's usually these beginner skiers still learning technique. Younger skiers are also trending toward seeking the next big kicker to get themselves on film so they too will sometimes ski spot to spot not using any pattern, thus creating the same effect throughout the mountain (thanks YouTube and gopro!). Snow sports are inherently dangerous with each carrying risk. Snowboarding is easier to pick up but the risk of serious injury comes much sooner in your progression (I cracked my helmet catching an edge at a near standstill on a green run in Utah). Skiing takes longer to master, has far more potential in the long-run, but gets far more potentially dangerous depending on the level of terrain you decide to take on (at a certain level it stops becoming about which is more dangerous to do and which is better for risk mitigation and terrain navigation when in extreme terrain settings). That said, if you are over 30 and only going to go up once a year, take up snowboarding because you can enjoy it much faster- just get (and always wear) a helmet, learn what a fall line is and how to cruise around it, and for the love of all that is good in the world, don't do the falling leaf when there is powder on the hill.

            "answer_text": "Snowboarding isn\u2019t that dangerous providing you know what you\u2019re doing and wearing the right protective gear and clothing. If you\u2019ve never got on a snowboard before and go to the top of a mountain and just get on, it\u2019s incredibly dangerous and you could die. If you have initial lessons from a coach or a friend who is good at boarding you\u2019ll be pretty safe. Most snowboarders dislocate or break something at least once in their life time but it all depends on the riders skill and style. Ultimately, I personally believe snowboarding isn\u2019t any more dangerous than any other sport. I\u2019ve seen more injuries from horse riding than I have boarding. ",
