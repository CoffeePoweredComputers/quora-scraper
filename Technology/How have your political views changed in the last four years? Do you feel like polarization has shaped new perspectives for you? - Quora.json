            "answer_text": "Sort of. My basic belief system remains unchanged. I am still a libertarian with essentially a centrist point of view. I have problems with both of the two major parties mostly based on their various authoritarian positions. That being the case, polarization is not a direct cause of any perspective changes since I don't sit anywhere near either pole. However, the last four years have convinced me that it is time to adopt a new personal voting methodology, the third of my lifetime. To provide context, it would probably help to describe my previous methods and how I came to adopt them. I was born in 1960 at the time of the civil rights movement. Naturally I don't have a lot of direct memories of those events but by the start of the 70s I was already a firm believer in black power and make love not war.  Based on this, my friends and I mostly became Democrats, the group being vocal about these things. Like the average person who joins a group, once I identified myself in that way I took up most of the remaining Democratic beliefs without giving them much thought. This led to my adoption of voting method #1. I simply voted the Democratic ticket. In my first presidential election in 1980, I paid very little attention to Reagan other than I assumed he was bad for America. He won without my vote and given that I assumed he would be voted out for his failures in four years I paid him no mind. I continued to vote the Democratic ticket and did so again in 1984. When Reagan won in the biggest landslide in American history, this made me question my assumptions. I certainly didn't care for the Republicans but what the Democrats had sold me wasn't adding up. At some point prior to the election I had become acquainted with libertarianism. That and the implications of Reagan's second election put the nail in the coffin of voting method #1.  Voting methodology #2 lasted from my mid-20s until now, three and a half decades. It was straightforward. Learn about the candidates and vote for the best one. Ignore the D, the R, the L, the I, or any other identifiers next to their name. These things don't determine whether or not they are a good candidate. An honest analysis of what they've done and what they're likely to do is the best way to choose a candidate. Based on this, I'd guess my voting record under methodology #2 is something like 45% Republicans, 40% Democrats, 5% Libertarians, and 10% everything else. I don't know for sure but it would be close to this. There would be more libertarians if more libertarians ran for office. Probably 5% of the Republican votes are actually libertarians running under the Republican label. The last four years have been very political. Mostly it's been Trump poking the hornets nest and the hornets trying to sting Trump. Russian collusion was a hoax. The investigation was a morass. And the impeachment was a farce. Regardless, it was all still politics. No matter how problematic these things were, it's part and parcel of the process in a free system. It's useful in determining what political groups stand for but not really crucial when determining the best choice for office.  2020 changed everything. First there was COVID-19. The Democratic authoritarian streak came out in droves. You have to stay six feet apart or people will die. You have to wear masks or people will die. You have to stay home or people will die. \u201cIf you don't comply you will be punished.\u201d That last sentence is a direct quote from a comment on one of my answers. If the authoritarians had stuck with their original proposals including the two weeks they promised was all that was needed everything would have worked out fine. But after several weeks Americans balked and eventually they publically protested, something the Democrats roundly condemned as spreading the disease. This has proven to be a double standard since they also insisted that protests against police brutality had to be allowed. Still, so far this has been just more politics. But during this pandemic, the Democrats took the political position that everything Trump did was wrong. That included mentioning hydroxicloroquine as a possible treatment. The Democrats condemned this and conducted a propaganda campaign to convince everyone just how horrible this idea was. But they didn't stop there. In some localities they actually interfered with people's health care by taking action against doctors who prescribed the drug. Their propaganda influenced many of the most affluent countries who also adopted this way of thinking. In the meanwhile, much of the rest of the world jumped all over hydroxicloroquine with significant results. According to the COVID-19 Treatment Analysis website, there have been 102 studies of hydroxicloroquine with an overall success rate of 75%. Delay in treatment after exposure is the single largest factor for failure. Even so, as of the date this answer was written, if hydroxicloroquine treatment was only 30% effective over 280,000 lives could have been saved.  This is why I'm changing my voting methodology. The Democratic Party has made it clear that their political agenda is more important than people's lives. As if that wasn't enough, they refused to hold the \u201cmostly peaceful protesters\u201d accountable for the looting, the burning buildings, and the deaths associated with those protests. Since our government exists specifically to protect our rights, this is a complete betrayal of their purpose for existence. Voting methodolgy #3 is a simple modification of #2. I will still make an honest analysis of the candidates based on what they've done and on what they are likely to do. However, the Democrats took politics to new levels making their support for those actions a crucial factor. I will not consider any Democrats regardless of their qualifications. Anyone who associates themselves with the Democratic Party is associating themselves with the above and I refuse to support that. #neverblue  Image sources: Flower Child, PentagonRonald ReaganDaily confirmed COVID-19 deathsMSNBC's Ali Velshi",

            "answer_text": "Its less about polarisation, and more to do with events. 2020 has brought things into the limelight, and changed a lot of people's opinions. Have my political views changed in the last four years? Yes, and even more so since January. For most of my teenage years and young adulthood, I considered myself to be Liberal. I still support racial equality, LGBT+ rights and a fairer economy. However, there are certain things happening with the left I dislike. To be more spesific: BLM Riots  Everyone agrees that George Floyd's death was disgusting. No one should be treated that way. However, the riots have changed my mind about Black Lives Matter. What once started out as a movement for equality has turned into a Marxist hate group who support violent thugs. Whats worse is that their efforts are counterproductive. They're making the black community and anti fascist organisations look bad. Its a far cry from the genuine Antifa who fought against Nazis in the 1930's. Because of all the destruction, a lot of people have walked away from the left (myself included). The Democrats seem to support the riots, which could potentially lose them a lot of votes. Honestly, I sometimes wonder if they're all working for Trump. Cancel Culture  The left used to be a place of tolerance and sometimes, healthy debate. Not so any more. Its become very reactionary. Little logic, but a lot of emotion (and sometimes manipulation). They claim to stand for freedom, but if you disagree with them you don't hear the last of it. You're a racist, a misogynist, a bigot, a homophobe etc. You deserve to lose your job, money, support and even home for having the \u201cwrong\" opinion. To call others fascist while simultaneously trying to eradicate any opposition (or slight criticism) is hypocrisy. Its madness. You know what they say: You become what you try to fight. Extreme Abortion Laws  Most early abortions are safe, however, there are so called \u201cLiberals\" who are pushing for abortion up until birth, and, for any reason. While I agree with each womans right to choose, I don\u2019t agree with ending a pregnancy that is nearly full term (unless there are serious complications). While the time at which a fetus becomes human is questionable, there is no question that a full term baby is in fact, a baby. I also question these peoples morals. Ending a full term pregnancy under normal circumstances shouldn't be debatable, but to them it should be legal. In my opinion, someone like this isn't fit to run a country. Transitioning Children  I will always defend an adults right to transition. In fact, there are certain places where transgender people need more rights and better healthcare. I dont debate this. However, to give a child puberty blockers, hormones and list them for surgery is a no for me. For starters, children are still developing. Teenagers in particular are constantly exploring their identity, be it gender or taste in music. The teenage years are an important time of self discovery and finding your place in the world. My point is, what happens if they stop puberty, then later discover they aren't trans? Some of the biological changes of hormones are irreversible, even for adults. Testosterone will produce a deep voice, even when medication is stopped, for example. To give children hormones is grossly negligent, to say the least. If they're certain, they should transition once they turn 18. Censorship  Facebook, Twitter, Google and even YouTube to an extent have become less about freedom of information, and more about supporting a narrative. Dont get me wrong, the Internet was fantastic at first, but certain sites have become more biased. This can also include main stream media. I believe the left have somewhat hijacked these platforms as a way to give people a certain view of the world. Facebook, for example, has stopped running political ads for Republicans, but hasn't done the same for the Democrats. Social media has created much of the polarisation we're seeing. This has happened because it will push certain left wing ideas. In turn people will either become more left wing, or search elsewhere (alternative media) for information. Thus becoming more right wing. As much as we hate to admit it, media has an impact on most peoples lives, even if only slightly. I've noticed those who are censored tend to become more right wing. Conclusion As previously stated, I have walked away from the left, and will be voting conservative in future. For generations my family have been Labour voters, and will be disappointed. However, even my parents and grandparents aren't blind to the disaster the left has become. They no longer represent us, or our values. Particularly since they focus less on workers rights and the unions. ",
