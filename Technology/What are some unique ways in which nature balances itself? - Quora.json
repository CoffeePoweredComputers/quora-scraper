            "answer_text": "Left to itself, nature is \u201cred in tooth and claw\u201d. If herbivores get out of balance ( in numbers) with carnivores, carnivores survival rate may go up. With rabbits, overpopulation causes the pregnant mother to resorb her fetus. Almost all life on earth, depends on photosynthesis. And, the reason photosynthesis works, is being explained by quantum mechanics. The secret is , a photon obeys the quantum rule of being in 3 or 4 places at the same time (superposition). It strikes multiple chlorophyll molecules, simultaneously, thus guaranteeing a 100% efficient energy transfer. This unequalled 100% efficiency, is what makes plant life unstoppable, and other life possible on this green earth. I am not an ecologist, but I suspect ecosystems are very complex. Perhaps, leaving them be, and studying them non-invasively, would be best. I\u2019ve read that past attempts to fix, or manage, ecosystems, to a particular result, have produced the opposite effect. One environmentalist on YouTube admits he thought that overgrazing by elephants was desertifying part of Africa. So, on his reserve, he ordered his staff to Shoot 40,000 elephants! It actually Increased desertification ! Oops! ( A really Big oops!) Better, to leave nature alone, study it, but try to protect it from it\u2019s biggest threat- humans. And, we are part of the ecosystem, and can learn to live in it, if we keep our senses and minds open to what is going on around us. Life on earth is so amazing, and so explosive , that belief is growing it may well be unique. Yikes! Maybe we\u2019d better preserve it. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think nature does balance itself anymore Ajita, there was a time when predators controlled the numbers of herbivores, this not only controlled the number of herbivores in any one area, but it also stopped the degradation of flora & the banks of waterways. But now we have destroyed all that, we have polluted & poisoned & killed until nature is no longer as it used to be. We have created anthropogenic global warming & climate change, this has not only caused & continues to cause the extinction of many animal species, but it will also be the cause of our own extinction in the very near future. This is not nature balancing itself, this is humans committing ecocide for the sake of city lifestyles.Keith. ",
