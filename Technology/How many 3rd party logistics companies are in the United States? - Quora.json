            "answer_text": "Nobody will be able to accurately give you a number: 3PLs are a hot industry, and new ones are opening and closing every day. It also depends on what you consider to be a true 3PL firm. Does the company need to operate exclusively in logistics? Do they have to touch all aspects of the supply chain, or can they focus on one or two? For instance, a trucking company that transports pallets is a 3PL company. A warehousing company that sets up these pallets for transport on the aforementioned trucking company is also a 3PL company. My best answer (from experience in this industry) is \u201cless than 10,000 and more than 1,000 such companies in the United States touch some part of logistics and qualify as a 3PL at scale\u201d. I hope this helps! Good luck out there. ",
