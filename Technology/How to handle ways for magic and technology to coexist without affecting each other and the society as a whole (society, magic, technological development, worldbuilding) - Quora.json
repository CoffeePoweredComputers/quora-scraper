            "answer_text": "Question: How do you handle ways for magic and technology to coexist without affecting each other and the society as a whole (society, magic, technological development, worldbuilding)? So the question is what level of technology do you want in your world and what level of magic if they are the same - e.g. the healing is essentially the same - if you go to a medical doctor or a cleric they can treat you in the same or similar amount of time. If weapons or spells have the same capacity to damageThen I would set up 2 societies where one is technology based and one is more magic based. As it would setup some interesting dynamicsIf technology is superior in some ways to magic - then you have left over pockets of mages - or various niches where magic is still \u201cquicker\u201d than technology.If magic is rare - or reserved - then technology develops for the rest of us.Think if you had clerical healing magic - but the practitioners were rare - they would be limited to the wealthy or powerful and the lower classes might still develop medicines and even surgery and vaccines - slower but still effective technology - just due to the scarcity of magic.Now to the question of affecting each other - they will affect each other - if magic and technology exist - then knowing the other exists will impact one or the other. In my last example - knowing you can cure a disease or almost instantly heal a wound with magic will potentially spur on the development of treatments for those less able to gain access to healers.In a world with \u201cGlass Steel\u201d or even create bonfire - may spur on the development of better alloys, or processes that use magic to create those alloys.TV might not be invented if you have people who can cast good enough illusions and spells to share those illusions to others, or it may spur on the technology\u2026There will be an impact - good or bad - just due to the ability of tech or magic to make an impact on our lives. In a world with both - people will find ways to use both - using magic to see far distances - and add that to lenses to enhance telescopes, and binoculars. Or early use to see small things - and jump start our understanding of the small, blood vessels, plant cells, biology, etc. germ theory may come about much sooner\u2026 Communication, translation is aided by comprehend languages. travel technology may be slowed due to teleportation. Or sped up - with gates - Development of pistons for steam engines and combustion engines could develop sooner as things like shape stone might be used to shape precision parts. Again there will be an impact - it is up to you what assumptions to make about your world. What logical leaps you think its inhabitants would make. And that will inform your decision about what level of technology exists and how common divine and/or arcane magic is in your world. ",

            "answer_text": "In terms are this question, let us presume we are talking about a fantasy world and not ours; as it\u2019s the only way this question makes any sense - especially as the question pertains to world-building. This means we can dispense with our familiar stage magic - while it may exist for entertainment's sake, it\u2019s still just that, stage magic. The one thing you can\u2019t dispense with, however, is the concept of technology. Because it\u2019s very important here. Technology, at the most basic level, is our tool for interacting with our environment. We need to not freeze in winter - we invent fire. We need to communicate with our neighbors - we invent language. We need to run faster than a cheetah - we invent race cars. We need to ask questions about magic and worldbuilding - we invent Quora. All these are ways we interact with our environment, and thus all the tools we use to accomplish this is technology. Thus it is not a matter of co-existence. Any Magic that creates an effect on our environment - be it turning invisible or blasting a fireball - is technology. So let\u2019s get to the gist of the question - I suspect the real question is how can Magical Technology can co-exist with other technologies. For this discussion let us toss all of our world\u2019s familiar technology under the single - and arbitrary - category of Mechanical Technology. The most simple answer to the question is - well simple. Of course not. Any technology, Magic or Mechanical, affects society as a whole. It\u2019s how we do things! The only way for it to not be is for the society and its people to be, well dead and not interacting with their environment at all. Can Magical and Mechanical technologies exist without affecting society? That\u2019s a tricky one. The answer is yes, which results in a no. The only way for this to happen is if there is a strict division, a great wall, between those who use magic and those who use mechanics - and on each side, ALL tasks are handled by one or the other and only by one or another. On one hand, this is a fairly draconian condition - but any time you mix them, even in the slightest way, they will affect each other, even if it is only having to make a decision what type of technology is used when. But this gets strange, because if you take a step back and look at the big picture, yes, magic and mechanical technologies HAVE affected each other and their societies, by creating the conditions that set the societies up and keep them distinct. Story-wise, this can become really interesting if the two societies start to interact \u2026 bit yup \u2026 once again, any interaction will most likely create an effect on one or the other. Fine. Let\u2019s make the question simpler. Can Magical and Mechanical technologies coexist? Another simple question - of course, they can. And it\u2019s guided by a very simple principle, one that true for all the various flavors of technology we are familiar with: The technology which will be used will be the most cost-effective. If it\u2019s easier to snap your fingers and light a fire - if it\u2019s something everyone will know, have access to, and that they can afford - even if matches are invented they will fall out of use. On the other hand, if you have to have a special magical gift, study three years, and need diamond dust to cast your flame spell \u2026 most folks will shake their heads, laugh at you, and use a match. It\u2019s why the internal combustion engine is still around. We have had electric vehicles around for just as long. The problem is that the internal combustion engine reliably delivers its power, it is affordable, well known, and understood, reliable, and can be operated by most folks. We don\u2019t have anything that does all that better \u2026 \u2026 except now, today, there are more and more electric vehicles. Why? Battery and electric motor technologies have improved \u2026 and there is a growing cultural recognition that they have a positive benefit to our environment. This is important - because being cost-effective is not just measured in cash \u2026 something may be more expensive or harder to do, but if the society deems this additional work is worth the end value, then it still makes economic sense. Whether or not such a cost can be borne over the long term will decide whether or not it or its society will remain viable. So in terms of world-building, that's what you need to look out for - you just need to decide when and how magical technology has a better benefit than the corresponding mechanical technology. ",
