            "answer_text": "You can turn off GPS aka Location. You can connect to Internet through a VPN. Now, the privacy I myself want does not involve somebody getting my info. I consider Spam calls to be violations of my privacy. I had tried various schemes to block such calls, but I still suffered continual ringing while I was trying to work, triggered by people offering to sell me things I do not need, and threatening me with actions they do not have the power to execute. Here is the way I found to solve my problem on my Android 5 phone: Settings > Sound and Notification > Notification > Do not disturb (turn it on) > Set Schedule > [Mon thru Sun, Start Time: 10:00 PM, End Time: 9:59 PM next day > Allow exceptions (turn it on) > Alarms on + Phone Calls on + Messages on > Calls and Messages from: Contacts only. Net effect: If a person on my contact list tries me, my phone rings or dings or sings depending on Alarm or Phone Call or Message from my friends and family only. Unknowns go straight to (VISUAL!) voice mail, no ring sound, no you\u2019ve-got-mail sound, or to Messages, no heavenly bells. BUT, I still receive the voice mail, which I can review at my own convenience, on my own schedule. ",
