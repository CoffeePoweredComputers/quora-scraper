            "answer_text": "the star indicates that the original dollar was rejected by the mint as defective (cut badly, smudged, missing or mismatched details etc.), and it was replaced with the same serial number with a star to identify it as a replacement. there are some collectors that specialize in star notes. if it\u2019s relatively recent probably two bucks, if it\u2019s old, maybe three. if it\u2019s a silver certificate, five or ten. check on ebay for prices. I had a bill that sported two stars. that meant the replacement was replaced. unfortunately, it was stolen along with the rest of my collection. that note would probably fetch around $1500 right now.
