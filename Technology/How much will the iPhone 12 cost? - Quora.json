            "answer_text": " The iPhone 12 will likely look different to the iPhone 11 Pro Max Apple's new iPhone is closer than ever as both the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are expected to land in the next couple of months. We're expecting both devices - plus another two phones - to be announced in September this year. September is normally when we see the new iPhone, but the Covid-19 pandemic may change things for the iPhone 12 release date. A delay is possible, which may mean we have to wait longer for the handsets but currently rumors suggest the phones will at least be unveiled by the end of 2020. What's set to change with the new iPhone? First up, you should expect four members of the iPhone 12 family, which will include the base handset as well as an iPhone 12 Max, iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. That's similar to the iPhone 11 series, but includes a new handset line in there called the iPhone 12 Max. That's likely to be a larger phone that's a similar size to the iPhone 12 Pro Max, but it won't feature such top-end specs. Other leaks and rumors suggest there will be the debut of 5G technology on an iPhone and it may even see the biggest design change since the company adopted the notch in 2017. The leaks are suggesting this will be one of the most exciting iPhone launches ever. While we don't know much for certain yet, we do know it's set to have iOS 14 and there are some facts that have been consistently leaked over the last few months. Everything you need to know about the new iPhone is below including the expect design, the specs, our best idea of \u200b\u200bthe price and much more. Plus, we're constantly keeping it updated with the latest new iPhone leaks and rumors. Latest iPhone 12 news: There's evidence of a 5.4-inch iPhone in the latest iOS 14 beta, the iPhone 12 range might come with a braided charging cable, and the big day could be September 8. When will the iPhone 12 come out? The exact iPhone 12 release date is a confusing topic; nothing has been made official yet, but we're almost certain Apple will be unveiling its new iPhones before the end of 2020. At least one tipster has said the big day will be September 8, which means Apple is more on schedule than we thought . Usually, we'd have said September is almost certainly when we'd see the phones, and in past years it has often been the second week of the month. It's almost always unveiled on a Tuesday, and with that in mind September 8 makes sense. In previous years, you've then been able to pick up the phone for yourself 10 days later. That'd mean it may land on September 18 or September 25, but that's looking less and less likely. We can't be as confident of these dates as in previous years as there is a good chance that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a serious impact on the production of the next iPhone.  How much will the iPhone 12 cost? The iPhone 12 price is something that leaks have made a little clearer than the release date, and from what we're hearing it's likely to stay broadly in line with 2019's iPhone range. For reference, the iPhone 11 started at $ 699 / \u00a3 729 / AU $ 1,199, the iPhone 11 Pro starts at $ 999 / \u00a3 1,049 / AU $ 1,749, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $ 1,099 / \u00a3 1,149 / AU $ 1,899. Prices for the next iPhone range probably won't be exactly the same though, as you can see in the chart below, which contains information taken from a big leak from YouTuber Jon Prosser. We've also included information from another leak, which suggests there will be 4G variants of the first two phones noted below. Source : New iPhone 12 release date, price, leaks, news and everything you need to know If you really want longevity, you might consider waiting for the iPhone 12 this fall. It's expected to cost a lot more, but feature a newer A14 processor (along with other fancy features)\u2014five years from now, Apple may cut off iOS support in the A13 while still offering updates for products that use the A14.

            "answer_text": "Apple has yet to confirm the price point of the iPhone 12 but it was speculated that it could be cheaper than the previous releases of the iPhone 11 series. The expected price at that point was approximated to be around 74k but it has not been confirmed. According to new reports however, it is stated that the new iPhone 12 could be actually priced at a higher range than the iPhone 11. The new reports suggest that there could be a difference of 50 US$ between devices of both the series. If that turns out to be the case, the iPhone 12 then will be priced nearer to 80k rather than less than that. And I am talking about the base variant here. The iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro max will obviously be more expensive and could easily be above 1 lakh in terms of price point.  I think if the iPhone 12 is priced within 80k it will be a decent purchase for a vast number of consumers. It also comes with decent features like - it has a 6.1 - inch display with a resolution of 1125*2436 pixels. It is run by the Apple A13 Bionic processor and it has 6 GB RAM and 64 GB internal storage. It has a triple rear camera with the specs of 12 MP + 12 MP + 12 MP and it also has a 12 MP front camera. The battery power is 3210 mAh which also supports quick charge. Although the features are decent, I do wish that they had integrated a stronger battery in the device. The fact that Apple is planning on not including the charger and the airpods along with the iPhone 12 devices should definitely reflect on its price. I think the best route as I mentioned earlier would be for them to keep the new release within 80k especially because they are not including any perks. The only thing confirmed to be included with the device at this point is a braided USB data cable. We will have to wait for Apple to confirm the deets on the other aspects of the new release.
