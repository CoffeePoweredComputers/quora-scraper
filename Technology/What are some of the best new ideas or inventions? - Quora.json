            "answer_text": "This!  The Oasis Aquaponics Patio Garden-small, compact, and so energy effcient that it can run off of solar energy alone.  Fish and shrimp grow in the bottom 210 cistern, and the top 165 litre grow beds grow vegetables, herbs and fruits. The fish and shrimp waste is broken down into plant food by certain types of bacteria; the plants then filter the water and return it-clean-to the fish.  Because of the nature of the liquid conveyer, the plants don\u2019t have to compete for nutrients, and grow larger and faster.  The system uses about 20% of the water that conventional farming uses.  It is so compact that (say, in Kenya) if the village is raided, then a family can pack it on a cart and take it with them.  The fish can be raised to eat (my mom named hers-they are going to die of old age!), the shrimp most certainly so, and the vegetables and plant grow at 2\u20133times the normal rate.  If just 5% of California used this to supplement just 5% of their vegetable needs we could save the entire state 100,000 gallons of water A MINUTE!  I have applied for provisional patents on several of the mechanisms within the system; upon receiving those I will begin a crowd-funder campaign. also intend to create a cheaper system that we can ship to impoverished areas and nations to feed everyone. Four systems should feed a family of four.  When we create the large system (the size of a shipping container) it will produce almost an entire acres worth of food-with no additional power. The system will be fully mature and ready for harvesting upon receipt.  Obviously, this is the rough prototpe, but the full-blown system is actually almost complete and ready for photoshoots.  That being said, it takes several years to become an overnight success\u2026  And-you guys are going to think that I have lost my bloody mind-I am NOT patenting the system itself, and I intend to release the plans online in about a year!  Thank you to Lilith Rosaline for helping with some editing-I am dictating voice to text while driving, and sometimes the translation does carry over!  Doesnt carry over-point in fact ",

            "answer_text": "Here is a list of some of the cleverest tech inventions and ideas ever.  1. 3-D Printer. 3-D Printers are devices that can build objects from digital blueprints, by layering plastic or other materials- this is rapidly becoming a reality.  2. Smart Watch. Apple's Watch recreates the computer for the wrist, using an interface that combines a touchscreen and physical buttons. The Watch can send messages, give directions, track fitness and make wireless payment.  3. Lego Phone. Like playing with LEGOs, a modular smartphone is a make-it-yourself device consisting of an endoskeleton base and modules that attach to create a custom phone. 4. Shadow. Shadow is an app designed to wake you up oh-so-gently, because no one likes a jarring wakeup and because that's the best way to bring you into \"hypnopompic\" sleep -- the space between sleep and awake where dreams are most easily remembered. The app would then prompt you to record your dream via text or voice. It would result in a database of dreams that could not only help individuals better understand themselves, but could give sleep scientists more fodder for analysis. 5. 3D Doodler Pen. The pen works by heating up and dispensing a thin plastic filament that cools down quickly to create hardened structures. It's like drawing with hot glue, and each one-foot stick of plastic can provide 11 feet worth of doodles. ",
