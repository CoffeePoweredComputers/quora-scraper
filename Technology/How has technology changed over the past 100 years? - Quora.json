            "answer_text": "Technology has transcended sorcery into reality. Imagine if you are a man of 1920, and you are entering a room and the door suddenly opens and shuts down as soon as you came inside. A man from early 90\u2019s will be terrified and assume it's the work of a ghost. And now in 2000s, we barely notice the elegant glass doors opening and closing as we get in.  A century ago, if I say I can predict an incoming hurricane, its position and time of the attack, I would be considered as god.  And now any teen with a mobile phone can interpret and finesse details accurately.  1920\u2019s: What? Are you serious? How do you know these?Me: I have a friend in space, sitting in a thing(ISS) who is monitoring above the earth.90\u2019s: Darn, you are a friend of God himself who is watching above us. *Hails me*  Hurricane Harvey intensity as seen from ISS. Source: IBTimes | Space Time  Me: I can speak with beings, which actually don\u2019t exist and only I can see it.1920\u2019s: Ghost???Me: No. Just my imagination in motion(Augmented reality).  *Hailing intensifies* To him I would be like an infallible man or mere god. And that\u2019s how the technology has advanced over the past 100 years.  Addendum: The technology has changed so much that whatever we achieved even in simplest things so far would be a non sequitur to the pertinence of what has been a hundred years ago. ",

In 1960 she had no closeup photos of any world, now we have had all the planets, asteroids and a comet or two investigated by space missions. This is just one aspect of the technological advances that has occurred in the past 100 years. It\u2019s just staggering how much technological advancements we have accomplished. ",
