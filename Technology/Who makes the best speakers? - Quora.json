            "answer_text": "Their are two key factors that make an excellent public speaker or an orator. I call it \u201cWho and How?\u201d First is your confidence, presentation, voice, body language (overall persona). Second is the topic, or discussion worth sharing with people. I have seen (in most cases), that the speaker has some kind of self accomplishment or a life story (of their or others) to share, and to inspire. If you can give something important or entertaining to the crowd, then you can even skip the first factor. The thing is that people should listen to you. ",
