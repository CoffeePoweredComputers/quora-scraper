            "answer_text": "NOTE: JUST NEVER NEVER NEVER GO for INTEL HD GRAPHICS !!!!! IF U WANT GAMING.NOTE:PLease Consider this point in my below mentioned aswer that the GPU which i call bad may be good for others who have not been a hardcore gaming person as i am. As i play all altest games including BF1, titanfall2 at ultra settings. Well now Please see this I have knowledge for being good in the laptop being for gaming. If you want an actual gaming laptop you must start from Rs 1.5 lacks of msi and alienware(Dell). Ofcourse even cheaper models comes from them but they their Graphics cards are not that good.Ofcourse quite much outta are budget So lets get to the Real Situation:DONTS Firstly never be fooled by the situation that more Graphic memory means better graphic card. it just giver a specific vram to start a game not to play in playable Frames. Actually diastrously bad experience that u would like to thow the laptop away due to being fed up(Practically). secondly dont be fooled by the word Dedicated Graphics. It jus means that it gives a special graphic card beyond the integrated(inbuit GPU of motherboard/PROCESSOR). And may or may not be good. It is Mostly good but at this range as u mentioned most are worse or equivalent as the integrated graphics so many people can fool you with this word but u must not be fooled. Now than when our DONTS are over we shall see that the best graphic card in laptops i found at your price range are nvidia gtx 920 and gtx 820 which actually are bottom end GPU but can run games uptill 2015 on low to medium settings very few of 2016 and it may overheat your laptop so suggest not to. Now going to DOS or linux instead of Windows is not a bad option.You firstly buy linux and than from local markets get WIndows 7/8/8.1/10 installed just for RS 300 or so. Around RS 30000 i only found this laptop which can run 99% all games uptill 2015 on playable FPS(20 FPS on medium settings for Project Cars, 25 FPS for battlefield 4 on Custom High Settings when we switch of anti alliasing and VSYNC, 45 FPS on PES 13 and 30 FPS on PES 15 and little lesser on equivalent FIFA games. You cannot really run NEED FOR SPEED 2015 on playable FPS on any of the laptops around RS50000 also but easilty good fps on RS30000 on desktops due to their better performance of NON Mobile GPUs).So heres the Laptop I am talking about:Acer Aspire E E5-573G-3100 15.6-inch Laptop (Core i3 5005U/4GB/1TB/Linux/Nvidia GeForce 920M Graphics), BlueIt has i3 5005U and you may overclock it too either manually or by Playing while Charging.It has 1 TB SATA hard disk drive4GB RAm(Ram can be upgraded in laptops so can upgrade it to 8GB in future although i suggest do it in recent days, u cannot upgrade graphic card or Processor in future,)NVIDIA 920M 2Gb graphic card is there. For more info on gtx 920M see thisGeForce 920M 2GB Can Run PC Game System Requirements ",

            "answer_text": "Well you can have a number of options if you asking about the laptop brand only there is HP, Dell, Acer, Lenovo And Asus to name a few but as far my knowledge and research is concerned that asus and Acer can give you a number of benefits at such a price but most of the people prefer HP and Dell as the higher priority. No doubt that those two are having the higher market share and that is the reason they give less benefits too as the brand name speaks for them. If you looking for a product which can give you better performance Asus A555LF-XX150T Asus A555LF-XX211D Asus A555LF-XX232D these are the models which provide you with performance having nvidia graphics card also allows a plus at such a price which you can never get in Hp or dell Acer Aspire E5-572G-525V Acer Aspire E5 ES1-571-558Z Acer Aspire E5-572G same goes for these laptops as well which are providing you excellent performance as giving you i5 processors at such a price and acer got service centers all over so no problem of getting service HP 15-AY025TU HP 15-AY026TU Dell VOS 3558 are some of more but they can provide you only brand name and low on performance comparing to others ",
