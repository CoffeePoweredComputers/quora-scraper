            "answer_text": "The building of photovoltaic panels is a high source of Co2 emissions and uses a substantial amount of coal in the manufacturing process. Over the life expectancy of a panel you will generate more energy than is required in the production process, but don\u2019t think these photovoltaic panels come without a large carbon footprint? The same can be said for the other intermittent supposedly \u201cgreen\u201d power source WIND TURBINES these are even worse! ",
