            "answer_text": "Making 10k in a month is not a big challenge. Note: I am fully aware that this answer is easy to write but a lot difficult to implement in reality. Its good to know that you want to get out of your comfort zone, the solution given below will not only allow you to make money but it will also make you get out of your comfort zone.  There is a huge demand for website nowadays, small business owners are paying a good amount for setting up websites. I am aware that you are a law student and do not posses any web designing skills, but you don't need to worry. Here are the steps: Step 1: If you currently do not have basic knowledge about web development then google it and study a little bit about domains and hosting, you don't need to be an expert but you need to understand the basic concepts and terminologies. It should take a few hours to get yourself familiar with this stuff. Step 2: Find some web developers or interns who could develop websites for you on a profit sharing basis. You could easily get interns who would charge less than 5k for a website. Step 3: Start approaching small business owners in your city who do not currently own websites. Now a days people pay up to 25K INR for a website. But as you are new, offer them a website for 15k INR. Now making a sale here is not as easy as it sounds, usually the conversion rate is 10%. i.e if you approach 100 people 10 people will buy from you. Our goal is to make 3 sales in the first 30 days.To make 3 sales you will have to approach 30 people.So each day you will have to approach at least 1 person, which is entirely doable. You sold each site for 15k out of which 3k is spent for domain name and hosting services, consider other 5k as developers fee. Net profit per website is: 15k-(3k + 5k)= 7k. Number of sales in 30 days: 3 sales. Profit for the month: 3 sales X 7,000 (profit per sale)= 21,000.  This will not only help your earn money but it will also help you get out of your comfort zone as you are doing something which is completely new to you as you are a law student and also you will face a lot of rejection from the client along the way.  Where you could go wrong :1.You might not even start,considering this is impossible.2.You might give up too soon after facing some rejection from people. But if you get out of your comfort zone then you will definitely be able to overcome the above two things. I hope you succeed :) . If you are successful doing this, I would suggest you to read my other answer Ashutosh Pawar (\u0906\u0936\u0941\u0924\u094b\u0937 \u092a\u0935\u093e\u0930)'s answer to What are the ways to earn 1 crore per year in India?

            "answer_text": "I had just written an answer to a similar query where I was asked \u201c How can I make rs 10000 per month with 1 lakh rupees in India?\u201d and I am providing the same info to you - Part 1. Incase you are looking at investment less than Rs. 15,000 but want a return of Rs. 5,000 in a couple of days or less than a week, then I am providing you additional information at the bottom - Part 2. Part 1: It\u2019s easy to earn Rs. 10,000 a month, though no amount of investment in Fixed Deposits, Recurring Deposits, ULIP, Mutual Funds, PPF etc can give you returns of Rs. 10,000 per month with an investment of Rs. 100,000. The one and only option is Stock Market and all it needs in little bit of investment and a large bit of patience.  U already have an investment amount of Rs. 100,000 and all you asking is only Rs. 10,000. The only thing you need is the right stock and a decent bit of patience. There are many stocks in each sector which have given such returns easily. Let\u2019s see a few of them. Dyes and Pigments Sector - Akshar Chemicals Akshar Chemicals. is a Gujarat based company, which was at a low of Rs. 109.2 in Jun 2015 and today is stands at Rs. 532.00 after hitting a high of Rs. 569 last week on 7th October 2016, a return of a whopping 422% return in 16 months. Meaning: If you had invested Rs. 100,000 for 909 shares in this company in October 2015, in exactly 12 months, you could have earned Rs. 383,500, which is a monthly earning of approx. Rs. 32,000.  Sugar Industry - Upper Ganges Upper Ganges is a UP based sugar mill. The stock was at Rs. 36.8 on October 1, 2015 and it hit a high of Rs. 508.35 on 29th July 2016, giving a return of 1281% in a span of 10 months. Meaning: If you had invested Rs. 100,000 for 2715 shares in this company in Oct 2015, then in exactly 10 months you could have earned Rs. 12,79,220.00, which is a monthly earning of Rs. 1,27,900.00  Paper Industry - Malu Paper Malu Paper is a Nagpur based Company. This stock was at Rs. 9.8 on 30th March 2016 and as of today (Oct 15, 2016) the stock is at Rs. 43.20, giving a return of 340% in a span of 7 months. Meaning: If you had invested Rs. 100,000 for 10,200 shares in this company in Mar 2016, then in exactly 7 months, you could have earned Rs. 3,40,640, which is a monthly earning of Rs. 48,660.00  Aluminum Industry - Century Extrusions Century Extrusions is a West Bengal based company. This stock was at Rs. 2.15 on 2nd Sep 2016 and as of 15th Oct 2016 it is trading at Rs. 7.55, giving a return of 252% in 40 days!!! Meaning: If you had invested Rs. 100,000 for 46,500 shares on 2nd Sep 2016, in exactly 40 days, you could have earned Rs. 2,51,000, which is a monthly earning of Rs. 167,300.00.  I can give 100\u2019s of such examples of how your Rs. 100,000 if invested in any month, on any day in the last one year could have given you more than the Rs. 10,000 per month, that you want as return. I hope my answer has provided you with enough insights on where to invest for excellent returns. But do remember, I don\u2019t give any recommendations or buy/sell/hold calls. Hence, kindly refrain me from asking any such questions. Incase you want to know the stocks in my portfolio, you can always read the other answers (comments also) I have written for other queries. Happy Investing !!! Part 2: U need Rs. 15000 to earn Rs. 5,000 in 2 days, provided you buy the right stock. For eg: I bought 50 shares of Kauntam Papers on 5th October at Rs. 284.00, spending Rs. 14,225.00 and today (7th October) I sold off all the shares at Rs. 393. I made a total profit of Rs. 5,400 after brokerage in 2 days. U can check the price that I bought in the graph below and also today\u2019s price.   Another example: I bought 700 shares of Malu papers on 4th October at a price of Rs. 20.30, spending Rs. 14,240. Today i sold all the shares at Rs. 29.90, thereby making a profit of Rs. 6,720 in 3 days.   So, like I said if you know the right stock, you don\u2019t need more than Rs. 15,000 to earn Rs. 5000 in less than 2 days. I never spend more than Rs. 15,000 per share for trading purpose and I don\u2019t keep the share beyond 1 week. Edit: By the way, I didnt tell about Ocean Agro. Similar case. 1 Wk investment - great return. Also read: Gopal Kavalireddi's answer to How can one earn 500 rupee everyday in stock market? ",

            "answer_text": "Let's get things straight - earning INR 10,000 in a month involves work.  If you are willing to do any sort of work, look out for posters in and around your locality for unskilled work - sales, marketing, door-to-door campaigns. If you are lucky, you might find part-time jobs that may fetch you 4-5K per month for working just the evening shift - especially restaurant jobs. Another option to consider would be home delivery service. Many restaurants and stores deliver to homes these days and need help with logistics. For any of these to bear fruit, you must be willing to go out there and find work. This experience will teach you the value of money, if not anything else and you will be better equipped to handle the life that lies ahead of you. Remember that all jobs have dignity because you are earning your bread. Any job is far better than sitting at home and cribbing about not having a job. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": " If you invest 1000 plus interest each month in investments at a rate of 7%, in 30 years, you have 1 million! Obviously, depending on your rates and the amount you invest each month, you can reach one million in just a few years or in 50 years. To find high rates, it is obviously necessary to avoid placing their money in the bank. Rather put his money in real estate, in companies, in binary options trading (through trusted binary options provider) or startups. If you know nothing about investment, I invite you to pay either a specialist in the field, or well you educate your side. There are lots of websites and blogs that talk of financial investment and make a lot of money. Now, the floor is yours: What is your financial goal, and how do you achieve it? and How to Get Rich & Earn 1 Million. Write a comment now just below. ",
