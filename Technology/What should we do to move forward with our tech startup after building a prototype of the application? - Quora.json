            "answer_text": "The question I would ask you, would be what does it mean to you to \u201cmove forward?\u201d Your mysterious prototype (about which we know nothing please keep in mind), might or might not work. Maybe it\u2019s been tested with target consumers, probably not. Would it work? Would it break if used by children or consumers? Does it require hours of studying manuals to install or use? We don\u2019t know. How much money would purchasing your item cost, and is that commensurate with your target market? Again,we don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve met many, many \u201cstartup founders.\u201d I\u2019ve yet to meet one who has tested everything, has proper financing, has exit strategies in place if that\u2019s what their end game is, have proper shares for co-founders and key staff, or are financially sound with growth strategies. Maybe I don\u2019t get out enough, but starting any kind of business is very tough and it\u2019s tougher still if you don\u2019t research, research, and do more research. So I would recommend testing out your prototype, asking around for test groups in your area, and networking with other similar founders near you. ",

            "answer_text": "Test it out! Get feedback. Run some Facebook ads to see what the interest is. Do some surveys. Get feedback from at least 20 people to see if any issues come up. If you have a monetization strategy, test the business model to see if users are willing to pay. From there, scale it, maybe look for capital if you really want it. At some point upgrade your design, features, etc, after you know there is an interest in it. ",
