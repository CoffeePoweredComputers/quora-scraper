            "answer_text": "Most manufacturers in fact do not build their own. Most are designed in house by engineers who first design the physical housings, and then design a motherboard, and all the devices to fit into a proprietary case. You however will see a number of similar models that use the same motherboard design, but add components and sockets for the particular model itself. While the major name brands like HP, Lenovo, Microsoft Surface and so forth appear the same on the outside, most are made by Chinese Factories to their custom specification. The boards will have the Chinese names and codes on them, but the BIOS of course determines the language the computer uses. The BIOS is set to determine the hardware that is in that particular model. Example the same motherboard has locations and sockets and interfaces that are not present on all models in that model line. Some might have 6 USB ports and some only 4 or even 2. Some may have a built in DVD drive, some may just have a blank plate where the DVD drive goes. Then we have all cases made for various display sizes and types. Touch displays and non touch displays.
