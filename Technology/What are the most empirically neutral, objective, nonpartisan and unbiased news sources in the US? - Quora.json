            "answer_text": "The answer is: There is no unbiased American news source, nor is there an unbiased international news source. What people need to do is be aware of the biases and read and compare stories from different perspectives. Most media outlets are decidedly Left-wing or even Far-Left. I have to laugh when posters put up National Public Radio (NPR) as an unbiased source. Sorry people, but NPR is very Left-wing. So is the BBC. The New York Times and New York Daily News are both Left-wing outfits, as is the Washington Post, Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times, ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN so on and so forth. MSNBC and CNBC are Left-wing to Far-Left (with the exception of Morning Joe, which is Center-Right). Magazines such as Mother Jones, The Nation, Salon, Slate, Vox and Rolling Stone are all Far-Left. On the Right are the Washington Times, the New York Post and Investor\u2019s Business Daily. Several newspapers have liberal/Left newspaper sections with conservative and libertarian editorial boards such as the Wall Street Journal, the Orange County Register, Boston Herald, Los Angeles Daily News, and to a certain extent the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times. Reason magazine is libertarian and National Review is conservative/Right-wing. Fox News and Fox Business Channel are Center-Right to Right-wing. A good practice is to read local newspapers to get the most accurate details of specific events. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s a national news story about something that took place in Dallas, Texas, like the killing of police officers. Every news source in the country is going to be discussing this event. The best and most accurate sources, however, will come from local newspapers, television and radio stations in the Dallas area. It goes without saying that official sources, if available, are important as well. News stories can help interpret official documents and statements as well as provide public reactions. Whenever possible, try to get source information. Let\u2019s say a news story says that Donald Trump said X or President Obama said Y. Read that story, then if possible watch the video recording or read the transcript to see if it matches what was actually spoken. News sources some times edit out important clarifications that provide context. Sometimes they give biased paraphrases. Headlines can be misleading as well and may not accurately reflect what\u2019s in the story. Headlines are often written by copywriters to get the attention of the reader, or by editors, some of whom not only have biases but animosities. ",

            "answer_text": "I would personally say NPR, BBC, Reuters, and the Associated Press. The BBC is not afraid of where its funding will come from, and is also not biased about American politics or culture, because it is British and very tradition bound. NPR is also quite balanced, because it reports the same whether or not its funding sources are threatened. They also take pains to be neutral an give a deeper view of stories they put on the air or the web. Reuters and AP are basically fact-oriented, and take pains to put absolutely no spin on their information. They are already on to the next item before analysis is done, for the most part. The major networks newscasts are also usually non-partisan as well, even to some extent Fox, but the problem lies in conflating the pundit and rant shows that they also put on that are usually somewhat slanted and inaccurate. People think of those as \u201cnews,\u201d because it has a thin veneer of the parent organization attached to it, but in reality they are opinion shows that are not to be assumed as the same level of journalism. As a quick reference, this chart is based on facts and analysis of the work of the information/infotainment/edutainment/downright inaccurate and fearmongering parts of the industry.  I think about it this way:AP: Dateline San Francisco, CA, 6:58 AMThe sun rose today. Reuters- Paris: 6:58 AM The sun came up this morning. NPR: The sun came up today, just like it has every day since the Earth was formed. This is Laxshmi Singh, NPR News, Washington. BBC: Once again, the sun has come up, at 6:58 GMT. (And there was widespread looting. Sorry, Monty Python reference because I cannot help it.) If it is a show on one of the news sources that is not the actual newscast: CNN: This is Anderson Cooper. The sun came up today, and here is a clip of Donald Trump lying about it. Fox and Friends: Senate Democrats today tried to prevent the sun from rising, but Paul Ryan and Donald Trump grabbed it and lifted it above their heads until it rose by its own bootstraps and burnt many illegal aliens. The Washington Post: Set of well researched stories about how Trump and his family tried to collude with clouds to block the sun except over Mar-A-Lago. The Economist: a fourteen page story with graphs and charts showing that the sun is actually necessary for photosynthesis, and detailing the entire food chain, with a cartoon of various political figures on the cover with ropes around the sun either pulling it up or down depending on their politics with the headline \u201cThe sun will come up\u2026tomorrow?\u201d Huffington Post: A story showing how Trump never cared about the sun in the past, replete with quotes and events, and then saying that his newfound care for the sun is just as much of a sham as anything else about him. Redstate: Trump created the sun. Occupy Democrats: Snappy meme with a picture of Obama pointing at the screen about how Obama made the sun come up way more times than Trump when he was president, and has the tagline \u201cNow Who Cares More About The Sun?\u201d InfoWars: There is no sun, it is all a plot by the human-animal hybrids that were bred by the CIA and the deep state to take our precious bodily fluids. Also, the sun is a paid actor. ",
