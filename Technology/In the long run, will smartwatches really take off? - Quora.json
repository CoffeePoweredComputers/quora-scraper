            "answer_text": "The problem with smartwatches is that they are not solving a problem. We already have watches that last for years on a battery or even without one. We have smartphones that tell us the time accurately, in sync with time servers on the internet and are vastly more powerful in terms of processing power for running apps and games. To make matters worse, smartwatches introduce inconveniences to their users. The major player's smartwatches last a day, maybe 1.5 days on a single charge and aren't as water resistant as we'd like them to be.  Most damning of all is the fact that none of the current apps running on smartwatches are compelling enough for someone to make the jump and change something as routine as not having a watch and using their phone instead, to tell the time. Until smartwatches are able to replace our smartphones altogether, I think that they will remain a niche product for the geek-fashion-conscious. and the health nuts. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course they will. But they won't ever have the prestige associated with a fine mechanical watch. Calculator watches did very well for a while, and smart watches will so better, IMO.  But these are completely different market segments, and there is a difference between wearing something and carrying/using something. ",
