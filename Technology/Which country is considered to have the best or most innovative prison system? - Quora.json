            "answer_text": "I agree with Alexandra Lampert, who wrote that Nordic countries operate more effective prison systems than those in the United States.  I began reading about the Scandanavian Ombudsman system when I was very early in my term, back in the late 1980s.  Although I knew that I lived in a country that was far more punitive, I was encouraged to think that some day I could play a role in working to reform America's prison system. As I understood it, the Ombudsman system began with a singular premise of preparing offenders to emerge from the prison experience with values, skills, and resources that would translate into a law-abiding, contributing lives.  Rather than measuring justice by the number of calendar pages that turned while society warehoused people, it measured justice by the offender's work toward reconciling with society. To encourage such transformations, the offender would meet with an ombudsman panel soon after he began serving his sentence.  People who lived in the same community where the offender intended to live upon his release would comprise the panel.  They would talk, and together they would come up with a plan for steps the offender could take during his imprisonment to demonstrate his remorse.  Once the panel and the offender came to an agreement, the offender could begin working to earn gradually increasing levels of liberty.  In time, he could earn his freedom. I read about a similar program that existed more a century ago on Norfolk Island, in Australia, which was then a penal colony for England.  The late Professor Norval Morris from the University of Chicago, wrote a wonderful book called Maconochie's Gentlemen: The Story of Norfolk Island and the Roots of Modern Prison Reform (Oxford U Press USA, 2003) which described the innovative system through which prisoners could work toward gradually increasing levels of liberty. Ironically, some important jurists in the United States have advocated on the need for prison reforms that would bring innovations to America's prison system.  While working to educate myself about America's prison system, I remember reading an article titled \"Factories with Fences\" by former Chief Justice Warren Burger.  (see http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/jus-24a.pdf)  The article that Justice Burger wrote suggested that people in prison should have opportunities \"to earn and learn\" their way to freedom.  Another jurist, Anthony Kennedy, delivered a magnificent and inspiring keynote speech to the American Bar Association when it hosted its annual meeting in San Francisco about a decade ago.  Justice Kennedy surprised the distinguished guests in the audience when he spoke about the need for prison reform, saying that we incarcerate too many people in this country, and people serve sentences that are far longer than necessary. (see Justice Kennedy Full Speech Text) Those stories about Nordic ombudsman systems, Australian prison reforms, and judicial recommendations inspired my journey.  Although I would have to serve a quarter century in American prisons of every security level, I spent every day working to prepare myself for life upon release.  That adjustment made a huge difference in my return to society, and I documented that journey in my book Earning Freedom: Conquering a 45-Year Prison Term. (Earning Freedom @ Michael Santos) ",

            "answer_text": "In all fairness, I've thought that India had one of the worst prison systems in the world.  Most Indian prisons have been and still are:  Overcrowded - Occupancy rate is almost always over 100%, and the capacity is overstated in the first placeCorrupted - Almost anything is possible within an Indian jail provided one has money and connections. Anything from cigarettes to call girls can be \"arranged\".Underfunded - Prison funding hasn't been on top of the government's agenda. And whatever little is spent is siphoned off by politicians.Breeding Grounds - The prisons are mostly breeding grounds for hardened criminals.Lawless - There is very little in the name of law inside a prison. Everybody is at the mercy of the wardens. Wardens torturing prisoners is very common.I never thought India could have an innovative prison until I read about the Sri Sampurnanand Khula Bandi Shivir (Open Jail), started in Rajasthan, India in 1963. Salient features of the prison:   The prison has about 160 male and female inmates. All of them are convicted murderers. The facility is 10 acres in size.There is no gender segregation in the prison, and prisoners get to bring their families, or live with them as they please.Inmates can venture out into the town next door and seek work / ply their businesses. One inmate who is serving for having poisoned, strangled, and burned his wife actually works as a teacher for school children.There are only three wardens for the prison complex. There isn't much in the name of security.Roll call is typically at day-break and dawn. There is a night curfew though, prisoners are expected to stay within their \"houses\" or \"cells\". There's a lock-down only if a prisoner goes missing. Norms get stricter after an escape.Prisoners pay a prison tax from their earnings, which partially funds the prison maintenance costs.Amazingly there have been very few attempts at escape. The primary reason for this, according to the wardens, is the fact that anybody attempting to escape, if caught, is sent back to a \"regular\" prison. So I guess prisoners know that they can enjoy freedom and earn money while they complete their sentence. While almost all inmates are convicted murderers, the prison apparently has a very specific screening system and doesn't admit serial killers, terrorists, rapists, drug convicts, and armed robbery convicts. And most prisoners usually come after serving a couple of years at a regular jail.  The model started in 1963 with 11 prisoners and has proven extremely successful. Apparently there are 28 open jails in India now, and this too is a surprise to me. ",
