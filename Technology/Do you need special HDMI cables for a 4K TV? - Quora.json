            "answer_text": "There are two HDMI cable speeds, Category 1 (Standard) and Category 2 (High Speed). These are available with or without Ethernet, but you don\u2019t care about that.  If you have HD video sources, like regular Blu-ray, HD satellite or cable, HD network player, etc. any old HDMI cable will be fine.  If you have UltraHD (aka 4K) video sources, like UltraHD Blu-ray, you will probably want a high speed cable. Now, if you grab any old cable and try it out, it might just work between your 4K source and your television. Most standard cables made for HDMI 1.3 and under 5m in length will support common 4K speeds, even though they\u2019re not specifically designed for it. The HDMI category 2 cable can support higher refresh rates and color depths than you\u2019re likely to use, and those are where your older HDMI cable probably fails. But all category 2 cables support all HDMI 2.0/2.0a. This isn\u2019t a situation like a computer connection, where you\u2019re going to worry about data dropping. It\u2019s a picture, and you can see if the picture looks good or if it\u2019s weird. Or just not there. Just check that you\u2019re actually getting 4K/UltraHD output. Sources (your player) and sinks (your monitor) negotiate for resolutions they can both support. Pretty much all 4K devices can drop back to HD if they find a reason to do so. It\u2019s pretty much going to be \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. If your cable doesn\u2019t work, try another. But it\u2019s not like the analog days, where the properties of a cable could affect the functional quality of your on-screen image. ",

First of all, HDMI is a digital signal. So, an HDMI cable will either work or not work. It is not like an expensive, shielded cable with gold plating will provide better signal. BIG MYTH. Second, we are being led to believe that we need HDMI 2.0 for 4K. That is also NOT TRUE. Check your current cable. Most likely existing cable will work for 4K. At least that is true for short distance of up to 6 feet. HDMI 2.0 is new standard that supports higher speeds including ethernet. A v1.4 cable is very likely to work. If your existing cable is not working for 4K, then shop for the cheapest 4K compatible cable in the shop. The shop assistant will try to dump the more expensive cable on you stating buzz words like \u2018best quality\u2019, \u2018peace of mind\u2019, \u2018will not damage your TV\u2019 etc. Ignore this.

            "answer_text": "No, as long as they are high speed HDMI cables you should be fine for at least modest HDMI cable runs. The package may say they are 4K certified or such, but often the same cables that carried your 1080P signal can carry the 4K signal just as well. In the future I can\u2019t say that will still be true when HDMI 2.1 is up and running, taking advantage of it\u2019s greater bandwith capability. For now, just make sure the HDMI cable says it is 18 gigs or 2.0 capable for 4K. ",

Long cables might have issues maintaining functionality under certain circumstances. This is because long cables have high electrical resistance and it lowers the available bandwidth. In case you\u2019re using long cables, you would need high quality cables for the bandwidth to be maintained. HDMI has become the most accepted and universal standard of connecting HD devices. It has been embraced by people because of its potential to change with evolving technologies, user-friendliness. It also offers High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection.
