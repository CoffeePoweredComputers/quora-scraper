            "answer_text": "Now, Web Television is transforming the whole situation. Individuals choose what, when, and how they want to watch television. Now, the televisions have become really clever. The modest TV name should be changed from' the idiot box' to' the clever idiot box.' 4K \u2013 Next Generation TV Technology Today you've got all the television companies that offer HD video. The picture resolution available in HD TVs is in the order of \"1280 X 720.\" This configuration (720p) can be found in most of today's budget HD TVs.  The mid-range TV has a larger 1920 X 1080 display. This system is commonly known as 1080p. The aspect ratio moves from 4:3 to 16:9, opening the way for a better viewing experience. The 4 K TV is an emerging technology with a resolution of 3,840 by 2,160 pixels, a minimum of 8 million pixels, four times that of Full HD (1,920 x 1,080). You will appreciate 4 K TV's crystal clearness while being as close to the screen as possible. HDR Technology If you're shopping for a new TV, retailers have probably noticed that they've started expressing 4 K TVs as the hot new trend. It's all about HDR these days\u2014 high dynamic range. Is this just another clever marketing word to make you feel outdated about your television? In a phrase, there is no. While a regular 4 K TV is fitted with more pixels than its HDTV equivalent, these pixels can be used more by an HDR TV. But what is HDR television?  An HDR TV is an optimized 4 K Television with one or more HDR formats. This is why HDR is important for now: it provides a much brighter image with a higher level of contrast between light and dark areas on the screen, while also taking advantage of more colors to create a much more realistic image. In short, it looks much better for HDR. The HDR10 is one of the most easily accessible formats. This is an open source platform somewhat close to the Android OS. To obtain the HDR10 format, there is no need to incur any licensing fee. The TV makers, however, tend to use this model.  You've talked of Dolby Audio. Did you hear from Dolby Vision? This is another that version of HDR10 available on the market. Similar to the 4000 nits present in HDR10, the Dolby Vision will accommodate up to 10,000 nits of peak brightness. The Dolby Vision will accommodate a color range of up to 12-bit. The HDR10 allows 10-bit color depth in contrast. This look is given by some leading brands like Vizio, Panasonic, and LG. Refresh Rate What's the idea? The refresh rate is the amount of frames that a TV will view per second in very simple terms. The calculating unit is Hertz. So, if we assume that a TV's refresh rate is 50 Hz, it means that in one second the TV will show 50 photos. The AC present in India runs at 60 Hz. It is therefore the highest source limit that the TV will operate.  That frequency has not improved, and today's smart TVs operate at a maximum rate of 60 Hz. you can go through to know more about technologies and tv brand ",

            "answer_text": "ULTRA HD OR 4K  Ultra HD or 4K refers to a set with a minimum resolution of 3840\u00d72160 - four times as many pixels as Full HD and eight times as many as SD. The advantage of such a high resolution is in the amount of detail you will be able to see. From the petals of a flower in a nature programme to beads of sweat on a footballer\u2019s face, pictures will be incredibly realistic and close to real life. More Ultra HD/4K content is becoming available to watch. BT Sport launched Europe\u2019s first Ultra HD channel at 50fps, which means sharper, blur-free images. Netflix subscribers can watch favourites like House of Cards and Better Call Saul in Ultra HD. The price of Ultra HD/4K sets have dropped over the last few years and they are much more affordable and over 50% of TVs sold now support Ultra HD/4K. ",
