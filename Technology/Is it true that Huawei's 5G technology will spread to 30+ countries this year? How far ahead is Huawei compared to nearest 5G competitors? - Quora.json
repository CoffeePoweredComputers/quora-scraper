            "answer_text": " Image: Credit Huawei is quite far ahead of other companies in terms of 5G technology. The company has adopted certain strategies which have made it not only faster than others but also stand apart from the rest of its competitors. Huawei has started researching on 5G technology long before and has developed the world\u2019s first 5G core chip named Huawei TIANGANG which has breakthrough 5G speeds and performance when it comes to computing power, and spectral bandwidth. This chip is highly advanced and supports large scale integration of active power amplifiers (PAs) and passive antenna arrays into very small antennas. Further, this chip has superfast computing capacity with an increase of 2.5 folds when compared with previous chips. A single chip can also control up to 64 channels using advanced algorithms and beamforming technology. The chip is also future ready with 200 MHz high spectral bandwidth support integrated into it. Huawei has also tied up with several countries across the world to deploy and expand the 5G network.  Hope it helps! OKportal Technology ",

            "answer_text": "This is more propaganda bullshit. A Chinese PR firm jumps on Quora and other sites and asks questions about Huawei. Those same firms, using different accounts answer the question. Read some of the answers, they sound like commercials. \u201c\u201cOh we have this new chip that does this and that\u201d. Bullshit. The chip and the technology isn\u2019t new in the sense that Huawei invented it, it new in the sense that it is the first chip of its kind that Huawei has built, or the first time that Huawei is using that technology. Huawei doesn\u2019t invent shit. They steal. They go into a market and offer to build a network for half of what other vendors do it for. They can do this because the Chinese government subsidizes them. What do you think the Chinese government gets in return? Data, information, espionage, information theft. In the meantime the vendors who really invented the technology get screwed because they get stuck with all the R&D costs and have rock bottom their prices in order to compete. ",
