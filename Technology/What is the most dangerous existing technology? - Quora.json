Armed drone planes when used by people with a lack of morals or a miracle system with a low value of life. Robots. Computer control processes (nucular, electrical, medical, traffic). Self driving cars. The list includes almost every application of technology. How can we measure what is more dangerous, realistically? ",

We improve it, so it is just a tiny-little more intelligent, then humans. Because it can improve itself, in a couple of seconds, it could get hundreds of thousands times more intelligent then us. I mean, we would not know if the AI would be kind, but there is the possibility that it would just kill all of us. ",
