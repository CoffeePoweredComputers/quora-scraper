            "answer_text": "Approximately once a month, Dave and I meet up. Generally, I go down to Virginia - we live about 5 hours away from one another - but occasionally he comes up here. It would make more sense financially for him to come here more often, since I have a place here and down there we need to get a hotel room because he lives with his parents for the time being, but with his work schedule and older car, it\u2019s not as easy for him to get up here and I don\u2019t mind the drive regardless. Soon though, I\u2019m moving back into my parents\u2019 home for a few months to save up some cash and look actively for a different job, so that\u2019s gonna change too. I\u2019m fairly certain we\u2019ll be skipping the month of September for our visit. Our relationship\u2019s been a bit rocky lately, and on top of it we\u2019ve both got some bills coming up and a few odd payments on other things that just are making this harder than normal. We were supposed to visit on the 22nd of September, but I mentioned potentially pushing it off until the following weekend and he wasn\u2019t opposed, just said we can feel it out. Today, I secretly booked a hotel room (tentatively, with a cancellation option) for the last weekend of the month since rates are super cheap because of the hurricane - so I wanted to lock that in before they go up and everyone is scrambling to get a cheap room. I\u2019m not gonna tell him until we discuss it further but I have a few weeks still and don\u2019t wanna put the pressure on to make it seem like I have to see him, even though I want to so badly. We both do. We just know things are tight right now and, unfortunately, things happen. We\u2019re hoping to close distance sometime, but we gotta get there first. So, for now, we\u2019re hanging onto those one-a-month-ish visits and hoping it all pans out the way optimism wants it to. ",

            "answer_text": "Funny how when you add a few miles the view of a relationship changes to locality? People in love visit each other everyday no matter where they are. They are together wherever their hearts are. I might suggest there are more couples that lay next to each other that are worlds apart more so than two hearts that are in love that have miles to conquer. The touch of your hand on me erodes walls to a memory you gave to me with a touching from eternity. It is a felt love that springs forth from within. Love within brings you to me with every breath, every thought, and that kiss passes tomorrow into today. Many can be next to each other, but not know each other. So now I ask you, \u201cHow often should couples in a long distance relationship visit each other?\u201d You feel love completely wherever you are when you allow love in. The greatest love is within you no matter where you rest your head. To be loved is only where you allow your heart to exist. Give me your heart and I will show you true love. I took yours. Do you see where it is? It is where you are. :) you were just visited. ",
