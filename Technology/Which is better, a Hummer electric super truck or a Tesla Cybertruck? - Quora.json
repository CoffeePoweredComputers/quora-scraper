            "answer_text": "Musk has admitted that the cybertruck will not be made because it is too large and won\u2019t even fit in a garage. He said they will begin working on a smaller more conventional truck but now he has to start from a clean sheet of paper. Most automotive designs take 3-5 years to go from initial concept to consumer-ready production units. Most manufacturers have models on a 4-6 year \"remodel circuit\" which means they will undergo a major remodeling in look and powertrain every 4 to 6 years. Unfortunately, Musk has decided to not remodel the S/X lines after 8 years. As far as the Hummer is concerned, full scale mass production is only a year away and it is a very impressive \u201csuper truck\u201d with prices starting at $70,000. Check out the \u201cReveal\u201d video released by GM today.

Musk should have had a mid-sized mass market pickup on the market 3 years ago. ",
