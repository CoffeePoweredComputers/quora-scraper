            "answer_text": "KELLY WEARSTLER  The New Yorker dubbed her \u201cthe presiding grande dame of West Coast interior design,\u201d but Kelly Wearstler is more rock star than matronly personage. Author, blogger, outr\u00e9 fashion plate, branding virtuoso (from sheets to jewelry), and decorator and muse of the Viceroy and Tides hotels\u2014Wearstler cuts a profile as colorful as those of her clients (Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale, among others). PETER MARINO  \u201cI want to create the illusion\u2014and the reality\u2014of permanence.\u201d These are not Peter Marino\u2019s words; they belong to the late Renzo Mongiardino, one of his biggest influences. But Marino\u2019s work certainly embodies their wisdom. Like the Italian illusionist, Marino believes in the seamless integration of architecture and interiors and also happens to be an aesthetic polymath. VICTORIA HAGAN INTERIORS  Victoria Hagan has long been respected for the intelligent integration of architecture and interior design. Her design philosophy features a refined use of materials, sophisticated color, and strong silhouettes. Victoria has been awarded many of the country\u2019s top design honors, including Architectural Digest\u2019s AD100. HITCHCOX & STARCK- YOO  Since 1999, yoo has worked with international developers, designing landmark residential and hotel projects throughout Asia, Australia, Europe, Africa, North and South America and the Middle East. \u201dYOO is a pioneering vision for living and the result of a partnership between property entrepreneur John Hitchcox and the ubiquitous designer, Philippe Starck.\u201d RICHARD MEIER & PARTNERS ARCHITECTS  The Pritzker Prize and AIA Gold Medal winner, Citing Bernini and Borromini as influences as well as Le Corbusier and Louis Kahn, the architect is well known for his abstracted, often white, buildings and unrelenting personal design philosophy. Meier is perhaps the best known of the group for his use of white in his designs, which he believes enhances the qualities of light in space: \u201cWhiteness allows the architectural ideas to be understood most clearly\u2014the difference between opacity and transparency, solid and void, structure and surface,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey have a greater clarity.\u201d MARMOL RADZINER  Marmol Radziner (founded 1989) is a Los Angeles-based design-build practice founded and led by architects Leo Marmol, FAIA and Ron Radziner, FAIA. The firm offers a full range of design services, including architectural design, programming, master planning, historic restoration, landscape design, interior design, and furniture design. Marmol Radziner specializes in residential, restoration, multifamily, commercial, retail, hospitality, educational, and community projects. ALBERTO PINTO  Borrowing from various cultural influences from his earliest childhood, Alberto Pinto, an inescapable actor of interior design, has built his works on the interbreeding and mixture of genders from more than baroque to less than bare. \u201dAlberto Pinto Interior Design appropriates the eclectic taste of its international clientele in adjusting its decors to each of their desires all the while adding elegance which creates a balance within such opulence. Classical or contemporary, intimate or gigantesque, at ease in all disciplines with the leitmotiv being a feeling of comfort and an expectation of the highest quality.\u201d ALAN WANZENBERG  Authenticity is the defining marker of this New York City architecture and interior-design standout, headed by Alan Wanzenberg. The 25-year-old firm\u2019s stirring residential projects, among them a barnlike shingle-and-stone manor, a country house with a Lutyens-esque countenance, and a honey-toned apartment with a 1930s Parisian air, are endowed with the heft and solidity that come from traditional materials expertly handled. EMILY SUMMERS  Her luxurious yet restrained interiors have won her and her firm the respect of the Southwest\u2019s leading architects, particularly Antoine Predock and Lake | Flato. In the realization of her soulful contemporary style, Summers continually experiments with new materials and intriguing marriages of texture\u2014a soft wool carpet lapping at the base of a board-molded concrete wall, Venetian plaster alongside plainly finished wood. JOHN BARMAN INC.  Glamorous Op Art modernity is the specialty of John Barman\u2019s Manhattan interior-design firm, as evidenced in airy high-rise apartments splashed with brightly hued art, textiles, and accessories. (Defining favorites include 20th-century glass, particularly Blenko, and contemporary paintings by such powerhouses as Karen Davie and Ross Bleckner.) ",
