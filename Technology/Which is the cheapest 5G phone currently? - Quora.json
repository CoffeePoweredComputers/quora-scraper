            "answer_text": "We saw a whole bunch of 5G smartphones launch in 2019 in markets where 5G is already a thing but one unifying factor among all those phones were that they were all quite expensive, at least in comparison to 4G LTE variants. But come 2020, brands are trying to see things differently and CES seems to be platform where OEMs and chipmakers want to make 5G less niche.  The Coolpad Legacy 5G draws its power from a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 processor. The device is launched in a single 4GB RAM and 64GB storage configuration. The device is said to run on the sub-6GHz spectrum of 5G making it ideal for countries like China but not so much for those in the US. It comes with Android 10 out-of-the-box and the company has also promised timely firmware updates rollout. The handset is equipped with a 6.53-inch LCD display, sporting a waterdrop notch for the selfie camera. The display is HDR 10 certified and offers an FHD+ resolution. In terms of optics, the Coolpad Legacy 5G packs two cameras at the rear panel. The camera comprises a 48MP primary sensor aided by an 8MP ultra-wide-angle sensor. The notch upfront packs a 16MP camera for selfies and video calling. While the majority of brands shifting towards a triple/quad rear camera setup on their premium devices, Coolpad using a dual-camera module is a move to reduce the cost. It would be interesting to see how the camera performs in day-to-day usage. Other features include a fingerprint scanner for biometric authentication placed at the rear panel and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Rounding off the specification sheet is a 4,000mAh battery unit. As for the pricing, the Coolpad Legacy 5G phone is announced at $400 which translates to (approximately INR 28,815) in India.
