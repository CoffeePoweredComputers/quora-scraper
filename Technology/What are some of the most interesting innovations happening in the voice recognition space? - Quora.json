            "answer_text": "Verbble - www.verbble.com  An exciting company current developing innovative cutting edge speech recognition and voice workflow solutions is www.verbble.com. They are the only provider of cloud-based speaker dependent voice profiles, enabling users to have a constantly adapting voice profile (leading to 99%+ accuracy) that is available on any device or OS(iOS, Windows, Android, Blackberry)..not even Nuance can provide this with their own software. Think of having your own voice profile that follows you from device-to-device as you log in to your Android phone, iPad, Windows desktop, living room, etc...this is available today with all of Verbble's innovative speech recognition and voice workflow offerings.  Verbble's solutions are all asynchronous (backfilling) vs. Nuance and Apple's slow synchronous Dragon/ Dictation offerings that make you wait until each utterance is filled. Verbble's TalkAnywhere provides full speech-to-text dictation for any Windows laptop/desktop today..why wait for Apple's slow solution.  Verbble's VoiceForms can take any page with an input (CRM, web page, PDF, etc) and speech optimize it (as well as save all of the native inputs-pull downs, etc) so that you can then Talk, Type, or Tap that information into your new contact form, contract, etc and then send that information to virtually any endpoint, as well as multiple endpoints (Outlook, Salesforce, email, etc). Solutions like Verbble that help mobile users overcome the current limitations of mobile data input with increased multimodal input, but also work with your enterprise systems to eliminate duplication and increase productivity are the wave of the future.
