            "answer_text": "Your question is vague. What do you mean? Languages? There is still quite a large percentage of static html websites out there (estimated at about 10%), some of which also use some JavaScript. The most common used language by far is PHP (estimates vary between 43% to 79% of all sites, but note those numbers are very unreliable). A distant second is ASP.NET. A distant third is Java, closely followed by Ruby. In fifth place is python. Please note with any of those languages mentioned is also combined with HTML (for structure, anything you see in the source code in the browser is basically html) and CSS for styling, and often includes JavaScript. Not to mention if you store anything, you use SQL databases or non-SQL. Sometimes sites or web applications also use XML based languages. Whatever language used, people often also use frameworks to help with development or have developed systems to aid people. For example within PHP the most widely used content management system is WordPress, which accounts for about half of the CMS used. A web framework within php that is gaining in popularity is Laravel. For example a known object relational mapping tool used in Java might be the hibernate framework. Sometimes sites or rather web applications use multiple languages. I could mention a lot more but then it would make for a very long list. ",

            "answer_text": "The actual website itself uses HTML which is just text written in such a way, and with certain rules, that a web browser can understand. Most of it is a hangover from the 1990s. The other technology is the web server. This is basically a computer that sits connected to the internet and waits for requests to it for the web page. When it gets one it sends it back to the request. That is basically it. ",
