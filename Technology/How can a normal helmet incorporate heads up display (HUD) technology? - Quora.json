            "answer_text": "I am certain most of the people might be aware of the brand called Skully. They made a first-ever proper prototype by turning a motorcycle helmet into the likes of many aviation type HUD but with the protection of a full-face helmet. The answers below are great, but they are not ordinary helmets and I doubt if any normal people would succeed getting their hands on a thousand dollar technology used by the military for state-of-the-art combat machines. So lets back a bit and focus on the actual question which I am assuming is \u201cnormal helmet\u201d = \u201cstreet helmet\u201d for motorcycle riding. With that in mind, here is what I think\u2026 Certainly, a regular street helmet can be kitted with the HUD unit to stream information from an external source like a mobile phone or on-board computers of a motorcycle. Now the challenge ahead of such an engineering feat is always the \u201csize limitation.\u201d It is also the answer to this question. A normal helmet can incorporate HUD when more space is available. If you looked up Skully, you\u2019ll notice it appears slightly different from a regular street helmet. It is bigger and elongated. That\u2019s because all the complex hardware and power unit had to be shrunk to fit into a street-legal helmet. Electronics in an aviation-grade helmet was always possible because of space availability and lack of size regulation. Remember, a pilot\u2019s helmet is not built for crash protection. So the liner is thin making more room for mounting HUD and other electronics. The power to the system is provided by the aircraft. A motorcycle helmet has the size and weight regulations to comply with before it\u2019s made street legal. So manufacturers must play within tolerances without compromising the wearer\u2019s safety. This is one reason why this is technology is still on the anvil. From the safety perspective, I think it could get in the way of safe riding because a new user must train and adapt to avoid getting distracted by the information populated on the display. While pilots train thousands of hours to consume HUD information and perform flight operations without risk, an average motorist may not have the dexterity to read basic information and avoid traffic hazards at the same time. Therefore, due to the enormous learning curve and overall complexity, it isn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s interest to build a practical helmet with HUD. In theory, it saves the effort to look up information on the go. With the improvement in technology, it's possible to have a compact unit with better battery performance. But until that happens, we can continue hoping it could someday become a reality. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s Head up display. Most of us only have one head. They\u2019re called Helmet Mounted Displays. You could do something like this  Elbit\u2019s HMD Or this  BAE Systems\u2019 Striker II HMD Or this  The F-35 HMD. Modern display devices can be small and light while remaining bright - the brightness is important as a lot of the image brightness is lost in the combiner, since the pilot must be able to see through it very well. Small and light means they are not too large a burden on the pilot\u2019s neck. Optical waveguides can be used to take the display image from the collimating lens system (next to the display) to the combiner (in front of the pilot\u2019s eye(s). Or mirrors can be used. ",

So you don't need to take your eyes to look down as in both of these instances you're looking straight through and you don't change your focal length. The technology is used for aviation for fighter pilots in the military. It's also used in top-of-the-range cars like BMW. So the design has already been carried out the testing has already been carried out and it's been proven. The head-up display is much better and fit for purpose for the use of motorcycling. more ",

            "answer_text": "No. Heads up display is a specialty display provided on high end cars which has an associated cost and extensive technology and machinery incorporated behind it. Heads-up display (HUD) systems can project information on the car windshield, to tell you where to turn, notify you of lane markings, identify how close the car in front of you is and even give you restaurant information all right in front of your eyes -- and while you're actually able to see those objects or places. The technology is similar to what fighter pilots use to guide precise movements at supersonic speeds. From the safety perspective, I think it could get in the way of safe riding because a new user must train and adapt to avoid getting distracted by the information populated on the display. While pilots train thousands of hours to consume HUD information and perform flight operations without risk, an average motorist may not have the dexterity to read basic information and avoid traffic hazards at the same time.
