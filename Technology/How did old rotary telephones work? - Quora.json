            "answer_text": "The question is \u201cHow did old rotary telephones work?\u201d You\u2019re talking about the most basic of POTS - Plain Old Telephone Service[1] . The old, rotary dial telephones were just a small part of a much more complicated machine - the local telephone switch (local being local to a small town or several large neighborhoods.) As part of the greater machine (local switch), and in order to minimize the number of individual wires connecting the handset (rotary telephone) to the larger switch, a signalling mechanism was used involving completing and interrupting a circuit with multiple voltages, both AC and DC. When a call was received AND the phone was \u201con hook\u201d (such as the receiver being in the cradle), the local switch would send a high voltage AC signal to activate the bell[2] , at around 20Hz. Once the receiver was picked up (the phone was \u201coff hook\u201d), the local switch would detect that and stop the ringer signalling. The mouthpiece in the receiver (the part you spoke into) was a \u201ccarbon microphone\u201d[3] that would change the electrical resistance with the pressure waves of the sound impacting on it. This change in resistance would produce the analogue electrical signal representing the voice of the speaker. Conversely, the sound from the other end was impressed on the pair of wires at a higher frequency (than the ringer). A system of passive electronic filters made of inductors, capacitors, and resistors separated the mouthpiece signal from the earpiece signal.  In order to make a call, the receiver would be lifted off the cradle, changing the phone from \u201con hook\u201d to \u201coff hook\u201d state, completing the DC circuit. The local switch would detect this (and would usually provide feedback as a low frequency buzz.) The local switch would connect the phone circuit to a \u201cstepper\u201d switch. Operating the dial would (quickly) switch the DC circuit at a fixed rate (frequency.) This frequency was low enough that it was possible for some agile people to actually make phone calls by tapping the cradle \u201chook\u201d button fast enough, with the right timing. (A parlor trick for nerdy teenagers.) This fixed rate of on-off switching is the \u201cpulses\u201d of pulse dialing[4] . In the original design, it caused the stepper switch[5] to step through it\u2019s various positions and then (usually) proceed to connect to another stepper switch.  These stepper switches were electro-mechanical and hideously complex (for the time - and even for now.) The sheer physical size and number of these stepper switches needed for each subscriber line, the number of cross connects needed, etc. meant that most of these switches didn\u2019t support more than 5-digit dialing.

            "answer_text": "Very well, actually. Much, much better than the latest phones: You could throw one through a glass window, or at a burglar, to break the window or give the burglar a bad concussion.It took a while to dial a girl\u2019s number, so you could chicken out.All the electronics were potted in a honey-like oil, so you could drop the phone in the pool, leave it there for a week, fish it out, and it would probably work just fine.They never, ever broke, even if you\u2019d had the same phone for 30 years.They cost you NOTHING. Well, like maybe $2 a month on your phone bill.They had something called a hybrid, a special transformer, a bit of analog magic, which allowed TWO-WAY talking, both ways, simultaneously, all the time.There were never cutouts, one-way conversations, drop-outs, or battery-low or battery-dead situations during a critical phone job interview. Never.You could actually cradle the handset between ear and shoulder.There were no people walking around Piggly-Wiggly talking loudly. \u201cYES, I DROVE MY JAGUAR TO PIGGLY-WIGGLY. THE FURGESICKLES ARE 12 CENTS MORE TODAY. YES, MY BIG BOYS ACHE TOO FROM WHAT WE DID. DOES YOUR WIFE SUSPECT? I\u2019M GOING TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON DRUNK IN MY HAMMOCK WHILE MY POOL-BOY WASHES MY CAR WITH HIS TEARS. WHAT\u2019S THAT? YOU CUT OUT. HERE, LET ME TAKE A WOBBLY VIDEO OF THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS HERE, THEY LOOK LIKE MY TWO BOYS. NO, SHAPE AND COLOR. OK, SAME ALLEY, SAME TIME. OH, YOU LEFT YOUR ROLLS TRUNK KEY IN THE BOWL AT THE PARTY. We don\u2019t need to hear all that.",
