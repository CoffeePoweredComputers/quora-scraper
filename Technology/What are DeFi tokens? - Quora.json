            "answer_text": "DeFi is an abbreviation of the phrase decentralized finance which generally refers to the digital assets and financial smart contracts, protocols, and decentralized applications (DApps) built on Ethereum. To put it layman terms, it is financial software built on the blockchain that can be pieced together like Money Legos. Currently the most popular and fasting growing sector of DeFi is borrowing and lending platforms. Similar to a bank, users deposit money and earn interest from other users borrowing their assets. However, in this case the assets are digital and smart contracts connect the lenders to borrowers, enforce the terms of the loans, and distribute the interest. And it all happens without the need to trust one another or middleman bank. And, by cutting out the middleman, lenders can earn higher returns and more clearly understand the risks thanks to the transparency blockchain provides. Large businesses don't want to miss out on this opportunity. however there are several barriers, use of 3rd party platforms, lack of understanding of these platforms, and also regulatory compliance. Perhaps, with blockchains like Concordium which provide the promise of Blockchain for Business, having regulatory compliance by design ( regulatory red tapeism has been a major hindrance for experimenting new technologies ) . Privacy and verification of users\u2019 identity( even offchain ) would give business a boost of confidence to develop on top of Concordium with white labeling of their products might help the customise solutions for their needs and onboard business into the DeFi world.

            "answer_text": "Decentralized finance\u2014often called DeFi or open finance\u2014refers to the economic paradigm shift enabled by decentralized technologies, particularly blockchain networks. While cryptocurrencies aim to make global payments accessible to everyone, DeFi aimes to bring it even a step further by combining both crypto and finance. Picture a world with decentralized alternatives to all of the financial services we use today, such as automated loans, savings account, insurance, investment accounts, all accessible to anyone in the world with a smartphone and internet connection. While it may sound far fetch and too innovative, to have global lending services, or earn interest on your money without a centralized party, these different negotiations are taking place today around the world using Dapps. No matter where you go to get the later daily crypto news, DeFi coins or tokens and the spark behind them is hard to ignore as the 2020 and beyond crypto bull market continues to pick up steam once again. DeFi and the entire Dapp ecosystem are one of the fastest-growing industries in crypto. The community references how much \u201cETH is locked in DEfi\u201d as a measure of the growth and popularity of the dapps. At the time of this writing, over 6.8 billion worth of crypto has been locked into Defi and expected to grow in the next months and years to come. While checking the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum price every day is the most attractive part of the ecosystem as a whole, DeFi coins are offering a whole array of products that are sure to see a favorable trend in the market, potential shielding profits to everyone who invests in the right projects at the right time. If you are also want to develop your own DeFi coins or tokens, I would suggest you shake hands with the best DeFi token development company that has immense experience in blockchain technology. ",
