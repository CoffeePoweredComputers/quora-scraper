If you don\u2019t have a charger, I\u2019d probably make sure it\u2019s got at least 50% charge before attempting to \u2018restore\u2019 your old phones contents onto the phone, as it\u2019s going to consume a good amount of power if you\u2019ve got a lot of apps and data to download and it\u2019s better to not intterupt this process (though it\u2019s not a battery issue.)

            "answer_text": "No, Infact you can use liion battery anytime and charge anytime no need to consider charge state. Charge state of 20\u201380 is healthy for liion. A fully charged cell self discharges faster than partially discharged one. How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries Liion dont have memory effect like nicd. So charge and use as you wish. Some devices like android smartphone may forget full capacity if not full charged for long time as they track watthours with the voltage. Which can be recovered by 1 or 2 complete cycles or by deleting the battery stats file. Hope this is helpfull ",
