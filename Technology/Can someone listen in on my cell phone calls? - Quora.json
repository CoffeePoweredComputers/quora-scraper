            "answer_text": "Yes. Over the years of cell phone evolution the parties that have the capabilities to \u2018eavesdrop\u2019 have evolved as well. In the very early days of \u2018cellphones\u2019 as we know them they were nothing more than a very sophisticated FM transmitter/receiver pair. As you made your way to the edge of a particular cell (base station receiver/transmitter) the system would ask the adjacent cells \u2018who has the best signal on this conversation?\u2019 the next cell would say \u2018I do!\u2019 then the system would change channels on your \u2018radio\u2019 to the new frequencies in the next cell, and then hand you off to the new cell, making your old channel pair available for a new conversation. IF you had a scanner capable of receiving those frequencies, you could just program them into the scanner and hear conversations. Or, at least PART of them. You had no way of predicting what channels would be used in the future during a hand-off, and there were hundreds of channels available. By the time you found the right one, the conversation was probably over. EXEPT if you were the GOVERNMENT. THEY had the computer power and voice ID systems to track conversations in real time. Privacy was a big thing with the cell phone companies too. They wanted to be able to market the privacy aspect of cell phones. So what did they do? I mean, all you needed was a scanner and patience, right? The phone manufacturers lobbied the government to make listening in illegal! Don't modify the phones, shift the blame and responsibility to the scanner manufacturers! At no cost! NNow fast forward to today. EVERYTHING IS DIGITAL. All audio is now a digital stream, and can be digitally stored. On a disk, a chip a thumb drive, or in some massive data storage center run by the NSA or some other government entity. PONDER THIS. A few years ago, there was a \u201cnear miss\u201d in the landing pattern near some airport in the United States. (I don't remember where or when, Google it and it will probably come up) and one of the Air Traffic Controllers was thought to be talking to someone on his cell phone, causing his attention to wander. Say it happened on Monday. On the Tuesday night news, it's alleged that he was on the phone, talking to his girlfriend. On the Wednesday night news, they said he was having an argument with his girlfriend, and she threatened to leave him. By Friday the news people had a friggin\u2019 TRANSCRIPT OF THE CONVERSATION! How? Someone accessed the digital storage of the phone conversation and leaked it to the news networks. The government has the capability to LOOK BACK at an event and find anything relevant to the incident that was spoken about on a cell phone. YOU NEED TO ASK YOURSELF, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO. ACT IN \u201cREAL TIME\u201d? I personally don't think they have the computational capacity to do so at present. WHAT. ABOUT. THE. FUTURE? ",

It is unencrypted and Big Brother has been using technology for years to eavesdrop on alleged spies and domestic threats for decades. Unfortunately, the FCC has no safeguards against this to protect consumers because the government has a vested interest in national security. Only companies like Apple may provide some semblance of security to private owners so as not to compel the authorities to hack into Apple\u2019s software. But as was seen, someone found a way and got big bucks to do so. By the way, check out the fine print on any FCC device you have lying around. It says \u201cThis device must not interfere with other devices and must accept interference from other devices.\u201d Paraphrasing, but it tells a lot about how the FCC handles business. Slashdot ",

The only way for someone to intercept calls is for them to trick your phone into connecting to a fake cell and you can build one for under $1000 if you know what you are doing. But the problem is the person or persons spying can only do this if they are within some relatively short range of you and if they do it they are breaking the law. In 99.9999% of cases no one is listening to anyone, the main point is we are generally unimportant enough for someone to bother. ",

Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) and Phone Calls and Phone Messages all work the same way as the internet does: They all take Bits, however they are stored, turn them to electrical currents and eventually as electromagnetic wireless waves, sent over to the receiving end in things called Packets. If one were able to intercept and view waves all around the globe they would be able to locate the waves that you and your friend are using to call each other and eavesdrop on you. Luckily such a device would need to be immensly powerful and would not be portable. The downside of technology is that it all uses mathematical logic and hence can be hacked. Ever wonder why the only thing that has remained to be hacked yet is the Brain? Because Biology gave math the finger and it worked like magic ;) ",

You cannot detect this.For everyone else, there is spyware on the phone itself and there is forget it. Spyware on the phone requires a hidden application to be installed and usually requiring the phone to be \"rooted\" or jailbroken in order to install it. Then you pay your monthly subscription and you can get almost everything from the phone. You might have a clue because the battery will discharge quicker than before. You might notice increased data usage. But you can't tell from examining the phone - it is hidden. ",

On your landline, one can put a tap on the wires but this requires either direct access to the wire plant (which may be easy in a flat building\u2026) OR you to use an analogue wireless phone. (Including most of the long range versions) The latter is easy to tap into by a 3rd party using a suitable receiver. So, only use DECT\u2026 When using a gsm, this is only possible for competent authorities and only when a court order has been issued. This is due to the encryption used on the radio part of the link. A maybe is valide for internet calls, I would think that under certain circumstances a tap is possible. Note that Any phone tap is illegal and only allowed for competent authorities governed by a court order. ",

BUT it is very easy for a hacker to break into your phone and listen to your conversations, steal passwords, and any other information you\u2019ve used your phone for, and sadly you will never even know they did it.

If you're just cheating on your wife then even if she found out that way it could not be used against you in court, but could be used against her to throw her in the can.
