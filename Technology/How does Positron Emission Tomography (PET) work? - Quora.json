            "answer_text": "This is a complex topic but I'll try to put in lay terms. PET scanning uses elements of computer aided cross sectional imaging (similar to CT and MRI scanning) and nuclear medicine imaging.  In CT and MRI, images are obtained by bombarding the area of interest with an outside \"force\" if you will (in CT - X rays are sent into the body; in MRI - a radiofrequency  (RF) wave is sent into the body in the setting of a strong magnetic field). What is measured is how the cells in the body react to these perturbations. In CT, cells absorb the X rays differently and in MRI, cells emit different RF frequencies after the RF pulse is sent in. Mathematical formulae then create images in three dimensions based on the data collected In PET, a substance is injected into the body and taken up by metabolically active tissue. The tracer injected is most commonly fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) which the body treats as glucose, a metabolic substrate for all cells (meaning cells use it for \"food\").  The more active a region of metabolic activity (such as cancer cells), the more uptake of FDG. The gamma rays given off by the labeled FDG are picked up by detectors in a ring around the patient and using complex mathematical formulae a 3D image is obtained.  Conversely, PET can be used to look for decreased metabolic activity in regions of the heart after heart attacks or in the brain with diseases such as Alzheimer's.  Abnormal brain activity can be seen in some psychiatric conditions.  Since the spatial orientation of PET scans is limited (i.e., the image acquired is not very detailed), a fusion scan with a near simultaneous CT is often obtained (and less commonly, MRI is used). Now you can overlay the two images obtained so you can see exactly where the PET 'activity\" is increased anatomically.  For example, using PET/CT, one can distinguish exactly which lymph node appears to have cancer in it as it has increased activity (it's \"glowing\" due to increased metabolic activity seen in cancer). Thus a directed biopsy can be performed if necessary for further diagnosis.    ",

            "answer_text": "How does Positron Emission Tomography (PET) work? This question has been very elegantly answered by Robert Pakter's answer to How does Positron Emission Tomography (PET) work? I will try to simplify it further for myself as well as other students, as I had extreme difficulty in understanding what exactly is PET while pursuing my graduation. In the end, I have also tried to differentiate PET and MRI in measuring brain activity.  Image: PET scanning; source: Understanding the Functional Nature of Cancer: The Value of PET Before a PET scan begins, a patient is given a safe dose of a radioactive tracer compound. To measure an organ activity, doctors and scientists use FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose), which is a modified glucose molecule.   Image- Fluorodeoxyglucose Brain Imaging Technologies Understanding the Functional Nature of Cancer: The Value of PET Glucose is a type of sugar, and it is the main energy source for brain cells and cancerous cells. The injected or inhaled FDG will enter the bloodstream, where it can travel to the affected organ or an area with cancer cells. If a particular area is more active, more glucose or energy will be needed there. When more glucose is used, more radioactive material is absorbed. The PET scanner measures the energy that is emitted when positrons (positively charged particles) from the radioactive material (here radioactive material is Fluorine-18 or F-18 attached to glucose molecule replacing oxygen at 5th carbon atoms) collide with electrons (negatively charged particles). PET scanner detects gamma rays (photons), a form of energy that is produced when positrons from the radioactive tracer (F-18) collide with electrons in a particular organ. a gamma ray detector. When the scanner detects a matching pair of gamma rays, a software program determines their point of origin and creates a three-dimensional image\u2014the PET scan. The scan usually takes between 30 minutes and two hours. A computer turns energy measurements into multicoloured, two- or three-dimensional images. The result is a colourful picture showing which parts of the brain were most active, based on the amount of glucose being used there.  Image source: Brain Imaging Technologies To create the colourful PET image, a computer displays each measurement as a series of tiny dots. The colour of each dot shows the intensity of the energy signal. Red indicates the highest intensity\u2014in other words, the area of greatest brain activity. Of course, there\u2019s a trade-off for everything. While they produce vivid images of cells\u2019 functional, metabolic activity, PET scans by themselves don\u2019t produce a very precise anatomical picture. The solution is to combine the findings of a PET scan with those of a conventional imaging study (usually a CT scan) that can provide detailed anatomical information. With both PET and CT images \u201cin register,\u201d they can be readily superimposed to provide the diagnostician with both anatomical and metabolic information about the tissues and organs of interest. Image source: Robert Pakter's answer to How does Positron Emission Tomography (PET) work? PET scans may play a role in determining whether a mass is cancerous. However, PET scans are more accurate in detecting larger and more aggressive tumours than they are in locating tumours that are smaller than 8 mm and/or less aggressive. They may also detect cancer when other imaging techniques show normal results. PET scans may be helpful in evaluating and staging recurrent disease (cancer that has come back). PET scans are beginning to be used to check if a treatment is working - if tumour cells are dying and thus using less sugar. https://imaging.cancer.gov/patientsandproviders/cancerimaging/nuclearimaging Image source: Brain Imaging Technologies HOW MUCH RADIATION EXPOSURE DO I GET FROM A PET SCAN? PET scans do expose patients to ionizing radiation, though efforts are made to limit the dose. The radioactive fluorine isotope in the FDG tracer produces a dose of around 5-7mSv (millisieverts, a measure of the biological effects of ionizing radiation). An additional 23-26 mSv, however, may be acquired from the CT scan that typically accompanies the PET scan. Therefore, the PET component of the PET/CT accounts for about 20% of the radiation dose, with the CT scan portion accounting for approximately 80% of the radiation dose. These figures mean that PET scans can produce meaningful, though not immediately dangerous, levels of radiation. For this reason, experts feel strongly that the risk of every PET scan as well as any imaging study resulting in radiation exposure should be thoroughly justified by the value of the information it provides. For comparison, average annual background radiation in the Northern Hemisphere is about 2.2 mSv; it has been estimated that airliner crews receive between 4-9 mSv per year.

Nuclear Imaging (PET and SPECT) HOW DOES MRI DIFFER FROM PET IN MEASURING BRAIN ACTIVITY?  Image source: Brain Imaging Technologies Brain activity can also be measured by functional MRI. WHAT IS MRI? Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the body uses a a powerful magnetic field,radio waves anda computerto produce detailed pictures of the inside of your body. Unlike conventional x-ray examinations and computed tomography (CT) scans, MRI does not utilize ionizing radiation.Hydrogen nuclei (protons), become aligned in a magnetic field.An MRI scanner applies a very strong magnetic field (about 0.2 to 3 teslas, or roughly a thousand times the strength of a typical fridge magnet), which aligns the proton \"spins.\"The scanner also produces a radio frequency current that creates a varying magnetic field. The protons absorb the energy from the variable field and flip their spins. When the field is turned off, the protons gradually return to their normal spin, a process called precession. The return process produces a radio signal that can be measured by receivers in the scanner and made into an image. What is an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)?The amount of energy released reflects blood flow, and therefore brain activity.A computer then processes the signals and generates a series of images, each of which shows a thin slice of the body. The images can then be studied from different angles by the interpreting radiologist. Frequently, the differentiation of abnormal (diseased) tissue from normal tissues is better with MRI than with other imaging modalities such as x-ray, CT and ultrasound.
