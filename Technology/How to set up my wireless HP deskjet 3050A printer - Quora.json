            "answer_text": "Your Printer should have an ip address and if it doesn't then that is most likely why you can't print.  Your mac can auto detect printers that are on the network.  So make sure that it successfully is on the wifi network and that is the same network that your computer is on.  Print out a configuration sheet from it and make sure that your computer and printer are on the same network.  Ensure your mac can detect the printer before you try and print.   Make sure also that your printer doesn't go into sleep mode or turn itself off to conserve energy. ",
