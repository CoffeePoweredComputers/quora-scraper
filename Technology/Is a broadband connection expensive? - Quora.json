            "answer_text": "With the recent uproar of digitisation in India, mobile data rates have gone down so much that people have started to think that broadband connection might be costlier than mobile data. A broadband connection is delivered directly through wired mediums. So, the main problem is that you would need at least one wired device to connect to the network. But, whatever the case may be, a broadband connection is much faster and inexpensive as compared to mobile data. If you do not need to stay mobile, getting a broadband connection is the best choice. With Airtel, you would get data with monthly rollover facilities. You can even opt for an option for unlimited data per month. If you select the right choice, you would find that a broadband connection would be the cheaper option. You can connect multiple people on a single channel. ",
