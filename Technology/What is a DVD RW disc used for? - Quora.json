Videos, Documents, Music or anything that can stored in a digital container.If data rot sets in you can punch out a small hole in the center and install one of those cheap clock mechanisms to create a clock.When the clock fails, you can use it as a small and dangerous Frisbee.If you are sued by someone for hitting their child in the park, you can claim it has pornographic images of them and you will release it if they sue.When convicted of attempting to bride an officer of the court, you can trade it for a cigarette when you loose your appeal and are now serving 20 years in the slammer with someone who is in for life and has no idea what a DVD-RW is.",
