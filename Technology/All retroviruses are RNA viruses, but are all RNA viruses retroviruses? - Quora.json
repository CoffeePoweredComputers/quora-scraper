            "answer_text": "No. Only RNA viruses that utilize DNA at some point in their life cycle are termed retroviruses and they are all found in Group VI of the Baltimore Classification. Groups I, II, and VII are DNA based viruses and RNA is not their primary carrier of genetic information. Groups III, IV, and V, also are RNA viruses, but they do not use DNA at any point during their lifecycle. They are collectively termed riboviruses but the term is rather vague as the riboviruses are most definitely polyphyletic and different groups function in rather different ways.
