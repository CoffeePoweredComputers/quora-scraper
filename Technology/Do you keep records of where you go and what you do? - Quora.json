            "answer_text": "Depends upon what I was doing and where I was going. For work, I kept a lab notebook with various information, such as the project(s) I was working on, what I did, what were the results, and if necessary who was doing what at work, etc. In one place, I needed to keep track of the weather because some of the mineral based ceramics changed with relative humidity. Such information is also important for any legal issues to help protect yourself and also the company if necessary. If I go traveling for business, I need to keep track of expenses and my time spent working. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t get refunded for the money I spent. If I go traveling for pleasure, I would keep track of where I was so that I knew what I took a picture of. Often, I would take a picture of the sign at the trail head and various signs along the way to help keep track of the sights. I would also keep a rough track of costs so that I am sure that I was not spending money uncontrollably\u2026. I can only afford to spend so much and need to keep to my travel budget. ",

It is a good way to keep track of all the activities that you do through out the year and I believe everyone should maintain a diary. It is a good way to look back at all the good and happy things that you did through out the year. Every year on the new year\u2019s eve I look back at all the memories. I really feels great. Here are some records from my diary: I performed for the first time at an Open Mic this year. 2. Rose Exhibition  3. That\u2019s my pet Mandy.  2018 has been great till now and I have a lot of such memories(records). I wish I could share all of them with you all. ",
