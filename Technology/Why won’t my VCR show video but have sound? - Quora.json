            "answer_text": "You're hooking up a Video Cassette Recorder? You've got one that actually works? Have you confirmed it works? Are you sure you're connecting the video cables correctly? Are you using coaxial, composite, or component cables? Are there any switches on the VCR that control which output is used (I can't think of any VCRs that had such a thing but you should look at all the switches)? Come to think of it, are you trying to just play back or record? Not that I can think of a valid reason to record on VHS at all, but you might be, and that will involve even more settings and switches. If you are trying to recover some precious home movies please don't try to do this yourself on a VCR of unknown condition. You're more likely to destroy the tape than get a good image. Old decks have sticky rollers that can eat tape, in doubtlessly damaging the tape's fragile oxide layer. Also, VCR heads need regular cleaning and calibration to be able to accurately play back video. Remember having to adjust the tracking dial? Later VCRs had auto tracking but if the heads are dirty and missaligned then they can't find the track and the video is awful. You're much better off sending your tape(s) to a professional for conversation. I did the same thing with my parent's 8mm family films. I wasn't about to try to do it myself when professional duplicators are better at it and my time is more valuable than babysitting a deck to computer transfer. ",

            "answer_text": "There are three possible options. The sound cables aren\u2019t connected correctly. Check the Input and Output ends of the sound cables to make sure that they are all plugged in properly. In case they are broken, try swapping them out for another pair if you can.The VHS tape didn\u2019t record sound correctly. This option is most likely if you recorded a VHS at home. If it was working recently. than this option probably isn\u2019t the case. Try playing it in a separate VCR to make sure the tape isn\u2019t the problem.Your VCR is broken. Try playing other tapes to see if they will play sound. If they don\u2019t, than it is the VCR, and it would just make more economic sense to buy a new one.",
