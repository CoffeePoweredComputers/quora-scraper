            "answer_text": "Yes, the natural progression of mankind is not to have their quality of life dependent on their work. Mankind is creative by nature so mankind will always strive to be creative, regardless of the field, the person, or the location. Mankind\u2019s creative ability and interest will never change, but their ability to enjoy that creativity is what will change. Today humans must work to make money to survive. It\u2019s a form of enslavement. Mankind is destined to free themselves of that slavery. As long as mankind remains human they will have human needs such as food, water, shelter, social, leisure, spiritual, and materialistic needs. We currently use others or our own ability to fill those needs; we go to the grocery store or we grow our own food to supply our need for food. We have to either manually work to grow the food or work a job to earn money to buy food at the grocery store. As long as mankind doesn\u2019t destroy itself the inevitable path is turning science fiction into science fact. Mankind will eventually master our planet, our sun and the solar system and then on into the galaxy and beyond. To do this mankind will have to progress at a rapid rate and absorb new information that will be used to master energy creation, matter manipulation, and artificial intelligence via major strides in technological capabilities. We will eventually replace PCBs with organic or quantum computing. This will lead to a technological advancement never seen before. Eventually mankind will create artificial intelligence to the point that we have real time thinking robots, androids, cyborgs, and digital characters who will replace all the service based jobs that mankind does. No longer will there be doctors or surgeons because nanotech will handle the maintenance, diagnosis, and repair of the human body via artificial intelligence. Human bodies will never age, and thus never die. These machines will be on par with human ability thus they will become a race in and of themselves handling the tasks that humans once needed to do. Instead of going to work you\u2019d send your robot to the office. Your robot earns the money while you progress mentally and emotionally without restrictions. Then money itself will become obsolete when machines will be similar to that of Star Trek with replicators and transporters. These two futures solve the problems with economics as scarcity of goods and services are eliminated. Our system of economics is a human trap, it only exists by having divisions of classes. For there to be rich people there must be poor people. For money to have value it has to be scarce and unequally distributed. If money was equally shared then money would be unneeded. So as long as scarcity still exists people will suffer. Replicators and machines can eliminate scarcity in the workforce by eliminating the need for humans to work to maintain their quality of life. The machines would do the tasks. However there would still be scarcity in time and location and decisions. We can\u2019t be in two places at once and we can\u2019t travel throughout time, and we still have to pick and choose whether you attend your son\u2019s football game or your daughter\u2019s volleyball game; we only have so many hours in a day. Suffering exists do to scarcity so while we can eliminate two forms of it via machines there still exists a dilemma in other forms of scarcity. Machines using/creating, multiple universes, virtual reality, brain capacity, quantum mechanics, and time travel can and eventually will solve those dilemmas. Mankind is only getting started and thus machines will be the tools to achieve the utopia that every living creature is innately working towards. Machines won\u2019t replace mankind, they will relinquish the bonds that keep mankind in enslavement. When will they replace mankind, as in totality? That i don\u2019t know, i have a inner thought that says there will soon be a new revolution of technology that will propel mankind faster than before. It\u2019s the fear of mankind that is trying to hold onto the old ways of doing things. Mankind will always have a desire to create and produce and this advancement won\u2019t eliminate mans instinct of creativity and productivity, but rather this will give mankind endless amounts of time to pursue creativity and productivity without the threat of loss. This provides mankind even more options than before. Imagine having a replicator from Star Trek. You can go to the replicator and ask for a T-bone steak cooked medium. The replicator looks through it\u2019s system and gives you a list of T-bone steak recipes that have been added to the systems memory by different cooks and chefs around the world (seeing how the memory of the system will be linked through the internet). You pick a certain one (just like a music playlist) and poof, within a second or two you have a perfectly cooked steak dinner in front of you. This is nice, but it eliminates the ability to be creative and produce your own. How do we resolve this dilemma? Simple, you ask the replicator to produce the ingredients you need, albeit already measured or in their respective containers, packages, boxes (however you choose). You take the ingredients, wash them, prepare them, and cook your own steak dinner. What if you want to grow the veggies instead of having them poof into thin air? Ask the replicator for the plants or the seeds needed to grow and go and plant them, wait the appropriate time until harvest, and then harvest and make your dinner. Restaurants would still exist if you have the desire to go out to eat and you can pick whether you want a replicated meal or a meal cooked by a machine or an available human who decided to go to work. If a human decided not to go to work that day he could still produce a steak from his own home, add it to the replicator and transfer the dinner from his own home to the restaurant within seconds. Either way it\u2019s a win win for everyone. With this level of technology we don\u2019t have to lose the creativeness and productiveness that mankind needs, but now mankind isn\u2019t forced to work for survival. An added bonus is that if a replicator can assemble atoms we no longer need to kill animals or destroy wildlife. You need wood to build a house or you like to make things from wood; simply have the replicator produce the wood without cutting down trees in nature. When you want the steak dinner you don\u2019t have to kill a cow to get the meat, simply have the replicator produce the beef. Imagine how organic the beef would be without all the additives fed to cows, pollution contaminants, or special additives used for longevity. With a proper moral compass mankind can enjoy the benefits of technology without losing what makes them human. It all sounds great, but if mankind does not have a higher power involved with their daily lives they will never get to the point of actually solving problems with technology. We will remain in the state of destruction, slavery, and eventual death. A higher power is needed to morally guide our hearts and enlighten us with love or it\u2019s all for nothing. ",

            "answer_text": "YES, thinking machines will replace most if not all human workers. It is has been happening for decades, it is accelerating and it will complete within 100 - 200 years. Perhaps 75% of the jobs will be gone in 50 years. No existing or future job without exception is safe simply because computers are general purpose thinking machine smarter, less error prone and more creative than humans in the long run. Take a few minutes and watch the short overview video before reading on.  It may change your vision of the future.  Robots / computer assisted humans produce goods and services cheaper / more efficiently than humans alone.  In a capitalist system robots will win as the companies using technology will dominate in the marketplace as only the most profitable companies survive and grow.  The world's capital is flowing towards automation and away from investing in human labor simply because automation has a better ROI.  This is the tipping point economically speaking.  The point of no return. Perfect is the enemy of good In an engineering / technology business sense means you do not have to replace the worker with technology.  You simply have to make the worker more productive with technology, using less workers in total while increasing economic production.  The robot / computer / software works cooperatively with the worker.  So in the end where there used to be 1M jobs, it reduces to 800k then to 500k then to 250k etc ...  over time as technology advances.  All the while the production of goods and services is rising with lower costs.  When economic growth requires less people and jobs year after year you have an insurmountable problem. This is happening at the present time.  This is why we have a \"jobless\" recovery.  No one wants to acknowledge the reason why.  The trend of technology replacing virtually every worker destroys the model of capitalism.  Capitalism assumes that economic production chiefly employees people not machines.  Workers derive personal wealth from employment.  When the majority of goods and services are produced by machines without human labor then the capitalist model falls completely apart. Technology is a chief driver of growing wealth inequality in the USA and the world.  This has created a rich class of owners (the 5% that make and own the technology along with the minority that they employ) and an increasingly poorer class of workers scrambling for an ever decreasing number of low paying service jobs. In Silicon Valley there is an elite relatively small economic class of ordinary citizens with a large amount of wealth derived solely from automation (also known as productivity technology / disruptive change which is tech speak for doing more output with less workers). As for the argument that productivity technology only impacts low paying jobs is false.  Automation is first geared precisely towards high paying, high value jobs.  That is where the money and profits reside for automation.  Bill Gates is still the richest person in the world in part because he automated high paid office work with Microsoft office and email.  Yes CPAs, business and finance people use excel as their primary language.  What would take a CPA in the 1960's a month to do can be done in an hour today.  Most financial software automates jobs that accountants performed. In fact venture capital and invested corporate capital deliberately targets those jobs / industries with the highest costs.  It will likely take a 100 years to maybe 200 years to completely replace most jobs with technology.   It may never fully complete perhaps leaving 1% or 10% of the population having to perform needed tasks (not work per se, not employment per se because these concepts may cease to exist in the post capitalist economic model). Despite the claims to the contrary it is different this time.  We are not talking about horses, trains, assembly lines, etc ... We are talking about intelligent robots with advanced technology that learn quickly without limit in the end.  Robots are general purpose and will do any job better and faster as time marches on.  Most human work can be automated with certainty given enough time.  As new jobs are created they will be automated in short order as the training process only happens once for all robots.  Unlike humans which have to be individually trained in costly manner, training one robot is effectively training all robots for all of time.  Humans are inefficient in comparison, they die taking most if not all of their knowledge with them. The future role for money, taxes and traditional jobs may likely not exist as we know it today.  These concepts are predicated on an economic system that will no longer likely exist. The transition to a jobless economy where only a small number of robot designers are gainfully employed could be extremely problematic.  Rising wealth inequality might be inevitable unless we abandon our 19th century economic concepts and move into the 22nd century economy. This article from the Economist last year provides a worthwhile overview to the matter.  This is becoming a mainstream of new economic thought.   Everyone owes it to themselves and their families to personally know what the future may likely hold.  The technology and automation trend spans the globe, no one can escape it in the end especially future generations.  The onrushing wave  \"Previous technological innovation has always delivered more long-run employment, not less. But things can change.\" IN 1930, when the world was \u201csuffering\u2026from a bad attack of economic pessimism\u201d, John Maynard Keynes wrote a broadly optimistic essay, \u201cEconomic Possibilities for our Grandchildren\u201d. It imagined a middle way between revolution and stagnation that would leave the said grandchildren a great deal richer than their grandparents. But the path was not without dangers. One of the worries Keynes admitted was a \u201cnew disease\u201d: \u201ctechnological unemployment\u2026due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.\u201d His readers might not have heard of the problem, he suggested\u2014but they were certain to hear a lot more about it in the years to come. For the most part, they did not. Nowadays, the majority of economists confidently wave such worries away. By raising productivity, they argue, any automation which economises on the use of labour will increase incomes. That will generate demand for new products and services, which will in turn create new jobs for displaced workers. To think otherwise has meant being tarred a Luddite\u2014the name taken by 19th-century textile workers who smashed the machines taking their jobs. For much of the 20th century, those arguing that technology brought ever more jobs and prosperity looked to have the better of the debate. Real incomes in Britain scarcely doubled between the beginning of the common era and 1570. They then tripled from 1570 to 1875. And they more than tripled from 1875 to 1975. Industrialisation did not end up eliminating the need for human workers. On the contrary, it created employment opportunities sufficient to soak up the 20th century\u2019s exploding population. Keynes\u2019s vision of everyone in the 2030s being a lot richer is largely achieved. His belief they would work just 15 hours or so a week has not come to pass. When the sleeper wakesYet some now fear that a new era of automation enabled by ever more powerful and capable computers could work out differently. They start from the observation that, across the rich world, all is far from well in the world of work. The essence of what they see as a work crisis is that in rich countries the wages of the typical worker, adjusted for cost of living, are stagnant. In America the real wage has hardly budged over the past four decades. Even in places like Britain and Germany, where employment is touching new highs, wages have been flat for a decade. Recent research suggests that this is because substituting capital for labour through automation is increasingly attractive; as a result owners of capital have captured ever more of the world\u2019s income since the 1980s, while the share going to labour has fallen. At the same time, even in relatively egalitarian places like Sweden, inequality among the employed has risen sharply, with the share going to the highest earners soaring. For those not in the elite, argues David Graeber, an anthropologist at the London School of Economics, much of modern labour consists of stultifying \u201cbullshit jobs\u201d\u2014low- and mid-level screen-sitting that serves simply to occupy workers for whom the economy no longer has much use. Keeping them employed, Mr Graeber argues, is not an economic choice; it is something the ruling class does to keep control over the lives of others. Be that as it may, drudgery may soon enough give way to frank unemployment. There is already a long-term trend towards lower levels of employment in some rich countries. The proportion of American adults participating in the labour force recently hit its lowest level since 1978, and although some of that is due to the effects of ageing, some is not. In a recent speech that was modelled in part on Keynes\u2019s \u201cPossibilities\u201d, Larry Summers, a former American treasury secretary, looked at employment trends among American men between 25 and 54. In the 1960s only one in 20 of those men was not working. According to Mr Summers\u2019s extrapolations, in ten years the number could be one in seven. This is one indication, Mr Summers says, that technical change is increasingly taking the form of \u201ccapital that effectively substitutes for labour\u201d. There may be a lot more for such capital to do in the near future. A 2013 paper by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, of the University of Oxford, argued that jobs are at high risk of being automated in 47% of the occupational categories into which work is customarily sorted. That includes accountancy, legal work, technical writing and a lot of other white-collar occupations. Answering the question of whether such automation could lead to prolonged pain for workers means taking a close look at past experience, theory and technological trends. The picture suggested by this evidence is a complex one. It is also more worrying than many economists and politicians have been prepared to admit. The lathe of heavenEconomists take the relationship between innovation and higher living standards for granted in part because they believe history justifies such a view. Industrialisation clearly led to enormous rises in incomes and living standards over the long run. Yet the road to riches was rockier than is often appreciated. In 1500 an estimated 75% of the British labour force toiled in agriculture. By 1800 that figure had fallen to 35%. When the shift to manufacturing got under way during the 18th century it was overwhelmingly done at small scale, either within the home or in a small workshop; employment in a large factory was a rarity. By the end of the 19th century huge plants in massive industrial cities were the norm. The great shift was made possible by automation and steam engines. Industrial firms combined human labour with big, expensive capital equipment. To maximise the output of that costly machinery, factory owners reorganised the processes of production. Workers were given one or a few repetitive tasks, often making components of finished products rather than whole pieces. Bosses imposed a tight schedule and strict worker discipline to keep up the productive pace. The Industrial Revolution was not simply a matter of replacing muscle with steam; it was a matter of reshaping jobs themselves into the sort of precisely defined components that steam-driven machinery needed\u2014cogs in a factory system. The way old jobs were done changed; new jobs were created. Joel Mokyr, an economic historian at Northwestern University in Illinois, argues that the more intricate machines, techniques and supply chains of the period all required careful tending. The workers who provided that care were well rewarded. As research by Lawrence Katz, of Harvard University, and Robert Margo, of Boston University, shows, employment in manufacturing \u201chollowed out\u201d. As employment grew for highly skilled workers and unskilled workers, craft workers lost out. This was the loss to which the Luddites, understandably if not effectively, took exception.    With the low-skilled workers far more numerous, at least to begin with, the lot of the average worker during the early part of this great industrial and social upheaval was not a happy one. As Mr Mokyr notes, \u201clife did not improve all that much between 1750 and 1850.\u201d For 60 years, from 1770 to 1830, growth in British wages, adjusted for inflation, was imperceptible because productivity growth was restricted to a few industries. Not until the late 19th century, when the gains had spread across the whole economy, did wages at last perform in line with productivity (see chart 1). Along with social reforms and new political movements that gave voice to the workers, this faster wage growth helped spread the benefits of industrialisation across wider segments of the population. New investments in education provided a supply of workers for the more skilled jobs that were by then being created in ever greater numbers. This shift continued into the 20th century as post-secondary education became increasingly common. Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard University, and Mr Katz have written that workers were in a \u201crace between education and technology\u201d during this period, and for the most part they won. Even so, it was not until the \u201cgolden age\u201d after the second world war that workers in the rich world secured real prosperity, and a large, property-owning middle class came to dominate politics. At the same time communism, a legacy of industrialisation\u2019s harsh early era, kept hundreds of millions of people around the world in poverty, and the effects of the imperialism driven by European industrialisation continued to be felt by billions. The impacts of technological change take their time appearing. They also vary hugely from industry to industry. Although in many simple economic models technology pairs neatly with capital and labour to produce output, in practice technological changes do not affect all workers the same way. Some find that their skills are complementary to new technologies. Others find themselves out of work. Take computers. In the early 20th century a \u201ccomputer\u201d was a worker, or a room of workers, doing mathematical calculations by hand, often with the end point of one person\u2019s work the starting point for the next. The development of mechanical and electronic computing rendered these arrangements obsolete. But in time it greatly increased the productivity of those who used the new computers in their work. Many other technical innovations had similar effects. New machinery displaced handicraft producers across numerous industries, from textiles to metalworking. At the same time it enabled vastly more output per person than craft producers could ever manage. Player pianoFor a task to be replaced by a machine, it helps a great deal if, like the work of human computers, it is already highly routine. Hence the demise of production-line jobs and some sorts of book-keeping, lost to the robot and the spreadsheet. Meanwhile work less easily broken down into a series of stereotyped tasks\u2014whether rewarding, as the management of other workers and the teaching of toddlers can be, or more of a grind, like tidying and cleaning messy work places\u2014has grown as a share of total employment. But the \u201crace\u201d aspect of technological change means that such workers cannot rest on their pay packets. Firms are constantly experimenting with new technologies and production processes. Experimentation with different techniques and business models requires flexibility, which is one critical advantage of a human worker. Yet over time, as best practices are worked out and then codified, it becomes easier to break production down into routine components, then automate those components as technology allows. If, that is, automation makes sense. As David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), points out in a 2013 paper, the mere fact that a job can be automated does not mean that it will be; relative costs also matter. When Nissan produces cars in Japan, he notes, it relies heavily on robots. At plants in India, by contrast, the firm relies more heavily on cheap local labour. Even when machine capabilities are rapidly improving, it can make sense instead to seek out ever cheaper supplies of increasingly skilled labour. Thus since the 1980s (a time when, in America, the trend towards post-secondary education levelled off) workers there and elsewhere have found themselves facing increased competition from both machines and cheap emerging-market workers.    Such processes have steadily and relentlessly squeezed labour out of the manufacturing sector in most rich economies. The share of American employment in manufacturing has declined sharply since the 1950s, from almost 30% to less than 10%. At the same time, jobs in services soared, from less than 50% of employment to almost 70% (see chart 2). It was inevitable, therefore, that firms would start to apply the same experimentation and reorganisation to service industries. A new wave of technological progress may dramatically accelerate this automation of brain-work. Evidence is mounting that rapid technological progress, which accounted for the long era of rapid productivity growth from the 19th century to the 1970s, is back. The sort of advances that allow people to put in their pocket a computer that is not only more powerful than any in the world 20 years ago, but also has far better software and far greater access to useful data, as well as to other people and machines, have implications for all sorts of work. The case for a highly disruptive period of economic growth is made by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, professors at MIT, in \u201cThe Second Machine Age\u201d, a book to be published later this month. Like the first great era of industrialisation, they argue, it should deliver enormous benefits\u2014but not without a period of disorienting and uncomfortable change. Their argument rests on an underappreciated aspect of the exponential growth in chip processing speed, memory capacity and other computer metrics: that the amount of progress computers will make in the next few years is always equal to the progress they have made since the very beginning. Mr Brynjolfsson and Mr McAfee reckon that the main bottleneck on innovation is the time it takes society to sort through the many combinations and permutations of new technologies and business models. A startling progression of inventions seems to bear their thesis out. Ten years ago technologically minded economists pointed to driving cars in traffic as the sort of human accomplishment that computers were highly unlikely to master. Now Google cars are rolling round California driver-free no one doubts such mastery is possible, though the speed at which fully self-driving cars will come to market remains hard to guess. Brave new worldEven after computers beat grandmasters at chess (once thought highly unlikely), nobody thought they could take on people at free-form games played in natural language. Then Watson, a pattern-recognising supercomputer developed by IBM, bested the best human competitors in America\u2019s popular and syntactically tricksy general-knowledge quiz show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d Versions of Watson are being marketed to firms across a range of industries to help with all sorts of pattern-recognition problems. Its acumen will grow, and its costs fall, as firms learn to harness its abilities. The machines are not just cleverer, they also have access to far more data. The combination of big data and smart machines will take over some occupations wholesale; in others it will allow firms to do more with fewer workers. Text-mining programs will displace professional jobs in legal services. Biopsies will be analysed more efficiently by image-processing software than lab technicians. Accountants may follow travel agents and tellers into the unemployment line as tax software improves. Machines are already turning basic sports results and financial data into good-enough news stories. Jobs that are not easily automated may still be transformed. New data-processing technology could break \u201ccognitive\u201d jobs down into smaller and smaller tasks. As well as opening the way to eventual automation this could reduce the satisfaction from such work, just as the satisfaction of making things was reduced by deskilling and interchangeable parts in the 19th century. If such jobs persist, they may engage Mr Graeber\u2019s \u201cbullshit\u201d detector. Being newly able to do brain work will not stop computers from doing ever more formerly manual labour; it will make them better at it. The designers of the latest generation of industrial robots talk about their creations as helping workers rather than replacing them; but there is little doubt that the technology will be able to do a bit of both\u2014probably more than a bit. A taxi driver will be a rarity in many places by the 2030s or 2040s. That sounds like bad news for journalists who rely on that most reliable source of local knowledge and prejudice\u2014but will there be many journalists left to care? Will there be airline pilots? Or traffic cops? Or soldiers?    There will still be jobs. Even Mr Frey and Mr Osborne, whose research speaks of 47% of job categories being open to automation within two decades, accept that some jobs\u2014especially those currently associated with high levels of education and high wages\u2014will survive (see table). Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University and a much-read blogger, writes in his most recent book, \u201cAverage is Over\u201d, that rich economies seem to be bifurcating into a small group of workers with skills highly complementary with machine intelligence, for whom he has high hopes, and the rest, for whom not so much. And although Mr Brynjolfsson and Mr McAfee rightly point out that developing the business models which make the best use of new technologies will involve trial and error and human flexibility, it is also the case that the second machine age will make such trial and error easier. It will be shockingly easy to launch a startup, bring a new product to market and sell to billions of global consumers (see article). Those who create or invest in blockbuster ideas may earn unprecedented returns as a result. In a forthcoming book Thomas Piketty, an economist at the Paris School of Economics, argues along similar lines that America may be pioneering a hyper-unequal economic model in which a top 1% of capital-owners and \u201csupermanagers\u201d grab a growing share of national income and accumulate an increasing concentration of national wealth. The rise of the middle-class\u2014a 20th-century innovation\u2014was a hugely important political and social development across the world. The squeezing out of that class could generate a more antagonistic, unstable and potentially dangerous politics.The potential for dramatic change is clear. A future of widespread technological unemployment is harder for many to accept. Every great period of innovation has produced its share of labour-market doomsayers, but technological progress has never previously failed to generate new employment opportunities.   The productivity gains from future automation will be real, even if they mostly accrue to the owners of the machines. Some will be spent on goods and services\u2014golf instructors, household help and so on\u2014and most of the rest invested in firms that are seeking to expand and presumably hire more labour. Though inequality could soar in such a world, unemployment would not necessarily spike. The current doldrum in wages may, like that of the early industrial era, be a temporary matter, with the good times about to roll (see chart 3). These jobs may look distinctly different from those they replace. Just as past mechanisation freed, or forced, workers into jobs requiring more cognitive dexterity, leaps in machine intelligence could create space for people to specialise in more emotive occupations, as yet unsuited to machines: a world of artists and therapists, love counsellors and yoga instructors. Such emotional and relational work could be as critical to the future as metal-bashing was in the past, even if it gets little respect at first. Cultural norms change slowly. Manufacturing jobs are still often treated as \u201cbetter\u201d\u2014in some vague, non-pecuniary way\u2014than paper-pushing is. To some 18th-century observers, working in the fields was inherently more noble than making gewgaws. But though growth in areas of the economy that are not easily automated provides jobs, it does not necessarily help real wages. Mr Summers points out that prices of things-made-of-widgets have fallen remarkably in past decades; America\u2019s Bureau of Labour Statistics reckons that today you could get the equivalent of an early 1980s television for a twentieth of its then price, were it not that no televisions that poor are still made. However, prices of things not made of widgets, most notably college education and health care, have shot up. If people lived on widgets alone\u2014 goods whose costs have fallen because of both globalisation and technology\u2014there would have been no pause in the increase of real wages. It is the increase in the prices of stuff that isn\u2019t mechanised (whose supply is often under the control of the state and perhaps subject to fundamental scarcity) that means a pay packet goes no further than it used to. So technological progress squeezes some incomes in the short term before making everyone richer in the long term, and can drive up the costs of some things even more than it eventually increases earnings. As innovation continues, automation may bring down costs in some of those stubborn areas as well, though those dominated by scarcity\u2014such as houses in desirable places\u2014are likely to resist the trend, as may those where the state keeps market forces at bay. But if innovation does make health care or higher education cheaper, it will probably be at the cost of more jobs, and give rise to yet more concentration of income.   The machine stopsEven if the long-term outlook is rosy, with the potential for greater wealth and lots of new jobs, it does not mean that policymakers should simply sit on their hands in the mean time. Adaptation to past waves of progress rested on political and policy responses. The most obvious are the massive improvements in educational attainment brought on first by the institution of universal secondary education and then by the rise of university attendance. Policies aimed at similar gains would now seem to be in order. But as Mr Cowen has pointed out, the gains of the 19th and 20th centuries will be hard to duplicate. Boosting the skills and earning power of the children of 19th-century farmers and labourers took little more than offering schools where they could learn to read, write and do algebra. Pushing a large proportion of college graduates to complete graduate work successfully will be harder and more expensive. Perhaps cheap and innovative online education will indeed make new attainment possible. But as Mr Cowen notes, such programmes may tend to deliver big gains only for the most conscientious students. Another way in which previous adaptation is not necessarily a good guide to future employment is the existence of welfare. The alternative to joining the 19th-century industrial proletariat was malnourished deprivation. Today, because of measures introduced in response to, and to some extent on the proceeds of, industrialisation, people in the developed world are provided with unemployment benefits, disability allowances and other forms of welfare. They are also much more likely than a bygone peasant to have savings. This means that the \u201creservation wage\u201d\u2014the wage below which a worker will not accept a job\u2014is now high in historical terms. If governments refuse to allow jobless workers to fall too far below the average standard of living, then this reservation wage will rise steadily, and ever more workers may find work unattractive. And the higher it rises, the greater the incentive to invest in capital that replaces labour. Everyone should be able to benefit from productivity gains\u2014in that, Keynes was united with his successors. His worry about technological unemployment was mainly a worry about a \u201ctemporary phase of maladjustment\u201d as society and the economy adjusted to ever greater levels of productivity. So it could well prove. However, society may find itself sorely tested if, as seems possible, growth and innovation deliver handsome gains to the skilled, while the rest cling to dwindling employment opportunities at stagnant wages.

The list would be far too long to type here but, just as examples, 100 years ago, tunnels were dug by hand with the aid of dangerous explosives whilst, nowadays, they are drilled to an accuracy of millimetres by giant boring machines that can go through some rocks at what would, 100 years ago have been phenomenal speeds. No longer do people have to take a bucket to the well for fresh water - a pump delivers it right to their house. Horses and carts have been replaced by motor vehicles that are, themselves, assembled by machines. Microwaves have replaced wood stoves. Computers have replaced abacuses and ledgers. Autopilots have replaced pilots on airliners. Many cities now have driverless commuter trains and ever more sophisticated combine harvesters long ago replaced the scythe and threshing floor! Need I go on? I think not. However, a much more pertinent question might be, \"As machines replace humans, what will humans do to occupy their time?\" and one answer to that is that machines and technology provide leisure activities hitherto unknown ranging from simply watching 3D TVs with surround sound (soon to be replaced by holographic \"artificial environments\") to jet boating or paragliding, etc. What the world still hasn't realised is that machines and technology should be reducing people's working hours dramatically. The 40-hour-week should be a faint historical memory in the 21st century as machines give people more and more leisure time. The increased productivity of machine-driven automation should make it possible for people to earn a comfortable living wage in just a few hours with vastly more jobs becoming available in leisure industries but incompetent politicians all over the world simply aren't keeping up. It seems that this won't change in the immediate future either where policies will always lag well behind technological advancement. For what it's worth, I think the dates on Cloyd Waldo's illustrated list (above) are way too late. Most of those things he lists will happen before 2020. ",

            "answer_text": "Machines will definitely replace many low skilled jobs but also create new jobs for IT and electronics engineering. The real question is, how many jobs will be created and how many will be replaced. We are living in a world where profit drives everything, and robots prove to be much cheaper than labour per unit quantity of production, considering all the costs right from purchase to scrap and also the human resource required for operation and maintenance. Now if you think carefully then you will notice that robots are cheaper than labour despite of cost of all human resource required to create them and repair them. Why? Because robots steal more jobs than they create. For example, it took only 1 software engineer, Satoshi Nakamoto, to create Bitcoins. But if all the paper currency is banned and Bitcoins are legalized then thousands of tellers are going to loose jobs. What is the future of machines? AI is defeating human beings in various fields like data audit. Now it can defeat world's best chess players. And much worse than that, it is improving at exponential rate. Once we needed intelligent coders to create programs but coding is becoming simpler day by day. Now we have self learning programs. There will be a time when we will have robots to create or repair other robots. The only job that will be remaining in human hands will be related to research and asthetics designing. But research and innovation is coming to stagnation. Once upon a time, research was possible in backyard. Today, you need very expensive research laboratories which only big companies can afford. In future, research may even turn into a non profit activity. If you have any idea, most of the time you find it already patented. That's why the last job will be imagining a fully automated world. And the only people who can survive will be those who own the means of production. What will create jobs if machines are replacing them? In the past 3 industrial revolutions, new products and services were creating new jobs. For example, tractors replaced many jobs in agriculture than they created new jobs for engineers and workers. But other products like radio and television contributed to job creation. And this time the fourth industrial revolution will create new jobs for organ manufacturing. So robots won't be a problem for 20\u201330 years. Other than new products and services competition also creates jobs. More the number of industries, more jobs are created. So instead of jobs being replaced, work load will be reduced and working hours as well. But if competition is reduced then machines are going to be a potential threat. Government can also rescue jobs by reducing working hours are retirement age. Please let me know your views in the comments section. ",

            "answer_text": "No:- And I think, I am the only one who thinks so. Machine are anything that lessens manual function while increasing efficiency and decreasing error rate; made to help humans. As Eivind Kj\u00f8rstad mentioned, \"Dishwasher\" and \"Calculator\" used to be job-titles. Do you think ,any human being deserve to spend rest of his life doing  addition (+), subtraction (-), division (/)  or multiplications (*). I don't think so. Imagine, now that person could be a Mathematics teacher educating generation over generation.We humans are made not sleep, eat and repeat. We are here as most amazing creatures who can do much better with our lives instead of being a calculator.  When machine eliminates a work, it gives human thousand more options and open doors that they didn't even know existed. Tell me something; would you rather do dishes and walk up to find your better half far asleep or let dishwasher do it, while you cuddle with your partner in the bed after a romantic dinner. It even gives you an opportunity to do much more than cuddling. Don't you like that?   I work for an event software firm. It is said, according to a survey, event planner is among top 5 most stressful jobs in the world. We reduce stress and spread joy with our products,  from guiding one through a road map till rating the speaker while one goes back home from the event. Imagine a person doing all of this instead of a machine. Now that person can bring more creativity and innovation into the world . I believe, when manual work is replaced by technology; it gives opportunity to do better with human lives and this world. Let me explain this better with an example. Disclaimer:- The example is derived from actual occurrence which are twisted to sculpt a story for better understanding. Two men use to sell beverages and snacks.    They were replaced by vending machine respectively.   One man spend rest of his life cribbing that technology took away his job.  While the other man went upto vending machine's owner and suggested what better could be done with it.  This man brought most amazing vending machines in the world. He realized,  station's nearby area had no dustbins. People threw plastic bottles causing bad environment and land pollution. He also knew the station is surrounded with many street dogs who were dying of hunger. He decide to come up with a vending machine that feed dog in exchange of plastic bottles which can further used for recycle.  Other, out of the world idea. Human sell token for travelling through metros and rapid train. Replaced by machine. That human  can now put to engineer circumstance to something like this:-  or even better than this.

Allah (SWA) in the Holy Quran says: Indeed Allah has created the human in the best of forms. (Surah Teen v.4) The verse glorifies human as creation, thats superior to any other specie ever created. Just for a minute imagine the fact that all these devastating tech are indeed wonders of human minds. To justify the statement that \u201cmachines won't ever replace humans\u201d understand the distinction that a machines can only be programed to achieve a particular task designated but, human mind is capable of achieving various functions. I would agree to the fact that AI has threatened human capabilities, emerging services like Amazon Go & Diverless car's are a threat to basic job positions such as Cashier's & Driver's. But we can't say that machines would replace human. Because at the end it, itself is a human breakthrough. Which requires \u201cHUMAN ATTENTION\u201d. Just think about the greatest invention ever- Airplane.  Source: Google Image To fly this masterpiece we require capable humans, human intellect is irreplaceable & unimaginable. Even though machines operate at there fullest error-free potential we require great human minds to operate & function it. In contrary as humans are relying more on technology. A simple today's reality is most people can't even write a paragraph without relying on auto-correct. It doesn't means we're getting replaced, its just a indication that we're so involved in it that we can't even flawlessly function without it. Hope this answers\u2026 Shahzaib\u2026 ",

Yes.Will humans find ways to enhance their job capabilities with machines they then hook up to their bodies to help them compete?That's where I hope we're headed, and I think history supports this sort of innovation. The steam shovel didn't completely end the need for a man with a trowel, but it freed labor that was done only with a shovel, pick and wheel barrow to be done largely by earth moving machines.  The interim fix was to have drivers, even though remote control, and even processed control systems have been available for decades. The design of buildings, websites, and even many of the tools can be guided by a person and built by machines.  Short hand is used to communicate the concepts between developers, including design patterns, modules and models, but eventually the short hand will be the programming language, and finally that job will be replaced by a statement of intent, or a realization of a need. But I don't think this means we'll be replaced by artificial intelligence.  I think this means that we'll start making the enhancements closer to the wet ware.  We just inserted the first grown pancreas in an Australian child, but far more promising for adults, we're making an organ that can aid in assisting overwhelmed pancreatic function fit in a small artificial organ replacing an under arm lymph node.  Once we get the necessity out of the way, the customization of organs for commercial and personal enhancement will follow.  Plastic surgery will not sit on the sidelines if there is money to be made in the implantation of useful organs or equipment that can be seen by some as more beautiful or perfect. Rather than buy the steam shovel for the operator to drive, put a motor cortex implant hooked directly to the cerebellum into a human, and let them manage and control a fleet of drones remotely.   As necessities become rarer, enhancements will probably become more popular.  Long before true artificial intelligence appears, I believe we will enhance the typical human beyond the normal confines of what humanity has defined as our current limitations.  It's the un-augmented human that will be replaced. ",

Naturally, that makes them more efficient than machines as the vice versa is not possible. Human beings take decisions based on memories of events which have occurred in the past, in other words they make decision on the basis of the experiences they have had. Machines are incapable of this quality which makes human beings unique and at the same time superior to them. Other things is adaptability n response to sudden unknown outcome which humans with the use ot their intelligence n wisdom can do but machine will do for what it is prepared for and that is too by us..and number of sudden unknown outcomes nobody can predict.. For that human mind is required. There is small video of Tennis Game between Man vs Machine.  ",

Universal Basic Income not minimum wage will be the future as well as your needing to retrain in the tech - AI - automation - programming sector. What is being manufactured and what can be manufactured and what can be manufactured for the masses at affordable prices has changed significantly. But it should be noted that while what is being manufactured has increased, the workers in manufacturing have decreased. This trend will continue. Be very afraid. Prepare for the future by becoming an automation expert in your field or a computer programmer. The only workers left in the manufacturing plant will be the AI - automation - programmer experts. If you are not a tech-automation field worker, as your job will be automated, you will need Universal Basic Income. UBI is the best poverty prevention welfare benefit structure, as it can also encourage the unemployed who want more income to use the UBI to go back to school and gain new skills and become re-employed in the tech-automation sector. The current welfare structure does not economically encourage recipients to work, as their working income that require working may not be any larger than their current welfare benefit. Even auto manufacturing in China is being automated. At least in China mechanization is still considered a way to increase wages, in the U.S. mechanization is the loss of the manufacturing sector the the rise of mich higher investment in human capital to work in the tech sector.  <A Robot Revolution, This Time in China> Humans do not win the race against the machine, humans need to be reinvented just as we invent machines.

And this won't happen at some future date, instead it started a long time ago. \"Dishwasher\" and \"Calculator\" used to be job-titles. Today they're names for machines. The vast majority of written messages sent from one human being to another used to be delivered by a human being who would stick pieces of paper into boxes known as \"postboxes\", today if you say \"your inbox\" people grab for their mobile phone to see if there's any new email. The list of tasks that uses to be done by human beings but which today are either partially or entirely automated is near-endless, and it'll keep growing. There won't be any magical date when suddenly everyone is replaced. That's not how it works. Instead we'll get gradually better and better technology and thus be able to do more and more tasks with less and less manual labour needed. Examples of pretty common jobs today that I believe will quite likely be reduced by atleast 90% over the next 25 years where I live (Norway) include:  Driving of road-vehicles such as cars, buses, taxis and lorriesPlanes and boats don't need a human driverCashiers in consumer-shops for everything from groceries to furniture.Cutting and trimming of lawnsRemoval of snow from roadsIn many more cases a few humans will remain, but what used to take 50 humans instead take 5 humans assisted by machines. This is also not a new thing. 5 human beings with modern mechanical digging-equipment vastly outperforms 50 human beings trying to make a ditch with shovels. ",

            "answer_text": "Popular Media does a great job at frightening people. Chances are, you are already fearful of Intelligent Machines and AI taking over your jobs. But in reality, they might replace human labor deployed at mundane and repetitive tasks only. I am not denying the prospects of how great and fundamentally disruptive the Industrial Revolution 4.0 might be and where it might take us. I am only saying Robots and AI aren\u2019t inherently Anti-Human. I am not going to give you reasons about why you shouldn\u2019t be afraid of Robots. You are going to find that out yourself in the coming days. But if you are indeed afraid of robots and want to start seeing the good sides of their existence, a good start is to analyze in which cases can the AI and Intelligent Machines be deployed. Amplification A great example of how Robots can amplify simple and limited Human capabilities is via the adoption of AR technology. AR Headsets are great at displaying information and instructions as an overlay.  In the future we might see Warehouse workers equipped with AR Headsets. Managers can display information about how much of a single product must be moved to the trucks and how many products in the warehouse needs to be replenished. Another great use case of AR, which is a blessing of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, can be in the Automobile Assembly Plants. The AR Headsets can overlay instructions on how to handle certain Car parts, how to put them together and so on. Interaction How can AI transform Customer Service. After working for almost 2 years in WordPress industry, I have come to the conclusion that developing an AI that can teach itself and auto-correct in real-time will take a lot of time. Many Websites created using the WordPress CMS, usually comes with a Chatbot, that replies to queries by the site-visitors. Usually they are very good and precise at answering regular queries, but whenever they are confronted with a new question, they might fail to answer properly. This is why most WordPress-centric firms have a strong Support Team. I am not saying AI can not teach itself how and what to reply, all I am saying is it might take several years and pure Data-Sets before we get a solid Support AI that can replace Customer Service completely. Embodiment This is probably the most interesting application of AI and Intelligent Machines. You might have already heard about Exo-Skeletons. Exo-Skeletons can give humans super-powers. In the future, you might see Advanced Military forces training their recruits to pilot special suits that can shoot them up in the air and travel between point A and point B at the speed of a Jet-Plane. Just like Iron-Man. But such an Advanced Suit will require both Super Smart Software and Impenetrable Hardware. So that Military Recruits do not fly into buildings or mountains.

            "answer_text": "Very loaded question. Similar to the early days of computing, people fear that robots will take over many of the jobs that humans perform. WIll that happen? I sure hope so. Many jobs that humans perform are boring, dangerous, and prone to error (human error). Robots can help solve many of these problems. At the same time, look at the way computers have revolutionized the way we perform business. Computers replaced a lot of humans performing mundane tasks (telephone operators, for example) but at the same time they created entire fields that never existed before: networking, software development, automation, computer science, artificial intelligence, IT, online education, etc. etc. etc....The list just goes on. Since robotics is primarily a subset of computing, I doubt that the overall effect will be as extreme, but many experts believe that as robots replace humans performing jobs in manufacturing and similar fields, new jobs will begin to pop up that feature more human-centric needs: robot operators, technicians, programmers. What we are seeing now in terms of the state of the art of robotics are machines designed to replace people either where we don't have enough people (healthcare, elder-care assistance) or where people don't need to be (warfare, mining, nuclear cleanup, search-and-rescue).

            "answer_text": "Will machine replace humans? It's half true & half false simply because one size doesn't fit all. It's true that most of the repetitive jobs will be replaced by machines but not all. For Example: It's difficult to automate SEO completely using\u200b automated tools, even if it is automated, it cannot produce the results that men can. So, there are certain things that men can do better than machines & vice versa. Men can think, act & take independent decisions in complicated situations that machines lack. On the other hand, machines can analyze the huge amount of data & produce the results at a faster rate that men cannot. There have been instances where a smartphone could do miracles that a great mathematician could not & the opposite is also true where a child could solve a problem that a supercomputer could not. So, machines should be treated as a complement than a substitute for men. They are just tools & not rivals but both (good men & good machines) are must to solve people's problems. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes In the 1970\u2019s, I founded iotron to put computers on ship bridges to do simple repetitive tasks to improve the results of the radar plotting tasks for collision avoidance watch standing and also to improve on an autopilot\u2019s frequently need for skilled adjusting of a WW II era, so called \u201cIron Mike\u201d PID conventional ship autopilots. Elmer Sperry, was the inventor of the PID which is considered THE classic example of Artificial Intelligence (AI) since it replaced a helmsma with fully automatic steering to maintain a set course when used with a ship\u2019s Sperry gyrocompass as an add-on. When ever the sea state changes or their is a course change, the 4 control parameter setup have to be readjusted or the steering control is not optimum and their is an increase in drag due to unnecessary rudder \u201cWiggle\u201d causing both an increase in both rudder and hull drag which can be up to 5 per cent theoretically. Iotron first developed DigiPLOT and then spent 5 years developing an optional mcadaptive autopilot using the same Mac 16 micro-sec multi-switching (solidll state-mini version of the Air Traffic Control (6000 vacuum tube mainframe) using both classical and modern control theory and developed over 5 years to achieve 3 per cent fuel saving. Dutch Esso for $25 k ordered the system for 4 VLCCs and 1 to 3 per cent fuel saved, then Texaco ordered 9 for VLCCs & other VLCCs totaling 17, plus 3 28 kt containerships that saved much more fuel dollars because of a more consistent 3 percent at TWICE the fuel rate. This was surely an AI Improvement over the PID, but we never mentioned it, since AI was over sold and had such a bad reputation, It is being overhyped now again even though DigiPLOT with its fuel saving option reducing the cost of safely maneuvering in heavy traffic like the English Channel and the S China a Sea. DigiPILOT, for ships whose operatonational fuel cost are 60 per cent of the total cost provides a 6 to 10 per cent profit increase, but also Digipilot offers a climate carbon footprint reduction Go to: automate.marine/space for my AF background and detailed descriptions of both DigiPLOT-AI and it\u2019s fuel saving autopilot add on AI equipments also to see Videos shown of DigiPLOT in action at sea displaying lReal Time precision Situation Awareness actually avoiding other vessels particularly the end on Sealand 25 kt shown head on with a tug and toe with the relative vector showing its Direction of Relative Motion accuracy to - 1 degree accuracy in 1 minute not 3 minutes eith only 12 deg accuracy of the IMO ARPA spec which is not sufficient accuracy to confirm the side of passing which is critical in 99 percent of all ship collisions. The spec does not even account for either ship turning or else the time starts over. AS shown on all videos, DigiPLOT is displaying all other ship True vectors that are only 15\u201345 sec behind the Real Time Aspect for easy comparison with visual lookouts observation and easy checked by VHF that their course agrees with the digital data read out of all ships vectors to gain faith on the ship that DigiPLOT does a highly accurate display on the closest 200 ditized echoes between own ship and the radar horizon or the nearest coastline shown on the display that are closest, then it automatically selects the closest 40 (if desired to favor a partilar area by placement of 2 manually adjusted plotting area limit lines) to create full accuracy true plots selectable as true or relative display, and all done in one radar scan of 2 or 3 seconds, not 3 minutes. DigiPLOT certainly qualifies as AI as impossible for humans and only possible using a fast computer equal or faster than a Mac 16, the only computer to have ever exceeded the IMO ARPA min std by exceeding its performance by independent Type Approval by a factor of 10 in accuracy in 1 minute! Four companies have tried to duplicate DigiPLOT but failed, there is only ONE that is fast enough to prevent ship collisions who all occur 5 to 15 minutes from first being aware that an echo could be a close passing till the collision occurs and the average is ONLY 9 minutes! In all other ARPAs if either turns during a plot the time is added to get results Navy destroyers can have 10 doing full maneuvering board solutions that take 6 or 9 minutes to get enough accuracy to solve end on side of passing with radar. This is definitely AI since it satisfies the definition of being on continuously 24/7 whenever the ship is moving at a Real Time accurate situational awareness which is physically impossible to be done by any human plotting team of any size to do a closet echo analysis on all surrounding for measurement or range, bearing , and range rate, to measure full course, speed, and CPA/TCPA of the closest selected 40everyb3 second radar antenna scan! Having more than 2 people agreeing to have lunch is nearly impossible, much less than the Navy ten sailors after working 102 hours as stated during in the recent recent collisions Jack Herther, President Automate Marine Systems, LLC Hertherjc@verizon.net ",

Most of them are routine tasks but more intelligent robots are continually being developed and assessed. In the future, robotics may take care of thought-oriented tasks as well as predictable ones. Popular Science offers a variety of possibilities. future of robots Currently lab research is being fueled by laboratory automation. Robotics take care of liquid handling and other simple jobs that once took up quite a bit of a researcher's time. These are the robotics my friend's husband works with. They have not replaced lab researchers but help them to achieve their work faster and with greater accuracy.  Robotics, Instruments & Equipment To sum it up, the likelihood of machines replacing people is remote. Rather, new jobs will be created over time and people will need updated training to remain relevant in the workforce as it continues to evolve. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by \"replace\". Robots controlled by AIs may well replace people for most economically productive activities. There are no apparent boundaries. Though many commentators wishfully cite \"creativity\", they are able to do so only by redefining creativity ever more narrowly over time. Some such as Ray Kurzweil believe that human minds are essentially patterns of information, and that as such they might eventually be downloaded into machines. Were that to prove feasible, then robots could fully replace \"humans\"--though in fact what would happen is that the word human would be redefined. I expect that a significant number of us will want to retain our \"meat bodies\" with uses of significant biologically based life extension technologies, and replacement of biological parts by mechanical ones only as necessary. However, that may be a bias carried forward from my 20th century upbringing. ",

In the coming years, robots will replace millions of people in practically every area of work, and it will become increasingly harder for people to find new jobs. The government will have no choice but to provide people with a basic income. However, that\u2019s only half the battle. Many, if not most, feel that a job defines a person. A bad job is better than no job because a job gives a person sense of self-worth. The need to engage in something meaningful is intrinsic to human beings, so finding a means to fulfill that need is critical. The only solution is in our connection. Positive, meaningful, relationships generate happiness and self-worth. Working together to build strong social-ties can redefine who we are and what we value. Connecting is the one activity that robots will never be able to do, and it\u2019s the means to true happiness\u2014where love and friendship are its foundations. When Robots Take Our Jobs ",

Going with this saying, if we trace back as what could have been the possible reason for humans to think that invention of automated machines was a necessity , it would definitely be for the welfare of the mankind. Similarly , once we(humans) start to feel that there are a lot of automated machines around us which are causing harm to our own existence, then there would be a revolution to move from a completely automated lifestyle to a normal one, probably with the saying \"Old is Gold\" or \"Vintage Lifestyle\".

All companies follow the same strategy, resulting in global unemployment leaving people unable to purchase the products and services offered by those companies, putting them out of business; essentially, a lose-lose situation. So, I don't believe machines will completely replace people unless the future turns into a Matrix where machines become conscious and replace humans by force. ",

And if machines do evolve beyond us, will it be as a completely separate life form leaving us destroyed or simply left behind to die out, or will we ourselves merge with or become the machines?  We can only hope that our \"kind\" are retained by merging or becoming so that there is a continuity, just as we evolved from our primate ancestors.   Our worst fear is that the machines take on their own alien culture and morality, or perhaps lack all emotion and moral or ethical standards, becoming simply cold hearted, inhuman machines and destroy us, leaving nothing of humanity, our culture, our dreams.
