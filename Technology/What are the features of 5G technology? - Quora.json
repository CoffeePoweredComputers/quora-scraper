            "answer_text": "5G mobile is being defined in 3GPP to offer support for an almost unlimited number of use cases that will fall in between the corner cases of: Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) targetting a consistent user experience along with a secondary target of higher peak bitratesUltra Reliable Low latency communications (URLLC) to provide extremely low delay transmission of specialised service such as misssion critical communicationsMassive Machine Type communications (mMTC) able to support enormous number of low bit rate Internet of Things devicesTo achieve these three very different limiting cases and adapt to everything in between, 5G needs a very flexible solution for the radio interface, the radio network, core and service platforms. This is pushing the 5G system design in a number of interesting directions: Radio interface will be LTE like using OFDM but will have more options to support flexiblity and scalability. For example, instead of a fixed subcarrier spacing the New Radio interface for 5G will allow for any power of 2 scaling from the LTE value of 15 kHz (i.e. 7.5, 15, 30, 60, 120 etc.)Networking solution will support both connection oriented (like LTE) and a new connectionless service mode that is better adapted to bursty and background trafficQuality of service controls will be more Internet based using packet marking instead of 1980s ISDN based circuit style controlsAccess network may support multiple parallel network user planes to offer short paths for low latency services and more centralised mobility anchors for longer life traffic flowsInterestingly the next generation core network will also allow LTE radio equipmemt to be upgraded to allow the networking approach to be supported. This means that both LTE and New Radio accesses will one day be part of thr 5G service offer. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201c5G\u201d actually refers to an industry standard, namely \u201cthe fifth generation mobile communication technology standard\u201d. How is the 5G standard born, and who makes it? 5G is developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (referred to as 3GPP), responsible for making. 3GPP is a standardized institution. Currently its members include relevant industry bodies in China, Europe, Japan, Korea and North America. So what are the benefits and characteristics of 5G? The benefits of 5G are reflected in its three application scenarios: enhanced mobile broadband, ultra-reliable low latency and massive machine-like communications. In other words, 5G can bring users higher bandwidth rates, lower and more reliable delays and larger capacity network connections. How fast can the 5G network speed be? 5G's enhanced mobile broadband application scenario means faster network speeds, it is reported that theoretically speaking, 5G network speed will be 100 times or more of 4G, and the peak of future 5G network can reach up to 20Gb per second. Of course, this also requires mobile phones, computers, storage devices, etc. to support such speeds, and it takes a certain amount of time to implement them. The three major application scenarios of 5G bring not only the improvement of the network speed, but also the application of wireless communication to more places, so that many technologies that have stayed in the theoretical stage or have just started because of the limited conditions have been widely used, such as smart city, smart home, drone, augmented reality, virtual reality, internet of things, etc. 5G will bring more convenience and fun to people's lives.[1] Footnotes[1] What is 5G?",
