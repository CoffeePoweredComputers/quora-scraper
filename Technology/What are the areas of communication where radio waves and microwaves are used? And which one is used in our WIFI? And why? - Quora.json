            "answer_text": "Anything wireless uses radio waves AM radio, TV, cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth, garage door openers, baby alarms\u2026 all of them They use different frequencies, and those have different properties: how they travel, how far they go and how good they are at bouncing off things (reflection)- or traveling through them, and how good they are at going around corners (diffraction ) AM radio is 100kHz, it goes a very long way, and goes everywhere: through walls, round corners, etc Cellular is about 1\u20132Ghz. It will go a number of miles and doors an ok job of going places and through walls WiFi is the same, but lower power, so it won't go as far Newer technologies are up at 60Ghz etc. They can carry a lot of data (big bandwidth) but only hoo in a straight line, can't bounce our bend, and don't go through things. So they are called \u201cline of sight\" Light is an EM wave too, but even higher frequency. ",

            "answer_text": "Microwaves are radio waves, they are a descriptive subset of them which applies, broadly speaking t o radio waves with a frequency above 1000 MHz. The ability or not to travel in straight lines is largely a function of the size of the wave versus the size of the obstacle. Lower frequencies have longer wavelengths, the relationship is 300/ F (Mhz = Wavelength in m. Thus a mountain will block an \u2018AM\u2019 frequency of 1 Mhz, (wavelength 300m) but a house won\u2019t. In addition, the high atmosphere contains a layer of ionised gas caused by solar radiation which can reflect and absorb low frequency waves, the absorption rate is different between night and day, hence AM radio can be heard at much greater distances at night ",
