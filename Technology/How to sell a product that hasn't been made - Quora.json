            "answer_text": "Your question initially refers to a \u201cproduct\u201d in such a way that implies (to me) that you\u2019re already an established company delivering products/services and you need to start selling something new to a customer base. That part is pretty simple. But the explanation of your question seems to get more into launching product line or suite or products (or even a company like Microsoft based primarily on a product line), which is very difficult. As a Product Manager who has taken pre-orders for products months or longer before delivery, I will respond to the prior interpretation of the question. If launching a single product, even before it\u2019s built or deliverable, you can worry less about selling yourself or marketing or websites or some of the other aspects discussed in other responses. Sure, salesmanship helps, but it\u2019s critical. This assumes you have at least some reasonable reputation of delivering on promises. Kevin Smith was the closest to what I would answer out of the current lot.  If you have truly found a market problem to solve, and have truly solved that problem (in the mind of the end user, not just yourself), then all you really need to do is be able to articulate that pain point to the customer and confidently show how you have removed/lessened it. You don\u2019t even have to articulate the actual pain point much \u2013 if it\u2019s really that painful the customer will be well aware \u2013 you just need to sell the fact that you \u201cget it\u201d and are capable of fixing it, then show how. In many cases, you really don\u2019t even have to \u201cshow\u201d how you fixed it \u2013 if you\u2019ve found the sweet spot where pain point meets price point, it will sell itself.  A long time ago, we had alarm clocks that you had to set every night or remember to turn off on days you didn\u2019t want it to wake you. If you\u2019ve ever been late to work because you forgot to set the alarm on, or if you keep waking up early on Saturdays because you forgot to turn off the alarm the night before, then when I pitch you an alarm clock that can be set to only wake you up on work days, you would automatically see the value. You would probably sign up for it before it was shippable. You may even do so before asking how much it costs, because it can\u2019t cost more than a missed day of work, right?   If you\u2019ve done your homework and have actually solved a problem, you likely won\u2019t have to try that hard to sell it. ",

            "answer_text": "When you present a product/service the first thing that you are selling is yourself, your technical abilities to have the job done, your accountability to reach what you promise, your desire to live to reach what you promise, to mantain promises and dedicate all the time you have to the project you are presenting.Generally investors prefer teams that offer more guarantees to dedicate full time to the project but, very very important, a team that works together, that has technical knowledge needed, that help each other.All these aspects are more important that forecast, planning and number that are based on hypothetical environment and situations.After this consider that a product that is not yet represented by something material should solve a problem, pain or be something useful for people before they understand the need of your product.

            "answer_text": "You should always sell it in some way before you build it. I say in some way, as selling can go from convincing people about the value you're adding to having a binding sale commitment. Now, you have to decide the optimized effort vs. time combination you need to convince your prospects. Do you need a :- 5min oral pitch?- 10 slides presentation?- 2-week work MVP? That's your call. My advice is to start with the former, test it, and then progress to the latter. I hope you'll find the validation you're seeking. ",

I use social media to get feed-back on what people want but also on how they react to my ideas. You have to be subtle on how you ask. People like to give their opinion. Many times you encounter hostility to your ideas so you have to find out how to deal with this. I use my contact with 'the people' to apply it to the design and also to gather an audience for the product. A business or major partner is reluctant to consider your idea unless you bring proof of its performance and feed-back from potential users. Some company bosses are very demanding and they want to see that you are already selling it, let alone making it. ",

The additional benefit of course is if you do make the product, you have a ready made list of interested customers. ",
