But I would like to concentration on one aspect only\u2026.IoT Just stick with this definition from Wikipedia. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables these things to connect and exchange data, resulting in efficiency improvements, economic benefits and reduced human intervention Your dad knocks the door, the camera installed in the door recognizes him and opens the door and allows him in while you are studying. A stranger knocks the door and notification comes to your mobile phone asking for permission if the door needs to be open. You get out of your bed in morning and the geyser gets on automatically. You can change the lighting of your room(both colour and intensity) by Philips Hue bulbs.https://www.philips.co.in/c-m-li/hue-personal-wireless-lighting The temperature rose above 25 and you are too lazy to go and switch it on. Viola!!! Its gets on automatically. Notification is sent to your phone as soon as the gas sensor detects sharp rise in conc. level of methyl isopropane(before even your nose can detect the smell) You can detect presence of living beings in your bedroom and switch on the ac.

There can be as few as two terms, or as many as a hundred, a thousand, or a million. Some products contain infinitely many terms. For products with relatively few terms, the numbers, or multiplicands, can be written one after another, separated by multiplication signs (x). An example is 1/1 x 1/2 x 1/3. This becomes awkward when the number of terms is large. When a product has infinitely many terms, the terms must occur in a definable sequence. This sequence is not always clear when the terms are simply listed and separated by multiplication symbols. For this reason, the product symbol was devised: a large, uppercase Greek letter pi. To denote 1/1 x 1/2 x 1/3, the following symbology can be used:  ",
