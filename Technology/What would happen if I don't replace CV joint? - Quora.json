            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re lucky enough to be barely moving, then just a cv joint, and some other small damage. But if you\u2019re moving anything faster than a crawl, you\u2019ll do some really serious damage to your suspension, steering, transmission, brakes, rims, tires, the chassis and frame, and quite possible even rip the entire lower control arm off the vehicle. As others have pointed out, the first sign of a failing cv joint is a clicking when turning. Now it\u2019s time to fix it at any cost before you have yourself a very large and useless vehicle in hand at the side of the road, and a very expensive towing charge. And if there\u2019s any damage to the road, you\u2019ll find yourself being fined by the municipality in the mail. Good luck trying to fight that one. I knew a man once that got pushed into the guardrail by salt trucks and ploughs many years ago. With children in the back, and the police listening to their stories of the out of control salters and ploughs, the family still found themselves with a rather large repair bill for the highway damage. Thank God laws have changed considerably since then and any public servant can now be charged and held accountable for their actions, even the corrupt police officers. ",

            "answer_text": "The CV joint should allow the drive shaft to flex and change length, but remain in line with the fixed end. When a CV joint fails it starts to move out of alignment with the fixed end. This makes the CV joint strike other parts of the car. This could be bodywork, suspension, steering, etc. I have seen floor and driver\u2019s foot damage caused by this. The movement increases the load on the fixed end of the shaft and can damage the transmission, transmission mounts, etc. The movement increases the load on the movable end of the shaft at the wheel. This can damage the wheel drive coupling. If the joint fails altogether then the shaft becomes free moving and can become two separate shafts. The free part can do spectacular damage at that point and spear through things, or jam between things. This is where it gets really exciting. You can lose control completely. A damaged CV joint is inexpensive and easy to repair. You would be crazy not to repair it ASAP. ",

            "answer_text": "The thing seizes up and literally explodes. Dramatic enough for you? If it has a catastrophic failure it's anyone's guess as to what events will follow. Get the thing fixed. These days shops don't mess with individual CV joints; they replace the half-shaft axle on they side of the vehicle. The half-shaft assembly will have two new CV joints ...the inner and outer joints ...and require the simple procedure of removing the old half-shaft on your car and replacing it with the new half-shaft.
