            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t think so, in fact, a lot of the coverage of the Pi 4 has been \u201cWho specifically is this meant for?\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s expensive\u201d, and \u201cit won\u2019t fit in the Pi 3 cases\u201d. However, as much as I accept those points, I have to commit what a lot of the Raspberry Pi community consider heresy and just say it. If you want an actual computer, that does tasks we\u2019d expect a computer to do, 1GB of RAM is SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. It\u2019s enough for maybe two or three tabs of light browsing with file management on top of the OS and the VRAM being shared with main RAM. Try watching YouTube and browsing Facebook at the same time on a Pi 3 and you\u2019ll find yourself wishing you had installed an on-off switch from all the hard-resetting you\u2019ll be doing. Besides, if you need a cheap computer for a robotics project, why not just buy a Pi Zero? They\u2019re literally under fifteen dollars shipped, and 512MB of RAM is plenty sufficient for most hobby robot programming. Also, for Retropie, it runs like garbage if you run anything 3D on itthe Pi 3B+ like, unplayably garbage. When the Retropie team makes a Retropie for the 4 that takes advantage of the much less restrictive RAM and puts the software-configurable VRAM to its best advantage, it will not only run N64 and PS1 games very well, but it might even be powerful enough for original Xbox, GameCube and PS2, which were stellar consoles and are nostalgic for a lot of people. Also, IIRC, the regular Raspberry Pi 3B+ wasn\u2019t capable of displaying a 4K signal, so you need an older sub-2K monitor for the image to not look like hot garbage. The Pi 4 can do 2 monitors at 4K, which even my main gaming computer can\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "For all those who don't know about the Raspberry Pi, I recommend you should take a quick read on it! You might not want to control and log the data of your sensors in your factory, but nevertheless, a mass-manufactured affordable and relatively powerful piece of engineering, which sheds some light on how fast the world is moving with Electronics, is literally worth a read!!! Raspberry Pi - Wikipedia ** According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, more than 5 million Raspberry Pis were sold by February 2015, making it the best-selling British computer. ** Now coming back to the question, the Raspberry Pi 4 is another remarkable piece of engineering from the SBC features and affordability perspective. Let's see what we've got in store here : 1 . The first step up we see on the Pi 4 is from a SBC aimed at education in computer science, the Pi has evolved into a powerful, silent, low-power desktop experience. The Pi 4 supports dual display 2 x 4k displays on Micro HDMI. 2. The earlier versions of the Pi had a USB Stack of USB 2.0s. The Pi 4 on the other hand, has two USB 2.0s and two USB 3.0s. Enabled with Type-C power supply compared to the previous USB type-B supplies, the USB 3.0 on the Pi 4 can now give out 5V, and upto 3A of current. That's a great feat considering the never-ending development of USB powered devices including cameras and optics. 3. The Pi offers variants of RAM[ you say DDR4? WOW! ] in ranges of 1 Gb, 2 Gb and 4 Gb. This is something developers and researchers would be looking out for, specially if you trying your hands on some image processing or real-time object tracking. I remember how the old Pis would show a significant lag and almost max out CPU usage after a short usage in real-time processing. The additional OpenGL 3.0 graphics is what? Seriously?! Everything on a single board. 4. With wireless and IoT riding the red dragon, you also have 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz IEEE 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 5.0, BLE on the Pi 4. Well, now you might stop scouting for the much awaited BT 5.0 enabled board and kick-start your dev right away! 5. Apart from the above hot features on the Pi (not really Hot, Raspberry Pi claims the powerful BCM2711 enabled board can keep it's cool) there are some more candies in the bag, like CSI and DSI ports for camera and display interface respectively. All in all, working with over a dozen boards in the past few years.. I'd say the Pi 4 is not all that overhyped. Considering a price band ranging from 35$ - 60$ (find it here - Raspberry Pi 4 Model B specifications \u2013 Raspberry Pi ) the Pi is indeed a sweet piece of hardware to have, considering it fits your requirements. Having the liberty to interface a dozen peripherals, run your choice of Linux OS and get a step ahead in development or simply learning.. the Pi 4 is worth it! P.S. I do not endorse Raspberry Pi or any of it's beneficiaries. This is just an honest review of the recently launched SBC, Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. Thanks for taking your time out and soaking a bit of knowledge :) ",
