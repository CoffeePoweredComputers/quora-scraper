            "answer_text": "I assume you mean personal drones like the DJI Phantom or 3DR Iris+.It's not exactly one technology drones are based on but more several different technology that have improved and gotten cheap and power efficient enough for consumer to use them. Military has been using them fo a long time and in a way this is another case of technology developed for military purpose that migrates to commercial and consumer markets. Anyway the different technologies that enable drones are: DC brushless motors- the motors that fly the drone using an attached propellersESC's (Electronic speed controllers) -  Enable a processor to control the motors.Flight controllers - both processors and different sensors have become cheaper, more powerful and power efficient due to being use in the cell-phone market. Flight controllers uses most technology you know from your smart devices to be used as the drone brain.Leading flight controllers are: 3DR Pixhawk - 3DRobotics IncNAZA-M V2 - Compact Designed Multirotor Autopilot System | DJISensors - Accelerometers, Gyros, Magnetometers, barometers and pretty much any sensor you can think of is used with dronesGPS - Enable drones to fly autonomously to GPS way-points.Lipo batteries - still the weak spots with drones but still a crucial part in each drone. Future technology - 2 technologies are expected to expand drones capabilities in the near future.LiDar - Laser range finder. see: LIDAR-Lite - 3DRobotics Inc & Using LIDAR-Lite to sweep an arc for sense-and-avoid Computer vision - will enable drones to see and better understand the environment, check out:Percepto - computer vision for drones ",

            "answer_text": "  Most likely the drones used for Amazon Air service will be octocopters. They will pick up the delivery payload and address from a belt and deliver it to the target location. The drones will also have extensive use of RFID tags which will help them know that they have dropped the package successfully and then they can they can pick up a new order. The drones will sport a micro controller board that controls the copter and other sensory input from gyroscopes, accelerometers and RFID tags. It will obviously have GPS integration and wireless internet for maintenance or updates.  It is very likely that the drone could have laser based sensors for image processing and obstacle avoidance. It will require a stereoscopic vision system for proper autonomous aviation. ",
