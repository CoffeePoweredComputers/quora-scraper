            "answer_text": "Lets breakdown your question into 2 parts; Support for Apple iPhone XR: Since this device was launched in Sept 2018 you can expect iOS support for iPhone XR for another 3\u20134 years minimum. This is based on historical deductions and at the end of the day the decision will remain with Apple and how they perceive the market in the next few years. However, since the iPhone XR is still available officially on the Apple website you can be assured that Apple will continue support for 2 years, at least. The iPhone XR is a fantastic device but, its not top of the line. In case you are driven by a budget do consider stretching your budget and buying the iPhone 11 from either Flipkart or Amazon during their sale days. The display, the camera and the build of the iPhone 11 are significantly better than the Apple iPhone XR. But, this is not taking anything away from the iPhone XR which comes with a LCD display and the A12 Bionic chipset from Apple. It has a 6.1 inch display and comes loaded with a single camera at the back. The iPhone XR also comes with dual sim capabilities. In 2020, if your purchase is driven by budgets and you still want a good iPhone, go for the iPhone XR, you won't be disappointed. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, don\u2019t worry the XR will be supported for many many years to come. At present, the 6S and above are being supported. It is speculated that 6S may even get another extra year. Even if we assume that it won\u2019t get an upgrade this year, the A10 and A11 chips would still be supported and assuming they too would be phased out year after year, that too would mean the A12 chip would last you till September 2023. So you have nothing to worry. This is the minimum supoort time. Maximum who knows could be a couple of years more. And by support I mean getting the latest version of iOS. Otherwise older devices are supported by Apple for very very long. A few months back even the iPhone 4S ( launches in 2011 ) received some security updates. ",
