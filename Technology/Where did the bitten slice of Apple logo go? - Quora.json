            "answer_text": "The story I heard is that this. The original logo was a big complicated image with Isaac Newton. Then for a very short time they actually used a full red apple. But it did not work in black and white or green and black. And you could not distinguish an apple from a cherry. So they added the byte (kilobyte). It was also a conspiracy theory that the bite was a hat off to Alan Turing, who bit into a poisonous apple, laced with cyanide, would be cool if true but I doubt it as any hat off that Apple would do in my opinion would be to HP.
