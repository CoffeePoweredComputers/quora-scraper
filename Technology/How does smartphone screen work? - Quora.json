            "answer_text": "The touchscreen is the main, and maybe only, input device on your phone or tablet. Touchscreens are also popular in laptops and point-of-sale terminals, and are largely replacing the mouse and keyboard in small devices. The reason is simple; they are compact and multi-featured (you can do a lot with them). Touchscreens come in two basic types, capacitive and resistive. Most phones use the capacitive variety because it registers multiple touches and responds quickly. The drawback is that it cannot be activated by non-conducting objects (finger nails or gloves). Resistance touchscreens are often used in stand-alone GPS devices and can be weatherproof and accessed with gloves or a stylus. This article covers capacitive touchscreens. The material you touch when you touch a modern smartphone screen is glass. But not ordinary glass mind you, but very highly engineered material. Originally, lenses were made from plastic, but were replaced by glass as the technology improved.  Today\u2019s high-strength glass is chemically tempered and makes for a very thin and tough lens.  You may have heard of Gorilla Glass.  All the touch sensing takes place underneath the glass through capacitive measurements.  What is capacitance?  Capacitance describes the ability of anything to hold a \u201ccharge\u201d.  Your body can have a lot of capacitance and ability to store a charge.  This is evident when you shuffle your feet across a carpet then touch a metal object and experience a static shock.  Your body was acting as a capacitor, and storing the static electric energy picked up from the carpet.  When you touch your phone, the screen senses your finger because of the increased capacitance your body introduces around your point of touch.  All this happens because there is an electrical grid embedded in the display. Since your finger contacts many points on the grid forming an area, the microprocessor locates the centroid of the area to calculate a touch point as shown in the figure below. Screen registers touch by a change in capacitance of a number of points on the screen.Raw touch points are captured and recorded.Background noise which includes stray points are eliminated.Actual contact points are calculated.True \u201ctouch\u201d area is established.Touch coordinates are calculated by computing the centroid (center) of the touch area.Touchscreens are not pressure sensitive, but require a certain contact area before they register a touch. If you touch the screen very lightly it may not register until you push harder. It does not sense the force, but the force causes your finger to squish and form a larger contact area which it senses.

            "answer_text": "Today, Smartphones have touchscreen which is widely classified into two types - Capacitive sensing Touch Screens Most phones use the capacitive variety because it registers multiple touches and responds quickly.The drawback is that it cannot be activated by non-conducting objects like fingernails or gloves. Resistive Touch Screens Resistive touchscreens are often used in car GPS screens and ATMS. Most resistive touchscreens don\u2019t have the ability for multi-touch, because of the multiple layers of displays and the larger amount of force it takes to register a response. They are more durable, cheaper and can be used with gloves or fingernails. The glass you find on modern smartphone screens is not ordinary glass, but a highly engineered material.Today\u2019s high-strength glass is chemically tempered and makes for a very thin and tough lens. You may have heard of Corning\u2019s Gorilla Glass, It is made to be especially hard and tough, but the possibility of breaking still exists. The reason is because the glass still needs to be very thin (less than 1 mm) to reduce size and weight. What is capacitance? or how touch really works? When you touch your smartphone screen, the touch is sensed through capacitive measurements underneath the glass. Capacitance describes the ability of anything to hold a \u201ccharge\u201d. When you shuffle your feet across a carpet then touch a metal object and experience a static shock, that\u2019s your body experiencing capacitance. Your body was acting as a capacitor, and storing the static electric energy picked up from the carpet. When you touch your phone, the screen senses your finger because of the increased capacitance your body introduces around an electrical grid embedded in the display.  The anatomy of a touchscreen begins with a conductive grid made up of horizontal conductors and vertical conductors (as shown in the figure). The grid lines are etched on opposite sides of a thin plastic insulating sheet that is glued to the back of the glass lens. The grid is energized by a voltage creating an electrostatic field. These conductive lines cross and form tiny capacitors. The circuitry in your device senses this and measures it.  Want more answers like this?
