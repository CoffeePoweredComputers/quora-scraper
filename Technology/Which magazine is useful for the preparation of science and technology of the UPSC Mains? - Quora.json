To know how an answer is written and how to substantiate your ideas, you can take reference from Toppers\u2019 notes or listen to Toppers\u2019 Talks that is rich with brilliant insights. However, if you are looking for an all-round magazine that not only helps with Science and Technology but also gives you all overall guidance about all the topics and Current Affairs of UPSC, I suggest you download the e-magazine called UPSC IQ. It is free of cost, covers almost all the topics and may help in the GS papers as well. ",
