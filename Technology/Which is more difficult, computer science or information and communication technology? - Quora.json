            "answer_text": "Computer Science and Information technology are very similar courses with a slight difference between them while communication technology is very different from these two Engineering Branches. While computer science and information technology only work on things related to computers whether it would be hardware or software whereas communication technology works not only on computer aspects of communication but on other technologies as well. Now, the problem comes in Telling that which is very difficult between the three is a difficult task since it can differ between each individual\u2019s opinion. In terms of wide variety of things one is learning while communication might seem to have an edge on papers, computer science and information technology both provide much variety then communication technology. In the terms of amount of competition with other engineers , computer science and information technology is way ahead even with more companies that it has across the world each year more and more computer engineers are produced. In terms of machinery that is used during the course communication technology is way ahead with a variety of machinery that is used by the students each having its own way of mechanisms.

            "answer_text": "That would depend on what find more difficult: - Applying obscure forms of mathematics to either quantify the efficiency of a given algorithm or generate pseudo-code. - Keeping up with the avalanche of new technology / implementation stacks / buzz-words / IT fads. If you find the first one easier, then you will find Computer Science easier.If you find the second one easier, then you will find a more general IT&C focused qualification / career easier. ",
