GERMANY \u201cNo one knows precisely why Germans have such a strong preference for cash, though survey data offer some hints. German respondents suggested that using cash makes it easier to keep track of their money and spending [pdf]. \u201cA glance into one\u2019s pocket provides a signal about the extent of expenses and the remaining budget. With a large cash share of expenditures, the quality of the signal is high. We conjecture that for some consumers this signal is of value and hence they choose to use cash,\u201d wrote ECB analysts who studied the phenomenon.\u201d Why Germans pay cash for almost everything JAPAN \u201cA number of explanations have been put forward to explain the enduring popularity of cash. One is safety. In a country where muggings are nearly unheard of, people feel comfortable carrying around the equivalent of hundreds of dollars in their pockets or handbags. Even the absent-minded can usually count on having a lost wallet returned unmolested. The prevalence of small, independent shops and eateries may also be a factor. Such places lack the scale to negotiate the lowest fees with credit card issuers, so some simply do not offer the option. And in a country where a majority of small businesses report losses and therefore pay no income tax, cash\u2019s relative opacity is doubtless an extra attraction for some.\u201d Subscribe to read Both are societies that favor cash even in the new millennium. It\u2019s due to their reliance on cash. I think comparing their societies is truly difficult. Germany is more flexible to change than the Japanese, because the Japanese economy has been in trouble for seventeen years plus due to their intransigence. (Personally, I know very little about Germany, except that one of my great great great grandmothers moved from Germany as an immigrant and had children with one of my great great great grandfathers\u2014 late 19th century or early 20th century.) JAPAN ECONOMY \u201cNow, let's look at Japan right now. Wikipedia tells us that Japan's per capita GDP, in nominal terms, is $45,900. That compares with $44,500 for Germany, $43,100 for France, and $39,600 for the UK...I suspect that what difference exists is due to labor inputs, since Japan does not force its citizens to take lots of time off of work the way Germany and France do. At purchasing power parity, the numbers are a little less favorable for Japan - $34,300, compared with $38,400 for Germany, $35,900 for the UK, and $35,000 for France. However, I am suspicious of these numbers, since PPP does not take into account quality differences between similar products across countries... So the \"real\" level of Japanese GDP, if such a thing can be said to exist, is probably somewhere right around that of Germany, France, and the UK. \"Lost decade\" or no, Japan in 2012 is right where the Solow Model says it should be. \u201c The Japanese tragedy And it\u2019s due to their being INCREDIBLE savers. The Germans save. The Japanese save. Here\u2019s a secret I know about Japan from having lived there. Another reason for the Japanese slump has been unlike Americans for example: the Japanese DO NOT like spend frivolously in times of economic uncertainty. \u201cMost children in Japan get their first training in personal finance at a young age from their parents. They are taught that the more money they save, the higher the quality of personal items they can buy in the future. It is common for Japanese parents to urge their children to keep their \u2018otoshidama\u2018 (traditional cash gifts received from relatives and friends) in the bank to avoid impulse buying. Most parents instill in their children\u2019s mind that borrowing money from people is frowned upon in Japanese society. So when there\u2019s a chance, high school students get a part-time job to fund a purchase outside of the family budget. Over time, their money management skills improve. Thus, by the time a man starts his career and raises a family, he is well prepared to manage his personal finances.\u201d \u201c54% of credit card holders in America use card for purchases, 55% in the U.K. and 58% in Korea. Only a paltry 18% of the average Japanese pay for purchases with their credit card. Presently, Japan is experiencing a steady decline in credit card use. In fact, membership is down to 84% in 2015 from 88.1% in 2011, according to a February 2016 JCB survey.\u201d Why average Japanese families have more cash savings than people in other countries (My Japanese friends would shake their heads at me at my choice of cigarettes, my need for expensive American food, etc\u2026 . It took me a few years to mostly smoke Japanese cigarettes rather than American cigarettes. I just kept buying my favorite brand, which was MAD expensive.) The Japanese do not like credit cards. The Germans do not like credit cards. \u201cBut the real point isn\u2019t that Germans love cash. It\u2019s that\u2014for the same historical reasons\u2014they loathe debt. (Armchair anthropologists have also long noted that German word for debt\u2014Schulden\u2014comes from the word for guilt, Schuld.)\u201d Why Germans pay cash for almost everything Unlike the Germans, the Japanese love CASH. Most mom and pop stores prefer cash. Okay, later. \u3067\u306f\u3001\u307e\u305f\u3002 ",

The share of salaries in GDP has been steadily declining for decades. At the same time, the rate of taxes on profits and property has declined. Net result? Richer get rich, middle class gets poorer and the state has less money on its disposal to perform the tasks it is supposed to. Eventually, the trust of the citizens in the system will erode as they realize that they aren't receiving the same level of service thay used to and generally can not afford what they used to do in the past. And that will be the beginning of a negative self-reinforcing loop that we have seen at work at other places\u2026 ",
