            "answer_text": "Nobody just magically knows something. You learn it. There's no magic, mostly just life choices. I chose what I wanted to be and then worked hard to be able to do it. You might have a brilliant mind but if you don't learn how to use it to achieve something, it's just ordinary. Since childhood, I always curious to know how something works. I remember, I was 9 when my dad bought a desktop for us and I was amazed by the system. How it did what I wanted it to do. I mostly played minesweeper for the first year until I got a dial-up internet connection at 56kbps. That helped me to know that there are some programming languages which makes the computer do what it does. Then came the learning part. Making html pages, using Frontpage, and other small programs with C/C++. That gave me a basic understanding of how computer works. Now if you need to exploit something, you must know how it works. By 13, I was passing out malicious programs via Y! Messenger, getting lucky using social engineering and doing crazy shit. That's how I did it and that's how usually most people do. Everything is on the internet. You just need to filter the good content from the bad. Start from the basics. Check  Page on hellboundhackers.org and Hack This Site!. OS Footprinting, Scanning systems and networks for vulnerabilities, cleaning your tracks and knowing where the logs are, and getting out. Keep your focus on programming and you too can hack. But, always hack in your own private network. Also, download Kali Linux (BackTrack formerly), it has all the tools you might need. Let me know if you need any help and enjoy hacking !
