            "answer_text": "The answers I have seen so far are generally sound on the question of the concept of evolutionary progress, and largely well informed on evolutionary facts and concepts, so I do not address those aspects.We are however getting our toe in the door of teleological evolution. Traditional Darwinism (neo or not) is non-teleological, heuristic adaptation to ambient circumstances, and as such leaves us open to threats largely of our own making, such as the new plagues. Please note that your medical optimism is drastically unrealistic; \"millions of lives\"? Millions are a drop in the bucket; we are losing millions of lives to disease per year already, which has been going on for centuries, in spite of vaccination and antibiotics. In the 20th century smallpox alone killed more people than all the wars of the century, even though the disease was wiped out less than three quarters through the century! Flu killed more than the first world war in a single epidemic!You think that our medical science renders us invulnerable to new plagues? Wake up and study some elementary epidemiology and medical realities! We are at one of the most dangerous phases in our medical history. We were so lucky with HIV  that it is hard to believe; its effects have been trivial; only about 40 million since we recognised the condition; less than malaria and easier to treat! If it had been a bit more infectious the deaths would have been billions instead of millions.And where did you get the impression that a super-flu or super HIV isn't quietly moving to the starting gate as we discuss the matter? Did you imagine that it was just a matter of telling the doctors that we had a new plague and they had better get busy? Just a slight change in its pattern of infection and transmission could turn Ebola or a similar Filovirus or Arenavirus into a global killer of hundreds of millions a year, medical advances or no.  But some would survive, so that is all right. More importantly, if the biological Luddites don't have their way, we are approaching the day in which we can employ molecular biology and related disciplines and technology to dictate our future evolution instead of relying on natural selection. When that gets under way, it will be the biggest blip in evolution since the emergence of metazoa and metaphyta. It might happen before the end of the century. Try to imagine some of the consequences; I bet you underestimate them by orders of magnitude and the dimensions in which the effects develop. Much as I will. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really because the idea of evolutionary progress is not that useful a notion.  It's true that some living things become more complex over time and one kind of thing, humans, became complex in a way that allowed us to develop language and culture, but there is no goal we are evolving toward.  Technology just means we can create devices or substances that help deal with the environment instead of having our bodies evolve to deal it. According to one report I read the rate of genetic change in humans is higher now than it's ever been simply because their are more humans on earth.  This doesn't mean that we are moving more quickly or more slowly to some kind of desirable state. As for future pandemics,  that's probably an interesting question.  My guess that evolving better defences to current diseases might not help us defend ourselves against a nasty new one, but it is actually really hard to answer.  For problems like a new disease, I'd actually trust targeted research more than evolution. ",
