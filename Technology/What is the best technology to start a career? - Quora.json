            "answer_text": "Whereas Cloud Computing is certainly going to be a big part of the future of technology, the cloud computing marketplace is getting pretty crowded with people jumping on the bandwagon.  Don't get me wrong.  There will be a big demand for data scientists, cloud administrators and other data analysts.  But, this is a technology that every CS school on the planet is gunning for and there will be thousands of graduates competing for the openings.  If your intrests lie in this area, then absolutely pursue it.  But, if you're just getting started in this field, you'll have a lot of competition.   On the other hand, if you've got an interest in the maker space and like to build physical things, you might consider the embedded platforms that will make up the Internet of Things (IoT) or the Industrial IoT.  There will be thousands of companies that are working on disruptive technology that will impact our daily lives.  If you understand bits and bytes and know what a data register is, then you might have better luck getting started in this area of interest simply because there are fewer developers and the market is exploding.  There is a real shortage world wide of developers who understand that not everything works in a virtual machine. :-) ",
