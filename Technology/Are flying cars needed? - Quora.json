            "answer_text": "You\u2019d have to define your terms. The currently available \u201cflying cars\u201d are effectively small, light aircraft. They require runways to be able to both take off and land, they require pilot\u2019s training to be able to operate, and they\u2019re subject to a whole lot of potential problems which could endanger the occupants. There are pretty limited circumstances under which these vehicles would be worth owning. For a flying car to be really useful, it would need a) effective vertical takeoff and landing capabilities, requiring a small footprint and no special infrastructure, b) to be operated with no more skill than a traditional vehicle (preferably could operate autonomously), c) have sufficient backup systems and collision prevention that minor errors and failures wouldn\u2019t result in catastrophic crashes, d) have low enough noise profiles that takeoffs and landings weren\u2019t especially disruptive and e) be possible to mass-produce cheaply enough for the average consumer to own (or, at least, to be used for public transit). If all of these conditions could be met, then flying cars would be one of the most transformative technologies in at least the last century. The amount of time, effort and infrastructure that\u2019s spent getting people and goods from point a) to point b) is ridiculous, when you think about it. And the only reason we need all of that is because cars can\u2019t navigate natural ground. If we could fly above that, a huge portion of our infrastructure would rapidly become obsolete. Since the earliest civilizations emerged, the ability to build and maintain roads was one of the most basic measuring sticks of a society\u2019s ability to advance itself. This would end that almost overnight. We\u2019d no longer need highways, tunnels or bridges. Traffic jams would become a thing of the past (there\u2019s a long more navigable space when you can work in three dimensions. Transporation from one place to another would become far more efficient. The wheel itself wouldn\u2019t totally die out, but would radically scale back in usefulness. Societies build themselves around roads and other transportation systems. What would we do when that no longer made sense? I can\u2019t even predict, but it would be fascinating to see. Another item, at random. There are a lot of ways that humans disrupt natural ecosystems, but a big one is that we cut up natural habitats into smaller and smaller pieces. If you run a highway through a forest, so animals can\u2019t range back and forth from one side to the other, the forest can support far fewer creatures. Imagine, then, that those roads are all just allowed to crumble and grow over, because no one needs them anymore. A lot of species would substantially recover from their currently vulnerable states. No longer being tied to our systems of roads to move people and goods around would be vastly transformative. Unfortunately, it would require advances so huge that I despair of it ever happening. ",

            "answer_text": "For most practical purposes, airplanes are already flying cars. You\u2019ve got tiny flying cars that will fit a single person\u2014sky motorcycles!\u2014all the way up through 800-passenger behemoths\u2014sky buses. In my mind the real question is, are airports still needed? Aviation has a noise problem that\u2019s not going to go away anytime soon. Sure, modern turbofans are much quieter than old turbojets, but it\u2019s still not something you want to live next to. I\u2019ll go out on a limb and say that prop planes and helicopters are as loud as they were 50 years ago. So, flying cars\u2014you know, airplanes\u2014are still going to be relegated to airports for now. No one wants to hear you firing up your super-drone at 7 a.m. for your morning commute. No one wants you landing on the freeway during rush hour. Your neighbors will only thank you for landing your helicopter in the back yard during fall, because it means they won\u2019t have to rake their leaves. So, basically, if airports are available, flying cars are not needed. But what if airports aren\u2019t available? This is where I love the work iTec is doing with its Maverick flying car.  What we have here is a lightweight, surprisingly capable off-road dune buggy that can convert to a powered parachute. It\u2019s designed specifically for reaching out-of-the-way places and peoples that are inaccessible by regular transportation. For those situations, yes\u2014flying cars are needed. ",

Besides, my personal belief is that unless the FAA laws change substantially (don\u2019t hold your breath), anyone that owns one will need driver\u2019s license to \u201cdrive\u201d it and a real, honest to goodness FAA certified pilot\u2019s license as needed to fly a \u201creal airplane\u201d just to fly it in the air. Not to mention that it will undoubtedly HAVE to be operated from an airport or airport equivalent. And, it will require ALL of the same inspections, etc. that a \u201creal\u201d airplane does. Personally, I see it as an expensive toy for most people. For some, like me when I was commuting to work by airplane, it would have made a lot of sense because my home and office were conveniently located near airports. ",

Reality:  I couldn\u2019t find an image of the requisite 1000 feet of distance between aircraft that the FAA requires. But at least the weather is appropriate. This is why:  That\u2019s just one rule that aircraft and air traffic controllers need to follow. There\u2019s a few hundred more after that. Oh, and fly into a thunderstorm in a small aircraft, and if you\u2019re astronomically lucky, you won\u2019t come out of it in 1,000 pieces. ",

The technical and logistical hurdles that need to be overcome to fill our skies with flying people movers means they won\u2019t be coming to a driveway near you anytime soon, unless you are one of the astronomically rich people in the world. Maybe then, and your driver will be a licensed pilot. But here\u2019s what MIGHT happen: If someone does eventually create a reliable, safe and scalable flying car, eventually, they\u2019ll could be like cell phones: No one really NEEDS one, but you are at a disadvantage in many ways by not having one. Then the demand will push the tech forward, including the safety tech, and as the price comes down and the tech improves, they will become within reach of the ordinary person (perhaps as a luxury vehicle, like a Mercedes or BMW). Then we could end up with skies full of them. But by then, I predict they will be self-piloting, electrically powered and flown with heavy assistance from AI controlling traffic and so on. Then they might be everywhere. But even then, no one will NEED them, but you might be at a disadvantage without one. ",

How insane is it that you pay to not use an asset (parking it) that other people pay to use (car rental)? Most personal cars will be replaced by autonomous taxis. There will also be autonomous air taxis (there already are). Transportation will segment into air/road, short and long haul (with lots of gradient in the middle). With different payload capabilities. They\u2019ll all be optimized for their purpose. Mixing short and long barely makes sense\u2014mixing air and ground much less so. IMHO. Rule the Robots \u2013 Medium ",

Concerning practicality, you have to get your car to an airport, then assemble the wings, and lock them down, then attach a propeller. It takes time to make certain all of the safety pins, pushrods, cables and nuts and bolts are properly seated. Instead of wasting time changing the configuration of the car/plane to a plane, you could drive your regular car to the airport, climb into your airplane and be halfway to your destination in the time needed to configure the car/plane. Perhaps when science figures out how to levitate a car without the use of wings, or rotors then they may be a need\u2014well, for the wealthy anyway. ",
