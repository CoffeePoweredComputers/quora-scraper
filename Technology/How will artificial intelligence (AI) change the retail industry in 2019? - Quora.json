            "answer_text": "Over the last few years, artificial intelligence technology has made some interesting advancements across multiple industries. Even though not every retailer has been using it due to high costs, the largest players in the retailing have been pretty active about it. It's no wonder, given the benefits AI can bring to the actual businesses. A.I can give more in-depth knowledge of customers. You see, A.I can be used to review actual sales data linked to the customer data. When this information is run through the machine learning algorithms, new information about a business, customers, and inventory is created which are not known to the business owner. Nike has created \u2018Nike Live\u2019 -- a responsive, hyper-locally curated, retail space designed to be a geographically specific culture hub. They\u2019ve taken data from all of their Nike apps and online shoppers in specific locations and created a place that offers the customization of an online shopping experience and brought it to life.  Meanwhile, stores such as Sephora have fully embraced technology and created a \u2018Virtual Artist\u2019 \u2014 a \u201c3D live experience\u201d that allows shoppers to upload a photo and virtually try on lipstick, blush, eye shadow and other cosmetic products \u2014 essentially, a valuable try-before-you-buy tool that saves time and money.  McDonald\u2019s has partnered with Uber Eats, an offshoot of rideshare company Uber, which allows users to order and have delivered food from select restaurants via their website or a smartphone or tablet. British online fashion retailer Asos.com also is using AI to help shoppers choose the right sizes. The retailer analyzes which items customers keep and in which sizes versus items that get returned most often. Using machine learning, Asos can then recommend appropriate sizes for individual customers. As a result, returns are minimized, the customer experience is better, and Asos reduces costs. So retailers have a lot of catching up to do, as the wild world of e-commerce takes a deeper turn into the world of A.I! ",
