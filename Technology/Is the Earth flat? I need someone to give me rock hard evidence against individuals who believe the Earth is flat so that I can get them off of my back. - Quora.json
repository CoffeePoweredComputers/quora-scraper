            "answer_text": "Things I like to ask Flat Earthers: 1. Is Australia really long and skinny like the Flat Earth map shows? Answer: no, that's a projection of the globe earth onto a flat map. It gets more and more distorted in the lower latitudes, until it gets \"divided by zero\" at the South Pole, which becomes a ring. Which it isn't. This is what it really looks like: \ufeffAustralia Map | Map of Australia The actual distances can be verified by any means you like. This DISPROVES Flat Earth. Darwin to Melbourne, 1960 miles; Perth-Brisbane 2240 miles. 2. Why are things up in the sky still lit after sunset? Aren't they subject to \"perspective\" or whatever stops the sunlight from reaching me on the ocean's surface? Mountains, clouds, planes, satellites ... I have been in a plane past local sunset, and was in the sun while the earth below was dark. Why?\ufeff Answer: because the sun is blocked by the horizon at ground level, but not higher up until the sun goes further around. In fact, you can prove the earth is round by this effect, and determine its circumference: Measuring the Earth's Curvature Activity 3. How come when I took a cruise down south, the northern constellations disappeared below the horizon and the Southern Cross came up? Polaris wasn't \"too far away\", it was BELOW the horizon. Answer: this is what you see when you're on a ball. \ufeff4. How does satellite TV work? Are there helicopters which stay up there? Who refuels them?? If they're balloons, why doesn't the wind move them off course? If the signals are reflected off the \"firmament\", then where's the transmitters? Are some of them in the mid-Atlantic where they\u2019d have to be to bounce down to the east coast of the USA?\ufeff Answer: they're called \u201csatellite TV\u201d for a good reason. 5. How did I receive GPS signals in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, the mountains of Uganda, and the rain forest of Madagascar, but not under my metal roof at home where I can still get cell signals?\ufeff Answer: they're from satellites, not \u201ctowers\u201d. Satellites are up in space, easily seen from anywhere with a view of the sky, but not under a metal roof. 6. Where do meteors come from? Why are they so fast? How can they make such a big shock wave? \ufeffAnswer: way out there in outer space, and going like a bat outta hell. Which they can't do if they just fall from \u201cthe Firmament\u201d, they can't get up enough speed. They\u2019d burn up like returning satellites, but not create huge booms. 7. Ecclesiates 1:5: \"\"The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteneth to his place where he arose.\" Job 26:7 He stretcheth out the north over empty space, He hangeth the Earth on nothing\". Luke 17:30\u201335 describes the return of Christ while some people are sleeping during the night, some awake in the day. Doesn't the Word of God (KJV, from 1611) thus prove the earth is a globe, going through space? Also, that the sun is a guy? Answer: no, the Bible is not a science book. \ufeffIt has philosphical truths, not astronomical facts. Or anatomical, in the case of the gender of the sun. 8. What is the percentage of scientists and engineers who believe the earth is flat? Answer: none that I know. I never got \"clued in to the secret\" despite working with satellites. Because there isn't any. 9. Why are the parabolic network downlink antennas at your local TV station pointed at the equatorial geostationary orbit ring? And at the cable TV office? And many hotels? And some businesses? Answer: that's where the satellites are.\ufeff 10. Why are Air Route Surveillance Radars only 200 miles apart, when they could be much further away if earth was flat? Answer: (Oooh, ooh, I know, ask me!! I'm a radar engineer!) It's called horizon blocking, caused by the earth curvature. If the earth was flat, the radars would interfere with one another, especially secondary (beacon, or IFF) radar, which all operate on the same frequency. 11. How come the ISS is always where NASA says it is going to be? (N2YO.com - real time satellite tracking) If it's a plane, don't they ever run out of fuel, and why don't the lights blink? Real planes have strobes. And how can it go over a Flat Earth in that weird S shaped curve, without burning fuel or changing course? Answer: it's orbiting a globe in a vacuum and doesn't need fuel unless it's to change orbit a little bit. \ufeffIt goes around in a circle and the Earth revolves under it, making that funny S curve on a flattened (distorted) map. You can triangulate it with another observer hundreds of miles away to verify that it's 250 miles up; from its angular speed you can thus deduce its orbital speed. 12. When a polar orbiting satellite like Radarsat goes over the South Pole, does it go 180 degrees across the Flat Earth instantaneously somehow, going from Chile to South Africa which are opposites on the Flat Earth map? Answer: no, it just continues over the Pole and around the globe. \ufeff 13. When I pointed a radar at the moon, it took almost 4 seconds for the return to come back. Why is that? Answer: it's because it is a quarter million miles away. It's also solid, which is why I got a radar return. \ufeffHam radio operators have done the same thing. 14. What's above the Firmament? Water, or beer? How far does it go?\ufeff Answer: there is an ionosphere up there which bounces radio waves below about 50 MHz. Frequencies above that (FM radio, TV) go right through. It's made of upper atmosphere gas ionized by the sun's radiation, and it changes greatly after the sun shines on the opposite side of the globe (AKA night, but I had to get that dig in). Of course this is nothing like a \"Firmament\", which has to be, well, Firm. Although the original in Hebrew was the word for \"sky\", but was mistranslated by the KJV people around 1611 because it sounded cooler. 15. What's below the earth, if it\u2019s Flat? How far does that go?\ufeff Forever? 16. What is the dome of the Firmament made of? How thick is it to resist billions of tons of pressure?, yet let meteors through? Answer: It's made of Unobtanium. It sits on a foundation of diamond, which is the only material that can withstand the pressure. And it's full of holes that lets meteors through, but not all the water, somehow. Or, maybe there's not a Firmament, but an atmosphere, held in by gravity, and empty space above it, which is all explained by conventional physics. 17. What makes the sun hot? Why aren't there any convection currents above it? Answer: it's a fusion reaction in a vacuum. \ufeff 18. Why are Flatheads lying about being able to see the North Star (Polaris) south of the equator? Answer: that's the only way they can get their constellations to work: lie. If somebody actually goes there (I did), they see that you can't see it. That disproves (again) Flat Earth. Debunking the Flat Earth 19. Why is it dark at night? It's many orders of magnitude lower than daytime, even though you should be able to see a glimmer of the sun. Answer: \"Perspective\" can't just shut off light. Perspective comes to a point at infinity, not a fixed distance. A solid horizon can. \ufeff 20. How come I can stand on the seashore and see the sun disappear below the horizon? If I zoom in with a camera after sunset, it's still gone. Where does it go? Why is the sea in the way? Why can't you bring it back with a telescope like Flat Earth Vanishing Point theory claims? \ufeff 21. When Admiral Byrd referred to the land beyond the South Pole the size of the USA, wasn't he referring to East Antarctica, which is that size? Why did he refer to it as a Pole, not a ring?\ufeff 22. I drove from the mid-Everglades (where my phone wouldn't work) to Orlando, and listened to one SiriusXM channel the whole way. How was this possible with no broadcast stations in the area? Answer: it came from a satellite, not terrestrial radio stations. 23. Why does the moon look big when it rises, and stay the same size all night? Isn't it supposed to start really small? red moon rising Is this (multiple exposure) photo an actual representation of how the moon comes over the horizon, or does it actually shrink to a dot the way Flat Earth theory asserts? http://www.pikespeakphoto.com/images/sunmoon/moon_rising.jpg Answer: what you see is a globe circling around us. So it stays the same size. This, of course, is contradictory to Flat Earth Fizzix. 24. When the moon is half full, you can see shadows of craters at the dark/light line if you look through a good telescope. How can this be if the moon self-illuminates? And how does it self-illuminate, anyhow? And change phases? And create tides on earth? Doesn't that mean it is a solid object, not a spot of light? Answer: Yeah, here's how that works. Note 2 things: this is exactly the way it looks from earth, and the earth is a globe. Moon Phases / Lunar Phases Explained 25. What satanic magic makes a foucalt pendulum work? There are lots of them, and they can't all be hoaxes. Is it aliens? Ether? Or\u2026 is it the turning of the earth?? 26. Cell towers are short and only go a few miles. TV broadcast towers are 500 feet and go 100 miles. Why is that? Answer: both are blocked by earth curvature. TV channels can be reused 200-300 miles away; there's no interference because of blockage by the earth curvature. There's a little troposcatter and refraction, but if the Earth was Flat you'd get TV from hundreds of miles away. 27. What do you get when you try al-Buruni's experiment? Al-Biruni's Classic Experiment: How to Calculate the Radius of the Earth Answer: you come up with a close measurement of earth's radius. 28. Is this where Flat Earth videos come from? The city getting rich from fake news 29. Commercial GPS antennas, like on an airliner, aim broadly upwards, and have deep nulls toward the horizon. Why is that? Answer: they need to receive signals from satellites, but reject as much interference from the environment as possible. So the nulls ensure they receive very little at the horizon, where all the cell towers are. Because cell towers don\u2019t transmit GPS signals. 30. During the \"super moon\" of fall 2016, where the moon looked about 10% bigger, how did \"they\" do that? Wasn't the moon supposed to be EXACTLY the same apparent size as the sun, according to one theory? Answer: it is adequately explained by classical celestial mechanics. The moon's orbit changes a little bit now and then. Around a globe earth. 31. One of the \"proofs\" of Flat Earth is that when you go high up in a balloon or plane, the horizon is level all around. Wouldn't you see the edge of the \"Firmament\" closer on one side if you weren't in the center of the \"disk\", at the North Pole? Since a level horizon all around is exactly what you'd expect on a globe, doesn't this disprove Flat Earth? 32. If the moon is Flat, why doesn't it look like an oval when you look at it from the side? Wouldn't it look round only when it was perfectly overhead? Answer: the full moon always looks round because a sphere looks the same at any angle. 33. So there's auroras at the magnetic poles, which attract charged particles from the sun. The south magnetic pole is offset from the geographic pole near Australia and not even on the Antarctic mainland. So, how come an aurora can be seen from South Africa or Chile? Isn't that halfway around the South Pole, err, ring, or whatever you call it? Doesn't that seem to indicate the geographic Pole is one spot, not a ring? Answer: The magnetic pole is near the geographic pole, and particles from the sun end up there just like the North Pole, and make an aurora. Because the earth is a globe. 34. How could GPS receivers figure out height if they're getting signals from terrestrial \"towers\"? Answer: they can't; that would be impossible to calculate altitude from a 2D flat plane. GPS satellites transmit from up in space, and receivers calculate position in 3D. 35. What happens when you point an antenna to the sky? Satellite Finder / Dish Alignment Calculator with Google Maps Answer: your dish gets TV from a satellite. (If you pay for it.) If you point it anywhere at the horizon, you get nothing. Note that most TV dish antennas have an offset feed, which is hard for Flatheads to figure out where they\u2019re aimed. 36. Is this video obviously a CGI fake made by a \"Nasa shill\" or actually the sun going down over the horizon? Sunset Over The Atlantic Ocean on December 5, 2015. (Note: this is not to imply that the sun is revolving around the earth, although it does show relative movement.) 37. When you go up a hill or an elevator, the air pressure change makes your ears pop. If you go up a tall mountain, it gets hard to breathe because of the thin air. If you extrapolate that decrease in air pressure up another 100 miles, how much air do you think is up there? Answer: virtually none, and that's where space starts. You can't fly planes up there, and water would boil instantly, so rain doesn't fall from \"the Firmament\". 38. Why does the Catholic Church run an observatory? Specola Vaticana Answer: same reason Fr. Georges Lema\u00eetre formulated the Big Bang theory, because they work hand in hand with science to further our knowledge about our universe. Which we discovered about 2500 years ago, the earth is a sphere, found out 600 years ago we go around the sun, and not too long ago that we are in a galaxy and there's a lot of other galaxies. Although some people haven't figured these things out yet. 39. How can you see Pike's Peak from 400 miles away in a plane? Answer: Earth Curve Calculator shows that you're at 40,000 feet, and the weather is perfect. 40. Did you know that while Flatheads were busy pumping out YouTube videos, mostly repeating the same lies and bullshit, NASA was doing this: NASA Reveals The Unknown In 2016 ? 41. Does the fact that you can see Venus at night PROVE that the earth is flat? Answer: Well, aren't you glad you asked. Let's go to a \"Flathead\" website. William James: 1\nSigmund Freud: 0 Now draw a line from Venus to the top surface of Earth (tangential to the surface). It's in the dark, right? So if you stand there, you can see Venus just after dusk. Venus is clearly above the horizon. So he debunks himself. The sun goes below the horizon (it's night), and both Venus and Mercury are above the horizon. 42. How come all the other planets are round? Saturn has rings around it. Why would ours be any different? You can see the red spot on Jupiter revolve around it. 43. \"There's NO curve.....\" How do you explain this? http://stupidconspiracies.org/misc/toronto.gif and this? http://s210.photobucket.com/user/DylanDude26/media/chicago%20from%20distance%201%202.jpg.html And this? http://s210.photobucket.com/user/DylanDude26/media/chicago%20from%20distance%201%202.jpg.html 43.5 How can light bend? Answer: gradients in the atmosphere, causing \"looming\". Like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTx7UoPXvr4 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looming_and_similar_refraction_phenomena Interestingly, it curves downward into the denser medium. This, of course, works against Flat Earth conjecture as to where the sun goes at night. 44. Do you have a solar collector? How do you site it? Answer: If you think the earth is Flat, you're doing it wrong. http://www.sunearthtools.com/dp/tools/pos_sun.php?lang=en Note the 4 definitions of twilight, based on how far the sun is below the horizon. BELOW. On a flat earth, the sun would never be below. 45. Is the ISS fake? Answer: well, it's a real something that orbits on a strict schedule (N2YO.com - real time satellite tracking) and can be seen from observers hundreds of miles away. They can measure the elevation to it, and comparing notes, can triangulate its height. Hint: 250 miles. From timing its track, they can estimate its speed. Hint: 17,000 MPH. Ham radio operators talk to it sometimes. 46. Which way is down? And why?? Answer: that \"magical gravity\" the Flatheads hate, pulls things together. The biggest thing around these parts is the 7,926 mile diameter rock we're sitting on. Down is toward the center of this mass. On Flat Earth, nobody knows which way is \"down\", or why it should be that way instead of some other direction, and nobody knows what pulls things down. It isn't magnetism, because many things are not magnetic; but they have mass, which attracts them to earth ....by gravity. Flatheads be like \u201cbecause down is that way.\u201d Oh. 47. What happens when you look at the sun through \"eclipse glasses\" and compare its size during the day? Answer: You discover that it stays the same size all day, contrary to Flat Earth Fizzix, showing that it stays the same distance from us as we rotate past it. 48. Where does Halley's comet go for 76 years? Why does it get brighter as it nears the sun and appear to go in an elliptical orbit? How could any of that happen on a Pizza Planet covered by a Firmament? 49. \u201cWhy do people lie about the shape of the earth?\u201d Answer: 5 reasons, in general. 1. They haven't got the brains to figure it out 2. They are paranoid psychotics and need help. \"Hidden knowledge\".... oooh. 3. They are Fundamentalist cultists who have misinterpreted the Bible. 4. They are making money off it. Wilbur Glenn Voliva, Samuel Rowbotham, and some folks currently on YouTube, the Fount of all True Knowledge (cough). 5. They don't really believe it, but want to pick fights. Short terms: 1. Stupid 2. Cuckoo 3. Fundie 4. Shill 5. Troll And that's why Flatheads lie about the shape of the earth. ",

            "answer_text": "Upon my research on this topic I have came to a clear understanding that the Earth is not a Globe. There might be some that might think I am joking, lying, or just a plain idiot. In my opinion like I have said before condemnation before investigation is the true sign of ignorance. In my response I will layout a few fact that has lead me to my beliefs. Anyone can debate these facts if they feel that I may have made an error but I doubt there is any errors that can be found. While looking into the sky you will see the same stars in the same positions they have been for thousands of years. Which proves that we live on a stationary plane and not a Globe.While you look across a distance let's say 20 miles across a body of water or a desert plane and you will not see any curvature which according to spherical geometry the curvature should be starting at 8\u2033 per mile squared. You don't see any curvature .While going up on a mountain or even look out a plane\u2019s window from any height the horizon line will be level with your eye sight which shouldn't be possible on a ball earth.I just wanted to throw out a few facts but there are plenty more. I also can provide some circumstantial evidence such as NASA or anyone has never provided a real photograph of a ball earth. Everything that you see photoshopped or CGI.Look at all flight plans in the So. hemispheres. There flight plans don't make any sense on a globe.Explorer Captain Cook tried to sail around Antarctica for over 60,000 miles and never found and open. In essence he was going around the outer ice wall.Update 11/22/2019 - Since I wrote this back in February 2017 I have refined my rock hard evidence that many have tried to disprove but absolutely no one has provided anything sufficient to discount the facts I will provide shortly. I have refined my arguments to just 2 facts. You can read the comments to my answers to this question and see for yourself no one has provided anything to refute the facts I lay out. Update 02/09/20- people seem to want to suppress my answer. Although many have agreed and my upvote there are people trying to suppress the truth and report my answer. There is absolutely no measurable curvature found anywhere on Earth. In geometry for any shape to be at least considered a sphere it must have curvature. The Earth has none.For the Earth to be a sphere it must without a doubt be rotating. The fact is we do not hear feel or see any movement. Some say well we can't trust our senses but the fact is there also has not been one scientific experiment done that has detected the Earth is rotating.These are 2 simple facts that truly disprove the heliocenteic model. With that said there might be many phenomenons in this world that we need to study and figure out how they work. Flat Earthers don't have huge budgets like NASA or other institutions have so it will take a lot of time to figure out how many things work on Earth but there are people working on these things. Just because there hasn't been enough time studying many of the phenomenons that are present on Earth doesn't mean we don't live on a flat plane. All it means is that we have a lot of work to do. ",
