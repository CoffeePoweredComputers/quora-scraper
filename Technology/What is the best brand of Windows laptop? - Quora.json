            "answer_text": "let me enlighten you on a couple ideas that are generally understood in the world of tech. there is only one Windows laptop brand and it is made for Microsoft, designed and developed by Microsoft but manufactured by pegatron, the device is entirely branded Microsoft and is meant to be an example for Microsoft oem's. it is called the surface book, beyond that there are no other windows laptop brands. There are tons of other oem or original equipment manufactures that license through Microsoft and are compatible with the windows operating system. On the other end of it there are Macs, and there is only the apple branded stuff unless you are a diy person and are willing to make a hackintosh, then there are Chromebooks which are not laptops but Chromebooks, some of the Chromebooks will fairly easily enough run other operating systems but it is a select few, and those os are not windows. Any windows compatible laptop will run most Linux distros(distributions, there are many out there now) some windows capable machines will run Macintosh os with special modified drivers and code but when you ask a question like this it is pretty straight forward that it is either a laptop, a Mac or a Chromebook, a laptop is what is considered an IBM/PC compatible system, there are other operating systems you can load and run on them, Macs will run windows via boot camp or VMware and since for the most part Apple products run nearly identical hardware as Ibm/PC compatible or windows machines, ie. Intel cpu and Nvidia or AMD gpu and even nvme SSD just with different formating on the drive, the distinction only need be if it is specifically Mac or a Chromebook, beyond that simply asking who makes the most reliable laptop? would more than suffice. of course there will be people that will say Mac but again it's apple not mac, Macintosh is the brand and Apple is the company, and also you didn't ask does apple make the most reliable machine so the people who answer as such should pretty much clue you in on the mentality of those that do. I prefer Lenovo but only the business class machines, specifically the thinkpad line. the idea books suck. Dell has made some very good and long lasting machines as well. even Acer has a few that are great. you notice I left out HP, very intentionally, there are also boutique builds made by game oriented companies but as far as mainstream off the shelf builds for reliability, those 3 companies higher end machines will do great. any lower tier machine will make sacrifices to get the cost down and that will also come at the cost of reliability so here you need to look into customer service and warranty. again I will stick with Lenovo with the 3 year coverage plan. Dell also has a very comprehensive coverage option. zero experience with Acer in the customer service service department but have hear good things. since the high end machines use very similar components that only change when it comes to the external case and port selection, preloaded software(mostly crap) and the customer service and protection plans it's up in the air ",

            "answer_text": "There's a great deal of preference that comes into this kind of question. Most people don't want \"best\" they want \"best in my price range\" or \"best with a specific feature set\" but, here are some standout options: I'm going to recommend some serious gaming laptops because frankly, unless you specifically need a workstation graphics card, they'll do anything else you could possibly need a laptop to do handily.  Top of the hardware stack: Digital Storm Behemoth 17 Inch Gaming LaptopThe \"Ultimate\" configuration on one of these insane monsters of gaming performance tops out at about $5,000 with 2TB of SSD performance storage, Dual GTX 880s in SLI and an Intel i7-4940MX Extreme edition processor. It's a monster that will crush most games. Did I mention the LED backlit gaming keyboard and touch pad?  It's also a little heavy... and a little bulky. All that performance takes some space to build. Maybe you want something more ultrabook like instead? The Maingear Pulse: Maingear Computers | Pulse 17 is under an inch thick, weighs only six pounds and still commands some impressive hardware: An i7-4700HQ processor, 16GB of RAM, a GTX 870 3GB GPU, and they'll even toss in twin SSDs in RAID for some extra performance. Toss a coat of BWM class automotive paint in your choice of color for an extra high end finish and still come in under $3,500. But, what if you don't want to game on a massive 17\" monitor? If you need more slim and portable? The The New Razer Blade Ultra-Thin Gaming Laptop - 14\" Notebook Display from Razer is probably one of the best compact gaming laptops on the market, which, despite having the smallest screen thus far, also boasts the highest resolution at 3200 X 1800! It's a little bit thinner than the Pulse, and a pound and a half lighter. Very similar hardware to the Maingear Pulse, though you won't get SSDs in RAID or a coat of automotive paint, you do get a pretty slick ultrabook and it tips the scales at a paltry $2,700.  There are a few other gaming laptops worth taking note of if you need something more budget friendly. In that respect, I recommend an ASUS ROG laptop (ROG - Notebooks - ASUS) or an MSI laptop. Both Asus and MSI have a solid reputation in the performance gaming hardware community and they have earned that reputation by consistently producing high quality gaming hardware at multiple levels of the market. They aren't as 'high end' as the top 3 laptops I mentioned, but for mass market gaming laptops, they're very good products. ",
