            "answer_text": "It depends on many factors my friend.Every viewer has different needs. If you want an stb on the basis of cost, then the local stb provider will be the best in india, i can say this because i have subscribed for airtel and the basic channel's pack in airtel is 230,now i have to pay 60 rs extra for the 4 star sports channels i have subscribed, u may have to & o the same as most of the people in india watch sports regularly (cricket mostly). Plus that i pay 80 rs extra for he english movie channels. That makes a total of 370. And this is my nonthly recharge amnt. Now on the other hand a friend of mine uses the local stb provided and he gets all these channels, the star sports as well as English movies at jst 200. So u can choose for yourself. Also the rate for airtel, tata sky videocon and other national dish provider has the same rate all over the company. Whereas the local stb's cost differs from place to place. For example - In ranchi where i live it is 200 whereas in Kolkata at my mama's house its just 150. So u must check the price for your city. Also their are some charges for few extra channels in local stb's too. Conclusion - If u want cheapest go for the local one, and if money is not an issue for you then u should subscribe for airtel dth. I personally believe it is the best in the country. You might choose tata sky, that's not bad either, but i would strictly suggest you not to go for the other dth providers as their quality is not of that level. Also i have heard (not sure) that tata sky provides the best hd channel's service. So decide as per your own preference. Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "Alternative programming, movies, and commercial free. Here in Chicago we had \u201cOn TV\u201d. A broadcast \u201cdescrambler\u201d box for around $30 a month that offered movies, video music albums (yes there were a few), and adult programming. This was late 70\u2032s, just before home video, cable, HBO and MTV. It was groundbreaking and incredibly lame at the same time. Very limited programming, only in the evening. Cable killed them off in a very short time. ",
