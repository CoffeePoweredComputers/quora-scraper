            "answer_text": "How do you allow bidirectional time travel in a deterministic block universe (time travel, worldbuilding)? The easiest way is to have the universe limit the times and places you can travel to/from, so as to allow your actions to have already occurred. So, for instance, you can\u2019t travel back to 1 second past midnight, 1969, and appear in Times Square. If that had happened, there might be newspaper articles about it, and you\u2019d (possibly) know about it. Since you don\u2019t know about it, it didn\u2019t happen. However, you might appear in the middle of the Sahara Desert, then hike out. There was nobody around to observe your arrival, and you don\u2019t leave unambiguous evidence (such as a radioactive crater), so the fact that you had \u201calready done so\u201d is perfectly consistent with history. Likewise, you might or might not be able to travel FROM Times Square on that date - it would depend on how drunk the people around you were, and whether they would notice your disappearance. Of course, this makes for a certain amount of nervousness on the part of the traveller. If you want to go back to, let\u2019s say, 1900 and set yourself up as the world\u2019s greatest inventor, and the time travel works, a simple explanation of why you don\u2019t appear in the history books might be that shortly after arriving you were killed by a runaway horse and carriage, and your death reported as simply \u201can unidentified person was killed in an accident\u201d. Or you immediately contracted a disease like pneumonia and died quickly of natural causes. Your claims of your origin were written off as delirium caused by high fever, and nobody paid attention or recorded them. However, in principle it allows you to do things like go back to the Jurassic and hunt dinosaurs. The particular dinos you kill \u201calready\u201d have been/will be killed, and there is no problem. If you want something a little more open-ended, you can try the multiple timeline approach. Let\u2019s say you travel back in time to kill your own grandfather. The act of killing the old gent creates a different timeline from the one you originated in, so you don\u2019t disappear in a flash of twisted spacetime. There are now two timelines where there was one. Timeline A is our present timeline, and in this one you are born, grow up to invent a time machine - then activate the machine and disappear. Timeline B is different - you appear in your time machine, then kill your grandfather. He never has children, and so you are never born. At least, not in timeline B. If you posit that the time machine is somehow \u201canchored\u201d in timeline A, you can return, but only after your original departure. This won\u2019t do you much good, of course, since in timeline A your grandfather was not killed, and there are no changes when you return. What you can do is to wave your hands and give the machine the ability to select which track it arrives at, so you can reappear in timeline B at any date after the death of your grandfather and see how things have changed. Of course, you then have your choice of declaring that your reappearance in timeline B has \u201calways\u201d been a part of timeline B, or if it creates a new timeline C. Etcetera. If you want to claim that a time traveller can change the past and the change propagates through history, the Grandfather Paradox shows its teeth. One elegant solution is to allow changes in the past to affect the future. Then, every time someone changes the past the traveller \u201cdisappears\u201d, having never having been born. However, someone else may discover time travel, go back, and the same thing happens. This will \u201crepeat\u201d (as far as the term makes sense) until the particular changes in the past cause a future in which time travel (although it\u2019s possible) is never actually discovered. This universe/history/reality is stable, and no more changes occur. Therefor it\u2019s the way things have always been. ",
