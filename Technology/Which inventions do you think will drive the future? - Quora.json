            "answer_text": "We are due for a massive change in the way we educate pre-K, Grade School and High School students.

Inventions in this new kind of teaching will be tethered to the classical subjects in a simultaneously philosophical and hands-on approach. New kinds of teachers and classrooms will be needed to begin implementation of this stuff, and working out the bugs with real students. ",
