            "answer_text": "I'd heard about this but not by name, just by being called dip paint, or water transfer painting and had done a little research - though I haven't tried it myself.  Essentially, you paint a base paint on an object, you create a print on a thin film that's water soluble, then you immerse the object in water and allow the film to wrap around the object. There are volatile chemicals involved which do make it hazardous work, and can cause health problem, so you need to take lots of safety precautions.   There's a site where you can buy kits and it gives a great deal of information about how the process works, they also have a video on the website. I won't put the link here, don't want to look like I'm promoting a product but it's called MyDipKit dot com, and this information below is from the product info page. How does the Water Transfer Printing Process Work  Products are decorated using a print, which resides on a thin base of water-soluble film. The printed film is placed on the surface of the water, and the base begins to dissolve. A patented activator chemical is sprayed over the film causing the ink to remain floating in an oil-like state on top of the water. Next the properly prepared part is immersed into the water, and the upward pressure of the water causes the ink to wrap around and adhere to the item. After the entire item has been immersed, it is removed from the water, cleaned and then coated with a clear coat.  To note: there are lots of warnings about safety, the chemicals present problems with exposure to skin, eyes, respiratory, and must be disposed of following hazardous waste regulations.  ",
