            "answer_text": "I know a family who are nearly all M.D.s. The father was a physician, and 6 of his 7 children are too. About two years ago, my family was dining with this family when we started to discuss the medical field (at the time I wanted to become a Physician Assistant). To our shock, all 6 physicians agreed they would not pursue an M.D. if they had to do it over again. They felt it simply wasn\u2019t worth it. Now, these were all successful, established, and respected physicians, not some embittered burnouts. They provided good reasoning to back their statement: The Education: training to become a Physician will consume a solid 8 years of your youth, with very little time left over for anything else. The coursework and workload are the most difficult of any educational path you could possibly choose, besides maybe high level math or science research. The cost of this education can rise into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, meaning most doctors graduate with massive debt. In addition, med school admissions have become increasingly competitive. Only students with perfect grades, extra curriculars, and a +95% MCAT will be accepted to the really prestigious schools. An \u201caverage\u201d medical student (still a Valedictorian by most standards) might end up spending 4 years at a C-grade school in rural Iowa, if they\u2019re lucky. And without the credential of a \u201cgood\u201d med school to your name, your career is already extremely limited. I knew an excellent student with near perfect grades, who spent a solid two years after college applying to every medical school she could find. Not one accepted her. It\u2019s just that competitive. Don\u2019t even try unless you know youre smart enough to ace high level chemistry classes all day long. If you drop out of med school, you are fucked. You get all the debt with no earning power, and your reputation is ruined.Residency: you thought med school was the hard part, huh? Well, after you graduate, expect to spend 3\u20134 years as a resident doctor in training, which by many accounts is the worst part of the whole process. There is basically no limit to how many hours residents can work, or for how little pay. Senior Physicians are often verbally abusive, and will dump excessive grunt work on you. You\u2019re expected to perform the tasks of a full doctor, but with none of the perks. Limits actually were imposed on resident hours after the high profile death of a patient in the 1980s due to a mistake caused by sleep deprivation. The limits they imposed? No more than 24 consecutive hours, and no more than 80 hours total per week. Yeah, that\u2019s the \u201climit\u201d. Luckily, by this point you\u2019re used to extreme sleep deprivation and never getting laid.The Pay: What\u2019s wrong with this part? Doctors make great money, right? Well, kind of. Doctors make low to mid 6 figure, usually 120k-300k per year for general practitioners. High level surgeons and specialist can make 300\u2013500k, but thats around the upper limit. It\u2019s good money, sure - but you could make as much or more as a corporate lawyer, and law school is 3 years to medical school/residency\u2019s 8. Same goes for a Masters in business or finance - or you could pour the time, effort, and capital from your education into starting a business or investment fund, which could be even more profitable in the long term. So doctors are actually paid very little compared to the training they receive, and the intelligence and work ethic they bring to the table. And let\u2019s not forget that educational debt! Even at 200k, you\u2019ll be paying off that interest for years. And with the recurring costs of certification, filing fees, and continuing ed, you may never feel truly wealthy.Job Satisfaction: Becoming a Physician is hard - really hard. Medical school is basically rings 6\u20139 in Dante\u2019s inferno. But everyone knows this, and students go into the field with some idea of the challenges that lie ahead. So even with all the work, and sleeplessness, and expense, it\u2019s worth it in the end because Doctors save lives, right? What could possibly be more gratifying that? Well, as Bob Dylan says, \u201cthe times, they are a changing\u201d. The new practices of the HMO run medical industry are slowly but surely squeezing the joy out of the Physician\u2019s profession. For example, many healthcare systems have truly idiotic requirements for physicians to sign off on nearly everything their underlings do. In California, an RN can\u2019t even start an IV without a Physician\u2019s approval. Now, nurses are master phlebotomists. They could start an IV drunk and blindfolded on the deck of the Titanic. But somehow, an MD must come by to sign off every single time they do it, or risk major trouble. When I volunteered at a hospital, I witnessed physicians running from place to place all day long, just signing off on stuff. They didn\u2019t get to do procedures. They didn\u2019t get to talk with patients. It was mainly the nurses doing these things, while the MDs used their 8 years of education to run around checking boxes. It was actually very very sad, but at least they were getting good exercise.In summary, I cannot recommend the Physician\u2019s path to anyone. It is simply too hard, too expensive, and has a lame payoff at the end. Luckily, there are plenty of more reasonable career paths available in the medical field. You can become a Physician Assistant or Nurse Practitioner with only a Masters degree - you don\u2019t even need a Biochem B.S. or anything, just a handful of prerequisites. There are masters degrees for Anesthesiology and MRI operation as well. All these jobs pay 6 figures. Nursing school is a good investment too, although very competitive now. However, any of these would be preferable to the barefoot trail of broken glass and Legos that is the road to becoming a Physician. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there Quora :) I am very happy this question was asked because it gives an opportunity to share a different perspective of the current situation as a student who just graduated from medical school. **DISCLAIMER: This is my personal perspective. I do not think this represents all doctors and as you can see from the other numerous answers there are perfectly content docs out there. So please don\u2019t take any offense these are just things I have been observing and also heard feedback about from my peers who were in medical school at the same time and at different institutions. Thanks :)** One of my biggest regrets is going to medical school IN THE CURRENT AGE. There\u2019s a lot of things that medical school doesn\u2019t prepare you for and a lot of things that are old and not changing about the system. If I could go back I wouldn\u2019t do it again CURRENTLY. I stress these words over and over because I think that medicine is slowly changing (very slowly), but it is changing for the better as more awareness is raised. So what didn\u2019t I like about medical school? Three main things for me personally: Medical school and doctor training is currently very very abusive in it\u2019s teaching style.One of the first things that a lot of medical schools will tell you (and I think a lot of people who went to medical school will agree with me) on your first day is \u201cWelcome to medical school, you will now be learning like you are drinking from a fire hose.\u201d To me as someone who has been teaching and mentoring since high school, this message just basically sounds like \u201cHey, we know this is too much information, but we are going to give it to you all in too little time anyways so good luck and those of you who can\u2019t make it just aren\u2019t cut out for this.\u201d There is a sad term called a \u201cGunner\u201d that gets floated around in medical school. I\u2019m not sure if this is a term that is used in other fields, but particularly in medicine this is someone who achieves the best grades and scores no matter the cost. Your class mate is struggling? Good riddance. That means I look better. Your team member has that doctor who is mean to all their students? Look away and be happy cause that isn\u2019t you. This is the essence of a gunner. A lot of people will joke around and call people gunners, but the way that the current medical system is set up we are rewarding and breeding for gunners. After the first 2 years (1 and a half years at some schools) of medical school students will leave the classroom and go directly into the hospitals for clinical learning. This is when the training style for Gunners runs rampant. Grading tends to not be objective during this time and because it is based on the opinion of the teaching physician all of the medical students compete with each other to try and impress them. Hence why gunners run rampant and are rewarded for their behavior. This kind of environment fosters medical students no longer asking questions, going home to memorize as much as they can to look impressive, not helping each other as much as they should, and overall creating an environment where future doctors are hyper competitive with each other instead of helping each other. In the United States doctors don\u2019t have unions and are forced to work 80 hour weeks which is the maximum that was placed in recent years because studies were showing that the sleep deprivation was harming patients. Prior to this it was even higher hence the term \u201cresident physicians.\u201d This means that you work 12 hours (usually getting into the hospital at 5am and staying until 5pm minimum) 6\u20137 days a week. The golden rule of vacation for doctors is \u201c4 days off a month\u201d during their training years so that means you can actually work 26\u201327 days STRAIGHT before you have even 1 day off working those 12 hour minimum shifts (this does not include times to respond to patient emails online, time to finish patient notes, travel time to work, or even time to get ready the next day). I have heard old school doctors complaining about the implementation of such a rule because \u201cWe did it so why shouldn\u2019t you.\u201d Funny part is many hospitals \u201cenforce\u201d this rule by sending residents home, but they are reminded that all patient notes need to be finished before the next day so in reality you aren\u2019t free from work at all and that 80 hour work week is really much higher. You just now get to do it at home, and this is seen as \u201cgenerous.\u201d Everyone goes in saying that they will never become the monsters that they were taught by, that they will never be that gunner, but after going through such an abusive system many people change and don\u2019t even realize it, I mean who can blame them? Think about this, you work 12 hours a day, should get 8 hours of sleep\u2026that leaves you 4 hours left in the day. 4 hours to be with your family, your significant other, your children, and your own physical and mental health. That is also assuming that you live right next to the hospital and get home immediately. Forget even having dinner, showering, or other personal hygiene rituals. This is from personal experience as well as from the numerous friends and family members that I have personally witnessed transform (in good and bad ways, but when talking about the bad ways most dismiss it and don\u2019t believe it. Which makes sense\u2026who wants to hear they are changing for the worse? This includes myself as well, and I am currently trying my best to change that!)*Update* Recently a doctor from South Africa was brave enough to put her recordings and interactions in her residency training online seen below. If you don\u2019t have time to view the video the summary is this **there is a female doctor in training who ended up leaving medical training because she was being told demeaning and sexist things. Upon bringing it up to her superiors instead of being listened to she was told that she was over-reacting and that she is being the resident and person \u201cno one wants to be.\u201d They told her she would never get a job again if she continued pursuing these things.** I would like to say that this is rare, but unfortunately the truth is it is not as rare as you would think. It\u2019s not just happening to women either. This abusive style permeates through all genders, races, beliefs, etc. It\u2019s a MEDICAL CULTURE. Which is really sad for such an altruistic field. All in all right now things are being taught with a \u201chazing\u201d type of mentality where people just say \u201cWell I went through this hell\u2026so why shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d instead of trying to continue to improve it for subsequent generations. Now to be clear\u2026this is NOT all doctors, this is NOT all programs, but there\u2019s a lot of them out there for various reasons and the only way things are going to change are by raising awareness and working together. 2. There\u2019s so much that we need to do to change the medical system, yet medical schools are only teaching us how to be doctors in hospitals only. We don\u2019t learn any entrepreneurship skills even though some of us are expected to run clinics and hospitals in the future. We aren\u2019t required to learn anything in regards to health policy even though doctors are more needed on Capitol Hill. Heck, we don\u2019t even learn how to maintain our own bodily health and mental sanity. (If you are interested in reading more about what I think is lacking in medical education you can read what I have written here: Tanakorn Kittisarapong's answer to What useful skills do they not teach you in medical school?) There was an interesting survey done by a website called Med Page Today which keeps up with the latest medical news and trends which basically asked doctors: Are You Thinking About Quitting Medicine? (you can click the question to go to the survey there). A staggering 61% answered \u201cYes\u201d with over 550 votes. Of course this is an online anonymous survey, so there could be many biases, but it is interesting to note how many people responded yes and that the age range was actually pretty evenly distributed (meaning it wasn\u2019t just young docs, middle aged docs, or older docs it was a nice spread among all of them). Physician has also become one of the professions (if not the top profession) with the highest suicidal rate. It\u2019s estimated 300\u2013400 physicians commit suicide EACH YEAR. That is one doctor dying in a totally preventable way EVERY DAY.Highest Suicide Rate by Profession Physician Burnout Rates Top 50 Percent (And That's Not the Worst Finding) Medical student suicide: It's impact is devastating. This case proves it., petition: Stop the suicide epidemic in medical schools and residency programs! 3. We are opening more medical schools, but the RESIDENCY (doctors in training) positions are not growing as quickly. The interesting incoming doctor shortage that the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) has done studies on in 2016 estimating a shortage of 61,700-94,700 physicians by 2025. (If you are interested look here: GME Funding and Physician Workforce). In response to this numerous medical schools have been opened up in order to prepare for this upcoming shortage, makes logical sense. Now comes the issue I mentioned at the start. Take a look at this image:   Notice the number of applicants went up by 1,036, but the number of positions went up by a little more than half of that only at 538 (even the number that are \u201cactive\u201d and submitted preferences, meaning they went to interviews and submitted which hospitals they wanted to go to {people such as myself}, went up by a higher number of 571). Active Seniors 18,187 up from last year. Matched Seniors 17,057 up from last year. % Positions filled by Seniors 61.2% DOWN from last year. Also take notice that the number of active seniors went up 162, but the number of matched seniors went up 125. That\u2019s 37 seniors lacking in matching. Critics will say that there are numerous factors for this, and I whole-heartedly agree, but where the heck are these seniors going? In addition isn\u2019t it worrisome that there are 1,130 UNMATCHED seniors??? This is only U.S. graduates, not even including those from Doctors of Osteopathic Medical Schools, U.S. citizens trying to come home from Carribbean Schools, and International Medical Graduates. For which the numbers are worse for and can hover down to 40\u201350%. Now what are these seniors suppose to do in the mean time or if they want to do something related to medicine but not be a clinical physician? Unfortunately having an M.D. degree doesn\u2019t qualify you for a wide range of jobs that something like an M.B.A might qualify you for. At least not that I am aware of (I would love for someone with insight to comment on this), but from personal experience myself it is hard to figure out what jobs I can get with an M.D. degree solely because my education has only trained me to be a doctor. There is so much talent wasted, and there is so much about the healthcare field that needs to be fixed that I am shocked there isn\u2019t more education and resources to get these graduates to other jobs/opportunities that can help the healthcare field in general. I am saying this after I spoke to 12 different physicians at my institution who could not advise me on what I could do with just an M.D. degree other than go to residency AND after going to my schools career center. Scary and disheartening if I do say so myself. It costs so much money to apply. I spent easily over $10,000 on applications and interviews because not only do you have to pay for each application you send in, but you also have to fly to each location for an interview as well as hotel.And let me just end with being a little honest about my situation. I didn\u2019t get into residency after applying to over 50 programs (for those curious, I applied to Pediatrics which is considered a \u201cnon-competitive\u201d specialty. I personally don\u2019t like that term, but it\u2019s what is being used right now). This was after I followed the advise of all my advisers. I didn\u2019t pass Step 1 the first time, but that was my only hiccup in the entirety of medical school. No other failures, no other red flags. In fact I ran multiple organizations at my school, did research that got published, and even created a peer teaching program that ran for a while. Problem is that in a system where the number of applicants to residency positions greatly exceeds the spots, the quickest way to weed people out is to look at the score and that red flag was enough to brand me. I don\u2019t even blame them, I understand how stressful it is to weed out thousands of applications (I have had jobs in the past where I was responsible for interviewing and hiring as well as interviewed numerous prospective students while I was in medical school). It\u2019s just an unfortunate reality of the current situation we are in with the system right now. The weird thing is that you can\u2019t even retake the Step exams in order to get higher scores. Once you pass you are stuck with that score for at least 7 years when the score expires. So in other words for 7 years you can\u2019t improve your chances to get into residency by SCORE (there are other things that one can do such as continued education, research, volunteering, maybe working for a well known doctor, etc.), which is interesting because there is such a heavy weight on score in this field. Now I hope this didn\u2019t sound bitter, but just a reality that I personally faced. With $350,000 of debt and over 10 years of my life spent on getting into medical school and graduating it was shocking that no one could advise me on what I could do with my M.D. degree to earn money to begin paying down my debt while waiting another year to apply to residency and needing to spend another $10,000. Everyone keeps saying \u201cdo research\u201d, but unfortunately I have worked on research projects in the past and those don\u2019t usually pay due to the uncertainty of grants. Or the jobs that do pay get taken by more qualified Ph.D\u2019s or Masters degree holders who have much more experience in the lab. I come from a middle class background, so I can\u2019t rely on my soon-to-retire parents to pay off my debt. I can\u2019t even imagine how someone from with a background with even less money can cope with the situation. It doesn\u2019t shock me to hear that there are doctors out there working as waiters and coffee baristas. My whole point of this post was to raise awareness that there are THOUSANDS of people graduating from medical schools and CAN\u2019T CONTINUE TRAINING. Even after enduring years of debt, education, and abusive teaching styles. I hope that people on Quora read this and share and spread more awareness because this is a really large issue that needs to be addressed and I myself am really adamantly pursuing individuals and work that is making this change happen. Thank you for your time. And as always, thank you so much for reading. I love discussions (as long as they are constructive and friendly) so please don\u2019t hesitate to comment :) ",

            "answer_text": "Probably more common than you might think. In an answer to a question about terrible things done to me my answer was \u2018med school which turned a man into a surgeon\u2019. It\u2019s that hard, that intense and, to some, too deeply into to quit, to committed to do anything else. I started in a class of 31 men on a Neurosurgical path; 7 of us finished. My admiration goes to those people who realize this wasn\u2019t the choice they thought it was and withdraw. Too many young people proclaim their desire to be a doctor of some form and do so for too long. Eventually it\u2019s just assumed that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do so, in a sense, they\u2019re stuck in their own mouth trap. Now it\u2019s off, eventually, to med school. They do well enough, graduate, perhaps start a practice but their professional reputation reflects what is their genuine disinterest in what they\u2019re doing. By now there\u2019s a great deal of money at stake and, since families, who\u2019ve been around and heard of their desperation to be a doctor, may well have gone into serious debt to see their child accommodated. The guilt of concurrently hating what you do but seeing responsibilities can be crushing. Please do not misunderstand me, if you want to be a doctor, great, hope you\u2019ll make it and be a good one but\u2026.if you have doubts that linger through maybe the second year (Everyone entering med school has doubts at first-it\u2019s that killing.) possibly you need to speak to someone at the school and discuss it with them. And I put it that way for I\u2019ve seen many people slightly shift their interest to something that will attract their interest, keep them involved and keep them in medicine. Briefly I had a GP whom I hated. The reason? You may have heard of \u2018bedside manner\u2019? He couldn\u2019t even get to cryptside manner. What he should of done, and finally did, was medical research. That\u2019s what I mean about shifting in the general field of medicine but finding a more satisfying path. Why did I become a surgeon? I can tell you to the date and the hour. 11:40 am, August 11, 1965. I was shot on the first day of the Watts Riots on the campus of USC from which I was receiving my Ph.D. in Physics. My Godfather, and my parents, decided I\u2019d had enough of California so sent me off to him in Cape Town to go to Med School. Which I did. What none of us could have known was that although I would do well and loved my field, I would be diagnosed with MS, not a disease for surgeons\u2026.(oh, how the hour? That was on the chart at the emergency room at Good Samaritan where, surprisingly, somewhat over a decade later, I would be on staff.) Later I happened to continue thinking about this question and realized something. Many of the doctors who were \u2018reluctant\u2019 physicians all came from a line of doctors. To them, they were pre-ordained to attend med school, become a doctor. In the instance I cite, the doctor who had no \u2018cryptside\u2019 manner, both his father and grandfather were physicians. This isn\u2019t always the case, certainly, my Oncologist is the son of another Oncologist and he\u2019s a brilliant doctor, but the instance in which it does happen is sufficient to be worthy of note.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t regret it. Here\u2019s what I tell my students and anyone looking at going into medicine: In ANY job you do, there will be a mountain of nonsense. Nonsense is a ubiquitous substance in any job worth doing and this is just a fact of life: *Cops/Firefighters/EMS do so much paperwork that they have to carry two pens so that if one runs out they have a spare. *Lawyers do paperwork for a living. *Pilots have to keep logbooks, learn procedures, go through manuals, etc. etc. etc. *Scientists get to actually do science during their degrees and postdoctoral fellowships. By the time they get to the point of being principal investigators, I noticed in college how mine were always in their offices writing or reviewing. Their days of doing actual science were over. *Executive chefs spend more time in the office than in the kitchen. Ask Jamie Oliver or Gordan Ramsay how much of their typical days they actually get to spend cooking. So what matters is: when you AREN\u2019T doing the nonsense, are you enjoying what you do? For me, when I\u2019m not writing notes and answering phone messages and filling out forms and doing stupid trainings and sitting in meetings, I am seeing patients. And that is the bit I live for. Calming the anxious mother worried that her smiling, happy baby with a cough might have a pneumonia. Breaking a huffing, puffing, wheezing kid out of an asthma attack. Suturing a wound. This is the stuff that makes my job great. Oh, and at least at my company we have very collegial relations with our management (in fact, I\u2019m part of the physician leadership team) and, while I\u2019ve chosen the field in medicine that is lowest-paid and hardest-working (General Pediatrics), my income still puts me in the top 5\u201310% of the nation and I live quite comfortably, if not opulently. This is, in fact, my dream job and I\u2019m actually doing it. So if you get hung up on the nonsense you\u2019re going to hate any job you do. If you focus on the fun part of the job (your patients), you\u2019ll love your career as a physician. And if you don\u2019t like patients, then either go into radiology or pathology -OR- don\u2019t go to medical school. For me, if my life were rewound to age 20 and I got to keep the knowledge I have, I\u2019d let it roll forward just as it did on the first go-around. ",

            "answer_text": "In a recent poll 1 out of every 5 physicians regretted their choice. I don't.In recent years Dutch doctors are given an overall country-wide budget by a government agency within which all care must be carried out, if one oversteps the budget the money has to be paid back. This has triggered some big lawsuits.The autonomous growth of the costs of medical care is not of our making, patients want all the newest technology for themselves and their loved ones, irrespective if it is applicable to them or not, since they think they have medical expertise from reading about miracle drugs and miracle cures in the tabloids, they claim it is their right since they have paid for their medical insurance policies, while everybody knows we have to equally share the medical care the country can afford. A lot of people who think they know a lot are in fact badly educated, and blinded by fear and emotion are often unwilling to listen to a reasonable explanation why they don't need an expensive new fangled exam \"just to make sure.\u201d But new effective drugs are in reality much more expensive, think of anti-cancer drugs, treatments are more and more complex and expensive, think of intensive care medicine (I once was an intensivist physician). So apart from unfounded claims, up to date bonafide treatment is costing us more and more. Add to that the fact that we all live longer, so will need more medical care during our lifespan. That fuels the growth of medical expenditure. In real life, whom to choose, the young mother with young children and incurable very aggressive breast cancer, in whom costly meds will buy her two more months for her to put her affairs in order and say goodbye to her children, or the young previously healthy person grievously sick after a serious accident for which he bears no blame, who has the potential to survive and live a long productive life afterwards? I don't have the answer. At present we still can treat both. In The Netherlands the medical profession is quickly being feminized, at present 80% or more of the medical graduates are female, of whom most will later work part time, some will not practice at all, which is why the planners think we will need a lot more doctors than will be graduating in the coming years; a lot of older male doctors like me who worked full time have retired or will be retiring soon. A female specialist once summed it up like this: lost of income, lost of status, lost of autonomy, that is why few males now choose to become a physician. Add to this the often long and tiring hours working hard bearing a lot of responsibility even when still at a younger age, which is hard on your partner, your children and yourself;, I would therefore not recommend just anybody to choose this profession, only if they really want to and know why they want to and understand the consequences for their life should they choose this profession. In The Netherlands after graduating from high school at 18, one must do med school (3 years for Bachelor, 3 years for Master, including 3 years of unpaid internship), after which one must apply for another 3 to 6 years of (paid) training as a resident before being able to start a career (at between 30 and 35 years old) and maybe a family. Perfect child care arrangements are paramount to having a happy life if you're female and a doctor, since a lot of female doctors with children feel inadequate both as a mother and as a doctor. A supportive partner is a must, a flexible partner is a blessing. While in The Netherlands in general 1 in every 3 relationships fail, in the medical profession it is 1 in 2. This is a fact little known to lay people, medical doctors are generally viewed as a desirable partner. Having said that, after 40 years it is still the most interesting, satisfying and gratifying profession I know; it makes me feel I am doing something worthwhile, but I know I only could do my work properly because of the staunch support of my wife. My children didn't know better so didn't suffer. My daughter eventually choose to become a doctor herself, she is now a PhD student, and is very happy being a doctor, hoping for a residency after attaining her PhD. Also in these difficult times, being a doctor practically guarantees you a job as long as you are not picky, just like nurses, IT people and maybe engineers. So all you people who are thinking about doing med school, think again, and if you're still convinced it is the profession for you, and think you know why, go ahead, invest a lot in your future and have a fulfilling professional live, but keep in mind you will need a supportive partner or either your relationship or your career will fail. EDIT:In 2013 the job prospect for physicians and surgeons in The Netherlands has gone bad, as many as 50 young certified highly trained surgeons at present aren't able to find a real job, so either do a locum, or work for free so not to lose their dexterity and license to practice. Clinical geneticist are losing their tenure, since they only work in academic hospitals and these had had big cuts in their budgets. The same for nurses.We still have some waiting lists, but budget cuts won't allow us to hire more young professionals, medical associations are calling on older docs to work less hours a week and so make room for younger docs to have a paid job. EDIT 2015:At present jobs in the health sector are scarce, 670 docs are registered as having no paid job, 158 of them highly trained medical specialists, the bulk are basic docs who after graduating med school haven't done further training e.g. residency (can't get into one). We don't know how many out of desperation has left the profession, and those having temp jobs. Our MD daughter has decided to forgo clinical medicine altogether after attaining her PhD in clinical genetics this summer, going for 100% clinical research, meaning hopping from one project to the next where they still have the money to do the research, no job security at all. EDIT 2016:Our daughter has left medicine altogether due an almost burn out, the research environment in the top medical institute she worked at was even worse than for those doing clinical work, the boss demanding that she worked during her daily 2x90 minute commute to and from work, and Saturday mornings too; she has today August 15th 2016 started a new career as a Data Analyst trying to build a bridge between clinical medicine and ICT, analyzing what clinicians want from the ICT people and rephrasing that in terms ICT people understand and can work with. Being among lots of nerds (brother although being in a marketing position is a nerd, longtime spouse is a programmer, many of their friends and acquaintances are programmers too), the firm will provide her with some course/training for that.

            "answer_text": "People love the career of a physician for many reasons; people regret, or burn out on, the career for many reasons. There is no one answer. Being a physician in most cases involves an intimate relationship with human dysfunction and human suffering. Treating a schizophrenic who refuses to take medications and is brought in screaming and threatening, guiding a patient and family through a death from painful and incurable cancer, watching the decline of a diabetic hypertensive heart failure patient who cannot afford their medicines. Or would rather spend their money on methaphetamines and alcohol: the life of a doctor is not serenely dispensing bolts of medical wisdom and sure fire cures in a spotless white coat. If it doesn't hurt, you\u2019re not doing it right. If people get into medicine without understanding how central human suffering will be to their working life, or if it impacts them too much, they may regret becoming a physician. Physicians make a fairly good income in the United States; those that think they would have made a lot more in another line of work are mostly kidding themselves. I don\u2019t think physicians entertain the fantasy of making their fortunes elsewhere because of greed or ambition; I think physicians who are burned out for other reasons and are determined to see nothing good about their profession, including their income, engage in a \u201cgrass is greener\u201d fallacy. Some people also regret becoming physicians because the pressures of the job have increased while the respect accorded the position has declined. In the \u201cbad old days\u201d physicians were expected to work brutal hours and be available to their patients day and night. In return they were positioned at the top of a very rigid hierarchy, and received deference from patients, nurses, administratours and the public. Today all organizations are \u201cflatter\u201d and more rule-driven than they were 50 years ago, including hospitals and clinics. (This is mostly a good thing, in medicine, but it has unintended effects too.) The physician is still expected to take ultimate responsibility for the patient and their care, we are still legally responsible when things go wrong, but rather than being \u201ckings and queens of the castle,\u201d we are under pressure from all directions: expected to work faster (always faster,) cheaper, more successfully, according to standards and practices laid out by CMS, JHACO, the hospital and the practice. Patient satisfaction, nursing satisfaction, lab tech and pharmacist satisfaction . . . If you can imagine being in a workplace where failure to organize an \u201cA+\u201d effort by the team can literally kill people, where you are expected to work faster and faster every year, with no mistakes or deviations from sometimes irrational or ill-conceived guidelines (such as the enforced introduction of poor-designed electronic medical records and electronic orders which add literally hours in front of the computer each day) from multiple different authorities, all while making every member of the team feel valuable and listened to, without ever scowling or raising your voice, and you will understand the tremendous pressure that leads some physicians to burn out.

            "answer_text": "Heck yeah, some doctors regret becoming physicians. When I was working for a pediatrician in a state agency, I made the decision to go back to school to become an occupational therapist (I was already an RN). I expected her to be happy for me but she seemed\u2026jealous??? \u201cWell,\u201d she frowned, \u201cit would be nice to do something else, but once you spend all that money on med school, it just doesn't seem worth it.\u201d Another time, I overheard three (female) pediatricians (who rotated as hospitalists on the hospital's pediatric floors) discussing how if they had it to do over again, they would be nurse practitioners, not physicians. They didn't think the difference in salary made up for their crazy work schedules. Once upon a time, a physician could expect a thriving private practice and tremendous prestige and community respect when he/she graduated from med school, along with a rewarding income. These days, medicine has become corporate and the majority of physicians are employees of large corporations that have a primary focus on the bottom line, not on quality of care. This is an issue with not-for-profits as well as for-profits. Also consider that physicians graduate with an average student loan debt of over $200,000 according to Google. It's an enormous burden. Recently, eight anonymous physicians at UF Health Shands Hospital gave an interview in which they described retaliation from their Pediatric Department Chairman when staff doctors brought up quality of care issues at the Children's Hospital and Clinics. The chair of the Department (Scott Rivkees, who is now also the Surgeon General of the state of Florida in addition to remaining Chair of the department of Pediatrics at UFHealth)also has privately sued a physician he fired at UFHealth for \u201cslander and libel\"; the sued physician detailed the kinds of retaliation physicians endure in his deposition, included firings, demotions, salary cuts, and bogus referrals to Florida's Professionals Resource Network for \u201cmental health issues\" or \u201caddiction treatment.\u201d References: look up Scott Rivkees in the (free) Alachua County Florida Public Records for the deposition, and see this article for the interview with eight physicians:\u2018Sense of fear\u2019: Ex-colleagues warn of DeSantis\u2019 surgeon general pick Pamela Wible, M.D., has a website on physician suicide prevention that describes the tremendous stressors on today's doctors.Physician Suicide Archives | Pamela Wible Reports .

            "answer_text": "Some do, yes. As the other answers have noted, it\u2019s common, probably >40% in primary care. I don\u2019t. But then, I\u2019ve done my best to \u201cbreak the rules\u201d, and so far I\u2019ve had success in avoiding the pitfalls that destroy so many doctors\u2019 love for the practice of medicine. Most of the dissatisfaction among doctors (like any other highly expert field) arises from being controlled by other forces (read more about this here). Read the other answers, especially User\u2019s experience - control from insurance, hospital administrators, ACO\u2019s, etc. etc. etc. This is (IMO) the core frustration in medicine - our expertise does not allow us autonomy; we are (as a profession) controlled by outside interests, and forever caught between the patient and the insurance companies. Concierge Medicine is the response to this intolerable circumstance. I\u2019m proud to work for RiverRock Medical Clinic because we are not controlled by any third party. My work is simply between me and my patients. No insurance, no bean-counters, no administrators. I work as a hospitalist as well, but never as an employee. My contract is between myself and the CEO or the hospital group, 1 week at a time. If I am ever asked to do something that conflicts with my patient\u2019s best interests (and it happens all the time), I just say no and there\u2019s another hospital who would love to have me. And there is SO MUCH to love about medicine. I loved physics (still do), I loved philosophy (still do), I love chess, and poker, and helping people as a volunteer in college. But nothing compares to medicine. Medicine has all of that wrapped into the highest-stakes game of judgement calls outside of the military or the presidency. And it\u2019s a game we play to help people. When we get it right, we prolong people\u2019s lives, or at least improve the quality of their lives. Their LIVES!! It\u2019s crazy-cool to have the opportunity to make an impact like that. Anyway, I\u2019ve been lucky and blessed (and smart ;)). I love my job, and I think I always will. My heart goes out to those of my peers who have fallen into a (sometimes inescapable) trap between a rock and a hard place, and who experience the frustration of seeing their dream of helping patients turned into a nightmare of frustration or despair. Physicians should not have a high suicide rate, but we do, and that is a terribly, terribly sad comment on the state of our profession. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a friend who is a doctor. She said to me more than once that she regretted becoming a doctor. She got into med school riding on altruistic energy. She had never had a long lasting full time job prior to college because she was overachieving schoolasticly so med school might be possible. She would stop by my house on Fridays after I had gotten home from working a long week and find me collapsed and numb from exhaustion camped out on my couch mindlessly watching TV or napping. She occasionally made fun of me hinting that I was lazy (we are no longer close friends). Zoom forward to 3rd year med school for her and now she is interning and on rotations. Interning is a slave like experience, they are working huge hours and are treated often with cruelty by the superiors, and let's face it--- people generally do not become nicer when sick. Oh, so now its OK to crawl home after work and dive into pizza and your couch? After surviving internship she went into a private practice group as the newcomer that got the worst shifts, more frequent on-call shifts than her senior coworkers, and anytime someone wasn't taking their shift the new girl was expected to cover with no complaints. This was not the vision of being an altruistic God-like physician that she had planned on being. She had trouble not bullying the office staff and just like it is in ANY office, unkindness to secretaries and clerks will always come back and bite you in the ass. After a very bad week she came to me to cry on my shoulder, so frustrated and now regretting becoming a doctor. She had a mountain of school debt, was exhausted all the time and was living with shattered dreams. Kinda like everyone in middle class America. I really had to dig deep to find compassion for her.

            "answer_text": "Many U.S. doctors regret choosing to become doctors. recent surveys have shown that 30% to 40% of practicing physicians wouldn't choose to enter the medical profession if they were deciding on a career again[1][3][6] This quote helps capture a lot that sentiment: \"I wouldn't do it again, and it has nothing to do with the money. I get too little respect from patients, physician colleagues, and administrators, despite good clinical judgment, hard work, and compassion for my patients. Working up patients in the ER these days involves shotguning multiple unnecessary tests (everybody gets a CT!) despite the fact that we know they don't need them, and being aware of the wastefulness of it all really sucks the love out of what you do. I feel like a pawn in a moneymaking game for hospital administrators. There are so many other ways I could have made my living and been more fulfilled. The sad part is we chose medicine because we thought it was worthwhile and noble, but from what I have seen in my short career, it is a charade.\"[1] U.S. doctors see themselves as lacking sufficient power and being told what to do by insurance companies and other forces. They spend a lot of time dealing with paperwork. U.S. doctors spend almost an hour on average each day, and $83,000 a year\u2014four times their Canadian counterparts\u2014dealing with the paperwork of insurance companies. Their office staffs spend more than seven hours a day. [1] They also have to deal with the threat of lawsuits and malpractice insurance. Salaries continue to be a multiple of house-hold income, despite the changes in the way medicine is practiced. In 1973,the median annual physician income was $45,000, and the median US house-hold income was $10,512[2] In 2014 house-hold income was about $51,000[4] and doctor salaries were considerably higher: In 2012, physicians practicing primary care received total median annual compensation of $220,942 and physicians practicing in medical specialties received total median annual compensation of $396,233.[5] Of course it\u2019s worth mentioning that achieving these salaries requires a massive up-front investment in medical school that can result in significant debt, together with additional years of training in which the salaries can be well below this level. Salaries need to be forgone during the medical school years as well and may be well below those of other opportunities during the training years.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m essentially rehashing an earlier answer of mine to a very similar question. Ah, I see what your problem is. A evil witch has cast a spell on you. Confused? All right, I\u2019ll explain. You see this?  That\u2019s what has happened to you. You\u2019ve fallen for the oldest con in the history of storytelling. And that is\u2026  You believe in true love. I don\u2019t mean your romantic true love. I mean your academic true love. You think that out there, there\u2019s one body of knowledge that you are destined to make love to forever. It\u2019s just that there isn\u2019t. Most of the people I know who got into medical school alongside me were intelligent enough and social enough to excel at a whole range of professions. Many of them changed tracks too, after medical school. Some did an MBA and go into business. Some got a PhD and go into full-time research (like my mother). So it is not true that the course textbooks of one special profession are designed to spend one long night writhing in your arms in bed until the sheets are drenched in your sweat.Now, that was true in my case. But that was just that one time the power and water in the dorm were out all night, so I couldn\u2019t shower after swimming in an over-chlorinated swimming pool, so went to bed with my pathology textbook. Look, whether you will love medical school or not is not some magical chemistry thing. It\u2019s not about magic at all. It\u2019s about love. And it\u2019s about science. There are no two words more universally misunderstood than love and science. Nearly everyone thinks love and science are nouns. They\u2019re not. They\u2019re verbs. Science is a very specific series of actions we use to learn about something. Love is not a feeling. Infatuation is a feeling. Love is a series of actions. And if you put two and two together, you will get that the act of science is primarily an act of love. It involves watching inconspicuously from a corner, penning your observations down, then your thoughts, building, testing, failing, trying again, risking your reputation, and in the end, expanding your world. See? You can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m talking now about science or love. People often have it backwards, you know. They think that the feeling must come first, then the actions will follow. And that is true. But they don\u2019t realize the opposite is true as well. If you act like you care about something, and start doings the things you\u2019d do if you cared for it, you will find that, slowly but surely, you will begin to actually care for it. If you think your skill set matches, and you can afford the expenses, and you are granted entry, and you aren\u2019t infatuated with anything else, take it! Seize your \u2018Happily Ever After\u2019 like all those Disney stories. But remember that the end of something is always the beginning of something else. Happily Ever After is just the beginning. If you don\u2019t put in the kind of work every day that would make medical school love to have you, in the end, you won\u2019t love the experience of medical school. You can never fully know if you will love the experience beforehand. There is no easy way. After all, the experience of medical school tends to be so objectively different (city, country, climate, cost, classmates) and subjectively different (mindset, sociability, mental health, physical health) for each person. So asking various people what it will be like is only partially helpful. The only real way to know will be to actually do it. The irony is that in order to get the most accurate answer possible, you will have to render the answer useless. So many of us assume that a person and a thing cannot become over time someone or something else entirely. Why do we assume that? People and things can and do change. Over half the doctors I know tend to regret joining the profession. When I probe, it really comes down to this: the rewards promised to them never materialized. What rewards? Oh, you know, easy money, minimum effort, social respect and of course, let\u2019s not forget that last minor thing that sweetens every challenge: a hot girlfriend. You fell for that? \u201cBuy two medical degrees, get one hot girlfriend free\u201d? How old were you? 17? Oh,well, we know what that can be like. But you\u2019re no longer 17, right? Grow up. As you age, your priorities and your passions change. Things that appeared important to you when you were 17 don\u2019t when you\u2019re 27. 27-yr old you will wake up in the morning with everything 17-yr old you wanted, and still count himself wanting. The reasons why you wanted to be a doctor, will often not be the reasons why you will continue to remain one. People often write so much about happiness, from a psychological and sociological and anthropological standpoint, that I think the reason so many people are still confused is because they\u2019ve over-analyzed it. I think happiness is simpler than it seems. Mihaly Cziksentmihalyi, the author of FLOW, pinned down the traits to daily happiness: if the work is complex and challenging, relevant to reality, and varies from time to time, it will make you happy. I quote my shoes when I tell myself this at the start of each day: just do it. Give it all I\u2019ve got, intelligently. If I put in the smart-hard-work toward my profession, if I defend it\u2019s dignity, if I tell it what I really think, if I feed it my most original thoughts, if I will pay all these things toward my profession, each day, every day, then in the end, I will find, even though I\u2019m not keeping score, that my profession has paid me back.

            "answer_text": "Why some? Many doctors regret their career choice because many of them get into medicine without understanding everything that comes with a career in medicine. Some find out midway that they didn\u2019t sign up for what it demands. So the regret Some issues that students never considered when they entered medical school were (and I speak from an Indian perspective): 1. That medical education & training is a long and arduous journey. The reward is very far off and that not all reach the end of the tunnel to reap those rewards. There is a mismatch between their expectation and outcomes regarding their careers. Priorities can change in the time between a starry eyed 18 year old kid entering medical school and a 35 year old frustrated doctor. One of the popular jokes going around last year which though sounds funny but is unfortunately true. 12th Results are being released on May/june 2015. All those toppers who will begiving interviews that they are planning to enter medical field, this is your next 18 years: 2015 Feb - 12th Exam2015 May/june - 12th Results2015 July - Enter Medical College2016 August - I MBBS2018 Feb - II MBBS 2020 Feb - III or Final MBBS2020 March - Final MBBS Result2020 Apr to 2021 March -CRRI / Internship 2021 or 2022 - state Public Service Committion or MRB 2023 Feb or March - Posted in Primary Health Center2023 to 2026 - 3 Year Rural Service 2026 Feb - state PG2026 May to 2029 April - MD / MS 2030 June - DM / MCh Entrance 2030 August to 2033- August -DM MCh And When you are preparing for your final exam in 2033 May, you will be reading an interview by children born this year that entering Medical College is their dream. 2. That medical education has become very very expensive today, even for those who manage to get into medical school and residency through government subsidized undergraduate and post-graduate programs. The costs? Opportunity costs of 10+ years of nearly no income when compared to other STEM fieldsLiving costs and family commitments during medical school and residencyNo fair system to match qualified doctors to appropriate positions once they finish medical school or/and residencyIf someone spent the kind of money needed to get non-subsidized medical education, there\u2019s no ethical means to recover that corpus working in a salaried job.High stress environments where doctors work in affects their family life and also puts them at risk for addictive behavior and suicide.3. That compensation at the end of their residency will not match those in the same age group who went to other fields. Many doctors feel disillusioned when they actually enter the job market. They have constantly been told by their parents and relatives that once they have got into medicine, their life is set. No one has prepared them for the reality that not every doctor has fairy-tale stories of high salaries and lavish lifestyle. Doctors either need to be from an elite background or be extremely skilled at generating revenue for hospitals to really enjoy a rich lifestyle. The fact that one\u2019s skills or knowledge or even ethics is not readily converted to well paying jobs is heartbreaking for any conscientious doctor. 4. That there is a major mismatch between medical school slots and residency slots. There are 55,000 MBBS graduates passing out of medical schools in India every year while there are hardly about 5,000 government subsidized residency program slots among all specialities. Many are doing residencies in specialities they don\u2019t like because they didn\u2019t get what they wanted and didn\u2019t want to risk getting into the residency exam rigmarole again- a success rate of 2\u20133% to actually get a rank in the All India Entrance test. Career options for those who don\u2019t crack the residency entrances are very limited. I have spoken about it in detail here. Has the Indian medical system of Post graduation become a rat race? 5. That we are woefully short of mentors to guide the next generation of doctors. Typically the best training in India happens in government medical colleges- not necessarily because of brilliant teachers but because of the sheer number of patients in these hospitals.* The quality of teachers in medical colleges- both in government and private- has dropped drastically in the last couple of decades. This is due to indiscriminate increase in MBBS seats without any consideration for the quality of medical education provided. Hence the students and residents who graduate from such colleges are of lower quality than the previous generation. The rather insecure present faculty see their students as their competition and intentionally under-train them. So it takes the new doctors more time to get up to speed with the latest. Teaching and mentoring is never incentivised so no one makes a better effort. If you pay peanuts you will get monkeys. 6. That violence against doctors, vigilante justice and public shaming of doctors in news media/social media is becoming more common. The worst part is that in most cases it\u2019s not even the doctor\u2019s fault and many times the information given by the media is grossly wrong. While the irresponsible media can\u2019t take back their words in today\u2019s world of instant 24/7 news, the damage done to individual doctors\u2019 careers is irreversible. 7. That breakdown in the Patient-Doctor trust is increasingly becoming more of a problem. This breakdown has resulted in less respect for doctors among patients, colleagues and other allied health professionals. Higher litigation has resulted in more defensive medicine and less empathetic patient care. 8. That poor quality infrastructure, facilities and poor maintenance of existing infrastructure in government hospitals is blatantly visible. Yet the government still tries to force all medical students to serve compulsory rural postings. Why do Indian doctors refuse to work in villages? 9. That the red tape in government and bureaucracy will make sure that people who have never ever visited a government hospital for treatment nor have an elementary idea about healthcare will get to decide how hospitals will be run, what expenditures to make and who should be hired. When substandard equipment and medicines supplied by the government coupled with unrealistic surgery targets to be \u201ccost -effective\u201d results in adverse outcomes for patients, the doctors are made scapegoats, arrested and put behind bars. Botched surgeries land docs in jail ; 2014 Chhattisgarh sterilisation deaths *I can attest however that there are still some very good teachers left in private and government medical colleges. I was just speaking of the general trend. Personally speaking, this post is not representative of my own experience with medicine but one from seeing medicine from close quarters. The above points I mentioned is not a rant since I do not regret my choice to do medicine and haven\u2019t experienced disillusionment in medicine-YET! I probably beat many of the odds that I have mentioned in this post to reach where I am. Many others aren\u2019t as lucky and I can empathize with their plight. The following article has found resonance among many Indian doctors and many have agreed with it\u2019s message. Why I will never allow my child to become a Doctor in India ! The author, Dr. Roshan Radhakrishnan -an Anesthetist ends with this note: I have been conversing with a lot of doctors recently and the sound of disillusionment about the field has never been as loud as it is today. Even doctors of generations past and heads of departments acknowledge the shift, stating that they are happy that they are not starting off their careers in today\u2019s India. One line which many of them said and one which I also agree with entirely is the basis of this article \u2013 \u201cI will never allow my children to join this field.\u201d There is also an email sitting in my inbox asking me to sign and share a petition demanding that applications for licensed guns be fast tracked for doctors. I have read it and placed a \u2018star\u2019 across the mail. I do not intend to sign it because I don\u2019t advocate guns as a rule\u2026 I see children cry everyday when I bring an intravenous cannula near their tiny arms. I do not wish to have them worry about the gun in the doctor\u2019s pocket too. But I empathize with the sorrow of the doctors who made the petition. And I know one day, I too may find myself revisiting this petition should a calamity befall me. As it is, hospitals have started employing bouncers now. I would love to hear from doctors here as well. Even if you disagree with my thoughts entirely, I do not mind. I just want to see how far the disillusionment lies and whether the \u201cHippocrates Oath\u201d and \u201cselfless service\u201d tag are still as strong in your hearts today as it was the day you joined your medical college. Where do you think it is all going wrong in India? ",

            "answer_text": "Wow\u2026 thats a very good question and am so glad am getting a chance to speak my heart at this forum. We as doctors dont regret becoming doctors per say, but we regret the kind of life we lead because of our profession. To start with, by the time we graduate, our colleagues from other professions are already working and almost getting settled. Our struggle has just begun aftr our graduation bcoz the options aftr graduation are vry limited and esp wen u hav struggled thru ur graduation so mch, u dnt feel like going for smaller options. Aftr graduation comes the time when we start learning the practical approach of our profession. The theory and the practical world are vry vry difrent in medicine. It takes almost a year or two to get well versed with the application of all the fives year theory knowledge on your live patients. By the time all this is completed we are almost 25 to 27 yrs old. Normaly ppl like to get settled before getting married. But in our profession i dnt knw how many can say this. Either you get married late or give your burden along with your spouses burden to your parents again. And with the kind of culture we have, the second option implies to most of the cases. Aftr all this struggle it finally comes to your fate when you start with your private practice. If luck favors you, you flourish. But even that takes atleast 2 to 5 yrs smtims. Now the point here which appears in mind is that aftr struggling for 10\u201315 yrs what are we achieving. There are many better options available to achieve the same so called financial, mental or social success with much lesser struggle and most importantly mch less of time involved. These were the professional aspects. Now coming to the personal aspects. The one thing which i am sure ech and evry doctor will agree upon is that they dont hav a personal life at all. The wrk schedule is sch that we cannot attend any social gatherings be it birthday parties, weddings, anniversaries etc. Evn if v do luckily get an opportunity to attend, v r d last to rech once our consulting is over bcoz we cant afford to leave smone ill and attend sm hapy functions. People feel that we r behind money and thats y v dnt attend functions. But that is not true. It is vry difficult to leave smone suffering and go n njoy urself and dats one imp reasn y v chose to attend the sick rather then njoying ourself. Having said that, i would also like to say, that evn if v r staying to earn money what is the problem. V also hav a family to look aftr. Y r all the social gatherings done in d evening? Dat is bcoz ppl can finish off their work and attend the gathering. No one wants to miss on their work and no one will miss on their jobs and work to attend a social gathering until n unless sm vry close relative is involved. Our wrking schedule is sch that v hav to wrk late in d evenings wen evryones retrning frm their wrk so that v can attend them. If v start attending evening functions not nly will v suffer financialy, but the patient will suffer as well. Patients want a doctor who is available full time, but v end up paying a grt cost for it\u2026 Our phones are always ringing, be it home, clinic, school, office, between gatherings, movie theatres, day, night, and v r bound to answer them. Now most of ul can say that v can switch off or answer as per our convinience. But then ask youselves that if u call ur doctor in an emergency and if he doesnt answer ur call how will u feel. V think bout this and dats d nly reasn v answer all calls evn in d middle of the night. When i was single it was ok doing this, but today am married, i hav a yr old son who sleeps with me. When the phone rings in the night it not nly wakes me up but my small son as well. All these factors are nevr imagined by normal people, but am sure ech and every doctor must have gone thru dis at some point of their life. Last but not the least, its a very unthankful job which we do. We dont expect people thanking us for eveythng. We know its our job. But then there are people who are being thanked for the worst of works. And we as doctors inspite of few words of kindness get to hear how expensive our treatment is. But then they tend to forget dat it is that expensive treatment which makes u worth enjoying ur life or living your life in peace. Inspite of all these facts, i would still say that i love my profession, i dnt regret a bit\u2026. But then it comes with a great cost to me and my family and that is what i regret. I dnt regret being a doctor. I am always proud to b a doctor. But if somone will ask me what i want my son to b, i will never give an option of being a doctor. ",

            "answer_text": "I once went out for a lunch buffet with an Indian doctor in Tennessee. I went to discuss some business related to practice management software. As we began to have our lunch, an young intern of his joined us. It was a big buffet. So, we had time to talk. We discussed his practice, about ICD-9 to ICD-10 transition and his general state of affairs. He had been in business for more than a decade. So, he was quite well set. Coming from India, he talked about how he came to pursue this line of occupation rather than the Engineering line. It was not surprising considering that most of the Indians growing in the 80s and 90s mostly had the doctor (MBBS) or engineer (BTech) educations to choose from. However, as we began to talk about the money part of his business, I sensed that things were not going that well as he would have wanted or as much as he had expected when he chose this profession. It was not because he was losing customers or that there was competition. He talked about how the health insurance industry was making it hard for him to get paid. You see in the US, the healthcare insurance companies get into the act once a patient visits a doctor. They go through the due diligence procedures (Coding, billing, claims and whole 9 yards) before the doctors and hospitals would get paid. The doctor talked about how delayed payments were upsetting his small practice. He grumbled about how it was no longer lucrative to be in this line of occupation. What\u2019s more, he wouldn\u2019t encourage his own children to pursue it. I was surprised that he was that frank about it in front of his intern. I think the hard times were speaking, but what really amazed me was what the doctor did next at the lunch table. As the waiter placed one more plate of the Indian Naan on the table, the doctor quickly covered it in the paper napkin and swiftly / secretly pushed it in his suitcase.  I was sad to see that happen, but more sorry to see him do it in front of his intern. As I drove home after the lunch, I thought it was not this particular doctor\u2019s problem. It could more likely be the problem with the US industry as a whole which must have forced him to regret his career choice. Edit 1: After posting my answer and seeing some of the comments here, I think I need to explain a few things: The doctor clearly mentioned the problem with insurance regulations and how they were impacting his practice. That was the crux of his situation. It had nothing to do with his own personal motivation(s) to stay put or get out of this line of occupation. I have seen other answers where they have talked about how the industry is getting stifled by regulations which are beyond the control of a small practice.When I said \u201clucrative\u201d, I did not mean to say \u201chuge amount of money\u201d or \u201cinsanely large amounts of profit\u201d. There is no implication of \u201cgreed\u201d. The point is that when you take up a career, you research how stable you will be in that line. When you study to be a doctor, the general thinking is that you are going to be reasonably well-off. I think, in comparison with other career choices, a doctor\u2019s earnings should be fairly good enough for parents to send their children to a medical school.The example I gave of the naan could well be wrong. I could have been wrong in connecting the doctor\u2019s frustrations with pushing the naan into his suitcase. And hey, who is to say if the doctor just liked a naan to take home. And what\u2019s more (and everyone knows), how awesomely tasty naans are.",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Some Doctors do regret becoming a doctor. However, this statement is true for most professions. In each and every profession, there always will be people who regret becoming what they are. Having said this, the answer to WHY this happens is also multifactorial. A lot of people choose their profession based on the likes and dislikes of their parents, the glamour associated with the profession, peer pressure at the time of choosing a speciality etc etc.. Also, Medical profession is really a unique profession in the sense that it is much more demanding mentally and emotionally than generally recognized. This combined with absence of proper group practice norms in India, makes it even more difficult. Running a private practice (even moderately successful one ) demands 24 X 7 involvement. And by 24 X 7 , I mean 24 X 7 And if you have picked up this profession just to satisfy your dad / mom , then later on it becomes really frustrating. And I guess that is why a lot of doctors do not want their children to enter medicine. Also, the unchecked involvement of the Corporate Healthcare groups have reduced the sanctity of this profession. Personally, I feel this is the biggest factor leading to the disillusionment of a lot of doctors. Since Corporate hospitals are established to generate profit, this becomes the goal of practice of most of the corporate physicians. Although it is easy for some to get used to the corporate medicine ways, but a large majority of the doctors remain attached to the corporate hospitals mainly because of lack of opportunity. The only other thing for a lot of people is to go solo, which may not even be an option in certain specialities. However, becoming a doctor is in itself a fulfilling experience, and I doubt any other profession can match it. And yes, we do need a lot more good doctors in our country. I would not discourage my children from becoming doctors if they choose so. But yes, I will be honest with them regarding the drawbacks of this profession. ",

The first filter is having to take science courses in undergrad, be amongst the top of your class, and take the MCAT. This removes a large percentage of people that wish to become physicians. You follow that with four years of medical school, where there is a small but significant attrition rate. Follow that with 3\u20137 years of residency training from which people DO leave though in smaller numbers than in prior steps. And then you\u2019ve ARRIVED! You are an attending physician, respected by your peers, paid handsomely by the hospital, bringing value to society\u2026.and then you realize you have to fight insurance companies to obtain imaging, hospital administration to get new equipment, explain to your wife and kids that you\u2019re going to miss the birthday party AGAIN, your student loans and tax bracket mean you\u2019re going to be comfortable but not jet setting around the world, some unscrupulous people will try to sue you, you can\u2019t spend as much time as you would like with each patient because the finance department wants to see more \u201cvolume\u201d from you\u2026. It\u2019s not for everyone. For those that took the long journey and then left, I wish you the best of luck and there are some days that I envy you. ",

Saving lives is a strong draw, and every kid dreams of being that person who rescues others. Or maybe they don\u2019t, but I did. The full on sacrifice of an important decade of your life (your 20s) and the enormous debt (paid off by age 40) could be forgiven if medicine was what it SHOULD be. When you are smart enough to do anything in the world, and when you are an ultra conscientious high achiever, it is very very difficult to see your world controlled by people who are in every way intellectually and morally inferior. I know that sounds horribly arrogant, but if you have ever been bossed around and threatened by a bean counter who is obsessed with his own power, you will know exactly what I am talking about. Politicians who don\u2019t know what DNA stands for, who couldn\u2019t read a statistical analysis if their life depended on it, are controlling the entire system based on a lust for power, control, and money. Doctors are so intensely obligated to their work that they do not have the time or the emotional energy to fight back. The AMA folk are officious suck ups who kowtow to the powers that be. The credentialing organizations are unelected powerhouses with the authority to charge you mandatory fees and determine your right to practice. It is really getting ugly. And as for me, having had personal health problems, the job itself is very inflexible. There are few to no options for part time hours. ",

The administrator sets a goal for everyone to follow \u2013 and when something goes wrong, it is the doctors that are responsible for the malpractice. Basically you have 15, 20 minutes to see each patient and to document the case and you go to the next one. You cannot second-guess yourself \u2013 some doctors privately told me that they order a lot of tests to cover themselves. Then there are phone messages that you have to personally answer, or assigned to a nurse (your nurse) to return the calls. He also have to review the lab results, etc. They do not give you the time (an empty slot in the schedule) to do that \u2013 you do it between patients, or at the end of the day, or at lunch hour. For example as a doctor, the patient comes in with back pain \u2013 there could be so many things wrong. It could be something simple as muscle pain (from lifting improperly), to bladder infection/kidney infection, to other, much more serious conditions. While I understand that taking a good history (\u201chow did this happen - does it sting when you urinate - did you lift something heavy - does the pain go down the leg - do you see blood in the urine - etc. etc\u201d) may give you a clear clue about what this patient may have, there are tests that must be done to find out and basically to cover your ass - if you end up in court, that is. I am a nurse \u2013 at the end of the day, I am able to walk right out of the clinic and the doctors stay for another hour, or two, or more, to finish their work. Money doesn't mean much (although they do get a lot) but they have very little personal time to enjoy themselves. Some are better than others with time management \u2013 but that is another story. ",

            "answer_text": "Ya I regret but that is because of my faulty decisions and not because of medical field . Here is my story\u2026. 8th July 2010, The day I wish i could go back and change my decision, will tell about it later. May 2010, results of Class 10th board were declared, got CGPA 8.8 ( ours was first batch to face this all new grading system of CBSE ), and so whats next typical middle class society thinking - aapke bhai ne science leli and that too with Maths and Biology. Story doesnt end here, Life ki bakchodi abhi baaki hai mere dost :\u2019). Since I belong to a family where highest educated person is my father (8th paas), so u can imagine about my family education background. So after few days of class 11th people started talking about different coaching institutes for various entrance exams (AIEEE, IIT, AIPMT). I heard for the very first time in my life about AIPMT,IIT etc. So I asked one of my friend about it asked him what I should do ? He said since you have taken biology so its better to take AIPMT coaching, as I was new to all these things and did not have any exposure from family side, so blindly accepted the advice and took admission in one of the best AIPMT coaching institute and paid 102000 fees for 2 years course. 8th July 2010, the day when I took admission in coaching. After few months I realised that this field is not for me, but thought that it might be due to increased study pressure I am having such thoughts. Again in my 12th class I started having same thoughts of dislike for bio and likes for engineering and this time I was more confident about my insights, and this time my teachers and batchmates started telling me to opt for engineering as I would do good in this field and leave coaching for medical as it was not too late, also I was quite good in maths but I ignored it all. But deep inside I knew they were right and my likes for engineering and dislikes for medical started ballooning, but the same middle class mentality kept me from taking any decision as I already paid huge amount of fees for medical coaching. So whats next ? I started feeling guilty and that guilt kept on increasing, as I could not find someone to guide me at this point of time. Nov-Dec 2011 The application forms for various entrance exams were available, so just to reduce the guilt I filled AIEEE ( Engineering enterance ) form along with other medical exams form. Results of entrance exams (2012) AIPMT = Qualified but rank not good for admission AIIMS = Didnt qualified BHU = Qualified in pre, but didnt gave mains DPMT = Qualified and got seat in UCMS DU Now the most important result, AIEEE = Qualified with good rank and to the surprise my result was 2nd best in my school, among all who took engineering coachings. But at the end of the day it was of no use : ( Fast Forward Completed my MBBS, without any backs and supple ; ) Gave PG medical exam, got an average rank and took MD Pathology ( MAMC DU). Currently in 2nd year residency. And even till today for the last 10 years I am living with the same guilt, why I didnt chose engineering :( . But as it is said its never too late to start new , So i am doing something new which I will post soon. Learnings 1 = Always listen to your heart, it will always take you to the right place. 2= Never ever in your life hesitate to step back, its okay, its life, it might be pulling you backward just to give you a head start for your new journey. 3 = Do what you love, money doesnt matter at the end of the day. 4 = Talk to yourself what you wants to do and follow what your heart says. 5 = Never hesitate to ask someone for any help.

            "answer_text": "I know a lot of colleagues who profess that regret. Whether or not all of them really mean it is another thing. I do feel at least 3 of these colleagues mean it. But 2 of those individuals went into the profession due to family expectations, so that\u2019s unsurprising. Personally, I don\u2019t regret having become a doctor. But it just so happens that What I Thought I Was Getting Into and What I Actually Got Into fell pretty close to each other. So if I had to try to generalize the \u201caverage\u201d case of MD regret, it\u2019s probably about expectations vs. outcome: some expect more money in the profession, for example, or more prestige. Others expect it to be a constant procession of helping others, when the reality is only about 30% helping others and 70% figuring out that \u201chelp\u201d only goes so far. People can feel regret for a million reasons. I even know 1 person who told me he\u2019d never have chosen to be a doctor if he knew how little respect doctors get in society nowadays. Have to admit that sounded like a stupid reason to regret going into medicine\u2026 but that\u2019s just me. I don\u2019t feel like asking society to respect me more than the plumber just because he can\u2019t do an appendectomy. Considering how many times my parents break faucets in their house too, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if my family respected him more, actually. They definitely call him more than me! ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not neither a doctor nor planning to be one. But I would like to share my own story on this. It is common for some doctors to regret their career. I'm from Iran. Yep, a country which is under severe sanctions since 1979 revolution and the end of 2500 years of Persian monarchy. Medicine is a hot topic in Iran. The new generation of Iranians see it as a path to free money and lavish lifestyle. They see being a doctor as someone who has a lot of prestige and drives his Maserati in Tehran's upscale neighborhoods to pick-up some hot girls and go party with them all night. Guess what? As soon as the graduate from high school they have to take konkour which is the Iranian University Entrance Exam. Oh, all of a sudden after they fail it the 1st time they realize to get accepted in Konkour they need to study. So they start studying. Next year comes and they fail again. They see that they have no interest/chance in Medicine so they change their major to humanities and arts or business. They end up there. Some people pass the exam and go for medicine. After the 1st year they realize med school isn't for them and they drop out. They see it as a hard topic. But others keep going until they become a doctor after 7.5 years of studying. Then they are send to spend 1 to 3 years in a rural city to help fellow Iranians. It all adds up to 10.5 if you are lucky. Then after that they have to put their whole lives on their career. They have to be there 24/7 and help people. Trust me it is not an easy job. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a very complex question though seemingly simple enough. To answer it in a straight forward manner,\u201d Not some but majority doctors regret becoming one\u201d. So you now know \u201chow common\u201dtoo! Why? That needs a lot of elaborating. I am a surgeon admitted to medical school in 1984 ( not many private medical colleges then) so only merit mattered as far as getting admitted to a medical school was concerned . I was so happy and elated then,but for all the wrong reasons. I enjoyed the attention and praise I was getting from relatives and acquaintances. I used to enjoy the appreciative stares from unknown bypassers as I donned my apron and started for my med school everyday. I also enjoyed overhearing conversations where relatives would mention my parents that within less than a decade this boy would be driving a posh car and living in a deluxe house. I was almost a celebrity in my colony and my family as I was the first from both the circles to get admitted to a medical school. All wrong reasons as you can see and I can admit for getting into a medical school. After years of deliberations I can tell you it was for all wrong reasons that I chose this profession. Where was the empathy, the urge to save lives,the desire to alleviate the suffering of fellow humans ? Not taken into consideration to be honest. Frankly speaking I wasn\u2019t alone. Every student getting admitted to med school has these factors into consideration. Now getting back to the point, as a doctor or surgeon you have to take decisions. Decisions which literally make a life and death difference . What factors do I consider in those crucial decision making seconds. Is it worth taking this risk? Are the relatives hostile? What are the eventualities that this decision might boomerang (though that being the clinically correct decision). How much will I be paid for this particular adventure considering what is at stake? While doing so the helpless man on the bed gets lesser marks than a rouge/ bully relative of his. I hope you get the point. Most of us in this profession are there basically for wrong reasons. But we are intelligent enough and in some cases manipulative enough to blame the society for all the bads. You must be hearing a lot about doctors not getting enough PPEs while treating Covid patients. Have you ever, in last 70 or so years heard a soldier complaining about going to the frontline without a bulletproof vest? No, because he is driven enough and motivated enough to fight for his motherland. Unless we have people with same desire and determination entering medical field there are going to be regrets!! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I am a doctor (MBBS, UK) who regretted his career choice. I always wanted to be a scientist/engineer/inventor, and was persuaded when I was young that medicine is a good route to being a scientist. Medicine in the UK is a very vocational degree, and a doctor\u2019s job is very, very hard, and very, very long hours - not leaving me a lot of time for science/fun. After 6 years of medical school and 3.5 years of working as a doctor, I quit clinical medicine and moved to a full-time PhD. In retrospect, I wish I had studied engineering or chemistry, because the job market would be a lot more interesting and varied for me (and pay better!) with those degrees. Also, I might have done one of those degree first, whilst I matured enough to consider medicine more carefully. Also, I would be more scientifically/mathematically knowledgeable/skilled if I had studied a \u2018pure\u2019 science first, rather than studying medicine so young. Medicine is also tough psychologically. Mainly because the demands of the profession, and of patients/society, on doctors are constantly increasing, but (in the UK), there are fewer doctors, and pay is stagnant. Medicine is a career where you are expected to make NO mistakes, which is humanly impossible, and the toll of that is great on doctors\u2019 mental health. Politicians do not respect doctors; neither do the media. The public, thankfully, still trust and appreciate doctors, but that relationship is constantly tested by changing relationships with money/internet self-diagnosis/social media. I still love the NHS and do anything I can to support it with my time. But it\u2019s a tough, tough job - only really for those who love it! \u2014 Cheers! Tom \u2014 ",

Some of my other friends (non medical students) already graduated from college and are working in nice jobs, some are married, some are married and with children\u2026, living a pretty normal life for people my age (well maybe not the children\u2026.), and here I am doing my internships in an hospital, at 3am, after a crazy day thinking \u201cWhat am I doing here!?\u201d.

It\u2019s a long series of decisions. I almost burnt out as early as Internship. 36 hour shifts can push your tolerance for work. So I decided to pursue Pathology. I love it so far! Pathology turned out to be surprisingly interesting, and while you can get quite busy, you are the master of your own time. No need for late night trips to the ER, no early morning rounds. There are many choices to fit your lifestyle and interests in Medicine. Like office work? Take up hospital administration or work for an HMO. Some clinical specialties offer this as well, including Rehab Med, Radiology, and Developmental Pedia. Like to write? Be an editor or contibutor to health related publications. Want to teach? Research? There\u2019s something for you. Even in Law enforcement (Forensic Pathology). And if, at any point in your career, you are still not happy, just go do another fellowship. Or do an MBA. Or take up Law. Because of this, I believe people who regret all their lives that they took up Medicine are not very common. ",

So - do some doctors regret their choice? Yes. I don\u2019t. People choose to be a doctor for many different reasons - intellectual challenge (House), money (not a good reason on its own but here in the UK doctors do reasonably well financially - if money is your sole reason, there are lots of better choices), flexibility over the duration of a career, wanting to \u201chelp\u201d people (research has been done on why doctors and nurses feel the need to \u201chelp\u201d) and many other individual reasons, I\u2019m sure. The population as a whole still rates doctors as the profession they trust most - but remember that compared to politicians and bankers they may feel the competition isn\u2019t too strong. However, in the UK, a doctor is the most prolific serial killer ever (Harold Shipman) so please trust only when indicated. I am incredibly lucky - I can genuinely try to improve people\u2019s lives. Sometimes I achieve this. Sometimes I don\u2019t. But I know that every day in my working life will be interesting, challenging and different from every single other day in my occupational existence. So I don\u2019t think I will ever regret the decision. This answer is not a substitute for professional medical advice. ",

Languages, designs, art, music, sports\u2026 And I managed to do some of those during my crazy schedule at the college and hospital. I took French course. I made sketches of landscape n faces at night until early in the morning. I watched football games that started at 2 am, that caused me missed my first and second hour of lecture a few times. I even switched one of my intern slots with a friend to attend a singing competition ( I was also playing the guitar while singing, haha..). I mean, I don't want to lose my real life just because I have a degree to catch. I never intended to get the highest score, but of course I had my target. Finishing it the fastest that I could. And yeah, I was one of the fastest 6 graduates of my batch. The point is, I am the master of myself. I set my bar, I made my choices, I did my strategies. Which subjects I will put my attention more on. How to get along well with people surround you. What time to study, when to rest and have fun. I do want to have a balance life. The same thing happened when I got my acceptance letter to continue my study, just a few days before my wedding. I really had to bite my lips so hard and go with my decision. Now I am raising my daughters. They are 11 and 12. Never missed any single of their important moments. Literally spending my whole day with them. I am not active at a clinic or hospital, but I got plenty of family and friends who calls me to consult, and I'm doing my doctor job pro bono. Do I regret being a doctor? Never. Once you are a doctor, forever you are a doctor. I am planning to continue my study and back to the field in six years. When both of my daughters go to college, when they won't need me that much at home. I am happy with my life. And hopefully making others happy, too with the path that I chose. ",

I just want to add another examples for \u201cregret becoming doctors\u201d I hope this is a topic about Medical Doctor. In Vietnam, which is where i live, many students compete each other harshly to get a high score in the National High School Exam. The results will be used to evaluate and choose outstanding students to the Med school. Many of them though after 6 years of study( in Vietnam, students apply to Med school directly from High school through a National test that was mentioned above) that they will have nearly everything: respect from their families and relatives, high salary, an important position in society, etc. However, the Med school, like anywhere else in the world, has a very stressful study schedule. Vietnamese Med students have to learn 9 modules in one semester, do some internship duties in the hospital at midnight, then go back to school in the morning for lectures, and have tests of modules at the end of the modules. Also after graduated, they have to study 2-3 years more in order to get a Medical Qualification for paticipating in a position as a real physician. Although a long and hard time of study, the salary isn't the same like in developed nations. They are not well-paid, and Doctors have to diagnose nearly 200 patients in public hospitals. They are also hit violently by patients who do not feel \u201cwelcome\u201d and some punks or jerks. Many students or even experienced physicians want to quit the job and move to another field. They don't feel secured and have good income when they just graduated. And that's why doctors in my country regret for what they\u2019ve chosen. ",

            "answer_text": "there are many reasons one can regret career decisions, and in my impression this can be distilled to the situation being regrettable. some at random: - prolonged high stress situations with unnecessary additional stress added by greedy politicians, patients, and third party payers. Too few non monetary rewards, such as time off, evenings off, minutes to think, minutes to enjoy time with relatives, minutes to yourself, minutes in the grocery store unrecognized. Too few vacations. Too many administrators asking for too many patients for employed slaves. Who wants money if there is no time to spend it. The real problem is our culture of complaint - a culture with the philosophy of \u201ccritical theory\u201d cooked in, where political correctness has stifled the simple humor if simple souls sharing a problem to convert horror into joy. Instead we expect the powerful to solve everything and accept no responsibility ourselves, infantilized by our political parties. Physicians have the rare privilege of watching people they care about slowly destroy themselves. Physicians get to watch patients blame everything but themselves without lifting a finger to prevent the avoidable. In combat, soldiers see their comrades die painfully, but never does a soldier watch his ally leave cover and grab a bag of potato chips to stroll through a mine field. Through this field of bodies and severed limbs lies a ray of hope. I live between the lines of the page hoping for my next fix. A hopeless case at the last minute turns. I live a day longer. ",

The job that I joined to do, trained to do, hugely enjoyed doing and which will always need doing - interacting with, examining, advising, treating and caring for those who are or who believe themselves to be ill and especially having regard to the physical, psychological and social dimensions of a patient's presentation - is great. The problems arise from the interference of others - especially politicians - who have little or no knowledge of the realities of medicine, are burdened with prejudices and are pursuing agendas alien to caring. The commercialisation of care is particularly malign for a variety of reasons. The intrusion of industrial style management is actively harmful to patients. A medical career, when taken as a vocation rather than as a route to riches, is more a state of mind and mode of living than a job. It has high and low points but is socially useful and constructive. Burnout is fairly common as is disillusionment when ones proper role is corrupted by external forces. Being a doctor when you do not have the vocation could be a special kind of purgatory. ",

Yep, I said it.My father is a doctor, and so was my grandfather.My grandfather was the best doctor in the town, and it was in that era maybe, that doctors used to get the respect they deserve.So did my Dad. He has been the finest doctor of the place I grew up in, and there's hardly anyone who took treatment from him as a kid, and doesn't remember him. As soon as I got in. I have been tangled in the issues of limited seats, reservations, undeserving students getting privileges, corruption and paid seats, patients treating doctors as shit, awful laws and bonds by government to spend life in rural areas without any facility or security on meager salary, and cut throat competition to get into master's after completing graduation, where again you face reservation, and rich brats. It's demoralizing. And the examination pattern is bizzare whose pattern changes every year. Like it's some kind of joke. It's a joke to become a doctor in India. I won't let that happen to my kid.My dad sees me and thinks the same. I can understand his plight. I hope history doesn't repeat itself. Edit/Disclaimer : It has been pointed out by a gentleman that my answer is coming out more as a demotivation for people who want to pursue a career in medicine.I'm sorry, if it did. I, by no means, wish people to not take up medicine. We are in real need of good doctors in our country. My anger is not towards the subject, or the profession. I love my job. My frustration is towards the system, which has created nuisance. But, as rightly pointed out by that guy, nuisance and absurdity prevails everywhere.:) ",

When I mentioned this in a room full of junior doctors the reaction couldn\u2019t have been more negative if I\u2019d said I\u2019d let him try hard drugs. They were all - perhaps 6 of them - unanimously appalled to an extent that surprised me. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the overwhelming majority of junior doctors I meet in the UK regret their decision to study medicine to a greater or lesser extent. I\u2019m happier than average. I\u2019m going to stop here and state that this is within the UK. In other countries things may be different. For example, from the USA I read a lot about the trials and tribulations of dealing with insurance companies which is one thing that we thankfully don\u2019t have to deal with here. In New Zealand, doctors have greater medicolegal protection from the consequences of medical errors. I\u2019m presuming you\u2019re asking the question for a purpose - perhaps to decide whether or not to study medicine? What it means to be a doctor clearly differs from one country to another. I think it\u2019s also going to change greatly in the future, as information technology changes the way we work. ",

            "answer_text": "I am actually writing a paper on this topic! A common occurrence within doctors is something called physician burnout. Typically, some of the symptoms involve exhaustion, cynicism, and the general sense that what they are doing doesn\u2019t matter. One major cause of this are bureaucratic tasks and the intricate record keeping that comes with it. This can make physicians feel more like paper pushers than doctors, which can be incredibly frustrating, especially considering the intensive training they underwent. Another cause is simply specialty. Some specialties are a lot more physically and emotionally demanding of the physicians. For example, consider being a neurosurgeon, where a slight movement could cause crippling damage versus specializing in public health/preventative medicine where they might focus on developing legislation over clinical care. Another contributing factor is their home lives. Physicians that have work-home conflicts are highly likely to experience burnout, as well as physicians with high amounts of debt, no children, or no significant other. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "\"I have no interest in medicine\".. that says it all my friend.. a sure fire way to regret choosing medicine at a later stage of your life.. you may have heard how tough and difficult it is to become a doctor.. right from getting a good rank in aipmt or the state medical entrance exam to passing every subject in the mbbs curriculum which can make all your 12th look like a library reading session.. The pressure that one faces at every year will be really huge.. and at the end of it all there is one year of gruelling internship which will shake your very core.. extreme poverty and illness and you will realise that sometimes you can do very little to save them.. and after that comes the biggest hurdle you will face.. post graduate entrance exams.. studying all the subjects again and remembering every small detail in them..finally more often than not you will do a course you end up with rather than your own choice.. and after all this you face the real world.. I don't have to say how difficult that is..  So a doctor knows how difficult it is to become one.. now comes the most important thing that matters.. perspective.. what do you want in life.. what do you consider as happiness and satisfaction.. that differs in every individual.. some doctors don't want their kids to undergo the same difficulties but whereas there are plenty who feel it's worth it and their kids can make it..  Being a doctor there are some moments which you simply cannot gain in any other profession like witnessing child birth, looking at the smile and gratitude of a person who walks cos u saved his life or limb and the respect of society in general (even in current times).. all this and u get paid for it too:-) know that there are pluses and minuses in every profession.. what makes u the see pluses and ignore the minuses is your own attitude and interest.. that's what I call perspective.. so if u have that go for medicine.. if not and instead u have a fixed idea of say earning plenty of money or command lots of respect (mind you it can still come) then u will end up regretting ur choice..

            "answer_text": "This is not my personal story but of the professors where I received my undergraduate degree. My pathophysiology was an M.D. who went to Oxford. He did nothing but spend a year studying for his MCAT. He got a perfect score and went to medical school. Now he\u2019s just an associate professor and plays golf on his free time while his wife is a director of a local hospital. My A&P professor was a Vet and her husband owned a lab. He donated all his equipment to the university to become a microbiology professor. My biochemistry professor got tired of researching the same protein for two years so he decided to go into teaching. My cell biology professor, in her early 30\u2019s has three PhD\u2019s, and it\u2019s also her first mortgage. I would think 100\u2019s of time before going into medicine because of the time, money, physical, and mental investment to this profession. You\u2019ll also lose much of your youth, then later time for your family. When I was a medical interpreter, I asked an ER doctor how many hours he work a day. He said, \u201cI do 48 hour shifts.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the article you cited answers your question.  The poll surveyed 24,216 doctors and health care professionals in 25 medical specialties and found that declining pay and high levels of student loan debt have doctors increasingly dissatisfied with their professions. Substantial pay gaps between areas of medicine also have doctors upset, while male physicians are paid 40 percent more than females across all specialities.  The ones thinking about retirement don't know if the money will be there for them because of declining revenue fears and investment losses over the past few years. They fear that the government and insurers will increasingly tell them how to practice. Younger doctors are afraid that they won't be able to pay off medical school debt as fast as they expected.  In a sentiment expressed by many of the 3200 physicians who commented on our survey, one doctor said, \"ACO arrangements are a conflict of interest. Administrators, not physicians, will decide what's allowed. It would also spell the end of solo or small group practices.\"  \"More and more, physicians feel that someone is telling them how to treat patients,\" said Bohannon. \"They worry that the guidelines are promulgated to reduce overall costs rather than put patients first. Doctors feel that they have to give up more autonomy and they resent being told how to exercise their medical judgment.\"   \"Too many doctors have little idea or time to devote to the cost of care,\" said Aburmishan. \"They often don't do their own billing or collections so they don't know what each insurer pays. They are so busy with paperwork and seeing more patients that they don't devote much time to overall cost issues.\"   Bohannon agrees. \"As medicine moves more and more to an employed model, most physicians feel that their responsibility is to treat the patient's clinical problem. The cost issue is secondary. Most doctors don't believe that it's their job to focus on that.\" ",

            "answer_text": "In mainland of china\uff0cmost of my classmates regret  their choice of studying medical.we need 11 years to get our doctor degree,form bachelor,master then doctor.But what we learn during our studying is doing experiments,writing articles,we have little free and time to learn how to cure a patient. Medical resources are uneven distributed. It is hard for us to find a job. Even if we are luckily enough to enter into a big hospital,we will not become economic independence in 4-6 years.The Physician-patient social contradiction is big. Every day,one  needs to see more than 100 out-patients,with low registration fee about 1.5 RMB(about 0.25 dollar) to 15 RMB(3 dollar). But the price of drugs are high,which exacerbates the Physician-patient contradiction.whereas the price of drugs are made by the government.There was a report in The Lancet \uff1aChinese doctors are under threat http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)61315-3/fulltext ",

            "answer_text": "Personally I do not regret it but medicine has changed since I graduated from medical school. I went to MIT with the purpose of going to medical school and becoming an orthopedic surgeon. When I practiced patients were generally thankful and there was a good doctor patient relationship. Now we have networks which are steeply discounted, bureaucracy, and limits to what test and medications we can prescribe (or endless paperwork). I advised my children not to go in (both of their parents are physicians). Both went in CS/EE at MIT and are making more that an average physician. I agree that we do need physicians and more of them, however if the student does not have the drive I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. ",

            "answer_text": "The statistics are there; the incidence of stress among doctors is nearly 28% compared to 18% in other professions. Various surveys had indicated that 30\u201350% of doctors in various parts of the world regret the choice of their career. And it seems the icidence is almost the same irrespective where you are in the World. I expect the percentage will be even higher in the future. The factors can be summarised in the following: Financial pressure: doctors take more time to graduate, further years of training after they fully qualify they usually have high level of dept.Family/social pressure: doctors work long hours and always have to juggle their commitments around. Trying to achieve work-life balance is exteremly challenging.Career (Professional) pressure: finishing medical school doesnot mean finish to studying and exams. In doctors life it means adding clinical work to studying/exams along with the other responsibilities.Regulations & litigations: practicing medicine is getting extremely complex with various regulatory mechanisms which at times hinder doctors from providing the care. Along with the increased litigation, incresed percentage of doctors practice defensive medicine.Erosion to medical professionalism: Medicine is enterprise of trust. The combination of the above factors and others eroded doctor-patient relationship, a siginificant percentage are finding it very difficult to fully empathise withtheir patients when they have significant levels of stress.",

Sounds like a perfect scenario. Except my husband is a very talented man. He wanted to be a computer scientist.But it was unpopular in his country so he became a doctor but if he proceeded, he would've created an app by the age of 20 and 15 years later he would be travelling the world and getting steady profits from his invention stress free. Currently, his jib is very stressful and oftentimes patients are ungrateful and outright rude. On top of that, you have to deal with government billing, which is very complicated because government prefers to pay you less and you have to prove why you should be paid more. ",

He makes a very good living earning over $400,000 a year, but finds his job incredibly boring as he just puts the patient to sleep, then just monitors the patient while the surgeon does the operation. And 99% of operations go fine at least as far as anaesthesia is concerned. So really all he does is sit there with nothing to do except glance at a monitor every now and then, but mostly I gather the monitor will sound a warning if the patients vital signs deteriorate. He does a lot of serious long operations where he almost dies of boredom. ",

There is an expectation that you go the extra mile (stay late, see extras, cover others who are off sick etc) - & this is not compensated at all. I was fine with that except employers take it for granted & use it to cover the gaps caused by underfunding. Politicians endlessly talk up expectation & don\u2019t resource it & are quick to try and blame health care workers for shortcomings in the service. Everyone should see their GP within 48 hours & faster if urgent they say - I am fine with that if they resource it but they don\u2019t. They seem to spend their time finding ways to increase workload & telling us to work smarter & use \u201cslack in the system\u201d. I have often wondered how it was safe to keep going on next to no sleep while \u201con call\u201d (ie working as normal in out of hours time) & being expected to perform at full pace the next day. Oh well I am retired now, have fond memories of most patients - but no time for my previous employers. ",

They are killed if they cannot treat a person but not even thanked if they save a life . The other reason is that you have to strive hard to become a doc . When you are in grade11 and 12 , you have to study hard ( day and night ) to score in the exams .When you start your college , you have to attend all the classes (if you don't ,you won't understand the whole concept ) ,therefore , you have to strive hard in your college days .When you start working ,you will have to work day and night .You spend your whole life with no fun if you become a doc and at last ,people kill you if you could not save a life which has half of its life gone . I would say that if you are willing to strive hard before and after becoming a doc and if you will be devoted to your job forever , last but not the least , if you prefer becoming a doc than fun , you can become a doc . All the best for being successful . ",

Last year i was invited to an emergency medicine meeting by a friend of mine who heads emergency unit (ambulances & fire-engines) of a private company & when we were queuing for lunch, a medic behind me asked his friend whether really healthcare was at it's best, the friend (whom i later got to know was a pediatrician) responded '' i don't care, what i need is money''. When the meeting was over i was told later by my friend that most medics attended the meeting, not to deliberate on how emergency medicine can be made effective to the public but coz there was sitting allowances.

Direct care, retaining autonomy and cutting out insurers, is a great way to minimize the heartache, but if you've noticed, the general political speech these days is in exactly the opposite direction in the US. We may all wind up being disgruntled employees (well, not me, necessarily, since I've reached 65 years of age).Anybody who's delivered a baby, or performed any of a million other life-affirming tasks, though, has to be an optimist at some level. We may dislike some of our patients. We certainly find it easy to disagree with insurers and administrators. But few of us give up on medicine itself. We sometimes just need reminding, and a little reason for hope. ",

But the main reasons are less Money paid for putting in HardWork, Sacrificing Family time, friends, personal space and Sheer Stress associated with this profession. In the end all doctors are human beings too . They too have some emotions. Doctors too have little dreams of spending time with their family, children, travel and enjoy their lives but it gets really hard when all of these gets snatched right in front of your eyes but doctors don't have a single complaint as for them Patients health and safety is Foremost priority and everything comes next. It's common in developing countries like India because of the pressure, harsh working environments, less pay and nowadays manhandling has become a recent part of it. A doctors profession is a DIVINE GIFT.. it's bestowed on you through your HardWork, Dedication but at the same time you have to Sacrifice the most valuable things in your life..Time, Family and Friends!

They spend their entire youth, parents' money + hopes and their own health to be qualified as doctors. By the time they start searching for a job, their colleagues in other professions are settled and raising their families. Beginning of their carrier and beginning of family-life run parallel and competing with each other. If this was not enough, low paying and highly stressful working conditions shatter all the dreams. Doctors caring for others health, work in unhealthy conditions. Fear of litigation, business pressures, government regulations and some ungrateful patients; all make life painful. In India, even patients assault doctors at times and police cannot protect. Passion of serving the sick and saving life is the only motivator against so many denominators. Very few lucky ones get good working conditions and all the doctors are not very rich.  For most, it is point of no return. In developing countries, there are hardly any options for a middle aged person. Is it sufficient answer to your question? ",

Instead we encounter patients who are demanding, rude, non-compliant and resist our efforts to help them. Most of all, we regret that we are not able to help every patient that comes to us -many get worse instead of better, and eventually, they all die. But- knowing that we are a select few who have been lucky enough to practice a profession dedicated to treating the sick, relieving pain, and comforting the dying, makes the sacrifices worthwhile. And for that we have no regret. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this question I would like to recall a research \" severity of stress in Pakistani medical student\" by Haider Ghazanfar and et. all and the result is quiet surprising where around 14% of the respondent wished to quit their medical study and even the incidence of stress in various category is surprisingly high. The result is somewhat similar in similar research. So it's really hard and needs metal preparedness and proper counselling during the medical study. Anxiety disorders . Panic attacks , insomnia etc are quite common during the exam hour . And so it's really hectic during the medical students' life . Many become addicted to drugs, Marijuana, alcohol or smoking cigarette during their medical life. The answer to question lies . It's quiet common thought among medical student and it varies accordingly to their timeframe of their life. Busy study hours , dedications, no free time to hangout with friends and even family, lesser personal time for the family , burden of work and study matter , exams and longer duration of study are the frustrating points for medical students when their contemporary pals are enjoying their life. But, but, but Once after the medical students' life is gone , it's the professional life that adds colors to life once again. Higher level of reputation compared to the same level of earning, seminars, medical society, pretty good salary, and of course the degree that's get paid higher social status lures youngster for pursuing medical career. Never to forget the attachment of patient care and wish for the social works and volunteerism cannot be skipped off. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are naturally good at Organic Chemistry and need not to recite then medical science is right for you. Like I say how to convert Phenol to Acetylsalicylic acid easily.  I read Organic Chemistry 15 years ago. That benzene ring remain inside the head, knocking the hydrogen from -OH and adding the side chain plus one carboxyl group works fine. Second step involves Kolbe Schmitt reaction. We remember Anatomy in that way like remembering the street maps. None needs a GPS navigation to go towards own house from grocery market.  That bland biology has less to do with Medical Science's subjects. You need really good in calculus, trigonometry, physics etc. Because these are towards higher math. Diagnosis and surgical pre-op planing is higher math.   Why so many doctors regret their choice of profession? Human has the bad habit of blaming & cursing. Most expect that money will fall automatically from the sky, none will disturb, all will be uneventful.  Indian Engineers, specially the S/W engineers also curse on Quora.  It is true that patients becoming angry towards the doctors, but behind that anger there are valid reasons. Most importantly, those blaming doctors never mention the advantages of near free treatment of own and the family members.  Reading is huge in Law too, work is abnormally higher in Law.   ",

            "answer_text": "Yes some doctors regret their choice of profession and there are various reasons for this. Quite commonly, some doctors chose medicine over their passions for other subjects-these doctors will always regret coming into medicine. Some folks were too young when they chose to commit to medicine only to realise later in life its not really what they want to do. Where you practise medicine and your choice of specialty can also lead to regrets. For me, its all about perspectives. Medicine is not a perfect career but there is enough for everyone if you make your choice carefully. I am extremely grateful for the opportunities Ive enjoyed as a result of becoming a doctor. ",

I do not regret being a doctor because if you want to serve people and make them get rid of their illness then you never regret being a doctor. Still what have been observed and said by Dr. Richa Shukla is absolutely correct and to the point because at certain point of time you get frustrated and you become sick of the system where reservations and paid seats and donations have so much influence in this era.There are instances where an mbbs seat costs upto 70-80 lacs in a private medical college where there is inadequate staff and lack of patient exposure. Still they demand such a huge amount only so that you can get MBBS degree.. Dats it.This is the pity condition of the medical field in india and MCI being the highest authority is just dummy and for namesake. Hope this changes really soon orelse there will no takers for medical profession in near future. ",

At a time when their peers are settling in their respective careers, they are consumed in thick medical books, preparing for their grueling exams. When their peers are going the family way, they are busy working the 18-hour shift. And when their peers are cheerily talking about their retirement plans, they are still finding their ground in their profession. Despite all the hurdles, the medical profession is still considered as the noblest profession by the young generation, parents of the medical doctors and the people. Government is taking several measures to address all the issues. The numbers of seats in various medical schools are being increased and many new medical colleges are also being planned to set up.
