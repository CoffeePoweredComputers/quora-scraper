            "answer_text": "Small business owners and managers make decisions on a daily basis, addressing everything from day-to-day operational issues to long-range strategic planning. The decision-making process of a manager can be broken down into six distinct steps. Although each step can be examined at length, managers often run through all of the steps quickly when making decisions. Understanding the process of managerial decision-making can improve your decision-making effectiveness. Identify Problems / Requirement / Change/OpportunityThe first step in the process is to recognize that there is a decision to be made. Decisions are not made arbitrarily; they result from an attempt to address a specific problem, need or opportunity. A supervisor in a retail shop may realize that he has too many employees on the floor compared with the day's current sales volume, for example, requiring him to make a decision to keep costs under control. Seek Information / Basic GroundworkManagers seek out a range of information to clarify their options once they have identified an issue that requires a decision. Managers may seek to determine potential causes of a problem, the people and processes involved in the issue and any constraints placed on the decision-making process. Brainstorm Solutions / Discussions / Meeting with expertsHaving a more complete understanding of the issue at hand, managers move on to make a list of potential solutions. This step can involve anything from a few seconds of though to a few months or more of formal collaborative planning, depending on the nature of the decision. Choose an AlternativeManagers weigh the pros and cons of each potential solution, seek additional information if needed and select the option they feel has the best chance of success at the least cost. Consider seeking outside advice if you have gone through all the previous steps on your own; asking for a second opinion can provide a new perspective on the problem and your potential solutions. Implementing Decision /Change processThere is no time to second guess yourself when you put your decision into action. Once you have committed to putting a specific solution in place, get all of your employees on board and put the decision into action with conviction. That is not to say that a managerial decision cannot change after it has been enacted; savvy managers put monitoring systems in place to evaluate the outcomes of their decisions. Evaluate OutcomesEven the most experienced business owners can learn from their mistakes. Always monitor the results of strategic decisions you make as a small business owner; be ready to adapt your plan as necessary, or to switch to another potential solution if your chosen solution does not work out the way you expected.

            "answer_text": "Broadly, the manager is trying to consider Business Analysis, Strategy, Team & Operations Resources, and caliber of Communications & Management to go ahead with a decision or not. Business analysis speaks to a financial ROI that they get more out of it (than sunk in) and so can see value, and it outweighs risk or future costs. Strategy has to do with market position and differentiation, and much MBA-level strategy focused on this. Team & Ops is about who\u2019ll plan to execute and then actually execute the thing. Comms (as it relates to Ops) is about the amount managerial effort demanded to see it through to completion. Specifically, Managers in different areas and in companies with specific Business Processes will have set frameworks they use- DMAIC, or a ton of other standard or custom creates processes. Also, it\u2019s obvious a Sales Managers is concerned with different things than a Engineering Manager than a Operations Manager, etc. So they tend to focus on certain areas of the above heuristic (often to the flaw of other areas\u2026 EX: Engineers always want more time and money and perfect data, Sales managers tend to shortterm sales even it sacs longterm sales or means pre-selling an unfinished product, Ops may become obsessed with a certain KPI like labor utilization or safety compliance and become too fixed minded and efficiency concerned while ignorance Change and Competitiveness, etc). Modern managers also face a velocity VS quality problem. Managers have to make many decisions, and so one of their outputs is decisions, and so having high velocity of decision making is generally good. On the other hand, the info/expertise demands of managers (and especially executives) is now VERY high, and they simply cannot know everything. Add in the info of modern Business Intelligence tools (which tend to make quantifiable decisions better) and you have a very demanding decision landscape. How much resources/effort, risk tolerance, and speed you want to sink in is up to you. You\u2019re trying add the data-driven crunch and best practices empiricism for decisions with more impactful scope while also being efficient enough that you \u201cdon\u2019t use a cannon to kill a butterfly\u201d. In Summary: Generally, managerial decision making tends to include elements of Business Analysis, Competitive Strategy, Operations, and thier own Managerial Communications requiredSpecifically, different types of managers (Sales vs Engineering vs Ops etc) and different company will have specific Business Processes they use for decision makingModern managers face a unique expertise issue o balancing breadth and depth of knowledge expertise alongside also efficiency concerns as they mix human and BI decision making for an ever wider range of functions",

            "answer_text": "There are as many management processes as there are managers and schools of thought, but there are guidelines to develop a decision making process, or for that matter, a management cycle. I personally prefer the following: -Organisation -Planning -Development -Execution -Evaluation This five steps can get you through any problem you encounter if you do them orderly and carefully about every single detail you stumble upon. Organise your resources and your problem at hand: What do you have to do against what resources you have to get it done. Plan your actions accordingly: What are the best and worst courses of actions? What are the foreseeable possible outcomes? What tools do you plan to use to address contingency? Develop a solid course of action, integrating you, your staff and your resources. Address every aspect of the job and course a viable timeline to accomplish your goal in correspondence to the plan you chose that is the best suited one from the previous phase. Execute that course of action. Write down and report every single occurrence and incident of the process and work accordingly to your plan. Evaluate the results obtained, the good the bad and the ugly. Develop tools for improving on weaknesses you might have encountered or even make them disappear, strengthen your already strong points. Consider alternatives, different courses of action for future cycles, compare your outcomes with those of other people from similar backgrounds and with those of different problematics that could make a valuable contribution to your system. Iterate. Rinse and repeat. Needless to say, each and every phase is critical of you are to accomplish a goal you have set for yourself. You can make adjustments, sure, you can always incorporate a couple or more steps, or abbreviate some into a giant process. Whatever method you use to accomplish your goals in a smart way, leading to the best quality possible in the least amount of time will be the best way to go, but don't forget, every process is improveable.

            "answer_text": "The business decision making process has three phases, according to Nobel prize winner Herbert Simon: Prospecting: Analyzing the problem.Conception: Creating solutions.Decision: Choosing one of the solutions.Simon considers that the rational aspect is limited in order to maximize the choice of a solution. What should be sought is not the ideal solution, but the most satisfactory. This emphasizes, in a way, the need to take into account the emotional aspect of organizational decision making. In addition, Simon classifies business decisions into 3 types: Scheduled decisions: Repetitive and routine, which can be the target of business process automation.Unscheduled decisions: Where the decision maker should use his judgment, intuition and creativity.Semi-scheduled decisions: A mix of the two. Where there\u2019s support from information systems, as well as the decision-maker\u2019s judgment, experience and understanding of the context.Whatever the type of business decision, a BPMN editor can help define business rules or provide the necessary information for decision-makers. In addition, established techniques such as the SWOT analysis, the Ishikawa diagram, the BCG Matrix, and the Eisenhower Matrix can assist leaders in the business decision making process.

Unfortunately, human beings are not fundamentally logical. For better or worse, we are essentially emotionally driven creatures. I\u2019ve worked with many leaders are bemoan the lack of logic in the behavior of followers. I point out to them the illogic of their expecting them to have logically with any consistency. The data-driven organization is a myth. Tons of analytical data may be available and for the most important decisions what feels right at the time typically leads the way. ",

Put simply it was a case of choosing, refining and benchmarking based on a particularly stringent decision making model/matrix. So instead I started running the workshops based upon the Thtee Principles, whereby the groups learned about the Human Operating System and where good decisions actually come from (not from reaction or fear, but from a deeper place of understanding and connection). It's now the only system I use in my workshops and the results are phenomenal. Wherever thinking is involved, this applies. There\u2019s more info on my website about this. ",
