            "answer_text": "First, you'll need to understand that no software or tricks you do with your will help increase your 4G speed because it's really unrelated, Your 4G speed depends on how far are you from the nearest mobile carrier tower, how many users are using 4G from that tower in a specific time and also whether you are inside or outside your home because it makes a big difference in speed, that's why 4G is always better outside, and always better very late at night when very few people are using it from the same tower as you are, in countries like USA, they offer 4G extenders, which is not really an extender but kind of a mini mobile tower commercially called Femtocells, such as the ones installed on the A380 for example and few other planes so you can have WiFi on board, The Femtocell (4G extender) when switched on connects to the service provider communication main hub to provide you with greater coverage inside your home with greater data rates (hence more data consumption on your behalf), they usually work for up to 10 devices at a time and only work with specific frequencies, so you will not get any wow speeds of 4G, it'll probably be limited to around 100 Mbps which is still impressive nevertheless. As for other countries, you can always call and complain about 4G data rates being down, most carriers will care and provide a solution within a few weeks that includes more optimisation to the neatest tower in terms of bandwidth, power and capacity, while some will simply tell you \u201coh we are upgrading our service soon so please be patient with us\u201d :D Hope my answer helped.

            "answer_text": "The quickest way to increase internet speed is to close off any unnecessary background applications. On Android In versions of Android before Marshmallow, this involves going to Settings > About and then tapping Build number about seven or so times. You'll get a notification telling you that Developer options have been unlocked once you're done and you can stop tapping.For many handsets, the next thing you need to look for is a setting called Processes or Process Stats. You can find this in Settings > Developer Options > Processes. That option takes you to a list of running processes showing how much RAM each is using.Obviously, it'll be tempting to stop the most RAM-hungry apps from running in the background, but you'll want to pay some attention to what you're stopping before you go ahead. Stopping some apps might crash your phone.On iPhone Double-click the Home button to show your most recently used apps.Swipe right or left to find the app that you want to close.Swipe up on the app's preview to close the app.",
