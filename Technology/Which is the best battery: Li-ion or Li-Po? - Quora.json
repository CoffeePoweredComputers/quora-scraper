            "answer_text": "Li-ion (as in the basic version, aka lithium cobalt cells) is obsolete due to the severe fire risk due to thermal runaway when overcharged, over-discharged , or used in series. Don\u2019t use basic Li-ion cells, they are dangerous when overdriven in any way. Li-Po power is probably cheaper in bulk. However it has a significant risk for fire when on charge after a hard impact. This was first discovered by the R/C modellers who used Li-Po packs in their planes and helicopters, but suffered fires that burnt out buildings when charging the batteries overnight after a heavy impact on the ground. On the other hand, Li-Mn cells - the \u2018basic\u2019 lithium cell technology today for discrete batteries - will suffer thermal runaway too when severely abused. Battery packs that use them will need cryogenic cooling (this probably applies to all lithium-based technologies). The safest of all lithium technologies is Li-FePO4 - it has a slightly lower voltage but this isn\u2019t a handicap in multi-cell packs. Lithium hybrid is another technology with considerable resources behind it, such as Sony. This type can use vanadium to improve some characteristics of a Li-FePO4 cell. Negligent engineeringAs an example the new Boeing Dreamliner had multiple fires that grounded them until they threw out the lethally incompetent battery pack design featuring lithium cells. Maybe someone didn\u2019t tell the fool that designed the battery packs that you can\u2019t smash them into the ground and you can\u2019t overdrive them and you can\u2019t operate them without cryogenic cooling systems. At least it\u2019s an eye-opener on jet airline safety: you\u2019d naturally assume that they have the best engineers, with good experience and the latest information. Instead, they had some know-nothing cretin who had never worked with lithium cells - these are all things anyone who has worked with lithium cells would know by heart. So: use Li-Po for cheapness but be extremely careful about impacts. Keep temperatures down, and this may mean efficient cooling systems. Be very careful about the architecture - use proven systems with known good history. Use Li-Mn or Li-hybrid for high performance, but temperature control is absolutely critical. You will want thermal monitoring right in the centre of the pack. You may well need cryogenics (liquid cooling). High-power lithium cell packs will need cryogenic systems as an integral part of the system: when you install or remove the pack, it should come complete with the tubing integrated within the pack, and you will connect/disconnect the pipework as well as the electrical connections. Use only proven architecture (proven safe cell size/type and series/parallel network design). Don\u2019t try and cobble together your own self-designed battery pack, you are asking for a fire. The first step is to find a proven safe design. Avoid whatever those idiots put in the Dreamliner for example. ",

            "answer_text": " Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery technology has historically been the power cell of choice for smartphones and a wide range of other portable gadgets too. However, modern smartphones now commonly feature lithium-polymer (Li-poly) batteries, a suitable alternative for a wide variety of consumer electronic gadgets. This certainly isn\u2019t a fact to overlook, given lithium-ion\u2019s occasional run-in with overheating problems. With battery safety and longevity high on some customers\u2019 priority list, it\u2019s good to know the pros and cons of these two battery technologies. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about lithium-ion vs. lithium-polymer batteries. How do lithium-ion batteries work? The trusty lithium-ion battery is the old industry workhorse. Development of the technology began all the way back in 1912 but it didn\u2019t gain popularity until adoption by Sony in 1991. Since then, lithium-ion batteries have powered a wide range of gadgets, from portable cameras to music players and smartphones. Lithium-ion has proven so successful due, in part, to its very high energy density, lack of the \u201cmemory effect\u201d (where cells become more difficult to charge over time) unlike previous battery tech, and its comparably cheap cost of production. These batteries are constructed from two positive and negative electrodes separated by a liquid chemical electrolyte, such as ethylene carbonate or diethyl carbonate. The chemical composition of this battery limits it to a mostly rectangular shape. Lithium-ion battery capacity decreases over charge cycles and even discharges when not in use, which isn\u2019t ideal. Worse though, the chemical electrolyte can become unstable at extreme temperatures or if punctured, leading to \u201cthermal runaway\u201d and fires. Although I should stress this is very, very rare. Electronic controllers are often used to regulate charging and discharge power to prevent overheating. How do lithium-polymer batteries work? Lithium-polymer battery technology is newer than lithium-ion. It didn\u2019t appear on the scene until the 1970s and has only made its way into smartphones much more recently. For example, Samsung only made the switch to lithium-polymer with the Galaxy S20 series. Although others have been using the technology for a little longer. Lithium-polymer technology again uses a positive and negative electrode, but with a dry solid, porous chemical, or gel-like electrolyte, rather than a liquid. As a result, polymer batteries can offer a lower profile, flexible and more-robust designs, and have a lower chance of leaking electrolytes resulting in thermal run away. In a nutshell, they\u2019re a fair bit safer. A major drawback of this technology is a notably higher manufacturing cost. The lithium-polymer life cycle is also shorter and the batteries store less energy than the same sized Li-ion. These cells also still use protection circuits to keep voltages operating within safe limits too. Lithium-ion vs lithium-polymer: Key differences Both battery types have their pros and cons. Generally speaking, lithium-ion batteries offer the highest capacities at the lowest prices. Handy if you want an inexpensive phone that lasts more than a single day between charges. Li-ion\u2019s drawbacks are a gradual self-discharge, not that this matters too much for phones that are always-on, and the tiny, but not zero potential for safety issues. Li-poly is safer, by comparison, which is particularly important in these days of super-fast charging technology. These batteries also have a very low self-discharge level, so won\u2019t go flat when you\u2019re not using them. However, this comes with a higher price tag, a shorter life-span, and a lower capacity density. Although, the lightweight nature of lithium-polymer batteries results in an overall better energy density per kg. Overall, lithium-polymer is replacing lithium-ion in the smartphone industry due to its superior safety, form factor versatility, and weight attributes in high-end and mid-tier devices. Although more affordable designs will likely stick with lithium-ion battery technology for a while longer.
