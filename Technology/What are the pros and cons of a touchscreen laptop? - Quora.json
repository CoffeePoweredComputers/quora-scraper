            "answer_text": "If I may generalize a little bit, most laptops with touchscreens tend to be some sort of \"convertible\" form factor, to make full use of the touchscreen as a tablet and allow the keyboard to stay out of the way is this usage.  This invariably means unconventional hinge mechanisms such as sliders (toshiba and sony), 180 degree hinges (lenovo yoga) or some other innovation on the standard hinge. This design modification very often leads to (1) weaker or less durable hinges leading to premature breakage, and unwanted vibrations of the screen when used in trains/planes etc. (2) some of the designs tend to keep the screen always on top, this means the surface of the screen is always exposed to impact and damage when placed in a bag full of other stuff, and is thus likely to get scratched or damaged. Screen damage is much more painful and expensive to fix than a scuffed laptop back. A touchscreen by itself has no cons (except for initial price of course), the digitizer can be turned off if not required, uses negligible power and does not affect the visual quality of the screen in anyway. But it is the design modifications stated above that tend to be the compromise. In a regular laptop scenario, with the screen upright, a touchscreen is awkward to to use and again may stress out the hinges and topple the laptop backwards due to the extra pressure. ",
