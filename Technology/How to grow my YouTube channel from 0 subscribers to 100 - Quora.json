            "answer_text": "First of all, if you continue uploading videos at least once a week you will AT SOME POINT reach 100 subscribers, even if the videos are garbage, at some point YOU WILL REACH IT. Now, you need to make frequent content. Some may post once a month and others once a day. Posting once per 1\u20133 days can be a good way to add a lot of content to your channel. Also 100 subs are an easy task. Just tell all your family members and friends to sub you (you can do it by yourself if you ask them \u201chey, i started a youtube channel, can i take your phone and subscribe to it?\u201d), and you will have 100 subs quickly.
