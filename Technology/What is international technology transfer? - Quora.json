            "answer_text": "In international business, international technology transfer is an important part. It involves several modes. Product or process technologies can be transferred to a host country within a multinational company. Other modes include sale or licensing of technology. In these cases a company other than the technology owner takes technology to a host country. International technology transfer involves many matters such as transfer mode, government trade policies, risk of losing technology and influence of industry associations. Its critics say it is a trick used by developed countries and multinational companies to exploit the unemployment conditions of developing countries. ",
