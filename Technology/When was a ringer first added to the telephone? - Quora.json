            "answer_text": "Let's think about that for a moment, was the early telephone one way?  Who could you call if no one would know you called because there was not a ringer?   Of course there was a ringer (a bell set in a wood box) or the typical kitchen wall mounted set complete with built in ringer.   The wooden box with external visible bells of various revisions were seldom required unless a no other set contained a ringer, these are the equivalent of today's E1 & F1 type bell sets. ",

            "answer_text": "Apparently, prior to ringers being part of the phone, there was a concept called a Ringer box. Once current entered the box, a mallet could be made to strike bells or else the current could be used to make a light turn on/blink. Furthermore, according to Wikipedia's entry on the Ringer box, The Western Electric 302-type telephone was the first widely used Bell System telephone to include the ringer and other subscriber set components inside the same housing of the telephone set.
