            "answer_text": "The preferred pronunciation of \u201cchic\u201d is \u201csheek\u201d (sh\u0113k) It rhymes with peak, peek, pic, pique. The \u201cch\u201d is not hard as in \u201cchange\u201d. What\u2019s a \u201cchick click\u201d? Another word is \u201cclique\u201d (kleek/kl\u0113k) which also rhymes with \u201cwreak\u201d (as in \u201cwreaking havoc\u201d) and \u201csheik\u201d/\u201csheikh\u201d (head of a family as Sheikh Mohammed bin Salmen) are pronounced incorrectly: \u201dwreck\u201d/ \u201cshake\u201d. Never heard either pronounced \u201cchick\u201d or \u201cclick\u201d until \u2018murican millennials began influencing pronunciations probably caused by the lack/poor quality of education in English and nonexistent studies in virtually any/all foreign languages!!! If they can spell anything correctly, they should enunciate the word properly since they can access dictionaries in their smart phones\u2026na\u2026 2 mush wurk 4 m\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Chique pronounced tsjiekhu (French).  Not tsjik (chick from chicken). Chic is a derivative of the French chique. Chic /\u02c8\u0283i\u02d0k/, meaning \"stylish\" or \"smart\", is an element of fashion.:) \"Chic is a French word, established in English since at least the 1870s. Early references in English dictionaries classified it as slang and New Zealand-born lexicographer Eric Partridge noted, with reference to its colloquial meaning, that it was \"not so used in Fr[ench].\"  Gustave Flaubert notes in Madame Bovary (published in 1856) that \"chicard\" (one who is chic) is then Parisian very current slang for \"classy\" noting, perhaps derisively, perhaps not, that it was bourgeoisie. There is a similar word in German, schick, with a meaning similar to chic, which may be the origin of the word in French; another theory links chic to the word chicane.  Although the French pronunciation (sh\u0113k or \"sheek\") is now virtually standard and was that given by Fowler,  chic was often rendered in the anglicised form of \"chick\".\" Chic  ",
