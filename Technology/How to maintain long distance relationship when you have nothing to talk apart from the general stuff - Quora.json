            "answer_text": "Long Distance Relationships are the best ones if one can maintain it quite well.Even I'm in a LDR..Every relationship has its own highs &lows, positives & negatives & so do LDRs have.Sometimes it really gets pretty painful because you cannot get to meet & see your loved one as & whenever you wish, You miss out on some happy moments which otherwise you would have spent & shared with him/her..But you know LDRs do teach patience & commitment.Your love for each other grows stronger as the time  passes..Your desire to be together grows higher..You can enjoy your space & independence too..When the wait for hearing the voice of your beloved at end of the day ends, the feeling is just ecstatic.See, it really does not depends whether you are talking some general stuff or some other things..It depends on regardless of the distance how much you want each other.Plan out & watch a movie together..like the same time even though not at the same place..& discuss about it..You can use skype also & have a dinner date..yeah on skype..Create an ambience at your place & ask her to get ready..Play some good music & have some good food together on skype itself..Although you can't be together for the time being but at least you can see each other & do these pretty little things together.Call her at times when she never expects you'll call & surprise her.It'll definitely make her happy.Send her some thing & don't tell her what it is..her reaction would be priceless..Love & Trust is what is essential for LDRs..for all relationships rather.Good luck..:) ",

            "answer_text": "Talk about general stuff!  Don't try to be something you are not just to keep her with you, this will have serious repercussions in future. Rather, talk about general stuff. You are in a relationship with her, you are not in a phase where you are trying to 'impress' her so only you have to be responsible. This is a relationship now, where her contribution also equally matters. So if you can't come up with new topics everyday, let her come up with something! And if she can't, then discuss this thing. In long distance relationship, it's very important to talk, and it's very important to 'have' something to talk about, otherwise the relationship starts dying out. Don't ignore this thing, rather discuss it with her. The more varied topics you will pick up to make her 'talk' forcefully, the more she will run away from you. So instead of keeping her with you with force, either let her come up with something as well, or tell her about this issue, and solve it mutually! I can give you an example here - The day you no longer have anything else to talk about, you can share your old pictures with each other - talk about your old dates - the time you spent together. Tell her she was looking beautiful that day! And when she asks 'which day?' you can start with discussing your old dates. This will not only give you a new topic to talk about, but will rather bring you closer as well :) Good luck! :) ",
