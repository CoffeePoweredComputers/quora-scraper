            "answer_text": "The who part I cannot answer, the What I can. Its simple supply and demand mechanics : India produces way too many engineers who, though of any trade, end up pursuing IT as a job or in longer terms a career. Despite massive underpriced outsourcing of Indian IT services to organizations, industries abroad, there is still only so much jobs they can provide. India is not a production based nation in IT and mostly relies on service and maintainence solutions, leading to most people having to compete for a handful of jobs. Again, IT is a very vast field, however very few end up doing anything else except keeping datacenters and services up and running and occasionally fixing the deployed code. This has led to massive redundancies, and usually 3 4 people are deployed on a 1 man job by companies, who overbill clients and underpay employees. Again, if more people ventured out into other trades, even from B.Tech, this overcrowding can be largely minimized, if not completely removed. ",
