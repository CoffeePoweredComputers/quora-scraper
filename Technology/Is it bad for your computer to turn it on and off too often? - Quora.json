            "answer_text": "To a small extent, yes. Old hard drives did not like full stops and starts, but with head parking and other features this is not really an issue anymore. However capacitors have a lifespan and the more you turn it off, the more often the charge goes completely to zero. There are quite a few capacitors on your motherboard. If you just cold turn the computer off instead of doing a proper shutdown this can cause all sorts of corruption to your data. When you turn the computer on only durring use it causes more issues. When your computer is fully off, it cant download windows updates, it cant download antivirus updates, and it can\u2019t backup any files (if you actually have backups setup).Overtime this causes a huge backlog that A) makes your system much more prone to infection, and B) makes the computer slower and slower as these updates start to backpile, even more so when the computer will try to catch up after bootup while you are trying to accomplish your task.I let my computers stay on all the time, and reboot them occasionally. A modern computer does not use that much power, but if you are greatly concerned about it then you can allow it to enter sleep mode. This will allow the PC to wake itself for scheduled tasks, but put the motherboard and other components in an ultra low power draw state. ",

            "answer_text": "As long as you complete a proper shutdown, there shouldn\u2019t be any problem. If you\u2019re doing this several times a day, however, I would suggest you use the \u2018sleep mode\u2019, which keeps your programs available without having to go through the startup process which takes up a lot more time. On mine, I almost always use sleep mode even for extended periods (overnight), as it does no harm to the device, but I don\u2019t have to wait for all my startup programs to boot. I only reboot or shut down when the OS has an update, or it\u2019s necessary for other programs (security programs, game updates, etc) to be able to set into the registry. Hope that helps. ",
