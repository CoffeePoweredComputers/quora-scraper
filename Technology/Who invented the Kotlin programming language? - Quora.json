            "answer_text": "Kotlin was created by JetBrains, a company creating software development tools, most notably IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm and ReSharper. They first announced Kotlin in 2011 and made it open-source in 2012. It was adopted by developers writing Android applications, due to the fact that it provided modern features (chiefly lambdas/closures, but not only) while compiling to a slightly older version of Java bytecode to which Android was limited at the time. (Newest versions of the Java language already had some of the features, but Android programmers couldn\u2019t use them since they were limited to Java 7) In 2017 Google announced first-class support for Kotlin in Android, along with Java and C++. Later, in early 2019 they made it a preferred language for Android development. I don\u2019t know if Google or anyone else supports Kotlin\u2019s development (financially or otherwise), the main work and stewardship of Kotlin is still done by it\u2019s creators, JetBrains. ",
