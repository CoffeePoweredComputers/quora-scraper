You\u2019d search spring and summer fashion trends. (yup, this means that you\u2019re behind for winter already, but now that you know you\u2019re ALL GOOD. Here\u2019s another gem. Research your body top and try out what will look good on YOU. Tall, short, body shape, that ish has everything to do with a fit. Everything isn\u2019t for everyone, I don\u2019t care what the 2020 fashion trends are telling you.
