            "answer_text": "It is not truth or falsehood that determines which information spreads faster. What makes the difference is how catchy the story is. \u201cCatchiness\u201d is not a simple thing; if it was, content creators could know in advance what will go viral. It's a combination of how simple and memorable it is, and what it contains that makes people want to repeat it. That's different for different people, which is why catchiness is complicated, but there are a few common themes such as warnings of danger, happy stories, juicy rumors, justification of group values, and ridicule of opposing groups. Stories that combine several of these can be extra catchy. People want to share these things in order to reaffirm a feeling of kinship, or to help others, or to increase their status as someone \u201cin the know,\u201d or things like that. Unfortunately, this puts truth at a disadvantage. In so many situations, the truth is complex and nuanced. But as it gets repeated, it gets simplified. Some details are exaggerated and others left out, until the story becomes deceptive even if nobody along the line intentionally lied. And the more strongly people want something to be true, the quicker any story may morph into something that supports this \u201ctruth.\u201d So, in the end, falsehood does tend to spread faster than truth. Not specifically because it's false, but because it's catchy. Occasionally a true story will be catchy enough to go viral without too much distortion, but the very fact of spreading a story widely tends to alter it. ",
