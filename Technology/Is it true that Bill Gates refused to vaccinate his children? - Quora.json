            "answer_text": "Nope. That particular claim seems to come from an article, written under a pseudonym, on a website called \u201cNewsPunch\u201d (which is notorious for made-up stories), which claims that someone leaked a tape from a symposium in which the Gates family doctor said Bill Gates refused to have his kids vaccinated. So, a website that has no concern about accuracy publishes an anonymous article which claims that somebody (and we have no idea who) heard these remarks from an unnamed doctor in an unspecified symposium. Also, the website has since deleted the article. False claim: Bill Gates refused to vaccinate his children Sounds legit! This claim is the perfect example of how fake stories function. It\u2019s absolute nonsense, but it sounds vaguely plausible. So someone wrote it up, every anti-vax website in the world picked up up, because it backed up what they already believed, and the next thing you know, it\u2019s all over the internet. Is it accurate? Who cares! If you want to believe it, you won\u2019t look too close. And everyone\u2019s saying it, so there must be something there! And this is not an uncommon thing. It appears to be an article of faith in the antivax community that doctors, pharmaceutical executives and vaccination advocates don\u2019t vaccinate their own children. To the point where all of those groups, when holding public meetings, will almost inevitable encounter a smug anti-vaxxer who asks them \u201cbut are your children vaccinated\u201d. I suppose they\u2019re hoping that the person will either dodge the question, or be shocked to be caught in their own web of lies. What happens in real life, in almost one hundred percent of cases, is that the person responds that OF COURSE their children are vaccinated, because that\u2019s one of the basic things every parent should do to keep their children safe. I assume the anti-vaxxers then just assume that they\u2019re lying. For the record, the Gates family has spoken publicly about vaccinating their own children. But I\u2019m sure an anonymous guy on the interwebs knows better than them. Melinda Gates ",
