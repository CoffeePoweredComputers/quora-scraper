            "answer_text": "The future of Islam looks quite bright; it is the future of the Muslims-by-birth that is worrisome.    Islam is the only system of beliefs, among all religions, that makes rational and logical sense. In this age of science and rationality, that is the only religion that is going to survive and grow. As the people in the West start thinking rationally of their beliefs they only have two choices: either to become atheists or to adopt Islam. Currently people are becoming atheists in large numbers because Islam has been put in a bad light, and Muslims are delinquent in their responsibilities of sharing true Islam with people of the world. But if we Muslims present the true essence of Islam and educate the masses, both by presenting the Islamic beliefs in the rational manner and by the excellence of our characters, the trend will turn to Islam. Similarly, when the literacy and rationality grows in places like rural areas of India, China and Africa, the same process will take place there.   But this will not happen by default. Muslims have a lot of work to do.     Some people who have not studied Islam or understood it, or have looked at it with Biblical lens, they usually complain about it being stuck in the 7th century. They are utterly wrong; it is actually stuck with human nature. Islam provides guidance, while keeping human nature in view, in terms of the principles and values to live by so that individuals and societies can excel in this world. As the human nature has always been the same and it does not change, Islamic guidance is also permanent and unchanging. All the desires, emotions, feelings, attitudes, greed, etc., that make people do bad things and all sentiments and tendencies that make people do good are as true today as they were for the very first human couple and will remain the same until the end of the world. That is why Islam has been the same from the first human couple to the last messenger of Allaah. Truth, justice fairness, human dignity, equality, balance, moderation, pursuit of excellence are the principles and values that Islam teaches and promotes, they were good yesterday and are still desirable today. Injustice, jealousy, arrogance, hatred, racism, backbiting, derision of others, etc., and crimes resulting from these evil tendencies are the things that Islam is designed to curb; they were as bad yesterday as they are today. What and why would someone like to change any of it?   The only change needed is that Muslims need to go back to this true and pure Islam and propagate it by their words and deeds. That is a major major task that is not going to be easy. It will require a lot dedication, hard work, perseverance, fortitude, and forbearance \u2013 curbing any tendencies to get even and adopting the prophetic policy of responding to evil with excellence. Even while doing so, Muslims must be cognizant that the things are going become even worse than they are now before they start to get better.    That answer is from logical perspective. From the eschatological perspective, when Jesus returns, all Christians will become Muslims because Jesus will tell them that his true religion is Islam and because they will know that Jesus was neither part of trinity nor did he die for their sins. Sensible Jews will also become Muslims because the Christ they were waiting for would have arrived. So Islam will be the only religion that will survive.   Thus, any way one looks at, the future of Islam is bright, it is the future of the Muslims-by-birth that is worrisome. It is up to those Muslims to see if they become part of the abovementioned noble process and make this world a better place sooner or they neglect their duties and prolong their suffering. ",

            "answer_text": "For first time in history Islam is facing strong and widespread challenge from within the community and from outside too. So many young Muslims are facing direct challenge to their faith and they find it difficult to accept the faith blindly, thanks to the internet. Muslim women started questioning their faith openly and directly, which were unimaginable in the past. They compare their life with the life of non Muslim women. Rebellion is the order these days even in strict Arabic nations. It is sure, that education, science and widespread communications will drastically impact Islam in future. How this will shape the Muslim world? Very difficult to predict. Most likely it will be difficult times for Islam, as a religion. That is why so much pressure to put restrictions on internet. Islam prohibits thinking. Demands blind obedience. Will the educated Muslims of the present and future able to accept the conservative approach? As a Christian I firmly believe Holy God is at work, behind the scenes. He wants everyone to know the truth about Him. He wants everyone to know the truth about His Son Jesus Christ, the only Savior for humanity appointed by his Father, the Holy God. God wants vast number of people to know the truth about the salvation and eternal life freely offered through the sacrifice of His Son on the cross. Muslims along with all other people of the world, has to hear the good news about the Son of God. I believe, wish and hope that in overall, future has to benefit so many Muslim countries and the Muslim people. God bless them all! ",

And, my answer will be to a theist is as follows: Any thing, be it a living or non-living thing, that comes into existence in this world will flourish and dies at the wish of the God. Human beings will not have say in this regard.So if it is the wish of the God that Islam shall flourish further, it will flourish.On the contrary, if it is the wish of the God that Islam shall be finished as a religion and that its followers may opt out of it to another way of worship, then that will be done.b) If the OP is an atheist, then my answer would be as follows: The statistical reports claiming that Islam is fastest religion are based on certain presumptions that (a) the fertility rate of Muslims is high (b) Many Christians are finding peace after getting converted into Islam (c) Many people from other religions are getting converted into Islam, will be valid only if the conditions remain the same.If Muslims in many countries get educated and start thinking and questioning the very tenets of Islam, then enrollment into atheism will be on rise mainly from ex-Muslims, as exodus from Muslim community is evident from writings of many ex-muslims in the Quora.So the future will unfold by itself to give detailed answers to everyone.

            "answer_text": "As a point of discussion...  Islam is a fast growing religion compared to say Christianity.  It seems to me that there are people who want a strong religious influence in their lives even though the trend of very weak beliefs is strong in the West.  There's been a shift in paradigm I think with Islam.  Not that long ago Islam was associated with developing modern thought, pursuing science and seemed progressive but in more recent times  it seems the scholars are more interested in working on Islamic texts and developing their understanding of the Islamc religion.  To western eyes most Islamic cultures seem backwards and any idea of progression has gone.  I understand the Quran is a direct text, so it's an exact copy of the original text recieved by the Prophet Muhammed but herein is part of the problem.  It's full of solutions that were relevant and applicable to the times and much of it (perhaps not the central texts) seems less relevant now. An interesting point made by a Christian Anglican is to with inerrancy.  The claim is that scripture wasn't intended (by God) to be the literal word of God, but God intended to give divine inspiration so that the author's of various books could pass on God's message in a way that people would understand.  Clearly that message can be restated using divine inspiration in a way that is applicable to the changing culture in the modern world.  I thought this had merit. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cAlif Lam Mim [I am Allah, the All-knowing] This is a perfect Book; there is no doubt in it; it is a guidance for the righteous\u2026\u201d (The Holy Quran, Al-Baqara 2: 2\u20133)  The name \u2018Allah,\u2019 which is the personal name of God Almighty and which is that compendium of all perfect attributes. The Living God Who possesses the light of His powerful Signs and continues to prove His existence through fresh and rejuvenating miracles and powers, it is He alone, who restrains one from sin; bestows true peace, contentment, and satisfaction; and grants steadfastness and true courage. He becomes the Fire that burns sin and the Water that washes away worldly desires. Truthfulness, steadfastness, devotion, and worship during this period of darkness have tremendous value in the estimation of God. And it was that very dark condition that having reached its ultimate point during the advent of the Holy Prophet [peace and blessings of Allah be on him] demanded the descent of the Glorious Light. In view of the dark condition of the time, and as a mercy for those afflicted with darkness, there was an upsurge of the attribute of Rahmaniyyat and heavenly blessings addressed themselves to the earth. Thus, this dark condition became a blessing for the world, and because of it, the world received a magnificent mercy in that the perfect man, Sayyidur-Rusul [the Chief of the Messengers] the like of whom has never been born, nor ever will be came for the guidance of the world and brought the Radiant Book, the like of which no eye has ever seen. Thus, it was a grand manifestation of God\u2019s perfect rahmaniyyat that He sent down, at the time of gloom and darkness, the Magnificent Light that is called the Furqan [Discrimination, i.e. Holy Quran], which distinguishes between truth and falsehood and which demonstrably established truth and uprooted falsehood. It descended upon the earth when the earth had died a spiritual death and great corruption had spread over land and sea. Steadfastness What is the formal Prayer? It is a kind of supplication, which protects man from all forms of vice and indecency, and makes them deserving of good and the recipient of divine favor or grace. It is said that 'Allah' is the Ism-e-Azam (the greatest name). Allah has placed all His other attributes under this name. If we reflect a little; the Salat starts with the Adhan and the Adhan begins with 'Allah O Akbar', that is, with the name of Allah and it concludes with, 'La ilaha Il-lal-lah', that, it come to an end with the name of Allah. This distinction and honor is found in the Islamic form of worship and no other people or nation. Thus Salat, which is a Prayer and in which 'Allah', which is His Ism-e-Azam, has been given precedence; similarly, the Ism-e-Azam of man is steadfastness. Ism-e-Azam signifies that through which the excellences of humanity are attained. Those who say, \u2018Our Lord is Allah,\u2019 and then remain steadfast, the angels descend on them, saying: \u2018Fear ye not, nor grieve.\u2019 -Ha Mim As-Sajdah, 41:31 In other words, when a person comes under the shadow of divine providence, and when the egg of human nature is nurtured under man\u2019s Greatest Name known as steadfastness (istiqamat), humans develop such capacities that angels begin to descend upon them and they do not suffer from any kind of fear or grief. I have stated that istiqamat or steadfastness is very significant. \u2018Guide us to that path\u2014and make us steadfast and upright in following that path\u2014which is straight and which has no perversity of any kind. What is the meaning of istiqamat? When everything is precisely in the right place, this is hikmat (wisdom) and istiqamat (steadfastness). One could say, that the natural and uncorrupted state of a thing is 'steadfastness'. Therefore, until the human form is not kept in the natural condition that it is meant to be, and it is not kept in a state that is mustaqim or \u2018right\u2019, it cannot develop moral excellences within itself. The system of supplication is that both these \u2018Great Names\u2019 must come together; and man must advance towards God without deviating towards anything other than Him, even if it be the idol of man\u2019s own carnal desires and passions. When this state comes about, it is then that the true pleasure of Pray unto Me; I will answer your prayer can be tasted. After the state of steadfastness has been attained, a person\u2019s heart develops signs of coolness and tranquility. The Shias view that the institution of sainthood (walayat) ended after the twelve Imams is completely false. Contrary to this, however, the prayer just mentioned demonstrates that God has decided that whosoever is righteous and acts in accordance with His will, shall be able to achieve the ranks attained by Prophets and saints. The excellences which Allah Almighty invested in the institution of prophethood reached their pinnacle collectively in the person of our Perfect Guide, the Holy Prophet [peace and blessings of Allah be on him]. Now, for all times to come, the Mujaddidin will continue to spiritually reflect these excellences throughout the world. Allah the Exalted will make this phenomenon continue until the Day of Resurrection. Beseech help with steadfastness and Prayer, and take the station of Ibrahim [Abraham] as a place for prayer. In this revelation, the \u2018place of Ibrahim\u2019 means high moral qualities and a strong relationship with Allah; that is, love of Allah, devotion to Him, seeking His pleasure, and complete faithfulness. This is the real station of Ibrahim which is awarded to ummat-e-Muhammadiyyah through following and by way of inheritance. He who is created in the spiritual essence of Ibrahim must tread along the same path. God Almighty will spread the shade of His mercy over you and will redress your grievances and will have mercy on you; and if all people refrain from safeguarding you, God will safeguard you. And God will certainly safeguard you with His help even if all the people refrain from it. One is drawn towards Him in one way, while another is by another way, Yusuf [Joseph], the son of Ya\u2018qub [Jacob] earned the status by imprisonment that the others attain by asceticism. This is an indication that there are two divine attributes which are engaged for the instruction of God\u2019s servants. The first attribute is of tenderness, kindness, and benevolence; it is called jamal [grace]. The other attribute is of force and harshness; it is called jalal [grandeur]. It is thus the way of Allah that those who are summoned to His exalted threshold are nurtured sometimes through His attribute of jamal and sometimes through His attribute of jalal. Whenever the greatest favors of the One True God are decreed, the manifestation of the attribute of jamal remain dominant; but on a few occasions the divine will disciplines or nurtures His special servants through the attribute of jalal. Even with regard to the noble Prophets it has been the way of the One True God that they are nurtured continually through the operation of the attribute of jamal, but sometimes the attributes of jalal also come into operation to demonstrate their steadfastness and their high moral qualities. They were afflicted with all types of tribulation at the hands of evil people so that their high moral qualities, which cannot be demonstrated without the pressure of great suffering, may be demonstrated and people of the world may know that they are not weak but are truly faithful. It must be remembered that the Sign of the highest love of God Almighty is that the attributes and colors of Allah develop by way of reflection in the one who loves God. So long as that condition is not attained, it is a lie to claim to be a lover of God. The condition of perfect love is exactly like that of a piece of iron which, when placed within the fire, absorbs so much of the effect of fire that the iron itself becomes like the fire. Then, although it is really iron and not fire, it is so thoroughly dominated by the fire that it reflects all the properties of fire; it burns like fire and emanates light like fire. So, the reality of the love of God is exactly the same, that one becomes colored in that color. Taqwa (fear of God) then is the road that leads to complete love for God and makes a believer an object of God's love and then he finds a complete salvation from all worldly difficulties. A Muttaqi (one who fears God) is an object of God's love and he finds salvation from all trials and unlimited bounties flow to him and God accepts the prayers of this man and the enemies of the Muttaqi face destruction and ruin. God unfolds the secrets of the unknown only to a Muttaqi. Man becomes recipient of all Divine favors once he is completely absorbed in His love. In truth, steadfastness, patience, and worship of Allah at such times bring favors that can never be attained at other times. Allah the Exalted states: And (as for) those who strive in Our path-We will surely guide them in Our ways. And verily Allah is with those who do good. -al-Ankabut, 29:70 The hallmark of a righteous person is steadfastness. Our success depends on steadfastness. And steadfastness is to recognize God and stand unshaken in the face of all difficulty, trial and tribulation. If a person is able to do this, they will surely become the recipient of divine communion and converse like the Prophets. I proclaim once again that even now God Almighty has not left the world deprived and He has established a dispensation. Verily, He has raised a man with His own hand and that person is I who speaks to you now, in your midst. It is time for the descent of the mercy of God Almighty. So supplicate, seek steadfastness, and invoke blessings upon the Holy Prophet [peace and blessings of Allah be on him] often, for invoking blessings upon him is a powerful means by which to attain steadfastness. But do not recite these words as a habit and custom; rather, do so keeping in mind the beauty and kindness of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and so that his rank and status may continue to be elevated, and so that he may continue to succeed. The result of this will be that the sweet and delicious fruit of the acceptance of prayer shall be granted to you. May Allah the Exalted bless us with the grace of revelation, dreams and visions. For these are characteristic of a believer, and thus, should exist in us. Send down Thy blessings and peace, O Allah, on Muhammad and his people according to the amount of pain and anguish he felt for his Ummah, and pour down upon him the lights of Thy mercy forever. ",

            "answer_text": "As the time will pass,Islam would become more moderate in Arab and persia,but it will flourish as a cultural source!Islam in rest of the world has already started to be moderating like malaysia,Indonesia,India,Pak,Central Asia etc.Islam could be a source of conflict in Africa,as Africa is a resource rich continent,much of it is untapped.U.S,Russia,China have major stakes there,and they are trying to offset each others interest by funding insurgency,Islamic jihadist groups are most potential instrument for them to undermine each others security!So we already see Boko Haram,Alqaeda,Isis in Africa,it is preparing for next big geopolitical & geostrategic conflicts!So in Africa Islam would remain in poor shape.Good news is that Syrian conflict is temporary,as Bashar Assad government would have to fall sooner or later,this will make the region more stable,and with moderating islam in Iran(after the fall of Islamic govt.) & Saudi arabia (after the fall of monarchy), Shia-Sunni Islam shall reconcile,leaving little potential of conflict based on religious sectarian divide! Israels future is gloomy,with the possibility of it being converted into an Apartheid state(if it swallows whole palestine), or it would have a so poor human rights record(if it expels palestinians into neighbouring countries or kill them or opress them),that hardly anyone would praise the jewish state,And if Israel maintains status quo,then it would become a major target of Moderate Islam, which would ask for a jewish state to become accountable to the region! Now coming to terror aspect of Islamic jihadism!Its a mainly Anti-globalisation movement driven by wahabi islamic ideology! With the Islam moderating in Arab and Asia,people would be more pro-develpoment in a stable Islamic world But,Africa will face worst forms of religious wars,and would become a new centre of Jihadism! Also increasing cultural exchanges among people all over the world would loosen the religious divide,Islam would transform into an ideal conduct and highest form of moral values,rather than being a ritual and custom based religion! Prophet Mohammad would be praised even after thousand years,for his attempt to enlighten the people of his time!He would still be remember in history for creating such an idealist mass movement which saw its up and downs!Overall,his real messege of Rightful conduct in daily life would be practiced more and more,but Islamic rituals would dilute!Overall Islam will become more individualistic in future,from being communal and community oriented currently!Individualistic perspective of Islam will survive till the end of this world!Majority of Men always look for highest ideals in human life,Islamic doctrine of idealistic life is permanent in nature! However in comparison to Christianity!Islam will be the most followed religion of the world due its highest nos. of population! On the question of God or Allah,Humanity is clueless and will remain clueless!Although we understand the design of the universe by science,but cant find out if its created by someone or not! Islam as an ideology and philosphy is going to be there in the world forever,but it will evolve with time,ultimately reduced to individualistic interpretation! A man of the magnitude of Prophet of Islam is nowhere to be found in history till now! His idealism is never-ending! With the passing time,Humans are becoming more idealistic, so his ideals for the betterment of humanity would be there in practice! Write me on qureshi.faisal199206@gmail.com ",

            "answer_text": "Islam is Fantastic Religion for men and it can make women more obedient to Men then any other religion in world. So must be all men to accept Islam, so naturally women will become Muslims, so men will have more freedom.Divorce is very easy by chanting Talaq three times, when women starts shouting at her husband. So men can easily come out from hardships given by wife. More over Muslim men can marry 4 wifes at a time depends upon some special permissions given by Almighty Allah, so this will make men's sexual fantasies can be easily satisfiable in this world and the belief which Islam insists that after death we can reach heaven and must have 2 ever virgins for each earth wife and 70 heaven girls for one ever virgin will make more and more enjoyable moments for muslim men in Heaven,sadly all men will look same like Allah and as per my understanding it may be like photo copy of Allah there in heaven, that's what very sad and going to make to loose muslim men's individuality there, but if a muslim man have 4 wifes here in this earth he will get 8 ever virgins and 560 heavenly girls so he can always busy in inter coursings enjoyments there. Rest times 2 ever virgins and 140 other heaven girls will become servents to one wife of muslim men in this world.By all this above rational and logical beliefs, Islam is vastly growing in youngsters mind all over world and by this means Islam will become religion of peace and prosperous every where in globe.

            "answer_text": "Murky at best. Mainstream Islam is a warrior creed, great in invoking agression against perceived enemies of Islam but ill-prepared for survival in peaceful circumstances. The Hadith are irrational, full of absurdities and immoralities. Rib Ticklingly funny Hadiths! Mainstream Islam can only survive under censorship (which explains why answers provided by Muslims to this question have their comments disabled). As the free flow of information is expected to continue in the coming years and the education level of Muslims continues to rise, it will be more and more challenging for Muslims to maintain their faith against scientific facts.  The main appeals of mainstream Islam lie in its ritualistic nature, its hedonistic promises for the afterlife and its monopolisation of sex. Two of the three of this pillars are under fire. Science is well on its way to provide for clinical immortality, with several life-extending drugs under clinical research. Sex, as well, is getting more and more easy to come by. Scientific education provides insight in the laws of nature, which are at odds with both Qur\u2019an and Hadith. The only appeal of mainstream Islam that remains, is it ritualistic nature, such as its tedious and elaborate prayer rituals, dress requirements for women and pervasive demands on daily life. While those rituals wil continue to hold their appeal to people near to the OCD end of the human behavioural spectrum, more intelligent and open-minded people will look for alternative sources of spirituality. All comments of people that disabled comments on their own answers will be deleted. ",

Unfortunately due to socioeconomic conditions, much of the Islamic world is struggling with high unemployment and lack of upward mobility, so societies are rigid and religiously conservative. Two things will happen, the second one more likely. An enlightened class in the West and urban centers will bring about much needed reform in the religion, resulting in Islam ushering in the modern world like Judaism and Christianity before it. The second, unfortunately more likely scenario is the status quo continuing resulting in marginalization and ghettoization of much of the Islamic world, with a minority of enlightened Muslims either being only cultural Muslims or moving away from the religion over time.

They have much in common with Mormons, but have not adopted the LDS principle of ongoing revelation which enables them to gradually and selectively throw out the crap that isn't bringing in more money. Islam is based on the Quran and the principle that the Quran cannot change. As people become more educated and read the Quran and discover how awful it is, Islam can only shatter and collapse. ",

It is growing within and with out.The number of muslims will rise everywhere. Countries like Sweden will be changing dramatically as will the U.K and Germany. That being said only the few,innovative,hard working and smart muslims will have good lives.That's true now and will be so forever. There's going\u200b to be a top 1% and there's going to be the rest. As for Islam as an ideology.Nostalgic identities die hard. The ideas will be twisted and turned around the world by various Islamic nation states to their own interests. Islamic laws in Morocco,Tunisia,Egypt,Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are all very different and will remain different. A fiat currency is definitely haram by Islamic law but every Muslim country does abide by it. Some changes do happen irrespective of what one may want. ",
