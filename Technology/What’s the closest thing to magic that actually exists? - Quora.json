            "answer_text": "Emergence is the closest thing to magic. I\u2019l try to explain \u201cmagic\u201d to you now, but you may not understand it. ;P First imagine how it looks to individual soldiers when they have to do some weird backwards move away from a vulnerable objective they just know they could take. It\u2019s frustrating to them because they don\u2019t know that getting the enemy to focus on escape at that one location opens up an even bigger opportunity elsewhere. We use compartmentalization to keep soldiers from being able to give away battle plans. Why is this important? Because the first thing you need to understand is that complex larger and longer-term effects can be participated in by intelligent individuals that do not understand what they are particpating in. They can only see the trees, not the forest. This requires a plan, however, right? Someone has to have planned it all out for something like this to occur, doesn\u2019t it? The answer to that is a resounding no! What if I told you conspiracies may be real but require no conspirators? What if I told you emergence can even occur inside a single mind; that what looks like a plan can occur without intention?  Blind cooperation occurs all the time. Let\u2019s say that there is a giant wall with a bar through it. Above it the bar is also connected to a bowl of fruit that could be knocked over if the bar was raised but the bar is too heavy for a single monkey to raise by himself. If I\u2019ve already shown my test monkeys other examples that were lighter, they\u2019d naturally attempt to get the fruit by raising the bar but find it too heavy by themselves. If, however, I have groups on both sides of the wall with the fruit pay off for both sides of the wall and then also have some sort of noticeable event like a loud buzzer that goes off every once in a while, something will happen. Randomly, the monkeys trying to raise the heavy bar will synchronize with each other and the beep and by cooperation they will receive the fruit. Without ever knowing they are cooperating with another monkey. This happens in economies constantly. These sort of blind interactions can become multi-layered and involve vast numbers of components. Unfortunately they can also result in the creating horrific consequences along with the benefits but that\u2019s a discussion for another time. The important thing to understand is that opportunities arise apparently spontaneously but are factually a sort of aggregation of actions which are synchronized by some method. The important thing to note is that the cause is not as much the linear chain of events as much as it is the timing or synchronization of them. This is not the normal way we think of causes. This is why we think of emergence with magical thinking ideations like invisible hands of the market or god. It\u2019s why we (still often) believe in creationism. We cannot see how simple benefit at smaller levels can lead to large scale organization and creation of systems. Even the various system of a human mind can come together in a way to accomplish tasks that look intentional but require no intent and no plan. Now how is this \u201cmagic\u201d if it just happens on its own? Because we can harness this power in a way that is like sorcery. We need not plan the individual events to create complex structured outcomes. Do you think DNA is altered with very tiny tweezers? Yet we do it, right? How do we do it? We know how some circumstances will evolve and how various things will interact with each other and we just mix things together in the right amounts and at the right times. This is the sort of magic carried out at the highest levels of governance when the intention is to destabilize a government we dislike etc. We take known components and mix them. We need not have finite details worked out for the components to interact in very particular ways. We simply mix the right solutions and the DNA is changed, no super-tiny tweezers required. \u201cThat\u2019s reliable for things like chemicals but people are way more variable! Your analogy is breaking down!\u201d For some things people are extremely variable; for others they are very reliable. When dealing with aggregates of people on things that are reliable, it\u2019s like mixing chemicals. There are even factors of social influence that create a convergence towards the mean that allow you to ignore outliers and unlikely events. It\u2019s much easier than it looks at first. \u201cI was more interested in a single person doing something like magic\u2026\u201d Well, that\u2019s possible for an extremely artistic mind, but not a pedantic one. They usually can\u2019t even grasp these concepts because using imprecise methods looks like complete failure to them and is indeed a failure with hard things like mathematics and electronics. That\u2019s why I think all mathematicians should be forced to learn advanced biology to round out their ability to understand complex variable systems better. The way an artistic mind (and natural systems) accomplishes magic is by being able to overlay or superpose multiple related sets of information such that their interconnection is obvious. This is the most powerful use of art: Multi-layered data.  The above is an artistic expression of art itself. It directly communicates the ability for white space and imprecision to compress data. Imagine if the two interleaved images were related in some way that showed a relationship between them instead of the arbitrary interlocking shown above? How about this picture of acting made from actors? With it we get just a little closer:  \u201cOkay cool, fine, multi-layered or compressed info\u2026 what\u2019s this got to do with emergence and compartmentalization? Do you even have a point?\u201d Yes, point is that the performance of real \u201cmagic,\u201d or the closest thing to it, is using the power of being able to put together concepts in an overlapping fashion such that they are arranged in a way that is more about lateral connection than it is about linear connection. It\u2019s much like timing. It\u2019s an arrangement that has certain power that is like a coiled spring or conformational energy in biological molecules. It\u2019s energetic information that can have an impact. \u201cOh, come on! Now, you\u2019re just talking wooish BS. Energy in concepts? Seriously?\u201d Okay I told you I might lose you. Right now, however, the interaction of information with energy is a fertile field in physics. There\u2019s not much I can give in the way of a defense that will appeal to a pedantic mind other than to focus upon those developments and specifically shannon entropy if you\u2019re actually interested in exploring. The point here is that fuzzy imprecision is the closest thing to magic and I\u2019m answering how it can be used, or at least conceived of, by a given person. We use probability to deal with imprecision and chaos. Even deterministic chaos that has very finite immutable mechanics must be dealt with by using imprecise methods like probability. Using emergence requires certain tools and concepts to even deal with the complexity. It\u2019s not really magic, but it might as well be since certainly levels of complexity are unapproachable using precision based systems. One last analogy and then we\u2019re done: Imagine thousands of tiny conveyor belts of any length you want could be arranged in space however you like. Imagine you wanted to assemble all the parts to an engine using these conveyor belts, such that you set all the parts in space at the right point and aimed the conveyor belts properly such that all the pieces ran into each other in just the right way. One would have to be able to conceive of not just the arrangement of the engine in a linear fashion but also the simultaneous locations of all the parts that would eventualy come together. If you could see the way our reality comes together in a broad enough sense and knew the way things transformed via the butterfly effect, could you not arrange strangely disconnected seeming things in way to come together like those conveyor belts to create something that is not just a collection of events, not just a pile of car parts, but an engine capable of doing something more. Could you not create a convergence that is greater than the sum of its parts because of its simultaneous arrangement? I believe our minds are capable of doing these things using the same skill an artist uses to arrange concepts in an overlapping fashion. I know I attempt to use \u201cmagic\u201d all the time. I\u2019m doing it right now. Otherwise why would I even care to tell you all this? ",

            "answer_text": "You guys will get a kick out of this! Have spent the last few weeks in a foreign county (St. Louis, MO-you can tell that it\u2019s foreign because everybody uses their turn signal) and the temperature up here has been dancing around the single digits. From the wrong side of zero. Anyway, I staggered out of bed, managed to eat some \u2018Raisin Bran\u2019 without stabbing myself in the forehead with the spoon, sucked down a liter of coffee without getting any second degree burns, and then I headed up to the local Schnuck\u2019s to grab some shaving cream and a razor (in the interest of NOT coming home with a radio collar, a dart in my butt, a tag in my ear, and large \u201c#6\u201d painted on my back-the local biologists are a little exuberant.) Managed to get to the check-out line (they are taking tips from Wal-Mart and promising to \u201copen a second lane every time they get at least 60 people in a single line\u201d) without running into anyone\u2019s cart or pitching face-first into the fresh shrimp display, so points for me. A couple was in line in front of me-and was so cheerful that I wanted to slap them-8:35 in the morning is NOT the time for giddy playfulness-unless it\u2019s from sleep deprivation. Or if one was approaching the hour from the rear with a beer in hand during an epic party-your call. The guy was doing some coin tricks-and I have to tell you (as a prestidigitator myself) some were really really good. I used to make a fortune as a waiter entertaining the kiddies with coin tricks. His name was Vance (and Shelly); simply listening to the two of them cooing at each other almost put me into insulin shock. What I found out was that (like me) they had a friend embezzle a bunch of money; they had just crawled out of a miserable 4 year hole and were \u201ccelebrating\u201d with a rare extra $20-doughnuts, espresso, some sort of exotic cheese. (Trust me; $20 doesn\u2019t go far\u2026). Shelly kept snapping the twenty like she could get it to turn into a fifty. I congratulated them, and told them that I was sorry not only for their trouble, but also that I could comprehend it so keenly. They laughed. And, as the universe normally does, it was then that we all got popped in the chops: there was a lady in front of us buying a scant amount of groceries. She was pretty threadbare, and had the look on her face that indicated that life wasn\u2019t going particularly well (I recognized at, as I have seen it staring back from my mirror for the last 6 years). Her coat was really ratty and patched, and she was wearing a crocheted hat that had been made in the \u201870s. She was buying some baby food and powdered milk, but was having to count out-literally-nickels and pennies to pay for it. One of the items that really stood out was a single small cup of chocolate yogurt pudding with a spoon attached-it was obvious that was going to be a rare treat for her. And\u2026she didn\u2019t have enough money. The look on her face was one that I hope I never ever see again-but it looked at home on her. She picked up the pudding, and asked the checkout girl if she could put it back for her. It was obvious that she wasn\u2019t going to forsake even one jar of baby food. Her face kinda crumpled with disappointment. I figured \u201cAhh, what the hell\u2026\u201d and started to reach into my wallet-when I heard it. Behind me, no less than five other people had just watched what was going on, and were reaching into THEIR wallets/purses/pockets! The girl saw what was happening, and her face turned beet red. She just shook her head \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d, and started to put her treat back up. Vance nudged his wife; she just looked at him and gave him a thumb up. And he stepped in. Vance then tapped the lady on the shoulder- \u201cMa\u2019am, I believe you dropped that.\u201d Pointing to the ground. I saw him reach down behind her by her foot with a totally outstretched empty hand-and them he straightened back up and presented her with a folded up $20 bill. The lady protested \u201cThat\u2019s not mine\u2026\u201d But Vance assured her that he had just watched it come out of her purse. \u201cIt was just on the ground behind you! Maybe you didn\u2019t notice it because it was folded\u2026\u201d The lady looked incredulous-but after a minute of him insisting she took the twenty, bought her groceries, and told him \u201cThank You!\u201d She definitely looked stunned-but started smiling a little. Her step bounced a little as she left. I thought it was pretty neat-then I noticed Vance and Shelly getting out of line to go replace their three items. They left the store arm in arm, smiling, laughing, and goofing around. Without buying a thing. And then I realized what he had done-prestidigitation is just mis-direction, after all. Then I remembered that he told me he was a magician. I very rarely meet anyone that can actually do true magic. ",
