Each citizen has a set amount of time to serve in the capacity of the career politicians which would be tied to health care and all government benefits. Then with no real politicians we would have to have a rule somewhere that states that if taking money or anything for a vote would negate all future benefits to that person doing service so that is not desirable.

There is nothing more that you can do as an individual. If you are a citizen of a country governed by a particular political group's decree, there is nothing that you can do unless the ruling group has views similar to yours. ",
