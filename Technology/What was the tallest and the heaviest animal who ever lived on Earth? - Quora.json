            "answer_text": "The tallest animal that ever lived on Earth would almost certainly be some kind of Sauropod dinosaur, though which one would depend on the beastie\u2019s life posture, which is unknown, because all we have is scattered remains. Candidates include: Argentinosaurus, a titanosaur from the Late Cretaiceous of some South American country or other. This is the largest land animal in overall terms known to date, with estimates of weight being up to 100 tonnes and total length up to 35 metres. But the neck is not known as yet, so such estimates relay on coparison with smaller, closely related creatures. Patagotitan is a better known but very similar genus also from Argentina, which is generally regarded as slightly smaller.Xinjiangtitan (again its location is given away by its name) is a very large genus of mamenchisaurid, a Jurassic clade distinguished by ridiculously long necks, so although it probably only weighed around half as much as Argentinosaurus, it might have been as tall or taller, depending on how upright it held its neck.Another possible candidate is Sauroposeidon, from early Cretaceous North America. This is another very long necked genus.Depending on the accuracy of current reconstructions and on life posture, which is impossible to know for certain, any of these might have been able to raise their heads to about 17\u201318 metres off the ground. The heaviest animal ever is the blue whale, a.k.a. Sibald\u2019s rorqual (Balaenoptera musculus), which has a greatest confirmed weight of 173 tonnes. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the biggest animal ever to exist on Earth?By considerable measure, the largest known animal on Earth is the blue whale. Mature blue whales can measure anywhere from 75 feet (23 m) to 100 feet (30.5 m) from head to tail, and can weigh as much as 150 tons (136 metric tons). That's as long as an 8- to 10-story building and as heavy as about 112 adult male giraffes! These days, most adult blue whales are only 75 to 80 feet long; whalers hunted down most of the super giants. Female blue whales generally weigh more than the males. The largest blue whale to date is a female that weighed 389,760 pounds (176,792 kg). A blue whale's head is so wide that an entire professional football team -- about 50 people -- could stand on its tongue. Its heart is as big as a small car, and its arteries are wide enough that you could climb through them. Even baby blue whales dwarf most animals. At birth, a blue whale calf is about 25 feet (7.6 m) long and weighs more than an elephant. And they do grow up fast: During the first 7 months of its life, a blue whale drinks approximately 100 gallons (379 liters) of its mother's milk per day, putting on as much as 200 pounds (91 kg) every 24 hours. An adult blue whale can eat more than 4 tons (3.6 metric tons) of krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature, every day. This puts blue whales well above any known land mammal in terms of size. Most people believe that the largest animals to ever exist on Earth were the dinosaurs. However, one of the largest land dinosaurs, the sauropod Argentinosaurus, weighed only about 180,000 pounds (81,647 kg). That's little more than half the size of an adult blue whale. It makes a lot of sense that the world's largest animal would be a sea creature. Land animals have to support their own weight, whereas sea creatures get some help from the water ",

Without looking up the last, up to the minute discovered animal, I will say Siezmosaurus. Although I believe that is one of the giant sauropods that got a name change. I will say it is one of the giant sauropods! ",
