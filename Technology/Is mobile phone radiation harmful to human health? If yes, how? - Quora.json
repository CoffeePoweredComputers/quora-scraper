            "answer_text": "They warm us up by an amount too small to measure. Seriously. That\u2019s it. Cell phones emit microwave energy\u2014electromagnatic \u201cradiation\u201d that is way, way down at the low energy end of the spectrum.  X-rays and gamma rays are harmful. They have enough energy that if a photon is absorbed by an atom, an electron can be dislodged, breaking chemical bonds. This sort of radiation \u2014 ionizing radiation \u2014 can kill or damage cells and among other things, cause cancer. Microwave and radio photons cannot do that. Period. They can\u2019t. Really, no, they can\u2019t. I realize I just said that same thing three times, but that\u2019s only because it\u2019s so important, I WANT YOU TO PAY ATTENTION. Cell phones emit microwaves\u2014roughly the same frequency as used by a microwave oven. These photons cannot break chemical bonds. When absorbed, that can only add to the kinetic energy of the absorbing atom, and therefore the absorbing material. If you pump a large quantity of microwave photons into a closed metal box containing a potato, they will bound around and around, until eventually they are absorbed. This will NOT give rise to Mr. Potato Head or a mutant 400 foot stomping potato monster. It will just warm up the potato. If you put a cell phone up to your head, the microwaves it emits will just fly through your head and keep going. Every once in a while, a microwave photon will be absorbed by an atom in your head\u2014and give that atom a little more kinetic energy, overwise known at \u201cheat.\u201d It will not break any chemical bonds. It will not give you cancer. It will not turn you into Spiderman\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s doctor\u2019s 400 foot stomping potato monster. Stop obsession over the word \u201cradiation.\u201d It just means \u201cthat which radiates through space.\u201d Look here when I press the button\u2026there here answer will radiate our to servers and workstations and cell phones all over the world. It\u2019s Ra-di-ation. Look out! ",

            "answer_text": "Science shows that we all are affected by radiations to some level whether we feel it or not. Because the reason is essentially our body is electric. Every cell in our body communicate using tiny electric signals. That\u2019s how our nervous system operates, so to think we can put an exponential amount of microwaves radiations into our environment and not feel its affects is simply false. Our exposure to wi-fi devices which emits microwave radiations/emr has increased 100 times in last 15 years. Every living or working spaces have multiple devices which are radiating all the time (mobile phone, laptops, router, booster, mobile towers, high tension lines etc.).To illustrate this, more and more people now days experience headaches when they wake up as they keep their phones next to their heads while asleep and wi-fi are never switched off while sleeping. People also experience, insomnia, irritation, fatigue, loss of concentration, behavioural problems in children (ADHD), loss of immunity, DNA damage and eventually cancer. This is what the research has started to show. If you simply google EMF research, WHO report on 2011 is the first to come up. They concluded mobile phone radiations are possible carcinogenic. FCC is supposed to be regulating wireless technology. But if you see their regulations are almost 20 years old. That means our most advanced technology is using science at least 20 years old. Not only that their concept is 50 years old which says microwaves radiations does not heat us, then it can\u2019t possibly hurt us. But 100 of studies are available that shows it does. Science is also heavily influenced by industry funded researches. 70% of independent studies shows effects and only 32% on industry funded studies shows effects. So there is influence of money in studies. ",
