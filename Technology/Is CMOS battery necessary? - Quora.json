            "answer_text": "Depends on the computer\u2019s BIOS design but usually this is true: CMOS is required for the clock to continue keeping time when the computer is off. If the battery is gone your clock will not keep time until you turn on the computer where the clock will be powered by the computer power supply. So you can turn it on, enter the BIOS settings and set the time and then continue to boot up. Or let the time be wrong and continue to boot up which will screw up the dates for any files you create or the OS creates while running. (Best to set the date and time.) I have booted up many times with a dead CMOS battery \u2014 but remember to set the time and date. If Microsoft gets confused you can mess up backup programs and other time based programs. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with the other 2 responses, a CMOS battery is necessary to maintain the clock and BIOS settings when a device is turned off. In fact I usually swap the battery on the motherboards with the system turned ON, that will eliminate the need to go back thru the BIOS settings manually. ",
