            "answer_text": "If someone tries to access your account on another device, you may be sent a notification about it, and then would have to go through a verification code process in order to re-access your account. In the case that someone does enter your account without your permission and you weren\u2019t aware of this happening, there are a few things you could look for to see if the account has been compromised. For instance, check the search history to see if there were any unfamiliar recent user searches. You can view the previous posts that you\u2019ve liked from your account by going to your user profile. If the other user engaged with other content while in your account you can try to trace that by looking at your previously liked photos to see if you spot anything unfamiliar. Lastly, you can take a look at the profile itself to see if any information in your bio or profile image has been altered. To be safe, it would be advisable to change your password to prevent another user from accessing your account in the future. ",

Instagram will inform you if someone tries to log in using another device with a push in your account. In such situation, you'll choose to allow or avoid the user has an access to your account. However, if you are already logged in, you actually have no way of knowing unless you know what you\u2019re looking for. That\u2019s why you need to monitor suspicious activity like uploads that you didn\u2019t publish, followers you don\u2019t recognize or people you are following that you don\u2019t remember following.

However, if Instagram believes that this login may be due to your account being compromised (A random login from India) they will lock your account and send you a email. Then once you have received word about your Instagram account being compromised you will be able to change the password and login once more as usual. If someone logs into your account, you will also be logged off. This is an easy way to find out if someone has logged in due to the fact that you will be kicked off and asked to login once more. A great way to avoid never having your Instagram compromised is to change your password on a consistent basis. Therefore, there is no possibility that your account can be compromised. ",

The only possible way you can get to know that your account was opened is if there are any changes into your account. By changes I mean updated bio, changed profile pic, uploaded photo or deleted photo. If someone logs into your account and likes or comment on other users photo or video it's very tough to find that.
