            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A.. My answer is US specific. Most people that start a technology consulting business do so after working in the particular field for a while. I worked in Middleware Big Systems Design and Delivery for several years before opening up my small business. I had a plan that targeted companies that used the products that I worked on. Eventually, I landed some good contracts. Have a business plan.Save some ca$h up. Having cash on hand puts you in the catbird seat. Without cash, it\u2019s tough to run a business.Do everything legally.Establish a corporate framework that will see you through your first five years: A corporation or LLC.Establish your EIN or tax number with the Federal GovernmentComply with State and local requirements for taxes, insurance, business licensing, etc.Open a business bank accountObtain business credit cards (probably in your name but has business on it - adds to credibility).Get business cards, web site and begin low-level marketingBuild a sales pipeline.Depending on your business, either hire employees to carry out the work or partner with sub-contractors and take a cut. This may depend on how your agreement to deliver is framed.In the US, you can reach out to the Small Business Administration (SBA). The SBA has a specific program, called SCORE, wherein local senior business leaders volunteer time to mentor people to put together their small business plans. See SCORE at: SBA Offices and Resource Partners This is merely the tip of the iceberg. Good Luck! ",
