            "answer_text": "In general the newer phones are better, but since the 12 hasn\u2019t been announced let along released you really only have two ways to have it. (1) you work at Apple, and the phone is nice even if it might be running a very early iOS 15 now, and that can be buggy\u2026but it is inconvenient to use as you will need written approval from two levels up in your management chain and to have an Apple physical security expert (I.e. one of those ex-military guys) escort you if you ever want to use it outside of Apple\u2019s offices. Or maybe they have rolled that back to an earlier era\u2019s rules and you need to keep it in one of three specific brands of gun safe (Apple provided) while working at home due to COVID-19. Either way this isn\u2019t the phone you are just casually going for a stroll. (2) you stole it, and now you need to worry that you will be found out and maybe go to jail or at least face a civil suit. Neither seem like fun. So in both cases at the moment the 11 is better. After the 12 comes out it is very likely to be better. ",
