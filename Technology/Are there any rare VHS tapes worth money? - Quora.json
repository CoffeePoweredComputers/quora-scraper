            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. There are a few but not many. Looking on sites such as eBay or Craigslist might give you some ideas. Recently I've seen copies of Beauty and the Beast in the black diamond bubble cases by Disney going from $500 to $5000. There were also other Disney black diamond movie bundles going for absurd prices. Movies that won't get transferred to DVD will also become more valuable over time such as b-rated horror/scary movies. Lastly films that have been banned such as Songs of the South or movies from the video nasty list such as Delirium aka psycho puppet will be worth quite a bit now. It really comes down to what people will pay. Never did I think my VHS copy of Beauty and the Beast could sell for $500 considering I paid $25 or so for it in '92. Hope this helps :) ",

            "answer_text": "Well my favorite genre of films is horror and when I was collecting VHS, I would look for films that never got a release on DVD or bluray which now is pretty hard because a-lot of obscure titles have gotten released on either format but there are still some there that have only been put out on VHS. I would also look for Wizard video releases as most Wizard video releases still fetch a good amount. I also love pro wrestling so trying to find anything pre change of name for the WWE is good. Most WWF Coliseum tapes are pretty valuable because even though the WWE network has most of their tapes on their, they are either edited, music altered, what have you \u2026. the Coliseum tapes have everything intact. Any WCW tapes will also bring money, the earlier the better. ",

I don\u2019t think they\u2019re that rare, though, given how many were produced originally, but I\u2019ve seen high prices close to the thousands. There are some rare b-movies, especially in the horror genre (I found one on eBay called \u201cThe Strangeness\u201d that someone else bought already), but I keep seeing people sell them for $25, tops. I guess it depends on whom you ask and how much they\u2019d like to charge. ",
