            "answer_text": "I am a final year UG Chemical Technology student with Oil, Fats and Surfactants as my specialization at LIT Nagpur. As far as I\u2019ve seen and experienced chemical technology, there\u2019s absolutely no harm in taking up the course. You definitely have to get rid of all the doubts and inferiority complex to excel. If you\u2019re getting a reputed college, by which I mean, even if it is not an IIT, even in that case you need not worry much. Obviously your starting salary will depend a lot on your college\u2019s reputation, the companies that come for campus placements and obviously your worth as you present yourself in the interview. If you\u2019re good at your studies and decent enough at the overall performance parameters for an engineer, it is definitely never going to be a problem. Well, Of course you won\u2019t be able to apply for a few PSUs but that doesn\u2019t mean the end of the world. There are many companies out there that need polymer technologists because obviously it is no joke to know the \u2018polymers\u2019 ! You\u2019re anytime going to be in demand given the requirements of the chemical engineering world in our present and future contexts. Yea..you won\u2019t be taught a few fluid dynamics \u2018in depth topics\u2019. But that is just it. Everything else remains the same.You will definitely be taught polymer science more than a chemical engineer ! (wink) To name a few companies - Pidlite, Asian Paints, Nerolac, Reliance, Tata - all these industries and many more recruit polymer technologists because obviously - you know the polymers man ! That is a big deal. And yea..all through your college time a lot of people will pass you looks and comments for not having a score enough to be able to get CHEMICAL ENGINEERING. D\u2019you care ? Decide for yourself. And if I forgot to mention - research can always happen ! So, to be very honest, you can definitely give it a shot if you want after a detailed background research about your college stats ! (If you\u2019d like to know - I got placed already in a campus interview) Good luck ! I joined Quora today. This one\u2019s my first answer. Hope it helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they are nearly equivalent. You can apply for companies like IOCL , GAIL ,ONGC after doing B.Tech in Chemical Technology but not for Polymer science technologyAlso many subjects like fluid mechanics and mass transfer are not covered fully in these branches which creates lots of problem afterwards.Scope of these branches are less if you apply for off campus as they prefer pure chemical engineers everywhere . Also the chances of getting placement is very less in these branches.But there are polymer companies which hire polymer science students at good salary.If you have already completed your diploma in chemical engineering then you should try and take admission in Chemical engineering only. That knowledge will help you afterwards.But chemical technology and polymer science technology is a very interesting subject where some new domains of applied chemistry are discoveredYou are also then eligible to do M.tech in paper technology from IIT Roorkee or rubber technology from IIT kharagpur",
