            "answer_text": "No unethical experiment can ever have a positive effect on the society. You cannot reach a good end through bad means. The problem with human society is that people are bad. They are bad inside them. That can never be changed now. Therefore, humans will suffer, they will cause pain to the innocents of the World, namely animals and little children, and therefore, the perpetrators of the crimes, and all their accomplices, will suffer in Hell after their deaths, and the descendants will instinctively seek to take revenge for the invisible suffering of their ancestors in Hell. This will never stop, as the descendants who seek to take revenge will only condemn themselves to Hell. If humans never changed after the hugely unethical experiment that took place in Germany in the 1930\u2019s, namely Nazism, then they will never change. It\u2019s obvious. They will only get worse and worse and worse. Hundreds of trillions of animals have been senselessly imprisoned and tortured, and a billion little children have been starved to death. The Earth has been largely ruined, and billions of species have been rendered extinct by Man\u2019s furious hooliganism. Starving to death is hideously painful, and for the World it\u2019s a crime to starve people to death. Causing any unnecessary pain to whoever, or whatever, is a crime, and it is punished with Hell. Hell is invisible so that other creatures are not disturbed by the vision of people suffering. No punishments will ever be carried out visibly. They never have, and they never will. Those who enact false justice in this World, should remember that they are punished with Hell for enacting false justice. There is no justice other than the justice of God, and that is carried out in another dimension. The only legal prison system on the Earth, is the Norway prison system, where the prisoners are not punished, only segregated from the society, to prevent social damages. That system would have been approved by Jesus Christ. Any act you commit that contradicts the advice of Jesus Christ is likely to be a criminal act in this world. Whether you are forgiven or not, depends on the entity of the crime. It must be said that sins are not quite the same as horrible crimes are. People do not say that Adolf Hitler was simply a sinner. No, he was a criminal. Sins are like not dressing tidily, telling little fibs, or not shaving your beard, or things like that. Being a prostitute would be a sin, and being a user of prostitutes is a sin, unless you are exploiting the prostitutes, in which case it is a crime. Buying pornography is a sin. Having a secret extra-marital affair is a sin, etc. As you see, those sins are different from the ghastly crimes of the Nazis. And they are different from the other hideous crimes that have happened here on Earth since 1950. Possessing weapons of mass destruction is a crime, especially if they threaten other creatures as well as human beings. Possessing hydrogen bombs is a heinous crime. Churches and temples are not wanted in this World. They create a division between Man and Nature. Jesus Christ said that people would not find God in their temples. Jesus Christ said that God could be found everywhere, in the forests, in the deserts, in the seas, but not in the temples. The expenditure of countless billions of dollars on building and maintaining churches is an offence to the World, especially when there are hundreds of millions of desperate people, who find it hard to get enough to eat, let alone build themselves houses. So, there is no experiment that you can ever do to correct negative people. They are negative inside them, and nothing can change them, ever, now. And to repeat, if it is an unethical experiment, it will only have a very bad result. Humanity had a big chance to change inside its soul, but it decided to get worse instead. By now, the pull of their own misdeeds is so strong, that, mathematically, the people of the Earth can never get out of it. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is too cute by considerably more then half. If you hadn\u2019t specifically asked me, I wouldn\u2019t be addressing this. First it\u2019s not grounded in anything wise, defined or really much of anything else. How then can the answers be meaningful when they have to grapple with the smoke that is the question? \u201cUnethical\u201d has a wide range of meaning, ethics having to do with the philosophy of morality mostly. I can only assume you\u2019re using it in a colloquial way to mean immoral. Can good come out of bad? - is what you\u2019re trying to explore, your premise being that if many benefit, that has to make it at least more OK. Its the quintessential slippery slope argument at its worst. I\u2019m often but not necessarily, not a fan of this argument but particularly here. If you start out with something that you know is fundamentally wrong & then try to ameliorate it, then it necessarily corrupts all that follows. The rule of thumb is, the reverse is always but always better to strive for. Starting with something good & then minimizing the worst or \u201cunethical\u201d aspects. In real time especially. The first is simply cynicism, which is the one thing there must always be zero tolerance for. Skepticism is of course necessary but this is not that. The human imagination is the preeminent characteristic that makes humans more powerful (for good or ill) then any other life form. It allows one to rationalize the premise of this question. You\u2019re a CEO of a business in LA Peter, & this question strongly smacks of the pragmatic. The word & concept is mostly used to insist that the lowest hanging fruit must always be reached for & reaching any higher is very aggressively dismissed. This dovetails rather neatly with the core principle & engine that drives all capitalism: Removing any & all obstacles to generating capital. Please understand, I\u2019m an entrepreneur so I well understand the priority of creatively inserting morality into business in such a way that trust is established makes life worthwhile on so many levels. Also, my becoming a part of all the ugliness of the world is at least very usefully minimized. Instead of \u201cpragmatic\u201d I use the word practical. Lets get to the heart of the matter this all revolves around. Morality can be usefully defined in clear even stark terms that are scientifically irrefutable. A first principle of demonstrable, axiomatic truth. For starters, it is indisputably not a psychological or social construct. It is incontrovertibly biological at the very deepest levels. Morality is an outgrowth of our biological capacity for empathy. Out of which Love (& all healthy socialization) also emerges that we exercise, because we are also intrinsically social creatures. Everything important in the most practical terms, attempting to express itself in sublime ways is mostly composed of Love - Integrity, dedication, authentic sincerity, honesty (especially with oneself), courage, honour etc. & must be a component of everything done or its literally worthless.* This is because empathy is a biological instinct so much bigger than any one of us. It's there for the perpetuation of the species. We would neither procreate w/o it or nearly as often or have any meaningful intimacy with virtually anyone - or stick around to raise the offspring. This is why emotional intelligence & empathy are just a form of this & the inevitable reason why it is the best predictor of all levels of the most profound happiness, fulfillment, success & prosperity in life. The unconscious will always rebel if this is suppressed & denied otherwise. In terms of a compromised immune system - within minutes (countless studies have shown). Opening us up to every 1) Physical & 2) Psychological malady - as unconscious anxieties ever intrude on our conscious life, requiring increasing effort to contain & making us psychologically unbalanced as our anxieties increasingly intrude on oour conscious mind (the textbook definition of insanity - it being a matter of degree). Honouring it is thus necessarily where all lasting joy (not just a component of it, pleasure) & all levels & kinds of prosperity lies. I understand how this can all get blurred in business & when one is dealing with Artists & the Los Angeles community. I say this next not unsympathetically. I once saw a repeat of a special 2 part episode of the original Law & Order series (done well before the CSI derivatives) where one of the detectives has gone to LA to chase a criminal & at the end of the second episode is chatting with a female V.P. of a Hollywood studio. She tells him she\u2019s leaving the business. He exclaims, \u201cYou\u2019re so good at it, why would you want to leave!\u201d Her reply I\u2019ve been told by many who\u2019ve done business in LA is uncomfortably close to describing a sensibility that is unfortunately too common. She replied, \u201cI\u2019m tired of being in an industry where everyone talks like hippies - but acts like hit men.\u201d The selfishly pragmatic propelled by fear based reasoning, self indulgence & psychological laziness, is apparently somewhat greater there, then many other business cultures in N.A. It can be a challenge to navigate through I\u2019m sure, especially when there are so many enablers implicit within it. The creativity used to passionately rationalize the \u201cunethical\u201d there are legendary. *The shortcut that will always tell you most directly if something is intrinsically moral to a meaningful degree, is look for any of the components that are mostly made up of Love mentioned. If the cleverness & fear (& all the selfishness & psychological laziness that are emanate from it) dominate, you have your answer. It\u2019s not always perfectly simple to do but its always the place you start that yields the the best results most frequently & consistently. Even trying & looking like you are builds trust & respect from everyone. ",

            "answer_text": "The whole point of declaring something unethical\u2014when the term is used right\u2014is to say something shouldn\u2019t be done because it\u2019s not worth an intangible cost. So, the unethical experiment that would have the biggest positive impact is likely one that\u2019s just almost worth doing. The experiments most often called \u2018unethical\u2019 inappropriately are mostly those that involve stem cell research. Religious people in the United States have some very strange beliefs surrounding human conception, involving \u2018souls\u2019 and applying human rights to things that aren\u2019t human in any meaningful way, and this has been blocking vital, life-saving medical research that could benefit all of humanity. I don\u2019t know which specific experiments could be most helpful. It\u2019s hard to know until after they\u2019ve been completed, more than once. But the field in general has a lot of untapped potential. There\u2019s many people that will never be able to have children of their own unless more research is done in this area, and stem cell research is relevant to curing cancer and congenital illnesses, and creating replacement organs without the need for an organ donor. It doesn\u2019t hurt anyone, since human embryos are not people\u2014it would make more sense to ban the use of lab rats than to ban the use of so-called \u2018babies\u2019 that have developed for less than seven weeks since conception. Abortions occur naturally at this stage of development all the time, without potential mothers even being aware of it. Unfortunately, the public is not well educated about this, and often intentionally misled by their religious and political leaders. ",

            "answer_text": "I think if we could find some way to round up all hypothetical questioners who craft scenarios that attempt to prove situation ethics or moral relativism useful, and strap the situation ethics people to one trolley track, and strap the moral relativism people to another, and then take, say, one logical positivist, and strap him or her to the switch, and instruct the logical positivist as follows: \u201cThese are parallel, non-intersecting tracks. One has a trolley coming down it. The other has a trolley coming up it. The switch you are tied to connects to nothing. WHAT DO YOU DO?\u201d Then while the logical positivist is sputtering protests, CLACKALACKA WOOOSH! Both trolleys roll by! CRUNCH! Arms flying one way! CRUNCH! Legs flying another! The whole thing could be televised. I bet it would sour a lot of people on the value of bullshit. They\u2019d be like, \u201cHey, that was a no-win proposition purely designed to cloud our sweet clean decent moral clarity and get us to hesitate for real in a true life situation with everything riding on it!\u201d And to anyone not thereby discouraged, it would provide at least a stern warning. Oh, by the way: no unethical experiment can benefit society. For whatever else its effect may be, it encourages the already pernicious and dangerous impression among professional experimenters that they should circumvent ethics without regard for their protection of and benefit to society, if a neat experiment has been thought of that can\u2019t be done (at this time) within them. Also: humanity is water running downhill. The silt of our ignorance washes away, to expose the hard substrate of reality\u2019s limits and attributes. The knowable is inevitable. We needn\u2019t run dangerous shortcuts through the few recognized ethical checks and blocks we\u2019ve actually managed to agree upon. Ignoring safety and ethical requirements (such as for informed consent) will jeopardize more lives across the board than any mad dash you think will get us there faster in one case can possible save. The performers of the experiment should also be killed. I\u2019ve decided. While we\u2019re at it. That would have some value (deterrent), and tend to work a corrective on the otherwise bad impression created. While I\u2019m at it, the experiment should cure cancer! I\u2019m not sure how one can cure cancer by running over a lot of people with trolleys, but as long as we\u2019re dreaming and wishing away, hey why not! And isn\u2019t it worth the sacrifice, to cure cancer in a one-time gross violation of ethics and be summarily executed for your trouble? I say it is. It is to me. And I\u2019m the one who designed the brilliant, cancer-cure death trolley experiment, so! Come get me. Soon as the headlines cry \u201cCANCER CURED! RANDOM HYPOTHETICAL-SLAUGHTERING TROLLEY MASTERMIND JACKASS ON QUORA RESPONSIBLE! DEATH BE UNTO HIM FOR DOING IT UNETHICALLY,\u201d I\u2019ll be satisfied. I\u2019d be a martyr to something people won\u2019t even be able to explain. Probably cop a sweet Nobel Prize! My legacy would be something unspeakable. These are all just hypothetical people, mind you. To be clear; to reassure all. Everyone in my answer is as hypothetical as the question was. If you could cure real cancer by executing hypothetical people, wouldn\u2019t you? Even if I had to die in the process? Pay no attention to the trolley. Keep off the track, though. Just in case. ",

I\u2019d probably start out with a VR headset but more along the lines of google glass so once they\u2019re hooked to it like smart phones, they\u2019ll take it everywhere. The selling point would be VR but you would be able to make in store changes to your appearance and gear to others to prey on vanity. It would have to be connected with a cloud that would use machine learning to outline shapes and reconstruct environments out of reality to fantasy once you but you glasses on. Eventually different areas could choice their fantasy environment looks like pasted over what physically exists with a block chain. As the tech increases and more people check out wandering the streets on quests, or using the VR with over sexualized chosen personal skins (the result should be obvious), I\u2019d go after my real purpose a the gaming/actually perception change would just be a way to recruit for a massive social experiment. Ready Player One makes the mistake on not combining reality with VR to make a synthetic one to cover up all their problems with skin overlays. By controlling how people perceive actually reality, the sky would be the limit for my new arm of the police state. I\u2019d use the headbands to incorporate real time brainwaves for the AI and use it to make slight adjustments to the user\u2019s perceptions until the desired result was acquired. Other vitals would be built into the wearable gear and as nano tech evolves, that would allow for complete monitoring. Mean while people would be playing VR games at the park, one portion of reality could be like lazer tag but with the accuracy and skin of call of duty. Foam handhelds could be used for melee weapons as direct violence would get you booted from the game. Pokemon would be simple, as well as other varieties. The Game engine would be large but only set to certain locations so if you wanted to stay in one game, you\u2019d travel to other locations participating in that scenario. Eventually they would be blended as automation put most people out of work and it would be a way to add meaning to their service sector jobs by the time the VR world has merged with the state. Actually jobs and practices would run through the Sky net of the game to create a that is only possible with a full body suit. At this point I\u2019d have complete control over the people, their reality, and the means of production. The AI would focus on giving them meaning based on their read outs while giving potential wrong doers a lock out and shut down of their suits as well as their virtual wealth\u2026 no one would be beyond big brother. Waste would be reduced by group meals lodges for companionship and all the material bs would be made digital. Food would be rationed to cut down on farm space and eventually become a composite of bugs with a low level effect on the environment though the food would look like chicken, etc and manipulations could be made to taste bud neurons so the taste chicken, etc after the mind has been decoded. All of this would allow man to become sustainable and artificially create meaning, art, wealth, etc while giving it a single goal and self discipline to go and conquer other planets as a safety measure even though every effort would be made to stabilize and protect the earth by those who work in conjunct er with the AI. Mankind would be tricked into doing the right thing while still getting what he wants. It would take a long time but I\u2019d start with China, Japan, SK as they would be most compliant and could work the bugs out before setting it up around the world and eventually merging it. ",

What\u2019s positive is in the eye of the beholder, so we made rules that we think are fair. Allowing as much freedom to each individual as possible, like free speech, freedom to get rich by effort. Something like that. So an unethical experiment is by definition bad for society.
