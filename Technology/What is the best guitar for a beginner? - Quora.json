            "answer_text": "I have been asked this question many times over the decades I have taught guitar, and I totally understand that people want some good advice. I will give you my advice, and you can decide to follow it, or not as you please. What we need to be aware of when we are starting to learn guitar, those first few weeks of learning open chords, how to tune the strings e.t.c is that your finger tips are going to get very sore. This is unavoidable, your finger tips have very sensitive skin, and lots of nerve endings, pressing down very hard on guitar strings (and you will be surprised at just how much pressure you need to use) takes its toll. At this point, many people tend to give up, because they simply did not understand just how sore their finger tips would get. Many beginning players want to start with an electric guitar, or a steel string acoustic - they are told it is fine, that you can play what you like. This is true, of course you can, you can choose to do many things, but it may not be wise to do so. After over 40 years of playing, and teaching a lot of people in that time I have this advice: For the first six months of learning, choose a Yamaha nylon string student model guitar. Once you have been learning for 6 months you will have developed some decent tough skin on your finger tips, you will then be ready for steel strings. This is entirely a practical course of action. This is my advice to anyone who is considering learning guitar. I know this is not the \u2018sexy\u2019 option. Guys want to grab a Les Paul, or a Martin acoustic and get stuck into learning cool riffs, shredding, picking, finger style; I get it. But it is like learning martial arts - you develop the discipline through mastering the rudiments, you don\u2019t immediately start with complex moves and advanced fighting techniques, the DoJo raises your fitness level, works on very simple, basic principles. Same with learning guitar. Starting with a nylon string guitar teaches us many things. We learn to appreciate the nature of guitar music, how to produce good tone, basic strumming patterns; once you are producing a good sound on a nylon string guitar you can play anything. So if you are serious about learning guitar, if you wish to become an accomplished player, if you wish to respect the journey of learning, I recommend beginning with a very modest, Yamaha C-40 nylon string guitar. For the princely sum of around $100 you have your warrior\u2019s training sword; get this baby sounding sweet, and your finger tips conditioned and you will be ready to move to a different instrument if you wish. Try to indulge your fantasy of being a \u2018rock God\u2019 by purchasing an Ibanez \u2018Gem\u2019 and you are likely to fail, it will look very cool leaning against your Marshall stack, but you will sound like a sick cat. This is what I have for you, it is not the sexy path, it is the hard, true path of the Journeyman. There is a lot of nonsense spoken about learning guitar, a lot of short cuts, and expensive online training websites will invite you to pay them a lot of money for the feeling you are now part of their exclusive club; don\u2019t be deceived. The discipline is rigorous, the learning journey is not easy, but the fruits of your work will pay off, and you will become a genuine player. In a world where poseurs and charlatans are trying to impress you with their high speed shredding, you will be a true musician, with an authentic musical soul, you will be able to move people with your vibrato, bring genuine joy, spiritual comfort. Begin with a nylon string guitar, start with the rudiments and you will become a true guitar player, this maybe not what you want to hear, but it is a valid, experience based conclusion based on the careers of many players, including my own.

            "answer_text": "Forget about brands. It is more important to decide on which type of guitar you want. There are three broad categories: classical (nylon string) acoustic (steel string) electric. These can each be further broken down as follows Nylon string: Classical (non cutaway) Classical with cutaway Electro acoustic nylon string (ususally has cutaway) ACOUSTIC: Folk guitar (jumbo, no cutaway) 12 String Folk Concert Acoustic with cutaway Electro-acoustic steel string (usually has cutaway) SEMI-ACOUSTIC (single or double cutaway, F holes, inset neck, fixed bridge or Bigsby vibrato this is a semi-hollow electric guitar, mostly with humbucking pickups, very versatile for everything from Blues through Jazz, Funk and Rock) the best known is probably the iconic Gibson ES-335 SOLIDBODY ELECTRIC: Gibson Les Paul type (has inset neck, fixed bridge or Bigsby vibrato and humbucking pickups - mostly single cutaway.) mostly used for Blues, Rock and Metal These tend to be very heavy Gibson SG type (has inset neck with dual cutaway, usually humbucking pivkups, fixed bridge or Vibrola tailpiece or Bigsby vibrato) mostly used for Blues, Rock and Metal. Lighter than a Les Paul There are many more iconic Gibson models to check out, such as the Firebird, Flying V, ES-175 Fender Telecaster (bolt on neck, single cutaway, two single coil pickups, fixed bridge or Bigsby) this versatile workhorse is mostly used for Country, Jazz, Blues, Rock, Metal can be as heavy as a Les Paul Fender Stratocaster (bolt on neck, double cutaway, 3 single coil pickups and vibrsto bridge) very versatile, and used in every style of music Can be very heavy or quite light, depending on the wood used Ibanez HM style guitars such as Jem series (bolt on neck, pointy double cutaway, various pickup combinations and usually Floyd Rose vibrato bridge) There are thousands of brands nowadays, but those I have picked out are the best known and most popular. These days you can find excellent Chinese copies and even originals very cheaply, which would make an excellent choice for a first guitar. But never buy anything without having done your homework first - go online and read as many articles and reviews as possible. Take a guitar playing friend with you, decide on a price range and try out all the guitars you can afford. Then go to another shop and do the same. Include used instruments too, and don't worry too much about the appearance. The important thing is how it sounds and how well it plays. A guitar with a nice low action which sounds reasonably good will help a great deal toward helping you stick with it. A guitar with a high action that sounds horrible will make you give up before your fingertips have time to harden! If you decide you prefer a used instrument, then look at models outside your price range, make a short list of your favourites, then look for them on the second hand market. ",
