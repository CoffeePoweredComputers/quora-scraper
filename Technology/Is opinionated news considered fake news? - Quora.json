            "answer_text": "Opinionated news is not news at all. The opinion area of the paper is not news, it\u2019s just opinion, an editorial. It\u2019s a single person\u2019s point of view. They may talk about the news, but it\u2019s not a news article by definition. Now when it comes to CNN, MSNBC, and Fox, they really need to stop injected opinion into news. News doesn\u2019t care about feelings. The news is to be reported. Who, what, when, how, and why (if possible). Any opinions tend to bias the news. Biasing the news means you are manipulating the person reading to follow your point of view over simply reporting the news. These can appear in words that offer editorial comments over just the news. For example, take this article from AP Primary night: Dems go for diversity, GOP for Trump choices It manipulates the reader to side with the democrats and paints the GOP in a very negative light through the use of language. A person should make that decision on their own. The article should simply report the news, and not include a language that manipulates the reader. The article above is a perfect example of opinionated news. It\u2019s not fake news, it\u2019s just not news. It should be in the editorial section. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not always, real news contrary to fake news can stay real news and then someone who provides the real news can additonaly say his or her own opinion to the news. on other hand fake news would be to make the news reports biased for propaganda purpose by not mentioning the whole issue, for example the media keeps accusing russia of meddling into the u.s. elections, when there is their so called \u201caipac\u201d \u2014wich is a misnomer on their behalf and actually gog kazarians\u2014 to meddle into the u.s. elections all the time. if the fake news was not fake news but real news, they would have to report their alleged \u201caipac\u201d meddling into the u.s. elections too, if they accuse russia thereof and the opiniated point would be to HONESTLY admit the double standard in their opinion that so called \u201caipac\u201d may meddle into u.s. elections when russians may not even have an opinion on u.s. foreign politics towards russia. to make it easy, someone can tell the news hey, 2+2 is 4 and then say he or she likes it but to distract from 2+2=4 to make invalid points against others is fake news, of course in politics its alot more complicated, as mentioned in the example above.
