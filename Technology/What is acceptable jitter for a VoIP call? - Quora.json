            "answer_text": "30ms is the acceptable jitter for a VoIP Call. Jitter is one of the most common issues faced in a VoIP Call. It\u2019s caused by the division of information passing through the call into packets. Measuring network jitter and knowing how to conduct a ping jitter test is an important part of the network administrators role. VoIP network jitter is congestion generated by millions of internet connections. In this, all the tiny packets of data try to use the same IP network. As as they are all active simultaneously it causes a condition similar to a road jam. As the high levels of jitter may be caused by multiple factors a ping test along would not be enough to pinpoint the root cause. You may try several things to reduce jitter but still, there are some aspects out of your hand. Therefore while removing jitter completely is not possible, there are some well-proved things you can try to reduce them significantly. Use Jitter BufferPacket PrioritisationBandwidth TestOther measures: Check device frequency, Change Ethernet cable, Minimize bandwidth usage",

            "answer_text": "Less than 30 milliseconds is acceptable level of jitter for VoIP calls. It\u2019s not to say you could have a call if it\u2019s over this threshold but you could run into quality issues higher than this. Having a network with Quality of Service (QoS) helps with keeping voice traffic in check over other applications. Some other key elements to consider for having good VoIP calls include: One way latency no more than 150 milliseconds.No packet loss.Enough bandwidth for voice and all other applicationsVoIP is far less demanding compared to video, but it is sensitive compared to other types of traffic on a data network.
