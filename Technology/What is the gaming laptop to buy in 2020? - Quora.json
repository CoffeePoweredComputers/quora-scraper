I personally love the idea of cramming a 17\u2033 high refresh rate screen into a 15\u2033 laptop.  I think the MSI GS75 Stealth is a work of art.  The Dell XPS has the perfect screen-to-bezel ratio  As an all-rounder, however, ASUS takes the gold medal with their ROG Strix Scar II GL704 \u2026  \u2026and they intelligently put all of the ports on the left hand side. Other manufacturers are getting the hint and following these excellent design trends, so 2020 looks to be a very good year for mobile devices!  EDIT: I love this discussion. It shows truly how far we are from really engineering the \u201cperfect\u201d gaming laptop. The inclusion of so many ports on the left side of the ROG GL704 means that cooling was sacrificed, putting it in the same boat as the i9 MacBook pro. Another model I thought to mention was the Acer Predator Triton 500 (reviewed last week by Dave Lee) because of its rock solid design and good cooling. Acer gets an \u201cA\u201d for effort, but the overall design is extremely plain for an $1800 gaming device despite its appealing \u201cboxy\u201d shape\u2014and the interior design makes upgrading a very unappealing prospect. I know they (and all the OEM\u2019s) will make great strides over the next several months to come up with better layouts for 2020. ",

            "answer_text": "A laptop is composed of different parts and each part is responsible for a different type of function. It depends upon your needs which laptop is best for you. So, let's discuss the most important parts of it and check which are suitable for you. 1. Processors It is the most important part and serves the main function of a laptop. It is responsible for the speed of the laptop to perform a task like starting time of a program or windows. So, if you want a laptop with good speed or you want to run heavy programs or games, you have to buy a laptop of the high-speed processor. If you want a high-level gaming processor, it should be minimum 4-Cores (Quad-Core) and clock speed should be more than 3.0 GHz and it should have more than 4MB cache. 2. Rams Ram also has great effect on the performance of a laptop. Ram decides how many programs you can run on a computer at a time. Ram actually loads what you are interacting or working with. So, for high performance or to run heavy programs Ram should be high. Your Ram should be 4GB minimum and if you want more heavy gaming than it should be more than 8GB. 3. Graphic Cards You don\u2019t actually need a graphic card if you are a simple worker and use laptops for simple and average programs. If you want to play heavy games or programs which use heavy graphics then you can think of embedding graphics card. There are two most common brands in the market i.e. AMD and Nvidia. Both are working good and excellent reviews. Starting from 1GB, there are many versions 2GB, 4GB, 8GB, depending upon the requirements of your games or programs. 4. Hard Disk Hard disks are only for storing data. There are two types of hard disks HDD and SSD. HDD is cheap but old technology; therefore, their speed is slow as compared to SSD which are almost 10 times faster but expensive. Hard disk\u2019s speed is measured by the rate of transferring data into or out of the hard drives. ",

            "answer_text": "It truly comes down to what you are using it for. My personal choice is the Dell XPS 15 9575. It's expensive, but I needed several of the features for some of the work I do. I use software called Ekahau to map out Wi-Fi as well as my work machine. I wanted light weight, sturdy, enough RAM and Processing power to handle most jobs, 2:1, touch screen, and the basic discrete gpu is fairly robust considering I don\u2019t play games on it. If I didn't use Ekahau I'd have been perfectly content using a desktop, but I can't take a desktop to do surveys so I had to find something. There were cheaper options, but I liked the XPS the better. They had some Latitudes that were almost what I wanted but used low power processors and ddr3 ram. That kind of money for half the processing power and RAM that's been replaced years ago wasnt for me. So it comes down to your use case. Chromebooks can be bought for around $250 for a decent Acer. They will handle most everything you need for school, work, web, and streaming. Stay away from Apple, I'm bias that I dislike them, but the cost for what you get is pretty poor I believe. Plus software lags behind andngenrrally released on Windows first with the exceptions of a few things. Video editors seem to love them for the software more than the hardware specs so if that's your goal you may consider it. At the end of the say you need to balance your budget with your needs. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on what basis you want to buy that laptop, whether its for gaming or other purposes. Based on extensive testing and research the best laptop right now is the Dell XPS 13, which starts at $799 and boasts a sleek and modern design with powerful specs. Better yet, the Dell XPS 13 2020 is shaping up to be even better than its predecessor, with a larger InfinityEdge display and an improved keyboard. If you're a macOS fan, then the 13-inch MacBook Pro is the best fit for most people. We also love the new 16-inch MacBook Pro for its supremely comfortable keyboard, though you should be wary of its reliability issues. For gamers, we suggest the Alienware m17 R2 or the Razer Blade Pro 17. And if you're willing to pay a premium for a true stunner, the new HP Elite Dragonfly has one of the most gorgeous designs and displays (not to mention epic battery life) that we've seen from a laptop.

MSI GS 66 Stealth if you want the sleekest, most portable and capable gaming device. Alienware Area 51m is still relatively sleek, far more powerful, just balls to the walls. No compromises. Except battery of course. Asus Zephyrus G14 is the most value option with a relatively normal build. Doesn't scream GAMER, is mature but is thicker than the MSI and has some absolute crap components like the Speakers and Display.

Due to small space to accomodate all components we have to sacrifice one of the components such as HDD or few USB ports or SATA ports or cooling. And worst is cooling. Over time cooling become big headache for heavy duty lappys. You have to keep cleaning it every 6 months and heating causes laptop to have short life. ",

Sure you received a lot of suggestions from respondents, based on their personal or perceived preferences, but there is no clear choice. Shop for the hardware specs that you need for your expected use. Chose the laptop that fits your needs and price range. Then research that laptop to make a decision. Check user and review sites reviews, google for issues with the model that you want, if you see a pattern of the same issue being reported by many reviewers or from google searches, look for something else. Do not expect any one manufacturer to have all good or all bad laptops. They all have their great models and they all have their junk. You have to do your homework. Don\u2019t rely on anyone to know what your needs are. ",
