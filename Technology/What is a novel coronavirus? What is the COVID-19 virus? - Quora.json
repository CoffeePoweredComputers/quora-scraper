            "answer_text": "The following is from an email from my doctor to all of his clients, Richard Knight, MD: \u201cAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), \u201cCoronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) us a bew strain that has not been previously identified in humans.\u201d Corona viruses are a large family of viruses, common in many animal species. Only rarely do they spread to humans and cause disease. Three such major incidences have been the SARS outbreak in 2003, the MERS outbreak in 2012, and currently the novel coronavirus COVID-19. SARS was thought to have spread from civet cats to humans, and MERS was thought to have spread from dromedary camels to humans. It is uncertain exactly which animal has propagated the current coronavirus illness. Very little is known thus far about the specifics of COVID-19. Since it is new in humans, it will take some time to understand the virus, the transmission, the incubation period, any seasonality trends, and potential treatments or vaccines to prevent infection. Other viruses such as influenza, have been studied for years and we are able to track trends and understand how it progresses. Since the COVID-19 is novel or new, it is currently uncharted territory. We just don\u2019t know how it will progress. Putting these outbreaks in perspective is important. With the 2003 outbreak of SARS there have been 8,098 documented cases and 774 died. This is approximately la 9.5% mortality rate. In the 2012 outbreak of MERS there were 2494 confirmed cases with 858 associated deaths or about a 35% mortality rate. These numbers may be skewed higher due to the relatively smaller number or overall cases of SARS and MERS. The current COVID-19 outbreak has a morality rate of about 2%. In comparison, influenza has a mortality rate of less than 0.2%. As of today, there are only 13 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the US, and there are no deaths reported in the US. Because of precautionary measures now in place, the virus does not appear to be spreading in the US, and thus the health risk of the virus is very low for the general public in the US. The symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath, with only some also developing sore throat and runny nose. Because these symptoms are similar to many respiratory viruses, it is impossible to distinguish these from the coronavirus based only on symptoms. The virus is spread primarily through respiratory secretions similar to cold viruses and flu. There may be some indication that it can spread through the GI tract, but this is not certain at present. Most respiratory viruses are contracted by either inhaling the virus from close contact with the infected, or by touch and handling of the virus from contaminated surfaces. Preventative measures include good handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; hand sanitizers may help, but are not proven; avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands; stay home when you are sick until fever-free for 24 hours; stay away from contact with others who may be sick; disinfect and clean surfaces or objects that others may also touch such as door knobs, faucet handles, desks, and countertops. Should you wear a face mask? At this time there is no need to rush and obtain surgical or face masks. The types of masks available for use generally would be helpful in reducing the spread of respiratory illnesses, but probably would not protect you from contracting the virus.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The new Covid-19 virus has already killed 5833 of the 156,400 people identified as infected, that's 3.7% or one in twenty-seven. It doesn't sound like much, but the so-called Spanish flu, which killed millions of people in 1918, far more than all the First World War battles, had a much lower death rate. But the true death rate is not quite so easy to calculate. 3.7% of those diagnosed as infected are dead, but many are still sick and more will die, while new cases will be detected. Today (March 15) we observe that so far only 73,968 people have recovered, so we should technically say that 5833 have died out of a total of 79,801 (73,968 cured plus 5833 dead). This gives a mortality rate of over 7% - pretty scary! That\u2019s one person in fourteen, and especially the elderly, one in six apparently. Do you know fourteen people? Which one will die? How old are your parents and grandparents? I note in passing that in South Korea, \"only\" 72 people have died out of 8086 victims, while in Italy, there are already 1441 deaths out of 21,157 infected, an apparent mortality rate almost eight times higher. The difference however is certainly mostly due to the fact that there has been far better screening for people affected in Korea (4.5 times as many per capita) but it seems that there is also an unreported scandal on the quality of hospital care provided in Italy. (Otherwise, if the quality of care is equivalent, we have to assume that there are actually around 38,000 people infected in Italy and not 21,157 ....) It\u2019s worth bearing in mind that the supply of respiratory support beds in hospitals is very limited; if there are too many cases, people will be left to die in the corridors like in China and Italy. And it\u2019s very complicated for hospitals to provide intensive respiratory care to highly contagious people. It\u2019s almost better for you to catch the virus now while there\u2019s room! We can assume that the real mortality rate is actually lower because by necessity it can only be based on people identified as infected. There are certainly many more people infected and showing no or few symptoms but we don\u2019t know how to count or calculate them yet. And I suspect the figures for the number of people healed are not updated as quickly as the number of people infected either. But we can already say that the Covid-19 virus has a mortality rate at least ten to twenty times more than the flu, which kills about 20,000 to 50,000 people each year in US despite the fact that a good part of the population is vaccinated. And there is no vaccine for the coronavirus yet. If this virus gets out of hand and infects a billion people, up to 70 million can be killed. On the whole world population that would be over 500 million\u2026.. It\u2019s no use to panic, but an enhanced awareness of the risk will not hurt \u2026\u2026. I find it unfortunate that some idiots still insist that this virus is no worse than the flu. Can they explain then why the authorities are enforcing all these draconian measures to try to stop the spread if it's just like the flu? Just to destroy our economy, our savings and morale?
