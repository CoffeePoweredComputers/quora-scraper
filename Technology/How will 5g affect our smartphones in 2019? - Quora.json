            "answer_text": "5G is not targeting smartphones at the heart, But saying that, I can\u2019t say it doesn\u2019t enhance the smartphone experience. That would be an understatement. I can go technical about it, but let\u2019s keep it away from it for now. As a part of evolution from 4G to 5G expect better bandwidth as thumb of rule. And along with some other changes on how the software is handled, the operators would be able to handle higher user bases, and as a consequence better quality of service for the users. 5G is more like a critical backbone or infrastructure. It has considerations to help with disasters, Internet of things, and Haptic feedback to name some of the prominent application use cases. 5G as an infrastructure tries to provide lower latency where needed, higher bandwidth where needed, and high user capacity. All this enables to provide for backbones for driverless cars and homes with smart devices connected with the internet. It is the backbone that provides for further development. More smartphones capable of handling 5G radio signals will start up sprouting around the market. And as a user, a more reliable service with higher quality is something to expect. ",
