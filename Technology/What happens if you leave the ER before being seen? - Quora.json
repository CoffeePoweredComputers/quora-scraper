            "answer_text": "Depending on what you are there for and if you were just in the waiting room or actually in an ER room and had any treatment but at the minimum it\u2019ll be documented that you left, any details of treatment you received while there. If you did receive any treatment or care then yeah you\u2019ll still get a bill and I\u2019m sure a phone call or two to check up on you (or should at least). If you are being evaluated for anything that could be potentially self harming, suicidal or danger to others than the police will be called and they will be following up that way. But if you we\u2019re just in the waiting room a notation would be made when they called you to go back and you weren\u2019t there, nothing more. ",

If you actually had a true emergency, you\u2019ll likely come back\u2014and soon\u2014either to the original ER or another. Either that, or your next hours will be very unpleasant and then you won\u2019t have to worry about it any more. If you didn\u2019t have a true emergency, you just did yourself and the ER staff a favor. How very thoughtful of you. ",

Even if you have received some treatment technically they cannot stop you from leaving. But that would be considered \u201cagainst medical advice\u201d or AMA. That would be noted in your chart for that visit. ",
