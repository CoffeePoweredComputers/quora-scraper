Now the race is on for getting there first and for selling them to consumers at affordable prices that make them must-have products. ",

At the moment the phone is clunky, more or less contained within a single unit and needs to be shifted left, right and centre - pocket to hand to ear to pocket etc. The tech will start fixing. The smartwatch is an early advance but a good example of tech that utilises an existing device in a new context. Glasses will follow. Earpieces and headphones, microphones and other devices too. Basically the sort of stuff that is internal in robots will start appearing as external fashion around us. ",

However, I think it'll be the 64MP cameras, then the graphene batteries, then an under display camera. Reason for under-display camera being lowest is because manufacturers will have to not only make sure of it's quality, but also manage costs and production speeds. ",
