            "answer_text": "If I am right this question is regarding the display of Samsung S10 vs One Plus 7 Pro. Samsung S10 having Dynamic Amoled wherein One Plus 7 Pro having Fluid Amoled. Both display are treat to eyes and provide brilliant display. Only advantage Fluid AMOLED screen has a 90Hz refresh rate higher than Dynamic Amoled of 60Hz which makes for smoother animation across the board as it refreshes more quickly than usual. These screens aren't that far apart, aside from size, but that's a nice little perk. Both display are same except Fluid AMOLED have higher refresh rate. ",

Therefore, I would say, Samsung have the 2nd Best display without question. (Sony Xperia have the best due to better picture enginee). As for Dynamic AMOLED or Fluid AMOLED. They are the same, they are both AMOLED, Dyna or Fluid only represented a Marketing word. That\u2019s all Above ",
