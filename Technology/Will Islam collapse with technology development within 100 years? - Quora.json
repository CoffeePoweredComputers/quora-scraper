            "answer_text": "First of all that\u2019s a good question. so as a muslim and areligious person I don\u2019t think islam will disapear within 100 years for the following reasons: 1- Islam itself motivate us to look in nature and study it for proof that God exist as it says in the quran in many verses for example (sura 20, verses 53 and 54):\u201c(God is) the One Who has made for you the earth like a cradle and inserted roads into it for you. He sent water down from the sky and thereby We brought forth pairs of plants, each separate from the other. Eat! Pasture your cattle! Verily in this are Signs for people endued with intelligence.\u201d 2- clearly you have a vague idea about ISLAM because if you know the basic teaching of it you wouldn\u2019t ask this question.One of the big teaching in quran(the holy book) itself is that you shouldn\u2019t belive blindly but rather look for reasonable reasons to do so by looking at nature and in yourself your creation. 3-for an excellent understanding of islam I recommand that you read the quran with an open mind and open heart and challenge tha claims that are made in the quran and see if the are reasonable or not as the quran itself gives you a falsification test in (Surah An-Nisa, 4:82): \"Do they not consider the Quran? Had it been from any other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much discrepancy.\" ",

            "answer_text": "No. Voltaire once said he thought the Bible would be a relic in 200 years. That\u2019s why every motel nightstand has a copy of the complete works of Voltaire. When my Reserve unit was training for the Gulf War, we were briefed by a State Department Middle East specialist who told how, early in his career, he expressed an interest in learning about Islam. \u201cForget Islam,\u201d a \u201cmentor\u201d told him, \u201cMarxism is going to dominate their thinking in the 21st century!\u201d Umm, yeah. How did that work out? By the end of the year, the Soviet Union would dissolve. Predictions of the imminent demise of religion have been made so often that we are entitled to chuck the whole concept in the dustbin of history. What really needs to decline, and may very well as those societies become more affluent, is the toxic, machismo culture that is obsessed with personal and family status and the subjugation of women. Islam will be around for a while. So will Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and all the rest. ",
