            "answer_text": "I guess so, if there is still battery by the time the alarm goes off. Just charge the battery otherwise the phone might run out of battery before the alarm goes off and you'll miss your alarm. I suggest if you want to make the battery last longer throughout the night, TURN ON airplane mode.. this will stop all wireless connections and it'll save battery\u2026 And additionally, turn on battery saver mode. The alarm will always go of even if battery saver mode is on and airplane mode is turned on. ",
