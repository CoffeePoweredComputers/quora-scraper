            "answer_text": "No, no and no. That question seems to spread like wildfire. The best that somebody can do to you when having your phone number is to call you. Or send you an SMS or MMS message. Note that there are so-called stealth SMS, which are received by your phone without letting you know. They generate network activity that would allow others to locate you \u2014 but they would have to have access to the operator\u2019s Network Operations Center. Hackers and normal criminals don't . There was an idea somewhere on Quora these days where this may have originated: the classical voice mail systems have a lousy level of protection. People can access your voicemail account with no big problems, unless you have given a real password. 99% of users have not given a password, or a password that is easy to guess. With listening into the list of voice mails, you can generate the impression that you have control over the phone (since you know a lot of the callers, including time of calling, messages etc.). Something like that must have happened on greater scale in the UK lately, and was reported in the press. Now it is a big hype. ",

            "answer_text": "So you are asking that if someone can hack your phone just by using your cell number. The answer is straightforward No, because hacking is not that much easier as someone thinks. There are few possibilities that a hacker can hack your phone: 1) He can send you a spam message/link via text. 2) He can attach malware with any app and send that to you. If you try to open such app the malware will be installed into your phone and you will have problems. 3) Whenever calls or sms are made SS7 service handles them. If a person gets into SS7 he can easily keep an eye on incoming and outgoing conversations. If you follow best security options then no one can get into your device, because just having a phone number is not enough yet to hack a device ! ",

A hacker requires some details about the target such as the IP address or the MAC address to initiate an attack. To get the above details about your device a hacker could send you a text message for any rewards or anything that might seem interesting. The message shall have a link or a picture asking you to click over it for further action. Once you hit the link a malware gets installed into your device. And that's it then the hacker has access to your phone. This was just one of the ways. There are numerous was to hack any device.

You can respond to the sender and ask them if they meant to send this link or image to you? You can also ask them to send that link or image over something else, like an app. The app platform will perform additional security checks, and you can check out links on your computer by unfurling shortened URLs. I never just click on shortened URLs. ",

Knowing your phone might allow them to send you malicious files (Which if you don\u2019t open, nothing will happen), phishing texts, but that is pretty much the extents they can do. Hacking your cell phone needs access to system level components. No need to worry about this. ",

It might lead to a Social Engineering attack. In social engineering, the attacker will send you an SMS which will contain a payload Once the payload is executed from your end, BOOM! you\u2019ll hand over the control to the attacker. It is always appreciated not to disclose your digital identity like your phone number, E-mail ID, Usernames, etc until and unless it is very much required. In short, directly it\u2019s not possible but, indirectly an attacker may use it for the wrong purpose. I hope you got the answer to your query. Thanks for being here! Be safe and secure. ",

It\u2019s also possible to cover this spyware from the victim, so you'll be using your phone as normal, completely unaware of the very fact that somebody is remotely monitoring your actions, stealing your data, and potentially even watching you via the device cameras.
