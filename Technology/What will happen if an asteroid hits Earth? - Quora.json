            "answer_text": "Depends upon a few factors, such as the size, speed, hit angle and landing point. If it is 10 feet across, it may skip off of the atmosphere or create a pretty fireworks explosion in the sky. If it\u2019s 100 feet across, it may cause a massive explosion, like the one at Tunguska. If its a quarter mile wide, it could take out an entire region, but if its 10km wide, well, that's a game changer for just about anyone and any living thing walking or crawling the Earth. That's what we may call an ELE, or Extinction-level Event, and it doesn't really matter where it hits. The deepest point in the oceans is only 11 km deep, and a typical speed for impacting. bolides is around 30 kilometers per second (around 90 times the speed of sound) -could be slower or faster. Unlike smaller meteors, an asteroid that size will not be slowed down much by the atmosphere. It will punch through in less than 3 seconds like it's hardly even there. And when it reaches the surface, it will hit so hard that it won't matter if it strikes ocean or land. Most people within a hundred miles or so of the impact point will either drop dead from the concussion of the compression wave of the incoming bolide, or will be completely vaporized. They will most like never know what hit them, but they're the lucky ones\u2026 The energy of the impact will also vaporize a large amount of the Earth's crust, possibly creating a crater more than one hundred kilometers across, throwing all that rock and dirt (known as \u2018ejecta') into the air. The outrush of air from the impact with cause winds reaching out up to a thousand miles, with wind speeds that may exceed 900 miles per hour. If you are near a coast, and the bolide hits mid-ocean, wave depths near the shore may reach over a mile in height and travel hundreds of miles inland. Horrible, unimaginable earthquakes will be felt worldwide, and the sound of the impact will reach out thousands of miles, serving as a warning regarding the real hell that is about to come. Some of the ejecta will be going so fast that it will fly right out of the Earth's atmosphere and go into orbit around the Earth. But most of it will rain back down on the Earth. - The entire Earth, heating the atmopshere to temperatures possibly near 900 degrees (hot enough to melt lead). This heat will last several hours and feel like the inside of an oven. It will trigger forest fires and cook anyone or anything that isn't sheltered deep underground. Your house and even your clothes may likely spontaneously combust. You will not survive, but you're probably luckier than the few people who will, because the ugliness is still just beginning\u2026 The combination of dust from the impact, and soot from the forest fires will remain in the Earth's atmosphere for a year or so, blocking the light of the Sun. Without sunlight, much of the Earth's plantlife will die. The entire food chain will collapse. Many species of animals--including the human race, if we aren't both lucky and resourceful!--will die out, either in the initial catastrophe, or in the ensuing years due to lack of food and the general devastation of the environment. And if you are fortunate enough to survive all of the above, you and the other survivors, which may number less than 50,000 or even 20,000 of the nearly 7 billion we currently have, will literally be reduced to stone age living for a time. You and the other survivors will scrounge just to continue to exist, eating anything that comes your way. All in all, if you survive such an impact, the next few years of your life won't be your best. ",

            "answer_text": "Asteroids are hitting the Earth all the time. Every day, space bombards us with around 100 tonnes of dust and sand. Car-sized asteroids make it to our atmosphere about once a year. Lucky for us, they burn up in the mesosphere, never reaching the Earth\u2019s surface. The massive 10-kilometer wide, life-threatening rocks like the one that wiped out all the dinosaurs, don\u2019t come by too often \u2013 maybe once every few million years. The ones we do have to worry about are asteroids the size of a football field that actually make it to the Earth\u2019s surface. Meteorites. They tend to come down to Earth every 2,000 years. What if one of those was to hit us tonight? The extent of an asteroid\u2019s devastation to our planet all comes to where the it lands. Just 3% of Earth\u2019s surface is populated, that means, in all likelihood, 97 asteroids out of 100 would just plunge into the ocean or flatten an uninhabited forest somewhere in Siberia or northern Canada. Damage to humans would be close to nothing. But 3 out of every 100 asteroids would strike a populated city. Imagine seeing a 100-meter-long (330-foot) rock speeding towards you, traveling at 30 km (19 miles) per second\u2026 From the moment it passed unharmed through the mesosphere, it would take less than 3 seconds for it to crash down to Earth. For a city like New-York, it would mean over 2.5 million casualties. A huge firefall would destroy everything in a 3 km (2 mile) radius, and cause heavy damage to buildings within a 7 km (4.5 miles) radius. Maybe it\u2019s not all bad\u2026 Ever heard of the meteorite that slammed near the Russia\u2019s city of Chelyabinsk? That rock exploded with the force of 20 Hiroshima bombs and caused around $33 million worth of damage. Some of those losses were recovered by ingenious Russians selling meteorite pieces for up to $50 a gram. Well, in our scenario, the meteorite is 5 times bigger! The freshly fallen space rock may pose the risk of widespread radiation if it were made up of radioactive heavy metals. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be as bad as a 10-kilometer wide asteroid hitting the Earth. In that case, the shock wave would be enough to wipe out a a good chunk of humanity right away. The Earth would get a new crater over a 100 km (62 miles) across and a ring of asteroid debris would give us a \u2018Saturn-like\u2019 appearance. Most of this debris would rain back on Earth, setting cities\u2026 and forests on fire on fire and cooking everything that\u2019s not protected. You might want to invest in an underground bunker before this happens. Because on the surface, it would be very, very dusty. All this dust and smoke would block the sunlight. Without the sun, all plants and a lot of animals would die out. After about a year, the atmosphere would clear up, but there would be very little food for humans left. And if we weren\u2019t resourceful enough, this would be the end of our race. We would suffer the same fate as the dinosaurs did 65 million years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "As Mark says, it is a matter of little consequence. However if we are talking, as I think you think you are, of an incoming, of some magnitude, then consider the meteor crater in Arizona: Meteor Crater - Wikipedia This was about 50m diameter, and it made quite a tidy hole. It would have made a right mess of New York, but some of the suburbs might have been left standing. Most come in at a little more than escape velocity, about 7 miles/second, so the energy of impact is more a matter of mass. Considering, a dense rock meteor, then, up to the point that the crust is ruptured, all other things being equal, the crater diameter will be approximately ten times the impacter diameter. The depth of the crater, for impacters above 400m diameter, the depth of the crater AFTER impact is relatively constant at about 1km. This hides a multitude of horrors. The true depth of the impact will in fact be closely related to the diameter, and immediate collapse of the crater will be responsible for the shallowness of the remaining crater. Take a look at this: Galway Bay Now look at the mouth of the Shannon at Ballybunion, and follow the Shannon Valley back through Limerick, Nenagh, Athlone, Roscommon, Carrick on Shannon, and on towards Sligo. See ho closely this follows about 120 degrees of a circle centred on a point near Galway city, where two lakes almost meet. Now zoom out, and see how a line through Loch Ness in Scotland, passes through a sea loch, into Derry, then on past Sligo, and on to where a line along the North West coast on the Northern Lake near Galway City crosses a line along the South West coast of the Southern lake. These are the classical features of a huge impact crater, about 100km radius, about 62 miles. That is, 200km diameter, or 125 miles. That implies an impacter of about 20km diameter. But so what? Look carefully at a map of Newfoundland, and you can find relics of the rest of the circle. Now look at this map of Quebec: Ring Lake: Manicouagan Reservoir First, you can see clearly an annular lake. Actually, if you examine the sattelite view carefully, you ca see two more ring structures, one about the same side, cotangental with it at about 11 oClock, and the other, at about 2 oClock, a little smaller, and separated by about 10 km. These features can only be the remnants of impact craters, and their age is coincidental with the birth of the Atlantic Ocean. So the diameter of Ring Lake is about 40 km. The Galway relic would have been 5x as big! The implication is that these were all fragments of the prime impacter, which broke the tectonic plate, so that the Atlantic ocean was opened. Again rough calculation for this impacter would be about 20 km diameter, and the fragments responsible for the ring features including Ring Lake would be about 4 km, 2 off, and 3km, 1 off. So we do not want anything of this size to strike the Earth. If the impacter can br broken up long before impact, even if ALL parts of it strike the Earth, the damage will be greatly limited, and with any kind of luck, most of tyhe fragments will land in deep ocean. A .22 round from a rifle can easily kill you, but a .410 shot cartridge from a shot gun will just give you a nasty rash. A deep penetration fusion bomb will easily make a lethal impacter quite safe.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve done Eros before this shouldn\u2019t be any problem. A one kilometer asteroid has been discovered by NASA and was found to be orbiting Jupiter. it was moving around Jupiter in a very elliptical orbit and it was thought it was going to hit Jupiter\u2019s moon Io in a few days. NASA had scientists tracking it constantly. When NASA announced that another moon orbiting Jupiter has been discovered it brought excitement to some people that Jupiter has another moon. But little did they know that it would pose a danger soon. After three days of tracking the moon it was approaching Io. Then it got caught it Io\u2019s gravitational influence. It was passing over one of Io\u2019s volcano\u2019s as it was erupting. The force from the eruption caused the asteroid to be put on a collision course with Earth. The scientists went crazy that an asteroid was going to hit earth in a week. NASA reported the asteroid to the American government and soon after it was publicly announced. many people started rioting to get provisions like food and water as well as the impact zone, being the eastern sea-board, was evacuated displacing millions of people. DC with NASA and space X were going over plans on what to do with the asteroid. redirect it to miss earth.put it into orbit.just blow it up.All the plans were assessed and the blowing it up plan would be used. After five days the asteroid was passing the moon. That was when the Rocket falcon heavy with 20 B83 nuclear war heads, with a combined explosive power of 24 megatons of TNT, was launched. It was in an interception mission with the asteroid. 3 2 1 ignition. in about 30 minutes to rocket was in orbit but it over shot so it wouldn\u2019t encounter the asteroid. After 2 days of people scrambling to their bunkers and then\u2026  The asteroid hit earth killing anything in the area and sending a shock wave that circles the earth. for the next few years the ash from the impact plunging the earth into a nuclear winter for the next few years. What happens to humanity I don\u2019t know. We might die or we may live. So if your reading this live everyday as if it were your last. ",

            "answer_text": " Only one case in history has ever been officially confirmed, whereas others have been reported. On November 30th 1954 of four kilograms or nine-pound meteorite crashed through the ceiling of 34-year-old and Elizabeth Hodges home. The stone bounced off the radio and hit the poor lady in the thigh leaving a huge bruise. The probability of such a small meteorite hitting a person is negligible but it happened. What if something larger fell to earth for example the largest asteroid in the solar system. Scientists estimate that there are now several hundred million asteroids one-meter or3.3 feet or more in size in Earth\u2019s orbit. Every day about a hundred tons of them in the form of small grains of sand and small stones penetrate the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and burn up leaving a bright trail about 30 asteroids with a total mass of up to 2,000 tons fly directly towards Earth's atmosphere every year. Occasionally their fragments fall to Earth\u2019s surface in the form of meteorites. More noticeable meteorites larger than 20 meters or 65 points 6 feet fall to earth no more than twice every 100 years. the last of these came down in the Chelyabinsk region in Russia in 2013. Once every thousand years objects like the Tunguska meteorite which was about75 meters or 246 feet in size reach the Earth\u2019s surface. Asteroids measuring more than a hundred meters or 328 feet land here even less often once every few thousand years. The most gigantic asteroids whose dimensions exceed kilometers or miles crashed down onto our planet once every 100 million years. but in this case, they become the cause of global catastrophes in the extinction of species. One of them probably destroyed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. If there were no wind rain and various geological processes on earth our entire planet would be dotted with craters as can be seen on the moon or mercury. The remaining traces of space objects confirmed that asteroid impacts are not a fantasy at all the arrival of large stones remains only a matter of time scientists consider asteroids at least 140 meters or 460 feet in size as the most dangerous.[1] To read the full article What If THE LARGEST ASTEROID Hit Earth?

            "answer_text": "Nothing or something. It all depends on the mass of said asteroid, its composition, and obviously its speed. There are asteroids out there that are no more than basically sand gathered together. Or at least particles of rock. Those asteroids easily break up in the Earth atmosphere. Those most dangerous asteroids are those with a high content of iron, and other heavy elements. But in the end it all comes down to mass and speed. For example the Tunguska forest suffered a devastation, caused by what was believed to be an asteroid of significant size, that blew up mid air before it crashed.   The asteroid is believed to have exploded 5 to 10 kilometers before hitting the ground. And still it leveled everything in a radius of 2,150 Km\u00b2. If such event happened today over a major city in the world, we would see hundreds of thousands to millions of dead, in mere seconds.   Events like those or the dinosaurs and other extinction events, happen very far apart from one another. Still it could happen at any time and we would have little to almost no warning. Most astronomers look for tell tale signs like the asteroid when it approaches the inner solar system, that the ice in it will begin to melt and form a tail that we can see. But that doesn't necessarily needs to happen. If the asteroid is made up of almost no ice, and mostly of rock, iron and other elements. Then it may not form any tail whatsoever. Which would make it incredibly difficult to detect. One such asteroid could be coming our way right now, and we would be none the wiser. At least not until it was too late. Obviously if it's mass is small then it would never be a significant danger. But if it's something the size of a city or several kilometers wide, then it can help end almost all life on the planet.

            "answer_text": "It depends entirely on how large the meteorite is. Those smaller than a grain of sand will be slowed by their high-speed passage through Earth\u2019s lower atmosphere. While everyone seems to think meteorites burn up in the process, very tiny particles land harmlessly on Earth, visible through a microscope as tiny spheres. once larger meteorites reach terminal velocity, they crash land and could cause small amounts of damage. They do not explode on impact but may break apart hundreds of feet or meters above ground, following has hundreds or thousands of small fragments. Meteorites as large as a car may survive and leave a small burial crater. Meteotites as large as a house will cause considerably more damage. It is extremely unlikely a house-sized meteorite will strike an area with a city. Most of Earth is uninhabited! A 30-meter (100-foot) diameter meteorite certainly will leave a kilometer (one-half) mile crater, owing to its speed and mass, however, such impacts only happen every 10,000 to 30,000-years. Cartoons, comic books, television programs and bad movies ALWAYS have meteorites striking populated famous places. Which has never happened. Much larger asteroids have in the past struck Earth two to five times over the last 3 thousand MILLION years apparently causing mass extinctions. A tiny piece of asteroid came in at an angle and exploded a few years ago at Chelyabinsk Siberia. The silent passage was captured by hundreds of camcorders. Shockwaves struck few minutes later, knicking down walls and shattering billions of dollars worth of plate glass windows. Thousands of dark meteorite fragments fell quietly into snow and ice below!

            "answer_text": "If an asteroid hit Earth, it would definitely leave quite the mark. But what else could it do? Well, let me explain. Depending on size, it could do many things. If it was anywhere near the size of the planet, it would likely either completely smash Earth to fiery pieces or it could possibly smack us straight out of orbit. A fairly big sized asteroid could turn the Earth into a fiery rock orbiting around a fiery ball of hydrogen and helium plasma (The Sun) instead of being our home and habitual planet orbiting our life source (Still talking about The Sun here). This is because the friction of an asteroid coming down in our atmosphere will heat the asteroid into, possibly, a flaming boulder. When the flaming space rock hit\u2019s the ground, it\u2019ll start \u2018digging\u2019 it\u2019s crater and compress the ground underneath it (Not including what exploded outwards when the energy of the asteroid suddenly hit the surface of our planet.). What happens to the area around it crater that is untouched? That\u2019s right! It\u2019s rubbing up against the asteroid while it\u2019s pushing it\u2019s way into the ground creating more friction and heating up the planet! The shockwave of an asteroid hitting the planet could kill quite a few things, if not everything, on our planet, too! When it hits the ground, it\u2019s releasing all of the energy it built up during it\u2019s decent through the atmosphere and the dirt around the planet can\u2019t handle all of that energy, so it releases, gets flung into the distance, Ect. Ect. I hope this was helpful. I\u2019m not an actual, professional sciencetist myself, but I think I know a little bit of what I\u2019m saying xD Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on one of my points. ",

There are many things in space flying past this planet , I suspect the real dangerous big ones are few and far between and we live on luck a little in maybe a quiet area of our universe, so the odds appear against a seriously destructive big one getting close , let alone hitting ( that we know about) Its pretty rare. But , one zipped past us last year apparently. between the earth and moon around, they said , 192,000 ks away from us. Whew!!! NASA recently got a gift of extra money from the Trump administration to look harder at the possibility of really dangerous floating space rocks etc , they have one instance where in 22nd century there is an asteroid they have found that is on course to hit earth. And they are sending off a craft into space that in a couple of years will meet this smaller asteroid they know of ,and test to see if they can destroy it or knock it of course. If they can they will use this type of technology for the 22nd century asteroid, which actually is heading for us, I think the year 2136 can\u2019t remember but, I read of it today. It is a great idea to protect earth from the very rare but world ending event. We have to remember that NASA and all space exploring operation aound the world know that there are things out there that are unknown, and there whereabouts unknown, I guess they are working on that too. , but the odds are small odds that we\u2019d be hit. But we could. We think the dinosaurs got hit and changed their world , but life kept going, so we don\u2019t know really and hopefully any thing really big can be dealt with, but technology needs several years to gather up its capacity and technology to have a shot at something we find in space that is a earth killer, this 2136 thing is one of those. We have been here billions of years our piece of dirt called Earth, and since we cooled off and developed and life began , we have been reasonably quiet so when you think on this the odds are out of the world that we will get hit that badly. And all of us today won\u2019t see NASA BELT THAT ASTEROID OFF COURSE. The money used to go to Mars, a stupid idea, would be better spent on asteroid hunting and destroying, but that\u2019s only my opinion and I am not scientific and educated only by what I\u2019ve read and found sensible , logic I guess you call it. We\u2019ll be fine . ",

I agree with James Carruthers, Earth \u201ccollects\u201d meteors and small asteroids at a steady rate. Interactions with Jupiter and anything else in the solar system provides for asteroids drifting into the inner solar system. Plus comets, as they swing through the inner solar system and are warmed by the Sun, outgass volatiles and occasional \u201cdirt\u201d - some of which may be of non-trivial size. Anything big enough to get all the way to the surface is moderately rare. Pieces of the Chelyabinsk asteroid did get to the surface. The odds are that something the size of that asteroid will impact the Earth about every ten years. This graphic is adapted from the Planetary and Space Science Centre at the University at New Brunswick, Canada, the Earth Impact Database article Impact cratering on Earth  The line continues past Annually to weekly and daily - surely you have see a \u201cshooting star\u201d, haven\u2019t you? Somewhere over the Earth every day there is a bolide or fireball bright enough to cast a shadow at night or to stand out against the daytime sky. Over several years many asteroids exploding in the atmosphere are big enough to register with sensors watching or listening for rocket launches or nuclear bomb tests.  The orange, almost red one is the Chelyabinsk meteor - Wikipedia. Statistically, about every century or two something like the Tunguska event - Wikipedia happens. Every few thousand years or so some moderately serious asteroid impacts and results in something like the Massive Impact Crater Beneath Greenland Which Could Explain Ice Age Climate Swing - The Crux Will anything big hit anytime soon? No, almost all the big ones have been found and are being tracked. The Chelyabinsk sized ones are small enough to be hard to find - we\u2019ve barely gotten started on finding and tracking them.

Most of them that hit us are really small after going past the atmosphere, like a basketball. Some were the size of houses, but still didn\u2019t do enough to cause global destruction, the nuclear weapons we have can do 1,000x more damage that pretty much any asteroid that ever hit the planet cause no radioactive fallout. Now if say the Asteroid dubbed \u201cApophis\u201d were to hit us. Underground bunkers wouldn\u2019t save us. NASA says that asteroid should come by for a visit in the next 10 years and it was discovered over a decade ago. If it is guaranteed to hit us, then the only thing that will save us: We move to another planet and it has to be outside our solar system, as there are no planets in our system that can support us - we\u2019d have to bring TONS of assurances for our survival. The nearest system that could support human life? 4.2 light-years from Earth (40 Trillion Miles). To give an idea, The moon at it\u2019s furthest distance is 252 thousand miles away, Mars is 60 million miles away at most, 25 million at it\u2019s closest. Pluto is 4.67 billion miles away. It took one of NASA\u2019s probes 11 years (2006 to 2015) to reach Pluto. IF we could make a ship capable of supporting enough life to restart on the other planet in our nearest neighboring solar system, humanity would go through dozens to hundreds of generations before reaching said planet - none of the original colonists would live long enough to even see the system. When something big enough to cause global extinction comes along, and hits us, we are dead. The one you saw in the Bruce Willis Armageddon movie, that one would have realistically not just wipe out all life, but also could turn the planet into a trillion dust particles - The one that COULD/MIGHT hit us is the size of Mars and Mars isn\u2019t as big as the asteroid/comet in that movie.

Most go unnoticed because they are micrometeroites that burn up almost instantaneously on contact with a thick enough layer of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Others go unnoticed because they happen on the day side of the planet where the sky is lit up by the Sun. The vast majority never reach the Earth\u2019s solid surface. Of those that do, most are the size of gravel or small stones. Fewer still are the size of small sports balls, baseballs, footballs, etc. Rarer still are the ones that make the news by happening at night and being large enough to leave a large enough streak of light in the sky to get put on YouTube. The really rare ones are the Tunguska and Chelyabink meteors that are seen during the day and actually produce damage on the ground. The truly astronomicly unlikely ones are the kind that produce extinction level events here on Earth, such as the one responsible for the Chicxulub crater, which is thought to have killed off the dinosaurs. Once it was realized that the surface of the Earth, unlike the Moon, is regularly scoured by wind and water erosion, it was soon recognized that the Earth is at least as pock-marked by meteor impact craters as our natural satellite. 11 Fascinating Impact Craters on Earth Possibly the most famous impact crater on the Earth\u2019s surface, other than Chicxulub, would be Barringer Crater in Arizona.  This is what people tend to think of when they think meteor impact crater, but once scientists figured out what to look for, they started finding craters all over the Earth\u2019s surface.

            "answer_text": "What would happen if a meteorite hits the Earth? Well, recently one meteorite made a hole in a frozen lake. You can see people standing around the hole for scale:  The 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor wasn\u2019t very impressive as a meteorite (the bits that hit Earth), but as meteor (still in the air) it injured almost 1500 Russians, shattered windows, and collapsed old buildings. The meteor\u2019s air blast was estimated as 400 - 500 kilotons.  (Pictured: shattered windows in Chelyabinsk. A lot of Russians got glass in the face.)  However, the Chelyabinsk meteor was rather small, only about 12,500 tons when it hit Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The Barringer Crater in Arizona was larger. The energy release at impact (50,000 years ago) was about 10 megatons. It was not a world-shaking impact, but it was devastating in the region: Barringer Meteor Crater and Its Environmental Effects  The damage inflicted by the impact was similar to a nuclear bomb blast, but without ionizing radiation damage. The asteroid, bedrock, and any fauna or flora at ground zero would have been vaporized. Bedrock was ejected and overturned out to a distance of 1-2 km (see graphic). The explosive shockwave would have produced winds in excess of 1000 km/hr within 3 to 5 km of the impact (see effects map). These winds would have stripped away grass near the crater and flattened juniper and pinyon trees out to a radial distance of ~14 to 19 km. Branches, rocks, and other debris was also accelerated by the blast, causing shrapnel-type wounds out to a distance of 10 to 13 km. Vegetation and animals may also have been subject to the thermal emission from the blast, causing burn damage out to a maximum range of ~10km. The probable sum of these effects is the destruction of vegetation over an area 800 to 1500 km.  ",

He dropped to one knee and raised the lever to stop the tub and then turned on both the taps as far as they would go. she was standing in the doorway in her nightwear, clutching the jamb, cradling her belly in one hand. What is it? She said. What is happening? I don\u2019t know. Why are you taking a bath? I\u2019m not. The Road, pages 27\u201328 (Nook version). Italics added by myself. Cormac McCarthy confirmed in a interview with Oprah (I think it was her) that the apocalyptic event was indeed an asteroid impact (\u201cimpact event\u201d) Unless you are near the impact zone this is what you might see, if you were lucky. Most people would likely never even know what happened. No other details of the impact event are described in the book. Just the after effect. The Road (I\u2019ve said this before, I know) is in my opinion the best post apocalyptic novel of all time. grim, hopeful, full of love and unflinching in its look at life in a post apocalyptic America. I cannot quote Evolution by Stephen Baxter (due to length and I do not have a copy of the book with me right now) but in that novel he has a very detailed explanation of the impact of the asteroid that hit the Earth, finishing off the dinosaurs. Very detailed, several pages long. Its probably one of the most dramatic moments in the novel. Lucifer\u2019s Hammer (Niven and Pournelle) also has a pretty detailed description of an asteroid impact. I know this is not exactly the answer you were looking for but it is the best that I am able to do. As far as I know, no one has ever survived an asteroid impact after witnessing it. ;-) ",

Meteor shower: A collection of meteors visible when Earth passes through a trail of debris left by a comet. Asteroid: An object larger than a meteoroid that orbits the sun and is made of rock or metal.Mar 10, 2013 The main difference between asteroids and comets is their composition, as in, what they are made of. Asteroids are made up of metals and rocky material, while comets are made up of ice, dust and rocky material. Both asteroids and comets were formed early in the history of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. NASA: Asteroid/Meteor/Meteorite An asteroid is a small rocky object that orbits the Sun. Asteroids are smaller than a planet, but they are larger than the pebble-size objects we call meteoroids. A meteor is what happens when a meteoroid \u2013 a small piece of an asteroid or comet \u2013 burns up upon entering Earth\u2019s atmosphere, creating a streak of light in the sky. Comets. travel at a far greater speed and are far less dense in composition than meteors. Accordingly they will explode in mid air from the excessive heat generated by entering our atmosphere. They leave no crater on land. One landed in Russia in 2013, and a much larger one at Tungaska, Russia in 1908, levelling 2,00 square KM of forest and killing 3.

Asteroids are much much larger, and leave huge craters when the hit land.

Th 2nd largest crater scar on earth is in Ontario Canada: Nat Geographic: Sudbury Basin: Asteroid impact date: Estimated 1.8 billion years ago Location: Ontario, Canada Specs: The Sudbury Basin is considered one of largest impact structures on Earth, with an estimated diameter of 81 miles (130 kilometers). Dating back 1.8 billion years, it is also one of the oldest known impact structures in the world. Asteroid : Extinction event size! A huge asteroid, which fell off the Yucatan peninsula, and landed in shallow Caribbean waters has left a crater which extends over land and shoreline waters, was an extinction event that ended the age of the dinosaurs!

An asteroid becomes one or the other when it comes in contact with our atmosphere. In the case of most meteoroids or meteroites the answer is still nothing as they will either skip off or disentergrate in our atmosphere though a few will come close enough to impact. Very large ones can and have done damage just passing through our atmosphere. Sibce 70% of our planet is covered in water and there are vast areas of the planet that are sparsely inhabitated damage will be barely noticeable unless its a really big one and we like to think we are tracking 90% of those. There is debate over what we could do if we detect one on a collision course. We have to either change its course or make it lighter aka reduce its gravity. Of course there is still that 10%, a hefty dose of radiation from distant suns, black holes etc. Then there's a CME from our own sun. We are either lucky or ordained. Either works. ",

If it was as large as the asteroid that took out the dinosaurs we could suffer a similar fate. But we do have at least one thing going for us. The giant gas planets (Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Jupiter) act as cosmic vacuum cleaners. Their huge gravitational fields serve to shield our planet from asteroid and wayward comet strikes. One example is the comet levy-shoemaker (1992) that looked to be heading for a potential impact with Earth. As it swung by Jupiter it was ripped apart into more than 20 pieces over a 7-day period. ",

There are many variables to take into account but to name a few: Size- The bigger the asteroid the more kinetic force it will impart to the planet. More Kinetic force means more destruction. Small things that enter the atmosphere typically burn up before they reach the ground. Speed- the faster an object is moving the more kinetic energy it can transfer. As mentioned above, more kinetic energy more destruction. Material-Is the asteroid made up of a bunch of small rocks and ice that will act like shotgun pellets, or is it a chunk of solid iron that will act more like a slug on impact Angle of attack - is it a direct strike or possibly just a glancing blow that will bounce off the atmosphere Strike point - Will it hit land or water, a city or a wilderness, on the poles or equator? There are some others but those are the main ones. All kinds of stuff falls from the sky all the time both natural and man-made. Most of it never even makes the news, much less of it is devastating or causes significant damage. Occasionally you will hear about a sonic boom made by something entering the atmosphere, it will knock things over possibly even break some windows, but there isn\u2019t even a crater because it disintegrated before it reached the ground.

Like say throwing a feather at someone would probably make them laugh and ignore it, while throwing a tennis ball would probably hurt.  For smaller asteroids, they'd probably burn up in the atmosphere. Temperatures are really high when they enter. That's why there needs to be so much heat shielding on rockets. The average person probably wouldn't even notice, however. Larger asteroids could survive the trip and fall on to the ground. It'd depend on the specific one, but it could range from being a souvenir in the Sochi Olympics and a subject of scientific research to being a world-ending cataclysmic device.

As a result, the kinetic energy of a moving object (and thus its impact energy) increases exponentially as it gets bigger. Objects a few meters across burn up in the upper atmosphere. Objects a few tens of meters across penetrate deeper and explode closer to the ground (like Chelyabinsk), potentially causing damage on the ground. Objects hundreds of meters in size can impact the ground and cause tremendous damage to the immediate area. Objects that are kilometers across\u2026 miles across\u2026 will have potentially planet-wide catastrophic consequences, possibly lasting for years. A lot hinges on the details of course, but as they say\u2026 \u201csize does matter\"! ",

Meteorites hit the Earth dozens of times a day, with little fanfare unless they happen to land near a city which is comparatively rare. A meteorite the size of the one that made the Arizona crater would cause wide-spread devastation if it hit a populated area, at least on the order of a major earthquake. If it hit out in the ocean, it might cause a small tidal wave if that. Something the size of the meteorite that created the Gulf of Mexico would immediately kill hundreds of thousands or millions if it hit land, then the resulting tidal waves, fires, etc would kill tens of thousands more at the the least. But then the global \u2018nuclear winter\u2019 it would cause would kill billions as crops failed, leading to infrastructures and governments collapsing. ",

The minimum size of an asteroid is one-meter diameter, measured along the longest axis. It used to be 10 meters, but they changed the definition several years ago. This one was 20 meters in diameter, and thus 20 x 20 x 20 = 8000 times as massive as the smallest. The larger the asteroid, the less common. Thus, nearly all asteroids striking the earth are in the 1\u20132 meter range, nearly all of them near the low end of that range. ",

If it falls on land, depending on its size, say 2 km asteroid, approximately the one that fell at yucatan penninsula 65 million years ago. First the air blast and shock waves would travel several miles away from impact and level tall trees and damage a lot of buildings. Heat generated from the blast would ignite forests and cause major conflagrations, dust and debri generated from impact would block out sunlight for a period of a decade. If i happens to fall at a location with unstable seismic conditions, earthquakes would be triggered, all this would eventually lead to an ecological collapse and hence global extinction. Secondly if it falls on the ocean, the effects wouldnt be as worse, although, There would be complete coastal modification as tsunamis towering tens of feet would submerge anything from ground zero to a few 100 meters high.

Put another way, the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago (after triggering earthquakes and volcanoes on a global scale, setting the planet on fire, and triggering a nuclear winter) was about 6 miles across, and it theoretically hit at a speed of at least 20 km/s (45,000 mph). If we doubled the diameter of the asteroid, it\u2019d have a mass that is approximately 8 times greater, thus if we kept the speed the same, the KE of the impact would be 8 times greater, and thus the destruction would be much larger.

Not at all like the picture. worse. BTW if somebody is looking for a science project, tell them to put a magnet in a weed bag and stick it in a rain downspout. Every time it rains they can pull the bag out and micrometeorites will be stuck to the magnet. They look like this: micrometeorites - Google Search ",

The reason for this wide range in numbers is the sheer number of variables that your question failed to provide. How fast is it moving? How large is it? Where will it hit the planet? What\u2019s it made out of? What angle will it strike the planet? I think it\u2019s fair to say that a rock would have to be moving VERY fast, and be fairly large, to cause any serious damage. One the size of a small mountain would totally destroy a city. One a few miles across might kill even more people. But it would have to be truly colossal, be very solid, hit land, hit dead on, and not at an angle, and moving many times faster than the fastest bullet. It would kill everyone and everything for 1000\u2019s of miles. It would mess up the atmosphere for some 10s of 1000s of years. But even then, there is no guarantee that it would kill everyone. Having said all this, there really is no way to tell. ",

A large enough asteroid collision could change the climate by creating a nuclear winter scenario, causing the death of much life on earth. ",
