            "answer_text": "Real (imperfect) lenses are usually evaluated using Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) plots that show the overall performance of a lens from its centre to its edge, and take account of both diffraction and optical aberration. However even the most perfect lens is limited in its resolving power by diffraction, which occurs when light passes through a small aperture to fall on an image plane such as a camera sensor. The light spreads out in a hemispherical wave beyond the aperture, and as it does so interference effects cause light and dark rings in the image, resulting in blurring. In this case, lens resolution is said to be diffraction limited. Before reaching the diffraction limit, the resolution of a real camera lens may be aberration limited, although optical aberration of some of the best lenses available today is low enough that diffraction does set the limit on performance. The point here is that, while optical aberration can be minimised by good design and construction, the diffraction limit, which is directly related to lens diameter (/aperture), places an absolute physical limit on lens performance.
