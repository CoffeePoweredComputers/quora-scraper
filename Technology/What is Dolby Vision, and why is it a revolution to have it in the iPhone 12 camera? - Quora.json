            "answer_text": "Q: What is Dolby Vision, and why is it a revolution to have it in the iPhone 12 camera? Calm down, it\u2019s not really worth to use the word revolution in this context. Dolby Vision is a novelty only for Apple which is always way behind current technology. Other manufacturers already have implemented Dolby Vision without making big fanfare. For example LG G6 from 2017 had it already, that\u2019s 3 years ago back in history from today. Assuming you know what 4K or UHD and HDR stand for Dolby Vision is a enhanced proprietary 4K HDR and it\u2019s a big deal because it\u2019s currently the best and most widely supported cross platform UHD format. This means you will be able to enjoy very well balanced 4K HDR over a variety of devices, from tablets, TV-sets etc etc. Maybe google first before you fall for the cheap Apple marketing. ",
