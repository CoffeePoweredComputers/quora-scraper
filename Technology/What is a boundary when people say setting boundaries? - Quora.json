            "answer_text": "It refers to limits you set regarding how you allow people treat to you. For example: If you don't like it that people wear dirty shoes when they enter your apartment, make it known to them before they arrive that you require them to kindly remove their shoes prior to entering your apartment. Don't be a dick about it. Just kindly explain the boundaries. Another example: Never allow people to disrespect you, as in raising their voice at you or speaking to you in a derogatory tone of voice. Stand up and call them out on their behaviour. My personal example: I recently had a landlord whom I detested with a capital T. I felt very bad energy from him the moment I met him, and this only confirmed itself as time progressed. He once asked me via text message what time I'll be home as he needs to see me. Bear in mind this was in the middle of the month and rent was only due on the 30th. I replied at 7pm, stating I was seeing some family and I'll only me home after 10pm. I asked him what he wanted to speak to me about. Now two things pissed me off about his follow-up reply: He did not tell me in his reply what he wanted to see me about, when I asked via textHe replied with, \u201cOkay, then I'll come after 10pm.\u201dI got mad as fuck and replied back with \u201cWHAT THE FUCK? Are you FUCKING MENTAL? What Bad social etiquette to suggest you'll see someone AFTER 10PM AT NIGHT when you did not even have the decency to tell me what the fuck you wanted! Come see me tomorrow you stupid fuck!! \u201c He did not reply to my message and came the next day at 3pm to say I must also pay an extra $100 for utilities which was a fucking lie. I then left his apartment without giving him the keys in his hand and just left the keys on the kitchen table with his door unlocked. I later discovered he deceived me into paying his Wi-Fi debt to the Internet company but fraudulently covering his debt as an \u201cinstallation fee\u201d. I found out because when I needed a new Wi-Fi installation for the new apartment where I moved into, the same company told me Installations were free. When I showed them what I paid, they laughed and said he deceived me and that this was his old debt, not an Installation fee. I did not read the fine print and just took his word for it. He then showed up at my new apartment and threatened to call the police. When I pushed him against the wall and showed him him my fists, I also showed him the fraudulent documents he deceived me into paying, and the motherfucker ran away like a cockroach. I then went back to the Internet company, showed them the fraudulent docs, and they credited my account with $100 and put his debt back onto his name. This is what it means to set and maintain boundaries. People will treat you how you allow them to treat you. ",

            "answer_text": "This most likely has to do with behavior. For example, your 13-year old daughter wants to get a tattoo. You tell her you will let her when she turns 18. You set a boundary and if she geys a tattoo before 18 there will be consequences. Or, your boss asks you to call or email him any time, even in the middle of the night or weekends. except for Thursdays between 8 p.m. and midnight. If you call him on a Thursday at 9 p.m. you have not respected his boundary. Your waitress is busy and you try to get her to stay at your table to hear your joke. She listens and then hurries off because some other customer needs to place an order. You call her back in 10 minutes and ask for more coffee. She gives it to you and you start to tell her another joke. She stops you and tells you she has other tables to take care of so she cannot listen to your joke, and smiles and walks away. You stay there another 20 minutes, not ordering any more food, and call her back saying you need another free refill of hot coffee. Then you start telling her another joke. You have violated several boundaries: 1. You are taking up her time after she told you not to. 2. You have done nothing to facilitate her being of service to others who actually are paying for more food and would leave her more tips, therefore crossing a boundary of consideration for another person's right to do their job and 3. You have cross over the boundary of a normal client-waitress relationship and have entered an area which is almost harrassment. In my last couple of examples you can see that boundaries can belong to unspoken cultural norms of behavior. ",
