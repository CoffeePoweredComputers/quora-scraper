            "answer_text": "You need a good web scraping service to handle this for you, it isn\u2019t much of a rocket science as news aggregation websites use this to gather news from different websites almost all at once. Since the same action of web scraping or extraction is going to be repeated several times for the different URLs, all you need to do is to set up a loop of the scraping activities to be carried out on each URL before moving to the next. The same way you\u2019d scrape the text data from one URL is same thing to apply here but this time action is repeated severally for different URL. It\u2019s as simple as that. There isn\u2019t a particular web scraper that will extract all of the text at once, rather it\u2019ll be a step by step process. Or better still you work with a good web scraping service and have them handle all of these for you without the need to worry about how fast or slow you want it. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many of these tools in the market at the moment. You should look for one that could meet your needs while extracting data. I would suggest checking Scrapy and/or BeautifulSoup since I found these tools being user-friendly, easy to understand and work with. Also, the great thing is that both of these tools can work with complex websites as well as with the easy-ones and that means that you can extract almost any kind of data and to go around the website won\u2019t be a big problem. Besides, these tools work fast even when you use proxy services. Proxies are very important when scraping web since scraping is an automatic action and can be easily detected by the website which leads to being banned without data you needed. To avoid that you use proxies that imitate natural human activity on the website and masks your real actions. Proxies are also very useful when you have to bypass geo-restrictions that often are a big problem trying to access various types of data. ",
