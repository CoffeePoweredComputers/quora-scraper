            "answer_text": "there is a pretty good chance actually they just attach themselves to you if you offend them or if they take interest in you. if you are doing spiritual practices, if you are loud. they affect your emotions and motives. are you feeling things like a different person? you got a problem. you need to see someone who specializes in removal or if worst comes to worst, abolishing. i think the tibetans are more adept than they let on. there are also taoist priests the west is pretty secretive about their actual psycho active power, so there is that. \u2026 don\u2019t screw with the paranormal for kicks, all horror movies start that way. in fact don\u2019t try to meditate for pathless reasons either. if you are walking the path, become a monk, join a monastery learn the rules! the paranormal is no joke. also you would need a shit ton of spiritual protection that major paths have, and even then you will encounter resistance. remember when mara was doing that to buddha? they gloss over that, but that should be 90% of the information! you will encounter darkness and you have to be able to resist!

Regardless of the reality of the situation, your own fear will likely manufacture the appearance of a haunting of some kind that you will carry around with you, but it will be entirely of your own making. Ask yourself this question: if there are spirits loafing about in \u201chaunted spots\u201d in Ohio, why in the world would they be interested in you? Do you think the dead \u2014 the billions and billions of human dead over the course of history \u2014 have nothing better to do than to say \u201cBoo! Hahahaha!\u201d to living people? Honestly, sometimes, one just despairs. ",

In a cemetery they wanted to come home with me. I told them \u201cNO\u201d. I have had two attachments however, I learned how to release them. One was not positive and I ended up with a speeding ticket as it put the gas peddle down and would not let me change it. One was a nice person who needed help to get to the other side after 9/11. He was being asked to go help on the other side with all confusion and more than usual numbers of people coming in. He did not know how to do this. I sent him on his way a couple of days later as he was good company. You always have the ability to tell them to leave and they are not welcome to return. ",

But when it comes to the paranormal, realm, belief is everything, and subconscious beliefs and trump conscious ones. If you are so afraid, it would probably be a good idea to stay away. If you intend to go anyway, find someone you trust that knows, and has a good track record in releasing attached spirits. Then go, and each time have yourself scanned and have any hitchhikers sent on their way. Do this for a while and the whole process will become so Ho-Hum that you will lose your fear. ",

If you visit haunted places there is a good chance of carrying something back with you and this will link your home with the haunted site. Back the basic issue is compatibility, whether you want a connection to a haunted place or to lost and miserable souls, or you are a student new at using or meddling with chi, eg Tai Chi, yoga, some meditation forms, Reiki\u2026. SUch practices make you brighter but not necessarily cleaner\u2026.. Protection is based on your love of life and karma, and general joy of being loved by God. ",

If you\u2019re terrified of a spirit following you or attaching to you, then why are you going to haunted places? You are going right to the places where your worst fears are most likely to come true. You can send out thoughts of protection and other things that help, but realistically, there\u2019s nothing that can keep you 100% impervious to spirits, all the time. If you want to encounter spirits, go to a good medium. It\u2019s much safer, and is more likely to be a positive experience. ",
