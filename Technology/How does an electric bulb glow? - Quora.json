            "answer_text": "There are two types of lightbulbs: incandescent and fluorescent. An incandescent bulb uses heat caused by an electrical current.  When electrical current passes through a wire, it causes the wire to heat.  The wire, or filament, gets so hot that it glows and gives off light.  Everyday incandescent light bulbs have a filament made of tungsten.  Since the hot tungsten would quickly burn away if it were exposed to oxygen, it must be placed in a sealed glass bulb which is either evacuated or filled with a gas that won't let it burn. Another common type of light is the fluorescent lamp.  A fluorescent lamp is a glass tube filled with argon gas and a tough of mercury.  When electrical current is passed through the gas the atoms of the gas pick up energy and radiate it in the form of ultra-violet light (and some heat).  The UV light then strikes the inside of the tube, which is coated with a phosphor.  The phosphor glows, giving off the light we see. Fluorescent lamps don't require high temperatures to produce light, like incandescent bulbs do.  Energy must be used in heating the incandescent bulb, and a large part of that energy is lost as heat, not light.  In the fluorescent lamp, a larger portion of the energy is radiated as light ",

            "answer_text": "Every object that has a temperature above absolute zero emits radiation. The higher the temperature the shorter the average wavelength of the radiation emitted. In physics an ideal radiator of this type is referred to as a black body radiator. If an object behaves as a true black body radiator then its emission spectrum is solely determined by its temperature. An incandescent bulb runs electric current through a filament and creates enough heat to raise its temperature to around 3000 degrees Kelvin (about 2700 degrees Celsius). At that temperature the emission spectrum has a lot of invisible heat being radiated but it also has fair amount of visible red and yellow light, with lesser amounts of green and blue. The result is what we sometimes refer to as \u201csoft white.\u201d However, at hotter temperatures the wavelengths start to shift toward the blue and result in a truer white or \u201cbright white.\u201d This is more like sunlight, and the sun\u2019s temperature is closer to 6500 Kelvin. If these Kelvin numbers sound familiar, that\u2019s because you may have seen them on a pack of lightbulbs at the hardware store\u2026 3000 K, 6500 K, etc. This is referred to as the color temperature. Other bulb types, like CFLs or LEDs, do not emit their light via black body radiation, but they are still classified according to their color temperature so they can be compared to incandescent bulbs.
