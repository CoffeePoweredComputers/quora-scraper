            "answer_text": "The price increase reflects Tesla\u2019s confidence that its FSD technology can be delivered soon, and will offer value to customers. As before, the price increase is timed to encourage wavering buyers to purchase the package in the next few days. One also needs to consider rival FSD offerings, in particular Waymo. The company is launching a driverless taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona. The urban area has been mapped to within a few inches so that the lidar (Light or laser radar) mounted on each car\u2019s roof can find its position accurately. The map took a lot of effort to build, and more to keep it updated as things inevitably change. The lidar device is expensive, costing $7,500 to other manufacturers on condition that they do not compete. We don\u2019t know if Waymo is subsidising them as the standard offerings cost $75,000.  This is not something consumers will want on top of their vehicles. Tesla\u2019s $10,000 price competes with Waymo, and we don\u2019t know what the software will cost. It cost billions to develop and test on the roads. Waymo employed drivers to ride in their cars for hundreds of millions of miles. Waymo finally launches an actual public, driverless taxi service https://www.mes-insights.com/lidar-systems-costs-integration-and-major-manufacturers-a-908358/ Tesla\u2019s sensors and electronics are part of every vehicle it sells. The on-board AI is trained to use the same senses as humans, albeit enhanced and more capable. The sensors are cameras (its eyes) looking in every direction, as well as radar which judges distances better than our vision and brain can do.  Autopilot 1.0 was trained with real data returned by the million Teslas on the road. Researchers asked the fleet to find instances of errors in the algorithm as they were discovered and send them back to help train the network. Testing was done in customer\u2019s cars by comparing the AI\u2019s decision with that of the driver. It did not matter if the vehicle was on Autopilot at the time. Altogether Tesla gathered information about billions of miles of real-world driving. Autopilot reached a plateau (or local maximum in AI jargon) and stopped improving. Tesla\u2019s engineers used their experience to rewrite Autopilot 2.0, which is now in the hands of beta-testers. Tesla is adding a new '4D' radar with twice the range for self-driving - Electrek  First look at Tesla's Beta FSD Shows Surprising Poise The videos linked in this article shows test drivers\u2019 reactions to the behaviour of the car. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do that!? You didn\u2019t do that!?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t do that! I didn\u2019t do that!\u201d Tesla does not need an accurate map for self-driving; it can drive on roads it never saw before. You get that for your $10k. ",
