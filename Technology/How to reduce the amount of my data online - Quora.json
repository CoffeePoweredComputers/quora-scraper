Mail clients, social media and other apps are very chatty and will keep using data in background. If you\u2019re using a desktop, when you aren\u2019t actually using it, disable the ethernet adapter. If it\u2019s a mobile, turn off cellular data. Stream videos at a lower resolution. Don\u2019t leave torrent clients running Do automatic backups less frequently Mainly, be aware of what you have running that uses data. ",
