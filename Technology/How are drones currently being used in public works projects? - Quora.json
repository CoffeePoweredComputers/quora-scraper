            "answer_text": "The most common use that I\u2019m aware of is inspection. Because of the low cost of drones and the high quality cameras they carry, they are being used for this quite a lot. They allow for visual inspection of hard to reach areas like towers, dams, and bridges much more safely than climbing, and more cost effectively than bringing in a lift or scaffolding. They are also used in cases where a \u201cbird\u2019s eye view\u201d is useful. Getting an overall view of how a crop is faring is something I\u2019ve seen. Areas where plants are doing poorly can be seen that one would miss from the ground. ",

            "answer_text": "In civil engineering and construction it\u2019s used to scan imagery that\u2019s used for creating 3D models. Once the models are created there\u2019s a lot of useful applications. For example the construction companies can monitor the progress of the project, or estimate the volume of material piles, or inspect hard to get to places. Here\u2019s a short video of Autodesk Recap that explains the Drone2Design process.  Here\u2019s an example of using drones to inspect bridges and infrastructure with drones by the civil engineering department of Florida Tech. Researches Explore Drones as Bridge Inspection Tools ",
