            "answer_text": "Obsolescence really depends on the nature of the thing, but generally, the more an object relies on advancing technology, the faster it will become obsolete. For example, a garden rake has been around for thousands of years; if you had one from the Middle Ages, you would recognize it as a rake, and you would be able to use it, and it would work just as well as the rake you bought yesterday. That\u2019s because the rake was designed for use in human hands, and humans have not changed; and it was designed to perform a certain task (rake stuff), and the task has not changed. On the other hand, computers are based on the newest, rapidly evolving technology, and may become quickly obsolete. In the 1990s, computers changed so fast that the top line models weren\u2019t even sold six months later; some generations (e.g., the 486) had poor sales because the generations skipped (in this case, from 386 to Pentium) so fast. Also, computers have dramatically changed in their purposes. Early computers were simply number crunchers; early personal computers were enhanced typewriters, and then became business productivity tools. Nowadays, a computer fits in our shirt pocket and links us to the world with music, video, GPS\u2014 you name it\u2014 and in the future, we can expect computers to tell us what they are going to do. In the middle, some things last a while, then change. For example, the light bulb. Up until recently, you could have used an incandescent bulb you had bought in the 1950s. But with the change of technology, incandescents have become obsolete, in favor of new bulbs that are cooler, brighter, and take less energy. Another \u201cmiddle\u201d example might be airplanes\u2014 at least they airframes. Many planes built in the 1970s and before are still in service because their design has proven reliable. However, much of the \u201cinsides\u201d of the plane have probably been replaced. And then there is the \u201cplanned\u201d obsolescence: A deliberate change in design or styling meant to stimulate sales. Light bulbs were widely thought to be a product of \u201cplanned\u201d obsolescence because they were designed to burn out\u2014 sure, we could design an incandescent filament to last forever, but then you would buy just one light bulb. So we make them cheaper, and you buy many. (The new bulbs last a very long time, but you pay handsomely for them.) And of course, the auto industry got by for decades with planned obsolescence, which is why you can look at just about any American car made before about 1980 and tell what year it was made. So that\u2019s it in large brushstrokes. Generally, the speed with which something becomes obsolete is a function of the technology used to make it, and its purpose. ",

            "answer_text": "It has double life during nostalgia attack after 30 years. So let's say you have a horse that is pulling water out of the well. Industrial revolution comes by , and your horse is useless because you bought a steam engine. So you kick your horse to the curve and enjoy leasure life. This is first death. Now every now and then you remember how you used to have horse do that job. At first you chuckle at the idea how messier and difficult it was, then 5-ish years pass and you remember how you used to pet that horse, give it food complain to him about your wife/girlfriend/teacher. This is some among first steps of nostalgia. Remembering continues and after 25-ish years you decide to get a horse just for hell of it. It is nice for the first several times until you start cleaning it's poop and you sell it again. This is second death, and final because you won't buy a horse again since you now know that all that system with horses had some major flaws that steam engine doesn\u2019t have. Now of course it depends on importance for every day of that \u201csomething\u201d and usability after it is replaced. Simple example : engineers used to draft everything by hand 30 or so years ago. Now there are still ppl who draft by hand , and in next few generations drafting by hand will become obsolete yet again. But now since all that equipment needs to go somewhere and it became cheap due to engineers not buying it, artists have started to use similar tools ( just rebranded ) for art. Ones man garbage - another's prize. And writing\u2026 even till this day people write by hand, there aren't much handwritten letters anymore, but technology didn't evolve enough that we can write something down quickly for mundane stuff, like signature or explaining something abstract. In short : there isn't the best new thing, there is better. Every Innovation hast it's pros and cons, often stuff that was obsolete just moved where it is needed. Never truly disappears, like energy it will exist always in this form or another. ",
