            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t fall for it. The pricing model on inkjets is to (almost) give you the printer to get you to buy their ink. People saw through it, and started throwing away the printers. The companies responded, and now the new printers now all come with \u201cstarter\u201d cartridges that have barely any ink in them. Even many of the laser printer manufacturers have switched to starter cartridges as well. Inkjet printers are not a good deal for most people in the long run. See: Scott King Walker's answer to Should I buy a laser printer or an inkjet printer? and Scott King Walker's answer to What products are relatively cheap to buy, but expensive to own? Bottom line\u2026 almost everyone is better off buying a laser printer (even a color laser printer) than buying any inkjet printer. The printers are more expensive, and the toner cartridges are more expensive, but it pays off in the long run because the toner cartridges and the printers last so much longer. If you want to save money, buy Brother laser printers because they are reasonably priced, well built, and the consumables are less expensive. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably because the profit made from the sales of ink for any specific printer are much higher, percentage wise, than the profits made from selling low-end printers usually made in China for the USA and UK/European markets. Without the sale of low-end, low-prices, printers which generate income but very little, the selling of compatible ink cassettes is what really gives profits. This is very noticeable when one finds out that the same ink patrons made by some other company and are identical to the original patrons cost half as much as the machine manufacturers own cassettes, then the shock sets in.
