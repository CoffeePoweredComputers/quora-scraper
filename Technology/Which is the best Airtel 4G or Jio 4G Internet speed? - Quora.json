            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A! The answer to this would be highly subjective to state, city, place in the city and also time of usage. The 4G cell-site supports speeds upto 40 Mbps. But that is when only 50 people are latched to it. In practical scenario, we never have only 50 people latching on to a mobile tower. Hence, the speed decrease. Companies put mobile towers as per population density. So an area in core of the city might be served through 4 cell sites, while on a highway, for a similar area 1 cell site would suffice. The number of users and timing of using mobile data also matters. So in a corporate-dominated area, users will be typically there betweek 9 AM \u20136 PM, while at residential areas, higher usage would be observed around 8\u201311 PM. That would mean former would get better speeds in night time, and latter in day time. Hence, it would be unfair to put a blanket statement on Airtel vs Jio vs Vodafone vs Idea 4G. Best suggestion can be taken from people in your locality/office. Depending on their experience, the best operator can be chosen. ",
