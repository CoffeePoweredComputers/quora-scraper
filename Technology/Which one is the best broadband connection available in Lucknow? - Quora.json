            "answer_text": "I am not sure about which one is good ISP's in your location. But surely I can help you with getting best that suits your needs. Get answers to the questions below : Analysis of your needs can be done by getting detailed reports of data usage in your home for a period of at least an year. This will give you key information about data usage for a month. Take the highest level of data consumed.Get to know the total amount you have spent on data packages you bought from your mobile and broadband.What's your usage patterns like do you mostly use smartphone or connected to your computer / laptop for internet surfing. This will allow you to understand do you really want a broadband connection at your home or not.Please note that local internet service providers like cable operators or some other private companies charge anywhere between \u20b9500\u2013\u20b9700/MO.You consider the following before you buy the plan.Monthly cost. Is it what you want.Security deposit if any, refundable clause and the time frame for such refunds. Be sure that they will try not to pay such refunds. So negotiate with them for waiver.Cost of Installation & any additional equipments like DSL modem or a wireless router. They waive off the cost if paid 3-6-12 months advance rent along with discount rates for such advance payments.Check out reviews from your neighbors of their services. Like downtime if it happens how much time they take to get the connection up. How many days does this happen in a month.No of user devices that will be connected to your broadband internet service. Like Smartphone, computer & laptop. Please note that for each connected device you want min bandwidth of 512kbps* (1 Mbps = 1024 Kbps) Kilo Bits Per Second & M=Mega.Also check what kind of Wi-Fi router is being provided. It should be a N300 series Router at least. This will take care of the connected devices. Also check if the router has QoS options in the router Firmware or not, this helps in distribution of bandwidth to users so that everyone is able to use internet without much of a lag in connection. It happens when one person is watching movie, while you want to shop online but your connection is very slow, since all the bandwidth is taken up by him/her.Once you have the answers check this :Monthly consumption is 30 GB mostly when you are using in home - then your smartphone\u2019s data is enough. As most of the TSP'S are providing 4G services with 1 GB cap/day.Monthly consumption is 60 GB or more while you are in home. The mobile data will be expensive. You should go for broadband.Please also note that this internet connection is available only inside your house and cannot be used when you travel.BSNL has launched BB249 unlimited downloads with 2 Mbps speed Fixed Usage Plan (FUP) 1 GB after consuming 1 GB the speed drops to 1 Mbps. This plan is for promotion and will automatically converted to BB499 after completion of promotional period of 6 or 12 months. ",

            "answer_text": "That totally depends on which are are you leaving in lucknow . But as per response from my colleages , Airtel is best one as it has broad reach in lucknow as well as their downtime is negligible , Further they have very good or can say best customer support . Their only negative thing is the speed data cap which is restricted to 10 GB (plan which normal user selects) . rest everything is cool with them .Next comes BSNL , i have used their WiMax services which is very unstable to such extent that in my 512 Kbps unlimited plan . I only got 512+ Kbps (as when it runs fine you will get 900Kbps speed) for roughly say 15\u201318 days a month . For rest days it dips to 50\u2013250 Kbps (Kilo Bit per second) . So only choose them in rare condition when you have no other ISP in your region . I disconnected them after moving to Netxss .There comes a new ISP player in market Netxss (NETXSS) , which using since one month seems totally reliable . I got constant 2Mbps speed till 50 GB , afterwards it collapsed to constant 512Kbps . So definetly recommended as per their plan price is considered . but talking with one of their guy , it seems they have very limited reach right now . I live in Gomti Nagar Vistaar .Even if your area is not covered by them , search a little more from your friend circle or neighbours in your locality about local ISP in your area (i came to know about Netxss by talking with a nearby Kirana store owner) . As what i have seen from couple of my colleagues using local ISP provides services , their plans are much cheaper and service is also good since they are restricted to small regions only . ",
