            "answer_text": "Broadband technology allows for high-speed transmission of voice, video and data over networks and ICT applications. The introduction of broadband technologies, community antennas, optical fibre, satellite and fixed and mobile wireless has enabled traditional and new forms of telecommunications to become a reality throughout the world. Because physical infrastructure and geography are vastly different from country to country, technology that works well in one geographic area may not work in another.Given the rapid advancement of telecommunication technologies, broadband access technologies have become available, specifically wireless, which offer performance that is similar to, or improves upon, wired access solutions.One of the main problems facing the developing countries is the lack of access to broadband services, and low teledensity. This programme will contribute to the goal of digital inclusion by providing assistance for the efficient and cost-effective development of rural, national and international broadband telecommunication networks, including broadband network access allowing the provision of new ICT services and applications.",

            "answer_text": "This term has different meanings in different fields of communication. In telecommunication Broadband is one type of transmission that has frequency range quiet large to transmit multiple types of signals and traffic at a time. Mediums of several types like co-axial cable , optical fiber or twisted pair cable can be used. In case of internet access, \"broadband\" is used to mean \"access that is always on and faster than the traditional dial-up access\". So we can sum up by saying broadband network is the network which is using a wide band of frequency to provide a faster and larger data transmission system. ",
