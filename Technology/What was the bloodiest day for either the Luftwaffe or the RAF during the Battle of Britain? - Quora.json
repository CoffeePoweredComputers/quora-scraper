            "answer_text": "The answer to that is the very last day of the Battle of Britain when the Luftwaffe under the mistaken idea that the RAF had been beaten made an all out effort to attack England. What they found was that the RAF far from being beaten was stronger than it had been on day 1 of the Battle. All raids were intercepted and attacked. The losses on both sides are still argued about today BUT the Luftwaffe stopped Daylight attacks and never repeated the experience. ",
