            "answer_text": "If you want to go with a Camera centric phone then go with Samsung M31s. It is much better than Poco X2 and OnePlus Nord. Both these phones are not known for their camera quality. Samsung M31s has Sony IMX 682 sensor with 1.8 aperture and OnePlus Nord has Sony IMX 586 sensor with 1.75 aperture. Also, OnePlus and Poco phones are never known for their Camera quality and this mid range Nord and X2 are no good either. Samsung M31s has an awesome camera in this segment and budget. It is way better than OnePlus and Poco in Picture and Video quality. It has some amazing flagship camera features as well. Also, it has the best battery of 6000 mah with 2 days backup. You should go with Samsung M31s. ",
