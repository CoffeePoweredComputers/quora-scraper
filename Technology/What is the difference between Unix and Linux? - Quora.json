            "answer_text": "The main difference most people are concerned about is that Unix is a proprietary OS, while Linux is open source. Unix was originally written as a networking OS.  For a very long time, it was the primary operating system for much of the Internet.  Being proprietary, it can cost as much as $20,000 USD (yes, that's thousand) for a mainframe system.  The end user is not authorized to modify the kernel or much of the underlying code in any way, as it's a violation of the license. The initial Linux kernel was written in 1991 by a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds, and was meant to be both a clone of the Unix system, yet free for anyone to use and modify as needed.  In a way, it's one of the most well known crowd sourcing projects, since many hands have taken the original kernel and improved on it for a large number of uses.  The \"license\" dictated by Torvalds is simply to make the modified source code freely available to everyone, which is why so many software companies have their finished product AND the source code available for download on their site, without charge.  Many will ask for donations, but it's not required. In truth, these two differences are really the biggest ones. Technically, Linux was only the kernel, which is the basic framework for which the entire OS operates on, while Unix was the full package.  However, \"Linux\" has come to encompass the whole package, also. Some of the minor differences lie in the tools and other software provided with each installation.  These tools may operate a bit differently from each other, but in general, each does very similar things.  Unix provides somewhat more advanced boot options, but mostly because the majority of Unix systems have a more advanced BIOS. Linux and Unix both share a great deal of similarities, such as the shell, GUI (Graphic User Interface) like KDE or Gnome, and can both use many of the same programs, such as Open Office, along with development tools (perl, Python, C++ compilers). For most home users with desktops and laptops, using one of them many Linux flavors is nearly the same as using Unix, but a lot less expensive.  Many small and medium networks also use Linux, since it has the same power and tools Unix does. ",

            "answer_text": "Linux is an Open Source project developed all over the world by a loose group of enthusiasts. Unix is much more older than Linux, and it was there before Linux even came around. Long ago, Unix was something like Linux, code was freely available for anyone to study, modify or play with it. But when they realized that codes aren't supposed to be freely available by anyone for them to modify or play with it, they closed the group for the rest of the world, and the developer(or as they said Hackers) had to sign an agreement which stated that they shouldn't be disclosing anything to the outside world about UNIX and to protect their data from their fellow co-workers they had to set up passwords(which weren't as secure as they thought it to be). But, that made some hackers like Richard Stallman feel betraying to the human society. So, Richard Stallman began with his own operating system GNU(GNU's Not Unix) which was aimed to copy the working of UNIX and still be nothing of the original OS. He had everything completed, except for the kernel(the heart & soul of any OS). He was creating a kernel name HURD, but it was way to complicated to be finished in time. That's when a kid named Linus Torvalds sends a letter to the world saying that he's working on a kernel \"just as a hobbie\" and it probably won't support anything other than his \"only processor\". He builds the kernel, and gives out to the world for free to hack into his code and play with it in any way the wished, this led to the creation of what we today know as LINUX. UNIX is developed by certain(fixed) developers, but anyone is free to contribute to Linux and use it as he/she wishes. The biggest difference between the two will be that UNIX is a full fledged operating system, whereas Linux is just a kernel of many free operating systems like Arch Linux, Fedora, GNU Sense, Linux Mint, Red Hat, Ubuntu, etc. ",
