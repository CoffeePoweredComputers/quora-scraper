Sustainable development requires that the needs (as determined from the SDGs) are identified, and the obstructions that prevents people from meeting their needs are removed. Is reducing inequalities harder to achieve than zero hunger? Wow. Tough question. Right now, far more people die from having too much food (generally of low quality, granted) than too little. Diabetes, heart disease, obesity - these kill more than malnutrition. Getting to no fatalities due to inadequate supply of food is totally reasonable - getting to \u2018zero hunger\u2019 might be possible - we grow enough food right now to feed 10 billion people. It\u2019s all about distribution. Reducing inequality is hard - that requires a massive transfer of sovereignty and control from those with power to those without. Are you privileged, or are you around people with privilege? Then you are aware of inequity. How would you fix it? Yeah, me neither. If you look at these things from a specific community perspective, then you may be able to answer this question more precisely. In any given community, which would be easier to address? In Canada, if you address inequity, you\u2019d address hunger, but not the other way around. So I think #10 has to come first, here. But answers will vary significantly. ",
