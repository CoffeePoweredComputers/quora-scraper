            "answer_text": "In addition to all the previous replies, it is because consumers in some of those (third-world) countries do not know, do not care to know, or do not care about HD and its difference compared with SD. They are happy if something moves on the screen, and that\u2019s all. A specific example is the philippines. The powers-that-be there got dragged into the digital HD age and adopted ISDB-T as the OTA TV system. Let\u2019s take the dramae of the biggest broadcaster there: ABS-CBN. In the beginning of the ISDB-T adoption, much ado was made of the HD capability. OTA shows duly transitioned into full-fledged HD, and to spur the public, a set top ISDB-T box was sold that paired well with current HDMI-equipped FHD LCD TVs. However, further and later iterations of this box dropped the HDMI and are now only equipped with analogue SD AV outputs, in the form of a miserable 3.5mm TRRS connector. Though the programs remain HD, this current box truncates it down to analogue SD (!) The indifference of the public to HD apparently got duly noted, and reflected in the excision of the HDMI port on these latest boxes, sold at the same price as their previous HDMI-equipped counterparts. The one other area of note is, in the age of HD one would expect programs to graduate to some semblance of at least 2ch stereo sound accompaniment (we\u2019re not even talking about 5.1 here). But ABS-CBN has steadfastly stuck and marched and bored ahead with pure unadulterated mono sound in all of its single channel glory, in all of its programs. And why not, if indeed the public is indifferent to the fantabulous multi-channel DD mixes typical on would-be blu-rays (and HD broadcasts). If video on discs did not get better than VCDs, people and the powers-that-be in the pilipins would not really be bothered with the 240 resolution, ever. So blu-ray is kinda really besides the point ;) ",

            "answer_text": "You mean, outside wealthy countries? Isn\u2019t that your answer right there? While usage of Blu-ray and DVD players has been declining for years, the main impediment to Blu-ray adoption even in wealthy countries was likely the relative expense of Blu-ray players during their initial debut. Additionally, VCD remained popular in Southeast Asia and the Middle East through the late 2000s, at which point DVD players had decreased significantly in price while Blu-ray players remained far more expensive. Evidently, the VCD format was more tolerant of humidity than VCRs and VHS cassettes, which led to a large installed base of VCD players. But moreover, many consumers in China, the Philippines, and other countries used VCDs with pirated content. Licensed DVDs and Blu-rays were not broadly affordable for these consumers.  ",
