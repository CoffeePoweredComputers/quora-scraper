            "answer_text": "The main innovation relates to three key things being achieved over over wireless networks in an outdoor and mobile environment, which are, high speed, reliability, and low latency. Those three points unlock a wide range of potential applications such as in remote medical, driverless vehicles, automation of everything, and the connection of everything.  The first innovation involves the use of technology that enabled the use of MM Wave or Millimeter Wave Communications which enables low cost, high speed, low latency wireless data transfer. The second innovation is Beamforming using small antennas to concentrate signals into highly focused beams that overcome the \u2018loss\u2019 normally attributed to this style of communication.  A third innovation is Network Slicing. In the past, if a dedicated network was required for a particular industry or service then it required independent infrastructure to built and dedicated to that industry or service. With 5G, that can be achieved virtually via \u2018Network Slicing\u2019 and no need to duplicate existing infrastructure.  5G network architecture is also very different from the traditional central cell base station set up in each area, instead, 5G uses a combination of traditional centralized \u2018base station\u2019 and distributed units. It's likely that you will see lots of small distributed units in buildings and business areas.  Who is the odd pioneer in all this? Australia and its CSIRO in 2006 were first to demonstrate 6GBPS data rates and have been world leaders in mm-wave and e-band backhaul.[1] Footnotes[1] mm-Wave Systems - Wireless Group",
