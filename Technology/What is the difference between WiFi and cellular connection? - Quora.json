            "answer_text": "Wi-Fi The Wi-Fi technology gets you internet access provided by an Internet Service Provider. You connect your devices with the modem and that modem is connected to an outlet i.e. either a phone line or cable line. The internet is accessible by your smart devices wirelessly. Moreover, with an internet service provider, you get assistance while facing a technical problem. For example, if your Spectrum Wi-Fi is not working, you can call the customer service to get it fixed. Radio Frequency The Wi-Fi is a local area network and only provides internet access within a short-range. Your smart devices, computers, and laptops can exchange data using 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz radio waves. This means the bandwidth is very high and you can stream all the popular TV shows in high-definition and play online games without a stretch. Cost There is no underlying cost of connecting your cellphone to the Wi-Fi only if you have an internet connection at your home. You choose a plan according to the requirements of your household and pay your monthly bill according to that plan. Usage As we have already discussed that Wi-Fi comes with high bandwidth. It means you are going to have greater usage. With such bandwidth, you no longer have to worry about the data consumption as most of the internet plans are backed by an ample amount of data limit. This gives Wi-Fi an edge over data. Cellular Data Cellular data is also referred to as the mobile internet. It is provided by your mobile phone service provider and requires a SIM card. As long as you have the cell service, you can use cellular data on the go. However, you need a better network coverage. Radiofrequency As we have already discussed, cellular data has greater coverage. You are consuming data whenever you are browsing or using social media. The cell phone frequencies vary from provider to provider. However, the 5G network will implore new possibilities. It is expected to be 100 times faster than the 4G. All of this will be possible due to the introduction of new frequencies for cellular data. These better frequencies will get us better bandwidth on the go. Cost The cellular data is quite expensive as opposed to your Wi-Fi. The cost differs from provider to provider and depends on the type of plan you subscribe to. Range Your Wi-Fi can only work within the range of your router. With a cellular data plan, you can access the internet on your smartphone whenever you want. The 4G LTE service covers most of the areas in the States. So, whenever you are on the move, you can get internet access. Usage Since a single user utilizes the cellular data, the plans are designed to cater to the needs of one user. Users can purchase a certain amount of data as per their usage. Usually, the plans are in the range of 10GB, 50GB and sometimes unlimited. Which one is more secure? Your home Wi-Fi network is secure but if you are outside and connect to a public Wi-Fi hotspot, you might put yourself in trouble. The Public Wi-Fi hotspots are not secure and you become vulnerable to attacks from hackers. So, whenever you are outside, it is advisable to use your cellular data as all the information going through is encrypted. Source: Morning Tick ",

            "answer_text": "Usual point of view of every person, which is also true. WiFi is wireless connection to a device where the router is acting as a hop for sharing the Internet connection. Cellular network, is nothing but accessing Internet with your mobile device through GSM or CDMA signals, but not PSTN(wired). But in reality. WiFi is just a network connectivity between several devices which can connect to a single device(router) which is designed to have a particular IP and MAC. It can share Internet or can be used for intranet purposes too, for sharing data (simple ex: shareit app). It is a few hops distance for the wired connection from your ISP. You can create wifi with laptop, If the laptop is permitted with necessary hardware. You can even create a Wifi with cellular data too by using hotspots and jiofi. Cellular data is almost similar to what we mention in the above, but it is a lot more hops distance from the wired connection. Ex: all the wired connections are connected to signal towers and then to sim. There are many other hops in middle. The ISP is very far away from you. In networking far doesn't mean distance. Far mean hops. ",
