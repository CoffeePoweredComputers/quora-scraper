The example is specific to running the VM on a Linux host using QEMU. I suspect that the only real possible issue might be graphic support in QEMU running on FreeBSD. Note that this has nothing to do with Hackintosh or underlying hardware. Credit goes to Dhiru Kholia who may be able to provide a more educated opinion. EDIT: As I dig into this more, other contributors to this effort include Evgeny Grin and others as mentioned on the github page. ",
