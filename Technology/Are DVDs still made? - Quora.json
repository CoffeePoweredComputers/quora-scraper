            "answer_text": "The very simple one word answer is - YES. But Quora does not like one liners and definitely one word - such answers are collapsed. Hence an elaborate answer. There are two type of DVDs - movie/TV/video content DVDs and Blank DVDs for writing. Among the latter - DVDs for writing - I will consider all such as DVD-R, DVR+R, dual layer, etc. as one single category. BOTH categories are still manufactured today and there is a healthy sale too. Movie/TV Show DVDs: These are sold in stores and online. They provide SD quality video and there are millions of people owning DVD players. Streaming is a recent phenomena - became popular since mid-2010s - whereas DVDs first came out in 1997 or around. People made the transition to DVD quickly once the players were available sub $200. Either they used to rent DVDs (majority) or buy them. Blockbuster Video made a transition from VHS to DVD. Netflix, the popular streaming service started as a mail-order DVD rental company. As flat screen TVs and higher resolution became popular, VHS went out. Today, DVD Video sales are not that great but still a significant number of people do buy them because the cost is cheap - around $10 for a new movie and $2 to $8 for older movies. This saves the hassle of the movie or show not being available on the stream. With advent of Full HD, DVD sales have dropped even further but these discs are still made. One may ask why? The reason is because they are cheap and always with you and secondly, they don\u2019t cost the studios much money to manufacture, distribute and sell; in fact studios take about 60\u201370% cut of the retail cost. Data DVDs: These are still a medium of offline storage, albeit a secondary medium. People have moved to external HDDs and SD cards for storage. But these are notorious in failure. Cloud storage beyond the free 5 GB/15 GB is expensive. So many people use data DVD as a secondary backup medium. Blu-Ray data discs also exist but not very popular because of cost of writers as well as discs. ",

            "answer_text": "YES. Of COURSE they are. LOL. You can get a LOT with a DVD that you CAN\u2019T get with streaming, so, there is no substitute (unless it\u2019s another form of TANGIBLE item\u2026like Blu-Ray). You don\u2019t get all the \u201cextras\u201d that go onto a DVD (or B-R), and, since a DVD is tangible, and streaming is NOT, you can DISPLAY them, collect them, have them AUTOGRAPHED. Streaming is \u201cokay\u201d, I stream a lot MYSELF. BUT, if I want a movie I am going to watch over and over, and I am PAYING for it, I want it to be TANGIBLE; for the reasons I mentioned. I have a LOT of DVD\u2019s on display. MOST of them are autographed, and some even have little notes stuck inside from someone involved in the film. TANGIBLE. END OF STORY. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes DVDs are still made and used in the world. Not everyone wants to just stream what a provider will allow them to stream. Most people want a physical copy so they can watch it for whenever or however they want to. Also with video streaming devices they control what you can view and often it might be an edited version or updated with scenes that have been obscured or deleted. A great example is the movie Splash recently. If you have the DVD or even the VHS copy of the film you don't get to be annoyed with the harry bum Disney decided to put on Daryl Hannah on the scene we see her bum as she goes back into the water.  LOL! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they are. Some movies were not released on pressed DVDs because of perceived low demand. So some media companies release them on DVD-R and BD-R. Warner calls theirs manufactured-on-demand (MOD), which is aimed at people who want a tangible copy instead of streaming, and is an efficient way of physical distribution without worrying over unsold batches.
