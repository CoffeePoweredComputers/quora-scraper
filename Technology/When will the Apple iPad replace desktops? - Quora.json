            "answer_text": "Steve Jobs famously said that if they designed a tablet operating system that required an input device other than your finger, they blew it.  I think Apple has been dealing with this ever since and it is fair to say, Mr. Jobs was not right. Or, at least he was right in the beginning but not any longer. What makes the desktop computer more productive, besides its power, is that it makes use of physical input devices that are proven to be more productive. Would Steve approve of the new Apple Magic Keyboard?  Why does this product even exist? Apple obviously knows there is a demand for a physical keyboard and trackpad enough to have invested millions of dollars in development for this wonderful, if overpriced, accessory, and modified the iPad\u2019s operating system to support input from most any Bluetooth input device. To me, this is proof that Apple has acquiesced and moved on from Steve\u2019s original philosophy, which was fine back then because it was true in the beginning that the team at Apple had to figure out how to do a touch interface to get this thing off the ground. They did, and the iPad achieved magnificent success because of it, but now, it is limited precisely because of it. So, what would it take to just make the iPad Pro, which already has USB-C, capable of Thunderbolt 3/DisplayPort on that connector, so that we could daisy-chain a few monitors? That and a keyboard and mouse or trackpad, and an OS that not only accepts but is optimized for those types of inputs are all that separate an iPad from a laptop or desktop computer. This is not a case of Apple\u2019s capability of doing it, but will they do it? I am sure in Apple\u2019s skunkworks, they have iPads running Big Sur and they act just like a MacBook, but I think they are not ready to go there just yet. I think we will see what the switch to Apple Silicon will do for Macs, but what I see is a convergence of iPadOS and macOS. I think it\u2019s inevitable. So, the answer to this question in my opinion is YES, ABSOLUTELY, the iPad will one day match the average desktop computer in terms of power and productivity. For that matter, there\u2019s no reason why our mobile phones can\u2019t do the same thing. I know this is not a new concept. It has already been done with Android tablets and mobile phones for a number of years. So, it\u2019s not some brilliant idea I\u2019m talking about here. But Apple has already met (surpassed?) the average laptop/desktop\u2019s power with the iPad. They are holding back the capability to do this just so they can sell more laptops and desktops and they\u2019ll keep doing it as long as they keep moving their high-margin, class-leading iPads. As long as the iPad, MacBook, and iMac continue to sell in their respective markets, Apple will not have any motivation to converge these products. If they did, iPad sales would go up and laptop/desktop sales would go down, resulting in a net change overall of less revenue, or maybe less growth potential. But when they can figure out a way for it to mean growth in their business, they will do it. They may not have any other choice as Microsoft could beat them to the punch with Surface Pro. Steve also said that one day, desktop computers would be considered more like pickup trucks and tablets would be fine for most users.  One day, desktop computers will be the equivalent of supercomputers today. The average person won\u2019t need something that utilitarian. Steve was right about a desktop computer becoming more like a pickup truck one day and the tablet becoming the most popular computing device (besides our mobile phones), but he was wrong about how we would prefer to interact with that device.

            "answer_text": "Are you a maker or a consumer? Makers - most people who create content need real computers. For Makers the tablet is not going to replace the desktop for a lot of reasons. Consumers - who mostly consume others people\u2019s content can get by with an iPad. For consumers - it already has. But even Makers also consume content created by others which is why many of not most of us have both and in fact anyone who is over thirty probably has multiple devices. Here are a few reasons - desktop screen real estate - there is no way a person with 80 square inches of screen can operate at the same speed as someone with several large monitors. Even a 20 inch monitor has 400 square inches but many of us use 2 or 3 larger monitors - I usually have over 1000 square inches to work. Not needed to watch a movie but definitely needed to make a movie. Reason number two: Ports - connectivity of peripherals like cameras, microphones, mice, trackpads, alphanumeric keyboards, music keyboards, external storage and yes extra monitors. The tradeoff is super simple; portability versus productivity and connectivity. For reading or watching, a tablet is great, but for idea capture and evolution through delivery or deployment, not so much. But hey for $300 the base model iPad is incredibly useful so get one. But if I compare the iPad Pro plus the magic keyboard and the pencil were are talking about more than several laptops in the family. And the size and weight of the iPad Pro plus the new Keyboard is more the base MacBook Air. ",
