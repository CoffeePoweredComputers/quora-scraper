            "answer_text": "Simple answer? No. Not needed at all. The SSD will function at its maximum speed with or without Rapid Storage. In fact, most of the new SSDs today would see no benefits whatsoever from this. All Rapid Storage is, is a program making a software RAID setup using specialized instructions in Intel CPUs. It\u2019s better than some forms of software RAID, but not the best. And it only works on SATA drives. Not for NVMe SSDs. And even on SATA SSDs, it doesn\u2019t gain you any speed as the \u201cbottleneck\u201d with SATA SSDs is the SATA controller, not the drive (unlike HDDs). And worst, it only works on more than one disk - the RAID means combining disks, else it has absolutely no effect. There may be some select cases where you \u201cwant\u201d such RAID on multiple SSDs. But for nearly everyone it is of no use whatsoever. And even then, there are alternatives making \u201cbetter\u201d RAID setups than Rapid Storage, and even alternatives giving better functionality than any sort of RAID. ",
