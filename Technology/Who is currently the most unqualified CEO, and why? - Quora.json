Someone who can be judged on his entire time as leader at one company. The title goes to Jeff Immelt, ex-CEO of GE (ret 2017). During his tenure as CEO, shares of GE dropped 30% while the S&P 500 index had risen by nearly 134%. I have not calculated his total compensations over his 17 year tenure. I am too lazy. The numbers are available on Wikipedia. I estimate that he made at least a quarter of a billion dollars for himself while his shareholders lost tens of billions of dollars. ",
