            "answer_text": "I wear a Garmin Forerunner 920XT. It does phone notifications and step counting, but the main reason I bought it was to use for heart rate, speed, distance and time when kayaking. I wear it every day. I almost never look at the phone notifications or the step counting. In February 2016 I had a rather harrowing accident in which I lost my kayak under the ice of a frozen river. My Forerunner was still attached[1]. Two and a half weeks later, I found my kayak, buried in the mud on the river bank a few miles downstream from where we\u2019d parted company.[2] The kayak was a complete loss, but my Forerunner was fine. I\u2019m still using it. [1] Death of a Thunderbolt [2] Alas, poor Thunderbolt, I knew him well ",

            "answer_text": "Nowadays, more than you think. They last maybe 2 years at best, it\u2019s a millennium thing. Why? Ask them or yourself, if you fall into that category. I can not say all of them, the majority of them. Technology is more important than craftsmanship. I love my watches, I would not trade in one of them for a thousand of the smartwatches. I am old school, I love what goes into making what I perceive as a real watch. We all have different perceptions of what is an actual achievement!!! ",
