            "answer_text": "First of all, it depends on your goals and the school you choose. If I were starting over again (and wanted to be an engineer/producer) in the next couple of years, I would go to Berklee because they recently purchased Avatar Studios, formerly known as Power Station, where I worked for many years. Right now they are in the process of renovating the studio, so no classes are being held, which is why I said \u201cnext couple of years\u201d. Prior to closing the studio for these renovations, they had some wonderful seminars offered to the public that would help anyone interested in technology. The other choice would be NYU, where multiple Grammy winner, Jim Anderson, oversees the program. Jim is an amazing person and has really created a fantastic program and is passionate about helping students get the education they need to work in this business. With that said, the costs are high and there is no guarantee that you will be able to go out and get a job in the business because there are far more people looking than there are opportunities. However, if you are looking to do music production for yourself, and don\u2019t mind spending the money to have the knowledge, then investigate these two school, as well as SAE Institute on 18th and Broadway in NYC. Many people do not attend a formal program, or a community college program, and learn by experimentation and from fellow musicians. You will still need to find your own \u201cvoice\u201d and will continue to learn throughout your career. The final decision is based on what you want to do in the industry. Since my background is mostly on the business side, I would recommend NYU for their music business program. But, don\u2019t spend the money if you think it will make is easy to get a high paying job in the industry to pay back student loans. You\u2019ll have to have a strong work ethic, natural talent, the right demeanor (including no attitude), and a great deal of luck to find true success in the music industry. ",

            "answer_text": "The key question is what you want to achieve with such a degree - where would it take you? doing a degree would hopefully provide you with all the following: technical knowledge and understandingexperience on a wide range of industry-standard studio gearteaching by competent, experienced industry professionalsinculcation of positive attitudes which lead to successnetworking opportunities.My only experience is of British courses. Quite a few years back I was involved with the UK Music Producers Guild\u2019s fledgling steps into approving degree courses, before family pressures took me away from all that. I can remember talking to some very senior London studio owners, guys with very serious background and credits, who completely refused to take graduates from one particular (worldwide) private recording school, because they came in without the requisite humility and willingness to learn - they expected to take charge of projects immediately. I believe the (un)said school has changed its ways, but despite the high fees charged, it had a crappy rep for years. If you want to be the kind of guy who works as assistant to a name engineer/producer/mixer, eventually going out on your own, then look for an institution with a track record in turning out that kind of graduate. If you want to set up your own studio and work with local bands, a wider range of institutions will fit the bill. If you want to be an EDM producer, you don\u2019t need to put yourself through all this stuff. I don\u2019t have such a degree (they didn\u2019t exist when I was younger), but that hasn\u2019t stopped me from working in a range of roles, from writing, recording, production, mixing and mastering and teaching, and earning money through what I\u2019ve learned. I\u2019ve talked with very senior old school British engineers and producers, who\u2019ve worked with artists like AC/DC, Bob Marley, The Clash and many others, and they all came up through studio apprenticeship systems. Other name producers came into it through being musicians. They all had the right attitude and were willing to seize opportunities. ",
