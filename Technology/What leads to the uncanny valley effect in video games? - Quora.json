            "answer_text": "Human brains have parts specifically designed to recognize people. It\u2019s hardwired in. When something triggers it, like a video, we recognize that as a person and we\u2019re okay. When something doesn\u2019t trigger it, like an obvious cartoon, we\u2019re also okay. When there\u2019s something a little off, our brain says \u201cSomething\u2019s not right\u201d and we feel creepy. This is triggered by CGI that\u2019s just a little off. One theory is that it evolved so that we\u2019d avoid people with genetic anomalies and not reproduce with them. Another theory is that we evolved that to detect early model T-600 series terminators.
