            "answer_text": "As with all video editing it is not just about RAM but, having said that, the more the better. I can do 4K output in HitFilm Pro and I have 24GB RAM.I am currently running CPU i5-2500K, GTX1070ti, 2 x 500GB SSD (One for the programmes and one just for Video Work Files) Multiple 1TB HDD to use as \"offline storage\" both for graphics assets and sounds, as well as all complete old projects files, and saved videos. With a 2 min MP4 video (1080) coming in at average 150MB you will soon use up lots of HD space! Some video editors, such as HitFilm, work well with the additional power of the GPU - I know I found a speed improvement going from the GTX 1060 to the 1070ti. But I have seen on answers here that is not the case for every editor. With some editors it is the CPU which has the most effect. I know that the i5 is now the bottleneck in my rig. Looking at the possibility of a new MB (ASRock X370 Taichi), with an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X. Sticking with the 1070ti, but it will then be the bottleneck (only minor though) and so, later on looking at going to a 1080ti - or one of the equivalent 2080ti, although that 3x cost difference may not be worth the 28% speed improvement, yet. So, to answer your question \u2013 as always, it all depends. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on two factors. The RAM requirements of the video editing software and the length of the 4K video, and not having any experience with this application category i can\u2019t provide a qualified answer, but i know that even editing still images from full-frame digital cameras is very memory hungry and a few people i know who do that, use 8-core Xeon 32Gb and 64Gb RAM systems, with terabyte SSDs.
