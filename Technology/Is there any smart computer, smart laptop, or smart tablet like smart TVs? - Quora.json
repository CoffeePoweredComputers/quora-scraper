            "answer_text": "Let's first understand the meaning of Smart in tech devices . Smart TV simply means an internet enabled TV (A TV whcih has the capability to connect to the internet) The word could be appealing when it's attached to a certain device's name but at the same time it would look awkward and cringy aswell if that's applied to a device which has that ability already ie.connecting to the internet. In conclusion the word Smart is used to differentiate between the TV(s) that have the ability to connect to the internet from the ones that don't have, hence the needlessness to use the same term on computers and similar devices that have that ability built-in natively (some of them or most anyway) from the beginning.
