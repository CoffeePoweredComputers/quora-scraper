            "answer_text": "No, Tesla did not intend his Wardenclyffe tower to broadcast energy for free. It was a later, very different method which supposedly provided \u201cenergy in unlimited quantity.\u201d Instead, (for the Wardenclyffe tower,) Tesla explained that he would use his \u201cMethod of Individuation\u201d to send coded amounts of energy to industrial customers in distant countries. Once a particular order was phoned in, only that one factory would be given the correct \u201cpass key,\u201d and could receive the incoming broadcasts. In an interview, Tesla gave the example of a sugar-factory in Australia phoning in their order, and being sent the megawatts from Niagara Falls tower. From other Tesla comments, this Method of Individuation was probably based on frequency-hopping spread-spectrum, or what\u2019s today called WiFi. (Possibly his mysterious \u201cStatic Eliminator\u201d device used this trick.) Notice that FM frequency-modulation \u201celiminates radio static,\u201d same as WiFi broadband method, where the unwanted thunderstorm emissions cannot duplicate the random hopping. FM radio is a \u201cstatic eliminator.\u201d Tesla\u2019s device was not FM radio, it appears to be employing a type of naturally-occurring frequency-hopping encode/decode process. Tesla describes that, in his system, a channel-hopping sequence of up to three channels are possibly decodable, but also he mentioned that he\u2019d worked with systems of up to twenty channels; just as unbreakable as a 20-digit combination lock. (Described in a 1912 interview, from Leyland Anderson\u2019s 1992 book \u201cNikola Tesla on his work \u2026transmission of power.\u201d) Actual Free Energy? Tesla\u2019s \u201cCosmic energy\u201d claims all date from two decades later: 1933. That\u2019s the year when Tesla finally revealed that he\u2019d discovered a new source of limitless energy. He said that mankind should be very glad that it exists\u2026 but he never said what it was. The secret apparently died with him. \u201cI shall not announce the scientific principles of the discovery nor describe the mechanical means I have devised for carrying it out, for the present. It is sufficient at this time to say that I have performed experiments and obtained results from which I am able to calculate what the mechanism may be expected to perform. Much, of course, remains to be accomplished, but it is work not necessarily of a creative kind; it can be done by many, and hence development to the point of actual operation may be enormously speeded up.\u201d (While in its present form the theory calls for the development of the energy in central plants requiring vast machinery, Dr. Tesla said he might be able \tto work out a plan for its use by individual.) - Tesla interviews, 1933In other words, just more rumors and myths, but started by Tesla himself. And when it was suppressed, it was Tesla himself doing the hushing-up. So, if Tesla\u2019s claims weren\u2019t exaggerated, then it means there\u2019s a vast energy source out there, waiting to be tapped, just as soon as human beings stop refusing to give major funding to all the many apparently-crazy crackpot inventors! :) From Tesla\u2019s The Problem of Increasing Human Energy: \u201cThe scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is like that of the planter\u2014for the future. His duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come, and point the way.\u201d\u201cIt is not a dream, it is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering, only expensive. \u2026blind, faint-hearted, doubting world! [...] Humanity is not yet sufficiently advanced to be willingly led by the discoverer's keen searching sense. But who knows? Perhaps it is better in this present world of ours that a revolutionary idea or invention instead of being helped and patted, be hampered and ill-treated in its adolescence \u2026by want of means, by selfish interest, pedantry, stupidity and ignorance; that it be attacked and stifled; that it pass through bitter trials and tribulations, through the strife of commercial existence. So do we get our light. So all that was great in the past was ridiculed, condemned, combated, suppressed \u2014 only to emerge all the more powerfully, all the more triumphantly from the struggle.\" - N. Tesla 1900(The rumor of Tesla\u2019s fuel-less car, the Pierce Arrow, came from years 1933. So maybe it was tapping the Cosmic Energy flow? Or maybe it was simply being powered by a secret Tesla tower built after Wardenclyffe was torn down, built in Canada.) ",

            "answer_text": "\u201c[...] what did he actually mean by free energy?\u201d I think it is simple. Note that this is my personal take on it. Tesla said things like \u201cconnecting to the very wheel-work of nature.\u201d \u201cCosmic Rays that move faster than light.\u201d \u201cUnlimited source.\u201d Etc.. If we look at the quote, \u201c[...] the very wheel-work of nature.\u201d (source below) then it becomes apparent that Tesla is talking about the source that birthed the universe. Tesla is talking about the Prime Mover, the be-all end-all. That is free energy. If the ultimate thing is not free energy, then we, the universe, and everything, will die and nothing can bring it back. Rightly, Tesla believed in free energy.  Below from: https://www.quora.com/How-does-Tesla%C2%B4s-free-energy-invention-work/answer/Thor-Fabian-Pettersen How does Tesla\u2019s free energy invention work? I believe it works like this: F = ma becomes F = -ma. Cosmic Rays that move faster than light = The Absolute Universe. You do not move faster than light, but you exist in a zero-dimensional world that lets you apparently \u201cmove faster than light.\u201d Radiant Energy = connecting to the very wheel-work of nature = must be the Absolute Universe (read about it below). The reason why I believe this is that I can see only one way for free energy to truly work. + Tesla had discovered a mysterious source of electrical energy, a secret that he took to his grave. I believe I have rediscovered this source (read below). With a little change in attitude, we could follow the smartest man who ever lived, Nikola Tesla, and have real free energy. Then 20 000 children would not need to die every day. A little change. I think I speak for many free energy enthusiasts when I say this: A little, fucking change. But no. You all remain assholes! (Strong words, but so true. A little change in attitude could change this world overnight.) You just have to believe in death and decay! Why can\u2019t you believe in life and immortality\u2014because that is what free energy is. Free energy is Immortal Nature. Is that so hard to understand? Is that so hard to see? Granted, if ISIS got their hands on free energy, then they would use it to blow up, say, the universe, which is why there will be a cosmic conspiracy to prevent Type 0 civilizations like us ever getting our hands on it. That is, when we venture into space, we really need to become benevolent. If we made the free energy dream come true, then I guess the powers that be would cause WW3 in retaliation (because they would lose so much money). That makes free energy enthusiasts like me the Anti-Christ. So 20 000 children today will just have to die. I do not believe that free energy is that dangerous. The real danger is the ones who sit on all the money and will rather see WW3 than face a wonderful world. That is, free energy would make money obsolete, which is why you must ridicule the free energy meme at every turn. It must not grow as a serious concept in fit brains. Imagine a large-scale production of free energy devices, the world would change, literally, overnight. So, the next 20 000 will either have to wait for the rich to become so ridiculously rich that their breadcrumbs will be large enough to feed all the world or, the said 20 000 must hope and pray that the robot that is coming soon will be benevolent. I believe there are four possible solutions to, \u201cWhy do we not have free energy?\u201d 1. E.T. does not allow its usage. They are evil. Or we are children. Who knows? 2. E.T. allows it, but the ones with all the money prevent it. 3. E.T. is not here and the ones with all the money prevent it. 4. Scientists believe that free energy is impossible and their belief simply closes all doors. Dissolving the Free Energy myths: \u2014Free energy does not violate any physical laws, nor conservation laws and the second law of thermodynamics. \u2014Free energy does not violate the arrow of time. \u2014Free energy does not violate reason. \u2014Free energy is not a perpetual motion machine. \u2014Free energy is not overunity. \u2014Free energy is finite. \u2014Free energy has nothing to do with the infinite or \u201cinfinite energy source.\u201d \u2014Free energy is not magic. \u2014Free energy is not supernatural. \u2014Free energy is not BS. \u2014Free energy does NOT create energy, only transforms unavailable energy into available energy. \u2014Free energy is symmetry, balance and resurrection. \u2014Free energy is the Immortal Heart of Nature, which is a dual torus. \u2014Free energy is normal energy. When you eat normal food, you are eating free energy. \u2014The sun is not a free energy machine; the free energy \u201cmachine\u201d is the Absolute Universe. \u2014Free energy will not blow up the universe by generating a surplus of energy or overunity. \u2014And free energy comes from somewhere! \u2014And I could go on all day, but I think you get the idea. Free Energy very short: Nothingness revives stuff. The end. Free Energy short: Matter and gravity (negative) = the unbalancing of the VE (google Buckminster Fuller\u2019s Vector Equilibrium (VE)). When the VE is unbalanced or folded, it creates matter and gravity (negative) because you need the VE to balance again, which means you need matter to interact with something in order to create the VE again. Then the dead matter can become the VE again, and then the VE can split into matter again, but this time, the matter is alive because it stems directly from the VE. Thus is free energy accomplished. That is, free energy is accomplished by way of resurrection. A Lego analogy: If the VE/cuboctahedron/nothingness = raw, unbuilt Lego bricks, and the space-time (car, fuel, energy, etc.) is the raw Lego bricks assembled into, say, a Lego car, then you will see how the vacuum of space/VE = zero energy. You cannot use raw Lego bricks as fuel if your fuel = a trillion assembled Lego bricks. You need fuel in order to drive your car. If free energy is real, then you still need fuel in order to drive your car. By fuel, I mean, e.g., electricity. Then your car uses up the fuel or the trillion assembled Lego bricks, and then the bricks get diffused out into the environment (space). My free energy idea here is that, if these bricks were reunited with the VE, then they would become raw Lego bricks once more. And from this state, the raw bricks could once more assemble into available energy, i.e., this thing called mass or electricity; which, I believe, would be the first to naturally form from the VE. The VE can be scaled up (or down); you can therefore plug a VE that is the right size directly into your car and thus drive forever. Yes, you have read correctly: Free energy is having a nothingness planted firmly under the hood of your car. That is a new idea. You should consider it. Of course, free energy would have to be that awesome in order to work. We are talking about free energy, which means, we are talking about the most awesome thing in the universe\u2014a thing that could make the warp drive a real possibility. VE = the center point in the cuboctahedron where the 12 lines converge. Free energy is so simple: \u2014Positive mass consumes power = [...] the bricks get diffused out into the environment (space). \u2014Negative mass generates power = [...] if these bricks were reunited with the VE, then they would become raw Lego bricks once more, etc.. (This is why we don\u2019t observe negative mass because it is tucked away in the Absolute Universe.) \u2014That\u2019s it. Free energy is completely symmetrical because Nature uses the positive mass to generate the negative mass. You do not violate conservation laws. You do not violate the second law of thermodynamics because the 2 law is operating in the Relative Universe and not in the Absolute Universe. Crystal visualization: Let the VE be a room. Let the room be made of dots or points. Let the room shrink to the size of one of the dots, now the other dots have no choice but to be stacked upon one another, thus yielding absolute order out of disorder. That is, when the stuff from the Relative Universe reunites with the Absolute Universe, that stuff is ordered once again because of the geometry of the Absolute World. Nothingness aka Absolute Universe/World = VE; that is, the nothingness is in vector equilibrium (VE); the universe (or mass etc.) is not in vector equilibrium; the universe is the folding of the VE. Nothingness = the way the light views Reality. Relative Universe = [...] raw Lego bricks assembled into, say, a Lego car. How do you shrink the room? How do you shrink the space-time in such a way? You would have to use infinite energy in order to do that?! I think Roger Penrose\u2019s idea is that, space-time is made of mass, lose the mass, and you shrink because you become absolute. True, you could perhaps use stupefying amounts of energy shrinking an object of mass, but you don\u2019t have to. Tesla saw free energy. I see it clearly: It all began (I mean: all space and time) with the way the light views reality, which is the true state of the light, which is the Absolute Universe (aka nothingness/motionlessness/timelessness), which is the zero propagation of space and time or massless universe of Penrose. The Absolute Universe can just exist because its nonexistence would be a paradox. The Absolute Universe is forever ordered because there is no room for a state of disorder to grow in, which means that matter can be recycled in the Absolute Universe; which means that, if you had a mini-version of this process in your car, then you could drive your car forever (you still have to change parts, though). [...] with the way the light views reality = Imagine sitting on a beam of light looking back at the universe. What would you see? You would see everything as frozen in time. However, if things were eternally frozen, then there was no time in which things could freeze. Consequently, then, since we have no time in which anything can ever be, we have no thing. Nothingness. Thus, at the absolute top floor of the universe, you would see everything (the future etc.) going by in an instant! But, there is more: since we have no time in which anything can ever be, we also have no time in which anything can ever decay. That is, from the light\u2019s point of view, there was always nothingness and ORDER. That is what free energy is, that is, an eternally existing ORDER. This order will always reset the clocks, so to speak, and make unavailable energy become available again. We came from nothingness! We are the froth of nothingness. What happens to the Relative Universe once it transitions into the Absolute Universe (i.e., the speed of light in vacuum)? For the thought-experiment to work, the light is of course in a vacuum. I believe the cuboctahedron is the Eternal Nothingness that has always existed because Fuller said: \u201cThe vector equilibrium is the zero point for happenings or nonhappenings: it is the empty theater and empty circus and empty universe ready to accommodate any act and any audience.\u201d\u2015Vector Equilibrium & Isotropic Vector Matrix The cuboctahedron can be scaled and, therefore, we can fit the recycling-process in our car or spaceship. This would not be an asymmetrical process, no more than the relative sizes of, say, a big Russian doll (cuboctahedron) and a small one would cause them to resurrect at different intervals. This is not an eternal universe in the static-sense, however, as all things must pass through the recycling-process eventually. [...] because its nonexistence would be a paradox = If we take away the content of the universe (relative motion), then we are left with the Absolute Universe. Ok. We removed motion. Let us remove motionlessness or the Absolute Universe. What is left? True nonexistence. No. What is left is a paradox: You are neither \u201cjust in motion\u201d (relative momentum) nor \u201cjust in motionlessness\u201d (absolute position). Which means that you are both at the same time, which is a paradox because now we can truly look at you (with an omnipotent eye) and measure your speed at the same time. But then you need an explanation for why you are \u201cjust there\u201d without rhyme or reason and why you are so bizarre-looking (absolute and relative at the same time). Or, you ARE no momentum and no position at the same time, that is, you have not moved (momentum) and you have not not moved (position), which is a paradox. Therefore, the absolute state must exist or else Nature would be paradoxical. To solve all the paradoxes, Nature is the Absolute state (position), and she can transition to the relative state (momentum) and back, but she cannot be \u201cboth at the same time\u201d or nonexistent. The Uncertainty Principle explains the First Cause of the Universe. However, Nature as a whole is Absolute and Relative at the same time, but that is different. That is, things of mass and no-mass can coexist. My point is, a particle cannot be absolute and relative at the same time. It has mass or it has no mass. The Absolute Universe can be \u201cjust there\u201d because the Absolute Universe knows no space-time. However, if you are \u201cjust there\u201d in the Relative Universe, that is, if the Relative Universe takes the role of the Absolute Universe, then we get the paradox: \u201cWhy is this thing \u201cjust here?\u201d Why isn\u2019t it \u201cover there?\u201d\u201d You cannot form this puzzle of the Absolute Universe because \u201chere\u201d and \u201cthere\u201d are the same \u201cspot,\u201d as it were. This \u201cspot\u201d in the Absolute Universe is the source from which all atoms sprang. In summa: The Uncertainty Principle truly explains WHY there is Existence rather than Nonexistence. Formlessness rules. Everything does truly flow. The motor behind free energy: By definition Reality is all alone, which means that, if it is moving, then it will keep moving forever and nothing can stop it because we have no agent that can influence it nor stop it. If Reality is the motionlessness and, if motionlessness is this fast speed, then Reality will forever be on the move. To where? To nowhere, because that is how fast the movement is. (This \u201cnowhere\u201d is a state of complete order because it is a room that is so small that no disorder can exist in it. It is forever ordered.) Moving on, the movement is like a point that just exists because its nonexistence (i.e., anti-motion) would be paradoxical. However, this point has great potential to birth universes because the point is fast and strong. In addition, if the cuboctahedron = Reality, then the motionlessness is this fast spin that does not seem to spin because of its speed. The universe, then, is literally a whirlpool (dual torus). In summa: Nature cannot die because no agent exists that can kill her. If this primal state of Reality is that of Order, then matter can be revived by that eternally existing order, and thus we have free energy eternally. In summa: Nothing can stop the resurrection process. The CTMU might also hint at free energy: From: https://www.quora.com/What-does-Chris-Langan-think-about-free-energy Joe Moyenne on Quora: \u201cIn the CTMU, it is written that in the reality of Logos, things are defined or contrasted by their complement. So it could be that positive mass and energy might also require a complement of negative mass-energy.\u201d (This is such a beautiful answer and shows that free energy is possible. I wonder if Langan himself sees it?) Cosmologists Prove Negative Mass Can Exist In Our Universe This is why we don\u2019t observe negative mass because it is tucked away in the Absolute Universe, which is the contraction-phase in the CTMU, I think. Conspansion = expansion and contraction of the universe. What if positive mass (consumes power) = expansion; and negative mass (generates power) = contraction? This way, the universe has been using dead matter to keep itself alive forever. A dragon feeding off its own tail or a Phoenix bird that resurrects (negative mass) from its ashes (positive mass). Finally, we look at the man himself, Nikola Tesla: \u201cTesla\u2019s intent was to condense the energy trapped between the earth and its upper atmosphere and to transform it into an electric current. He pictured the sun as an immense ball of electricity, positively charged with a potential of some 200 billion volts. The earth, on the other hand, is charged with negative electricity. The tremendous electrical force between these two bodies constituted, at least in part, what he called cosmic energy. It varied from night to day and from season to season but it is always present.\u201d From: https://www.nuenergy.org/nikola-tesla-radiant-energy-system/ My explanation of the Sun and Earth relationship: The cuboctahedron can come in any size. The sun is a cuboctahedron. The earth is a cuboctahedron. The atom is a cuboctahedron. The sun, which is a torus (i.e., a cuboctahedron), must have its charge go somewhere, so the earth may work as the negative charge; while the sun is the positive charge. Together, the earth and the sun = a giant torus. The energy flows out of the sun and into the earth, and then to the Absolute Universe where the mass is revived, and then it can flow out of the sun again via the Absolute Universe and make another round, ad infinitum. Of course, all negative charges work as a \u201chome\u201d for the positive charges. In other words, the positive charge is the flow of energy out of the torus, and the negative charge is the flow of energy into the torus\u2019s core/center. The toroidal core I believe to be the home of the Absolute Universe. This explains why positive and negative attract and why equal repel because the positive and the negative are one torus. Therefore, equal charges will repel as they seek their homes and not each other. If this is true, then your battery = free energy. So why does your battery run out? Because all negative charges in the universe = the home. Therefore, when energy flows from your battery to power whatever, the earth will suck up your battery because it is a much more powerful whirlpool/\u201chome.\u201d That is, the energy flow will rather go to the center of the earth than back into your battery. A free energy device would essentially be a clever way of directing the energy flow because, as Tesla said, the source is everywhere and in unlimited quantities. Unlimited because, I believe, there is a resurrection going on rather than the source being \u201cinfinite.\u201d True: If a single battery were all that existed, it would be immortal and never run out. The reason why a battery runs out is that, it does not really run out, it just becomes a part of a greater battery we call the Universe (i.e., the Relative Universe + the Absolute Universe). To the ones who say that Tesla didn\u2019t really believe in free energy, read this (below): Philadelphia Public Ledger November 2, 1933 Tesla \u2018Harnesses\u2019 Free Cosmic Energy \u201cInventor announces discovery to displace fuel in driving machinery. Calls Sun main source. A principle by which power for driving machinery of the world may be developed from the cosmic energy which operates the universe, has been discovered by Nikola Tesla, noted physicist and inventor of scientific devices, he announced today. This principle, which taps a source of power described as \u201ceverywhere present in unlimited quantities\u201d and which may be transmitted by wire or wireless from central plants to any part of the globe, will eliminate the need of coal, oil, gas or any other of the common fuels, he said. Dr. Tesla in a statement today at his hotel indicated the time was not far distant when the principle would be ready for practical commercial development. Asked whether the sudden introduction of his principle would upset the present economic system, Dr. Tesla replied, \u201cIt is badly upset already.\u201d He added that now as never before was the time ripe for the development of new resources. While in its present form, the theory calls for the development of energy in central plants requiring vast machinery. Dr. Tesla said he might be able to work out a plan for its use by individuals. The central source of cosmic energy for the earth is the Sun, Dr. Tesla said, but \u201cnight will not interrupt the flow of new power supply.\u201d\u201d \u201cClearly Tesla is not talking about an atomic reactor. He is directly converting ionized particles generated by radiant matter. It is not nuclear energy as we know it today. Tesla Radiant Energy is directly converted to electrical power! Tesla believed that the Sun generates highly charged particles and that radiant matter is a re-transmitter of energy, it is this transfer of energy that could be used for practical purposes.\u201d Tesla\u2019s Apprentice: This is from a great mind that can truly see: \u201cYou have said that you greatly respect the work of Nikola Tesla, and surely you have studied his inventions and his life. If so, then you might be aware that Nikola Tesla was planning to transmit power all over the world in a way that you would surely say is impossible. But you must know that Nikola Tesla was a very careful experimenter who tested every idea before employing it. What then is the answer to the implied dilemma? So, Nikola Tesla was just a wild man, right? A nut. While Michio Kaku and his 11 dimensions make wonderful sense. Or could you and others be wrong about what Nikola Tesla was doing? Could it even be the case that Tesla was using electromagnetic theory that included the very gauge transformations that physicists of this era do not include? Is that not possible, sir, and if not, why not? Therefore, if I may speak freely, I would say that while millions or even billions of people live in desperate poverty, and while millions of Americans lose their jobs because we don't have this kind of technology \u2014 you tell people that such technology is impossible, when it isn't.\u201d\u2014Robert W. Koontz, Ph.D. From: http://www.doctorkoontz.com/Scalar_Physics/Letters/Kaku/Open_Letter_to_Dr._Michio_Kaku.htm Below is from: http://www.doctorkoontz.com/Scalar_Physics/Energy/index.htm Dr. Thomas Henry Moray was able to generate 50,000 watts of power with a tabletop device that did not burn any kind of fuel. How did he do it? The device ran cool; it did not put off heat. How is that possible? Energy Conservation and Free Energy \"We can gain unlimited amounts of energy without violating the law of energy conservation.\" \u2014Robert Koontz (Bio) It sounds impossible, but it isn't. It is possible to obtain an unlimited amount of energy from devices which essentially only require that they be charged up with negative mass electrons and negative mass positrons. Any physicist should be able to convince himself of this in a matter of minutes. It really is simple: While ordinary positive mass electrons in a circuit consume power, negative mass electrons generate power. Why is that? For negative mass electrons and negative mass positrons, Newton's second law, F = ma becomes F = -ma. But acquiring negative mass electrons and negative mass electrons is not quite as simple as it sounds. They are exotic particles that many physicists may even doubt exist. But they do exist. I am convinced of this \u2014 for good reasons. The Law of Energy Conservation The law of energy conservation tells us that the total energy of a closed system is constant. Therefore, if such a system has an increase in positive energy, there must be an increase in negative energy. The total energy stays constant. When you drop an object in the earth's gravitational field, the object gains negative gravitational potential energy as it falls \u2014 with that increase in negative energy being balanced by an increase of positive energy of motion. But the object does not lose or gain total energy as it falls. It gains kinetic energy while it gains an equal amount of negative gravitational energy. How could we have free energy? If we gain positive energy, we must also generate negative energy in exactly the same amount. That will \"conserve energy,\" as physicists say. In application, in the field of \"free energy,\" that means generating negative energy photons and other negative energy particles while we get the positive energy we are seeking. What is the problem, then? The problem involves generating the negative energy particles. And I note that physicists do not generally recognize that negative energy particles exist, to include the existence of negative energy photons. Dr. Thomas Henry Moray was able to generate 50,000 watts of power with a tabletop device that did not burn any kind of fuel. How did he do it? The device ran cool; it did not put off heat. If we are to believe that energy is conserved, then we have to believe that as Dr. Moray generated the 50,000 positive watts of power his system also generated 50,000 watts of negative power that either cooled the apparatus or flew off harmlessly into space. There is no other way. Dr. Moray's devices ran cool because they were absorbing negative energy. Hundreds of people witnessed Dr. Moray's devices producing power, to include scores of scientists, engineers and politicians. Many signed affidavits. The patent office would not issue Dr. Moray a patent for his device, insisting that Dr. Moray had to explain where the energy was coming from. But this man did not know the source for the energy. He thought he was tuning into some sort of mysterious energy that filled the cosmos. When he contacted the government about the device, Dr. Moray was told by the government representatives that they did not want to interfere with private industry. He was on his own. Even though he was never to have his devices accepted by the public, at least on a widespread basis, Dr. Moray was producing energy, and he did it by charging up circuitry with negative mass electrons and negative mass positrons, I am convinced of this, and I am prepared to soon create a device similar to Dr. Moray's. Or at least that is what I hope to do. But this kind of research takes time and money, and I have already exhausted most of my life savings. I am thus looking for outside sources of revenue or investors. Bob Koontz Negative Mass Electrons, Negative Mass Positrons and Negative Energy Photons When Paul Dirac, the Nobel prize-winning physicist was developing the first form of relativistic quantum mechanics he found it necessary to introduce the concept of negative mass electrons. This subsequently led Dirac to develop the idea that a hole in a sea of negative mass electrons corresponded to a positron, otherwise known as an antielectron. Some years later the positron was observed and Dirac won the Nobel prize.   Subsequent to the above, there appears to have been no experimental search for these negative mass particles. Whether or not negative mass electrons and negative mass positrons exist is thus a question to which we do not yet have an answer. However, if these particles do exist, their unusual properties could be exploited to produce unlimited amounts of energy \u2014 as negative mass electrons and negative mass positrons, when employed in a circuit, produce energy rather than consume it. Newton's 2nd law F = ma becomes F = - ma and that explains why negative mass electrons and negative mass positrons produce energy rather than consume it. I believe that any good physicist should be able to see this quite quickly.  Also, when one solves Maxwell's equations for propagating electromagnetic photon energy, the solutions allow for negative energy photons as well as the ordinary positive energy photons. Negative energy photons would be given off by negative energy electrons and that would cause circuits to run cool. That is what is seen with the better free energy devices.   Regarding negative mass electrons and negative mass positrons, Maxwell's equations transform unchanged under energy and charge conjugation. This suggest the possible existence of the aforementioned particles. ",
