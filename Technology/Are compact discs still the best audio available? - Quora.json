Some people prefer the sound of vinyl records over CD; which is actually better is an audiophile war with strongly held opinions on both sides. In the digital realm, high resolution digital sounds better. It exists as digital downloads, and on physical media in the form of DVD-Audio, and Blu-Ray Audio discs. High resolution digital features higher sample rates and/or more bit depth than CD. There is also Super Audio CD (SACD), another format with excellent sound quality; its sample rate and bit depth cannot be directly compared to high resolution PCM because a different sampling method is used. None of those have ever achieved mass adoption. In the analog realm, reel to reel tape is probably the best sounding format. Like high resolution digital, it has always been a niche format. Whether reel to reel sounds better or worse than high resolution digital is another audiophile war. ",
