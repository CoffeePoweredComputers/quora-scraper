            "answer_text": "To stream your any gaming or casual video on YouTube effectively, there are some tips I will give you. First of all, if you are livestreaming a game(like PUBG), use a good screen recorder. Use OBS for PC and DU for phone. You can also use camera feature for showing your face. Use Nightbot, which is helpful for you livestreams. Nightbot helps to communicate with the viewers when you can\u2019t answer them. Use donation messege by which you can communicate with the ones who have given you donation or Super Chat. And most importantly, use Paytm on screen feature.
