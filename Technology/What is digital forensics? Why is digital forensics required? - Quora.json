            "answer_text": "Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that involves the collection, recovery, and investigation of data found on devices and accounts that store electronic data, often in connection with actual or potential litigation. Common devices that are the subject of digital forensic analysis include personal computers, laptops, tablets, smart phones, servers, email accounts, social media accounts, web-based storage accounts, wearable technology, and Internet connected devices, among others. The terms \u201cdigital forensics\u201d and \u201ccomputer forensics\u201d often are used interchangeably, but because experts routinely work with many electronic storage devices and accounts, the term \u201cdigital forensics\u201d more accurately captures the modern scope of expertise. Professional digital forensic experts typically employ verifiable electronic evidence collection procedures to assist in authenticating collected evidence. Forensic imaging is the process of creating exact, bit-for-bit verifiable copies of the contents of computer hard drives. For smart phones, the ability to make a bit-for-bit copy often is unavailable due to developer restrictions, and forensic imaging of such devices accordingly consists of verifiable collection of all supported extractable data. Digital forensic experts also often perform targeted forensic collections, so that the collection of specific folders or files can be validated forensically. Once data is forensically collected, digital forensics experts often perform investigations. Capabilities and circumstances vary, but common scenarios include analyzing device usage history, searching for relevant files, recovering deleted data, and examining file metadata. Such work typically is done using the forensic copies of data so that the original evidence is not substantively altered.

            "answer_text": "Digital evidence is the information that is converted into binary form, it is mainly associated with electronic crimes, like child pornography or credit card fraud, etc. They are found in digital devices such as mobile phones, a computer hard drive, or others. These pieces of evidence are now used to conduct almost all kinds of crimes, not just limited to e-crimes. For example, suspect\u2019s mobile phone files contain critical pieces of evidence like their intention, their relationships with other suspects, and whereabouts at the time, etc. ",
