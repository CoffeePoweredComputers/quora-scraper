            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts saying overnight charging does not affect phone\u2019s battery in any way. I don\u2019t know the technical stuff involved, but i can tell you some things from my experience. The first flagship phone i bought was samsung galaxy s5. I bought it at the release time. It was one of the high end smartphones at that time. So i played a lot of games in it. and i always kept it for overnight charging. after 5 or 6 months, my phone\u2019s battery started draining really badly. it lasted only half a day (it used to last morning to night normally). So i got the battery replaced and after that, i started charging to 100% and then stopped. i got good battery standby for like more than 2 years with it. My next phone was s7 edge. that too i never overcharged and even now im getting good battery standby in it. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing. Now a days almost all the phone comes with overcharge protection circuit. In simple words when the battery gets fully charged the protection circuit switches off the charging even if the charger is connected to mains thus protecting the battery from getting overcharged.
