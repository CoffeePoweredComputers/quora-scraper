            "answer_text": "As a student who have been living in SZ for 15 years, I witness the change of SZ and just want to say SZ is not perfect now, but it is doing. When I was six (maybe in 2001), I immigrated to Longhua (not the downtown of SZ, on the north of Futian), SZ with my mum since my father was working there. To be honest, I did not like this city at that time because the street was full of leaflets and packaging and many buildings were under construction, of course, there was not plaza at that moment so what we could buy was extremely limited. There were clays on the road as well, what a terrible thing was that when it was rain the road was yellow, mixed with water and clays and I could not put any pace on the road. In the rainy day, with the poor drain system, the water could submerge my knee and when I went back to my home from school my shots were definitely wetted. It was only a ten-minute-walk in normal day. The weather always was gray with poor air environment due to the construction of infrastructure. The condition did not change too much until 2011, and it was the milestone for SZ for the 26th World University Games was held in SZ. The government took many actions to promote the appearance such as repainting the buildings (but only repaint the buildings which were near the main street for government did not have abundant budget), building \u201cgreen road\u201d (for bicycle only) and encourage citizens to be the decent people (like do not throw the rubbish here and there, do not run the red light). And people was pleased to do that for they wanted to become the decent hosts to welcome foreigner players. Beside, government introduced policy to move away the heavily-polluted factories, and finally I could see the blue sky again. Now with the developed transport and many plazas, live becomes convenient and I enjoy living in SZ. The phenomenon streets were full of rubbish cannot be seen. And I also enjoy the blue sky and well planting everywhere. Compared with BJ, SH, HK and other international cities, SZ is a young city but it have done a lot of things and finish in a short time, just like a motivated young man. And it means a lot to me, when someone ask me \u201cwhere are you come from\u201d, I will appreciate to answer \u201cShenzhen\u201d. BTW, when you visit SZ during the period of Chinese New Year, you will see the opposite condition that there are few people and cars on the street because most of SZers (about 90 per cent even more) come from other cities and they go back to reunion with their families. Our family settle in SZ so we rarely go back to my hometown and I have a chance to enjoy the uncommonly quiet city. (This is the first time for me to answer, thank you for reading~) ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s pretty great. The quality of life in the urban districts of Shenzhen (Luohu, Futian, Nanshan) is very high. There are a lot of parks, public transportation is fast and efficient, and more recently, rental bike companies such as Ofo and Mobike have covered the streets with incredibly cheap (1 yuan per half hour, or around US$0.16) bicycles that can get you across the very few areas in which public transport is not as convenient. The city has a lot of public parks and squares where you can go at more or less any time of day and see some kind of activities going on. One of my favorite things to do in Shenzhen was, when coming back from a trip overseas, to get up very early due to jet lag and go for a walk around the park near my apartment at 5:00am and see older Chinese people doing their morning Tai Chi. It\u2019s a very dynamic city\u2014new buildings formerly were built at what is called \u201cShenzhen Speed\u201d, which is generally agreed to be 4 new floors every 9 days. The below building, the newly completed Ping An Finance Center, is now the second-tallest building in China and the tallest in Shenzhen (~600m)  The schools in Shenzhen are some of the best in China, and while the Chinese style of learning is not for everyone (too much emphasis on rote memorization\u2014I would not send my future kid/s to Chinese schools), those in Shenzhen are strong. In terms of lifestyle and cultural activities, Shenzhen has improved much in these areas over the past few years. There are now several very trendy parts of town where you can go and see live music, art festivals, or other cultural activities. There are many shopping malls, and while they all have more or less the same 40\u201350 stores, they are also by and large very modern and comfortable. What is more, the city is becoming increasingly diverse. Different districts have radically different feels to them, and as the \u201ccenter\u201d of Shenzhen has continued to migrate west, the different areas of the city have changed accordingly. Luohu, in the east of the city, for instance, was the center of Shenzhen in much of the 1980s and into the 1990s. It is now somewhat older and in some instances \u201cdirty\u201d, however it also has an odd charm, as the buildings maintain a sort of 1980s-1990s cheesy Chinese modernist architecture style. Nanshan, conversely, is the city\u2019s high-tech center, and as such, the architecture is quite\u2026\u201dspacey\u201d, for lack of a better term. Straddling these two districts is the governmental center of Futian, with its grandiose public squares and the city\u2019s beautiful phoenix-shaped city hall (below, credit: me)  The city is also home to several solid museums, including the Shenzhen Museum, which offers an excellent look at the city\u2019s recent history, as well as the history of the area back to ancient times and during the Opium Wars. Other museums include several devoted to specific artists or artistic styles. Shenzhen has an increasingly large number of good western restaurants, but in terms of value for money, it is still not as good as someplace like Shanghai, where competition has forced restaurants to have more reasonable prices. For instance, a very good burger at one of the few very good burger places in Shenzhen can easily run you RMB100+, or around US$15. In Shanghai, you could probably get a similar burger for ~20% less, however there are many places in Shanghai where you would also certainly pay more. Shenzhen has recently seen several craft beer pubs open, and the nightlife in general, while getting more expensive and somewhat less \u201cforeigner-friendly\u201d, remains quite good. The language barrier is, as far as I\u2019m concerned, not that big of an issue. While I ultimately did end up learning Chinese, the first several years of living in Shenzhen, I spoke basically none, and I never really had any major issues. Weather in Shenzhen is nice, depending on your perspective. The summers are very, very hot and humid, but the winters are mild (low temperatures in the 50s Fahrenheit in the evening). Shenzhen people tend to be somewhat better-educated and more open-minded than the average Chinese person, as well as younger. The city is one of migrants, so those who come there tend to be open-minded, young, and capable of entering the city\u2019s labor markets. Overall, I think life in Shenzhen is quite good, though my perspective is as a foreigner who spent much of my 20s living there. Over the past 5 years, the city has become increasingly difficult for lower-middle class people, as more and more lower-income areas that would have been home to these people (known as cheng zhong cun, or village within a city) have disappeared in favor of new highrises.  Image Source One point that I would absolutely disagree with that has been repeated here in other (admittedly older/outdated answers)\u2014Shenzhen is not a manufacturing city anymore. There is still quite a lot of manufacturing that goes on in the rural areas outside of Shenzhen, but the majority of the city\u2019s economy is now based on services, including China\u2019s largest tech company in Tencent, the world\u2019s largest drone company in DJI, and several other world-beating companies like Huawei, Ping An Insurance, MindRay, and so on. A few caveats that are definitely worth noting: real estate in Shenzhen is impossibly expensive (though still cheaper than Beijing/Shanghai/Hong Kong). Per square meter, apartments in/near the city center can easily exceed US$10,000. The cost of living continues to rise, and the pollution, while still better than most places in China, is not great to live with. The population density is still quite high, so major subway stations at rush hour are a nightmare. These are realities of life Moving forward, the future of Shenzhen is likely to see prices continue to rise, and for life to continue to be more difficult for people in the lower rungs of society. The Chinese government is trying hard to integrate Shenzhen and surrounding cities, including Guangzhou, Dongguan, Huizhou, Foshan, etc., into the \u201cBig Bay Area\u201d, by bringing their public transport infrastructure closer together and basically making one big megacity. In this case, we would presumably see most of the poorer people in Shenzhen pushed out to these outlying cities, while those who can still afford the increasingly expensive lifestyle remain. (Map of Big Bay Area below, taken from South China Morning Post)  Image Source Bottom line: I spent ages 23\u201328 living mostly in Shenzhen, and I really enjoyed it. The city is young, clean, convenient, and relatively cheap. It is constantly changing, and now whenever I go back, there is inevitably some skyscraper that was not there the last time I was. I highly recommend a visit. ",
