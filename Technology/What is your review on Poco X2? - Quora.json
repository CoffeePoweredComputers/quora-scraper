            "answer_text": "\u201cPoco X2 the smartphone to beat under 20k\u201d Display: This has an IPS display but it is the best display under 20k. The display has a refresh rate of 120hz that makes the user experience much more pleasing. It's much brighter than Redmi note 9 pro, Realme devices display. Poco X2 phone has 500nits display. Plus it has the biggest display out of all the phones under 20K(good for games and media consumption). Poco X2 is also the only phone to support HDR 10 under 20K after Redmi k20 . Realme 6 pro and Redmi note 9 pro don't support HDR 10 even though all 3 phones have IPS displays. Camera: Best camera phone under 20K without any doubt. It has a 64 MP Sony IMX686 sensor which you won't get in phone under 30K right now. The other phones, Redmi, Realme, even the 28k Realme x2pro have Samsung GM1 sensor and Sony sensor is much better than the samsung sensor in terms of details and dynamic range. Performance: This phone simply is a beast in terms of performance. CPU: The CPU handles every task very easily, you throw anything at the processor may it be video rendering or day to day usage handling 120 hz display . opening apps and games, network connectivity. GPU: It has default smooth ultra option. But, you can extend it to smooth extreme using the gfx tools. Now let me tell you about what smooth ultra and smooth extreme are actually giving in the phone. With smooth ultra, you get CONSTANT 39-40 fps even with 3-4 squads around, even at landing during hotdrops. It never drops. Yes, this phone has an inbuilt \"Game Turbo\" app which shows you the fps during the game. And even with screen recording on, smooth ultra NEVER freezes (no \"chipak rha hai\" issue.). Now coming to Smooth Extreme. Use gfx tools to make it to 60fps. After using gfx tools, this phone stays above 58 fps in all conditions. Comparing this to Redmi note 8 pro which provide Smooth Extreme by default in app, often drop to 40-45 fps in the game, this phone's adreno 618 never drops below 58 fps in any condition. Redmi note 8 pro drops to 45-50 fps A LOT, even with smooth extreme being available by default. Same with Realme 6 .They freeze a lot. Battery: It charges from 0 to 100 in 70 minutes. Battery is also large enough. One 30min PUBG game takes 10\u201312% of battery approx. So you can play PUBG for more than 4\u20134.5 hours continously. And still there'll be some battery left. Then it recharges back up to 40% in less than 20 minutes. Extra Features: It has Hi-Fi Dac (3.5 mm jack) support which can power extreme wired headphones . Fingerprint sensor is great. MIUI 11 has a built in screen recorder, built in night mode, Game Turbo app allows you to take calls and chat on WhatsApp while playing games. The Android 10 out of the box is good, Touch response is very good ,Gyroscope performance is better than other phones in this range, and a cool looking camera punch hole. Poco X2 supports Full HD playback in Netflix and Amzon Prime Video that makes it awesome for Content consumption. Overall, it's a great deal under 20K. I think if you're thinking to buy a gaming phone, go for it. Other phones might provide Smooth+Extreme out of the box, but they hang a lot. SD 730G is always more reliable and optimized than other chipsets and the Custom Rom development will be great for this device . Please upvote the answer so that others can also read this answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Poco X2 review Let us start with the design and build quality. To begin with, it is a huge smartphone witha 6.67 inch display. It has gorilla glass 5 at the front and back. So design wise, it is already a huge leapover the plastic back of the POCO F1. I was never too fond of the plastic back onthe F1. So big thumbs up to POCO for putting a glass back on the X2. It makes it feel so much more premium for its price. I have said that it is huge phone, but how huge exactly?. Here is a size comparison with the iPhone11 Pro Max which is biggest of all the iPhones. Apple launched last year. This should giveyou some idea of the scale. While this size means. We do get a large display and more room inside the device for a bigger battery. But I still think phones with 6 or 6.2 inch displays are the right size for most peoples hands. Poco X2 Camera review Coming to the cameras. Primary one gets the 64 megapixel SONY IMX686 sensor with F/1.8 aperture and a 26mm lens. Then there is a 8 megapixel sensor with a13mm ultra wide angle lens and F/2.2 aperture. Followed by a 2 megapixel sensor with F/2.4 aperture and a macro lens. And finally there is another 2 megapixel depthsensor with F/2.4 aperture. To put it in simple terms, Cameras on thePOCO X2 are the best on any smartphone under Rs.20,000. In most lighting conditions you will be really happy with the images that come out of this phone. If you like to take portrait shots, try switching to the Movie mode, and you will be blown away by the results. Now the macro camera is getting quite a bit of heat since last couple of weeks. Sure its just a 2 megapixel sensor, but whenyou think about it, it needs to capture a very tiny part of the scene, and as far asthe focus is set properly, it doesn\u2019t really matter how many details are in the remaining part go the image, because most of the times those parts are out of focus anyways. I definitely agree that having higher resolutionwould be better, but I don\u2019t think this kind of lens needs to have a multiple digitmegapixel count. You might not agree with me, and that is totally fine, because if you know what you are doing with it, even a 2 megapixel macro camera cantake amazing looking images. Although it gets 2 front facing cameras, andone of them has a 20 megapixel sensor, selfies from the POCO X2 are not the best. There are some other smartphones at a lowerprice, which do a better job than this. But it makes up for it by taking amazing videos. POCO X2 can take electronically stabilised 4K 30fps videos, and these videos look really good. ",
