Hyper text transport protocol, or http[1] starts with a request from the client - \u2018'please give me the hypertext document located at /index.htm\" to the server, and then the server responds with the document. Making this request involves transmitting data. [1] Which is what I assume you mean by \u201cthe internet\u201d. \u201cThe internet\u201d is of course the whole of the network, all the protocols and services that run on it, POP3 and IMAP and SMTP email, FTP, NNTP, DNS, and so on, but the world wide web is the bit that most people interact with and HTTP has mostly swallowed all the other protocols alive.
