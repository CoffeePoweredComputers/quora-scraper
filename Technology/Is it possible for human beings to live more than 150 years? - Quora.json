            "answer_text": "I would say 150 is not overly ambitious as a target and expect that the first person to reach that age could well be currently in their late 60s or 70s. We pretty much know what is needed and I would say we have a 60% chance in bringing aging under a decisive degree of medical control within not less than 10 years but not more than 25, and a 90% or better chance this century. We only need a few more breakthroughs such as CRISPR-cas9 (first used for gene editing in 2013), Stem Cell therapies such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which can now be created easily because in 2012, iPSCs were first made from renal epithelial cells in the urine where previously creation was more invasive, add in senescent cell clearance (another recent discovery) and it\u2019s clear we are well on our way. The key is defining what aging is because that is the reason that currently we can't live indefinitely and understanding it clarifies what we need to do so here is my definition - Aging is the progressive and inexorable accumulation of molecular and cellular damage which leads to loss of physical function increasing infirmity, elevated risk of chronic illness, and ultimately death -. Address those issues by repairing the damage and we are pretty much home and dry. Although I don't think we will find an actual CURE for aging in the foreseeable future there is a middle path that is likely to succeed based on our current and near future technology and at the bottom and throughout this posting I refer to those numbered links which provide further reading and illustrate the current rapid rate of progress and why I believe we will have aging under a decisive level of medical control within the timeframe I referred to above. The key to success is that we must work from where our knowledge stands currently, this is because although we understand the reasons why the body deteriorates with age, we do not have the requisite knowledge to intervene in a way that influences the actual ongoing metabolic processes. When I am asked \"how long before we can cure aging?\" I always suggest people keep in mind that we are already adding two months to life expectancy every year (or 5 hours per day) and this has been consistent for the last 30 years or so. If you then consider that many people including myself see a better than 50% chance of controlling aging within 25 years with a 20% chance of a very sudden and unexpected breakthrough which was unexpected such as CRISPR-Cas9 4 years ago (12) when we look at all the possibilities and the current progress the whole issue starts to look very promising. As far as the time span for an actual cure, I would hazard a guess that it is at least 100 years away. The alternative approach as I have touched on already is to aim at controlling aging and repairing the accumulated damage and this should be our primary goal because we understand how the damage is laid down even though we understand very little about actually slowing aging or influencing metabolism. This is the essence of Aubrey de Grey's SENS (1) theory regarding the engineering approach and it holds the best prospect of success in the first half of this century. Having said that two other well funded organizations are waging war on aging so when you factor those two into the equation things look very positive, the first company is Calico (2) which is an independent R&D biotech company established in 2013 by Google Inc. and Arthur D. Levinson and the other is Human Longevity Inc with $1.5 billion+ this is potentially a game changer (3) these two show the field is attracting serious funding and these will be followed by numerous others big and small so we are at the beginning of a serious push being made to tackle the problem which aging poses to everyone currently alive. Current breakthroughs in the area of telomere research relating to the lengthening of telomeres are interesting because the research is moving fast and clearly it is technically possible and highly probable it will translate into humans, the same thing applies to senolytic drugs (14) . The primary concern with the lengthening of telomeres used to lie in the theoretically elevated risk of cancer but this problem does not apply based on the current research which you can see on the Stanford University website (link 4 at the bottom) as a researcher into aging I consider this research and some additional supporting work which has taken place at Harvard indicates everything in this area is looking very positive. As far as the mechanism of delivery which has been developed so far the scientists at Stamford used modified messenger RNA to extend the telomeres so the whole process if it translates effectively into humans - and the evidence is suggesting it will - would be pretty straightforward especially when you consider the degree of extension which is 1000 nucleotides and the fact that the telomerase which lengthens the telomeres is only active in the body for 48 hours which means there is no significant risk of cancer due to the limited time during which proliferation of the cells could take place. Interestingly shortening of telomeres was until recently perceived by many as being a result of aging and not causal but the research at Stanford clearly repudiates this and suggests that Dr Dr Bill Andrews was correct all the way along. Dr Andrews website is at link (5) When we couple the research above with additional research (6) relating to a compound that is related to Rapamycin called Sirolimus and also Metformin it all tends to indicate that we are finally making significant progress in addressing the diseases of aging. If you now check out Professor George Church (7) who is a highly reputable professor of genetics at Harvard University and a recent article (8) it is clear the fight is on and it\u2019s going mainstream whereas 15 years ago when I first got involved in anti aging research people viewed controlling aging as an impossible dream but good news is now coming in with increasing frequency for example this recent research suggests Aubrey de Grey at SENS was right all along (9) Personally I am pretty confident that with SENS and other routes being explored such as the Telomere research above and removal of senescent cells show that we do not have to find a cure for aging itself, therefore, we bypass the problems that our lack of knowledge in the area of metabolism and the aging process creates because what Aubrey de Grey terms \u201cengineered negligible senescence\" can potentially extend life indefinitely while not actually curing the underlying aging process which is allowed to continue as normal. The key lies in the fact that we have a sufficient understanding of genetic and biochemical processes that lead to metabolic damage that we can already envision what is termed the engineering approach. Aubrey frequently uses the question \"how long will a house last?\" Of course, the answer is that, if you look after it, it can last forever! The key here is that Aubrey proposes that we find a method to undo the damage that has accumulated over the first 50 or 60 years of a person\u2019s life. Repairing the damage means we do not need to understand all the processes of aging, only that we need to know enough to extend healthy lifespan by let us say 30 years. So how would it work in practice? As far as how it would actually work in practice it\u2019s quite easy to follow and what this means in essence is this, let\u2019s say you are 60 years old at the time of the first intervention and that this early and fundamentally imperfect treatment repairs 75% of the accumulated damage and winds the clock back by 25 years. Then 10 years later you would reach the chronological age of 70 but would be biologically only 45 years old and look and feel like a 45 year old. We now come to the vital key to the whole theory which is this, let's say 20 years after the first treatment, when you are chronologically 80 but biologically 55 years old, clearly both your doctor and yourself will realize that the damage that was not repaired in the first treatment combined with the further damage accumulated over the 20 years since is again posing a health risk. At this point it is time for another intervention. It is now that the progress in medicine comes into play because, by the time 20 years has gone by, anti-aging medicine will have moved on significantly and, whilst the first treatment bought you an extra 20 or 30 years by repairing a fair amount of the damage accumulated over your first 60 years, it did not repair it all. 20 years later medical progress will mean that the latest treatment will not only repair all of the damage corrected by the first intervention but also some of the damage that was not able to be repaired 20 years earlier so in essence you are now chronologically 80 (but biologically in your 50s). This means that, whilst you will have aged 20 years, chronologically you will be biologically younger after the second intervention than you were after the first. This is the essence of Aubrey de Grey's theory and pretty much any other theory based on rejuvenation and damage repair, essentially, it's a short cut to radical life extension. It is not a cure but it acknowledges that it does not need to be because it simply buys time and leads to a situation where regular interventions at say 15/20 year intervals with increasing effective treatments could extend life virtually indefinitely. So at this stage you might well be asking will it happen? My opinion is that we are well on the way in a number of areas such as gene therapy, stem cell therapies, tissue engineering and numerous other types regenerative medicine such as work with Telomeres, senolytic cells etc. Progress depends on funding although a number of factors will drive things forward and interest is increasing among both Scientists and the general population as well as wealthy philanthropists. The greatest driving force of all is that the baby boomers are aging and this will place increasing demands on healthcare systems. Keep in mind that the average person costs more in medical expenditure in the last year of their life than all the other years put together. Also, the number of workers is declining in most developed countries which means that we need to keep the existing population working and productive as long as possible. These are just two reasons but jointly they pose a serious economic problem to many governments worldwide. So what time-frame do I put on it? I made a projection some time back and, based on current research, I feel we will be pretty much able to treat and manage aging within 10/25 years given sufficient motivation, appropriate research and robust funding which is starting to flow with Google Calico and PayPal founder Peter Thiel on board with SENS plus other wealthy individuals who are waking up to the fact this is something which is possible and no longer in the realms of SciFi. Many of the therapies are progressing quite well already such as stem cell therapies, gene therapies, senescent cell clearance and tissue engineering but without a comprehensive intervention targeting all of the types of damage that arise due to aging the treatments individually will most likely just allow a person to grind on for 5 or 6 years. Of course there are other routes other than engineering approaches such as SENS and I think even Aubrey de Grey knows SENS is only a means to to get a foot on the ladder but clearly once SENS strategies are perfected they will certainly save millions of lives and prevent a great deal of suffering. As I see it there are five technologies which will ultimately lead to radical life extension during the course of this century, these are advanced Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Advanced Robotics, Genetics and mind uploading / whole brain emulation, or the route outlined below which I accept is an extreme - but in all probability not impossible - route to life extension. This option is to clone a person\u2019s body at say 55/60 years of age and then some years later transfer their existing brain into the new cloned body. Clearly this is closer than many people realise because scientists and doctors are already looking at the potential of a whole body transplant see (10) and this is a few steps further on. Of course ultimately memory upload to a new brain or non biological brain would be a better option but this is probably further in the future than our being able to transplant an existing brain into a cloned body. One factor a lot of people raise with me regarding the brain being transferred to a new cloned body is relating to the deterioration of the brain but that might not be as big an issue as it seems because some years ago researchers at Stanford University used parabiosis which involved linking the blood supplies of an old and young mouse to study the impact on blood stem cells and muscle cells to see if the old mouse was rejuvenated. What the researchers found was that the muscle stem cells in the old mouse were rejuvenated exactly as the researchers had already foreseen as a potential outcome. Stanford researchers and others (11) have determined that old-young parabiosis will improve the health of an aging mouse\u2019s organs such as liver, spinal cord, and brain and this could have a major impact if you transplant an old brain into a new body. The only major issue in my view would be making the connections of the nerves, blood vessels and spinal cord but in the case of cloning from the donor of the brain there would be one huge benefit which is no rejection issues because the tissue is generated from the original body and therefore there would be no requirement for immunosuppressant drugs. It goes without saying the ethical issues of cloning a body to be the host of the person\u2019s brain could be an issue but in my opinion the first stage as mentioned above which is a whole body transplant is something we can and will at some point attempt and in all probability within the next 5 years. Of course a whole body transplant with a donor body will require immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of the recipient\u2019s life but this first step will be proof of concept and from then on this path might prove very attractive in a wide variety of situations not just related to aging. The effect all of the technologies above will have on life extension differs greatly but my guess is that there are three potential approaches which are likely to come to fruition first, one is SENS which is biotechnology the second is nanotechnology which will enable us to repair the body at a cellular and molecular level though this will probably come after SENS - though it's possible that it could arrive in the late 2030\u2019s or early 2040\u2019s - but because this one is more difficult to predict I tend to be very much of the mind that SENS is much more predictable than the second and third routes simply because our knowledge of biotechnology is currently significantly greater than nanotechnology. The third route which I consider to be a likely success is preservation of the existing brain to be followed when the technology is developed with whole mind uploading which is a combination of robust artificial intelligence enabling the modelling of the biological brain to be achieved combined with whole brain emulation. Whole brain emulation is where the brain is uploaded to a digital medium and increasingly enhanced and replaced with non biological components until it reaches a stage where the non biological components can model the biological part so accurately the original brains loss would be irrelevant from a functional perspective. This is a technology which is hard to put an exact time-frame on though we may reach this point much earlier than expected whilst on the other hand it has the potential to encounter significant difficulties which are unforeseeable from where we stand at the moment but it's quite possible that nanotechnology will speed up the development of whole brain emulation. Personally I feel the outcome long term for life extension will ultimately be a combination of the five routes outlined above, the crucial point is that each of these technologies individually has the potential to get us to where we need to go. What this means is that for the development of radical life extension to fail all of these technologies must also fail and that simply won\u2019t happen so my guess is we will reach the stage of having a decisive level of control over the aging process within 20/25 years although maybe not all of the technologies I describe would be sufficiently developed at that point the road ahead for those that aren't will already be very clear . We must also factor in that there is also a possibility that we could find a faster route and that treatments to lengthen telomeres might have a greater benefit than assumed and current research as mentioned above confirms that it does. Clearly lengthening the telomeres through temporary activation of telomerase is massively beneficial now it looks like increased risk of cancer is no longer a major factor. The implications for tissue engineering are interesting too. It\u2019s was thought until recently by some that the shortening of Telomeres was a consequence of aging and not a cause but all evidence tends to indicate otherwise based on ongoing research as mentioned above. Nevertheless the implications of combined stem cell and lengthened telomeres could mean we can greatly improved our abilities regarding biomedical repairs. If you are unsure whether this is a war worth fighting consider this. When the war on aging is won (and it's a case of when not if) 100,000 people per day would be saved! This is because, of the 160,000 people who die each day, two thirds die from aging. This is a staggering figure and what this means is that, of nearly 60 million people who die each year, 40 million die from age related issues. I believe we will achieve significant positive results within the next decade in research on mice and that the knowledge acquired will then be transferred to humans and, hopefully, end the horrific descent into senility and old age of the millions of people who linger in retirement homes and suffer the indignities that come with the passing years. Conquering aging is pretty much the same as beating any other disease, albeit aging is a complex issue involving many different processes but that does not mean that it is not a realistic goal to render it a chronic albeit manageable condition within a 10/25 year timeframe. http://www.sens.org/http://www.calicolabs.com/http://www.humanlongevity.com/http://www.nature.com/news/anti-ageing-pill-pushed-as-bona-fide-drug-1.17769http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/http://roguehealthandfitness.com/rapamycin-anti-aging-medicine-an-interview-with-alan-s-green-m-d/https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2017/02/george-church-indicates-reversal-of.htmlhttps://thewinnower.com/papers/38-parabiosis-in-aging-research-enigmatic-youth-factor-versus-ordinary-stem-cell-transfusion-effect#_ENREF_7http://www.lifeextension.com/Magazine/2016/7/Age-Reversal-Research-at-Harvard-Medical-School/Page-01http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/molecule-kills-elderly-cells-reduces-signs-aging-micehttps://thewinnower.com/papers/38-parabiosis-in-aging-research-enigmatic-youth-factor-versus-ordinary-stem-cell-transfusion-effect#_ENREF_7https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2016/06/first-phase-1-human-aging-reversal.htmlhttp://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30246-5http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/04/health/anti-aging-senolytic-drugs-clinical-trials-study/index.htmlhttps://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/shedding-old-cells-rejuvenates-the-brittle-bones-of-ageing-mice.

            "answer_text": "I think that a far more RELEVANT question is one that would be only slightly changed from the one being asked, and that would be: WILL IT EVER BE possible for human beings to live more than 150 years? To me, gathering together all of the knowledge that I have amassed in my mere 57 years on planet Earth, I would have to guess that the correct answer is: PROBABLY. WHY?\u2026.. Well, because we are humans, capable of doing (and figuring out how to do) extraordinary things, indeed. And FOREVER IS A LONG TIME. Combine these two facts, and you have a recipe for figuring out and implementing much in the way of doing whatever we want to do\u2014including terraforming planets, possible space travel outside of our solar system (and by extension, possible colonization of other inhabitable worlds), and technological and scientific advancements which will one day have us pushing the boundaries of what we now consider to be \u201cimpossible\u201d. Extending human life span by a mere few decades beyond that which current medical science believes to be the \u201cabsolute limits\u201d is nothing more than a barrier that is destined to fall, just like so many other \u201cimpossible\u201d barriers have been breached due to human drive, determination, and ingenuity throughout history. All I need to do is look around, and look at what has manifested in our human realm just in the last couple of centuries, and I don\u2019t need to dwell on it any further, or ponder things too much beyond that. I know what makes sense to me\u2026.. It\u2019s all coming down the pike. It\u2019s only a matter of TIME. It\u2019s not a question of IF, but WHEN we will achieve (a great many things, some of which most of us haven\u2019t even begun to dream of yet.) Extending human life span by a few decades beyond that which is now the accepted outer limitation? Child\u2019s play\u2026\u2026. We can and we will be able to do far more complex and difficult things than that\u2026 At least, I think that\u2019s how scientists will view it AFTER it\u2019s all been implemented\u2026. ",
