            "answer_text": "Even the best technology for extracting the chemical energy stored in coal by biological process long ago are not clean enough. Remember what coal is - the accumulated and compressed remains of plants and animals that were deposited in a chemically reducing environment. The bulk of coal is Carbon, mostly in the form of graphite, but there is still a lot of the other elements and compounds that were part of the plants and animals. Even if all of that stuff is somehow captured and kept out of the environment, there is no point in using coal if we have to capture and contain the Carbon Dioxide that is the inevitable waste product. Think about it. Where did all of that Carbon in coal come from? It was removed from the atmosphere as CO2 was used in photosynthesis to capture some of the energy coming from the Sun. That is the source of the chemical energy that we can get from coal. We have been putting CO2 back into the atmosphere at a prodigious rate long enough to raise the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to levels not seen for at least half a million years. Enough to have a measurable effect on the pH of the oceans. The only clean coal is coal that is left in the ground. The only source of clean energy is one that can replace coal and other fossil fuels. Nuclear is the only source of energy available today that can be expanded enough to do that. Nuclear release energy that was stored away in nuclear bonds by stellar explosions before our solar system was even formed. It does not divert energy from any natural cycle that sustains life or change the chemical balances in the ecosphere. If you want to live - come with me and go nuclear. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. The coal mining industry\u2019s part in \u2018clean coal\u2019 is focusing on exploiting low-sulphur coal reserves instead of brown coal reserves. Reducing the sulphur oxides emissions of coal generation was key in the 1970s and 1980s to reducing acid rain. The coal generation industry is using techniques which they refer to as \u2018clean coal\u2019 techniques which reduce a host of problems with burning coal somewhat, but insufficiently to be called clean. More like \u2018less horrendously filthy coal\u2019. These techniques include but are not limited to: Particulate traps as coal generation remains one of the largest sources of particulate air pollution in the world with or without mitigations.Sulphur scrubbing as low-sulphur coal is still much higher than anyone would reasonably want.High-heat pulverized coal generation which consumes more of the coal in burning, leaving fewer over all emissions.Carbon-capture and sequestration at source, as coal generation remains the single largest generator of greenhouse gases in the world. Industry analysts typically aim only for 30% capture of CO2 because it\u2019s a pretty flawed technology.However, these techniques and technologies are mostly only used in developed countries and then only as much as the industry is actually forced to use them by aggressive enforcement of regulations with real teeth. The only \u2018clean coal\u2019 is coal left covered in rock and dirt where it formed. That\u2019s part of the reason that the industry is in serious trouble with bankruptcies littering the landscape. The other part of course is that renewables and gas generation are now cheaper to build and operate even in developing countries.  Like my content? Help it spread via Patreon.
