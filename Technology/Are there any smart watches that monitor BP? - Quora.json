            "answer_text": "Not reliably can they monitor blood pressure on the wrist. They can monitor heart rate but not pressure. The blood pressure needs compression pressure to be applied to take a reading at what pressure the blood is pumping on both systolic and diastolic readings. At present there is not a smartwatch I have seen or read about that has this possibility. Maybe at some point we can have a miniature air pump or something that can give the proper pressure but again you wear the watch on the wrist. That isn't a good place to get a good reading. That is why you take it on your arm, bigger veins and better readings. A heart rate reading can be taken at the wrist as you are just taking the rate at which blood is pumping, not the pressure. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A: There do exist blood pressure measurement devices that do it at the wrist. However, they need a cuff mechanism that can expand and restrict blood flow. Such a mechanism would be way too clumsy for a device you could legitimately call a watch. Some smartwatches do have sensors that can measure pulse rate and blood-oxygen levels. ",
