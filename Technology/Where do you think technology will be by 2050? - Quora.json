            "answer_text": "This February my wife was diagnosed and given six months to live. When I heard the doctor tell her \u201csix months\u201d, it felt like I was going to die and my whole world was going to collapse. I met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.  Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year. Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away \u2014 same as my dad. Jess and I didn't hunt with them \u2014 we hung out by the lake. The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since. But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do \u2014 I'm scared and lost. Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models. These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological. Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download. \u201cOh my God Timmy, what's the catch?\u201d \u201cThe price, Leon.\u201d When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.  Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say \u201ctwenty\u201d, but I did it \u2014 I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy \u2014 especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it. We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world. One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.  Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,  she,  was.  The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her. Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.  I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T. Machines like this don't have rights \u2014 even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower \u2014 so, as I said, I.T. is my possession. The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.  Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love \u2014 with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.  Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time \u2014 I lied to her. I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes. I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.  \u201cHello\u2026. Smile\u2026\u201d  Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing \u2014 I was so happy.  We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk. I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.  I.T. was becoming aware.  At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.  I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, \u201cWhere do I come from?\u201d \u201cYou come from Heaven. You are my angel.\u201d That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.  When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do. Jess passed away right then. It was finally over. I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave. After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness. After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, \u201cIs it you, Jess?\u201d She smiled and said, \u201cIt is, silly \u2014 now kiss me.\u201d  Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.  My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.  Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.  After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back \u2014 the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess. I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.  I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).  I turned them on.  I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.  The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.  I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last \u2014 she is beside me. I died, on that very night as a happy man.  One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.  They gently cut the box open.  And turned me on.  You ask where technology will be in 2050? We will be everywhere.  Leon  Special thanks: Cameron \u2014 Dear friend. Thank you so much for all your help with bringing this idea to life. You are awesome. I'm proud to call you friend.    Kinsalynn \u2014 My sister and friend. Your help with makeup and photography was an absolute godsend \u2014 thank you so much. I love and appreciate you. P.S. you took over 300 pictures in an eight hour span. Thank you from the bottom of my heart:)    Brooke \u2014 Even with a bullet hole in the head, you are deliciously gorgeous. You spent eight hours modeling for my Quora answer today and never once did you fail to impress or inspire me. I am honored to be friends with you.    Jess \u2014 The love of my life. I'm not sure I can even put into words how appreciative I am of you. You have seen me through the dark and help me shine brighter than I ever thought possible. Thank you for everything \u2014 including sticking your tongue in Cameron's ear.   ",

            "answer_text": " Well, to start with it's going to be BEYOND-IMAGINATION. Technology as a whole impacts a very large portion of our everyday life. We\u2019ve evolved so much technologically in such a short span of time that sometimes it already feels like we\u2019ve been living in the future. From sensors fitted into your Wristband that can measure your Heart Beat, how many calories you\u2019ve burned today, how much have you walked today, etc. to landing on Mars. I think we\u2019ve done it all. But, this is just 10-12% of a world where everything will be Automated and will run on Artificial Intelligence. As we all know there are always Positive and Negative impacts of anything. Let\u2019s start with the positive side first. #1 Autonomous Driving Vehicles An Autonomous Vehicle is one that can guide itself without human interaction. This kind of vehicle has become a concrete reality in recent years and may pave the way for future systems where computers are taking over the art of driving. Going by the current trends in the Automobile Industry, the Future of Driving is only Autonomous. Mobility will transform to an extent that can\u2019t be put into words. Car Manufacturers like Tesla has already been in the game for a very long time now, boasting their Flagship Auto-Pilot feature, Lane Change Alert features, and such next-gen Gadgetry.  Source: Google But, big German companies like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, BMW Group, etc. have also been developing its own line of Autonomous Driving vehicles for quite a while now.  Source: Google Porsche has also put more than $1 Billion to develop its first Electric vehicle, the Porsche Taycan which has already received more than 32,000 applications which have prompted the automaker to add 500 more jobs at its headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany.  Source: Forbes World sales of Electric vehicles are estimated to reach about 26,366,667 units till 2050. #2 TV\u2019s will disappear I believe Television will disappear from our lives. Mobile Devices have already taken over the Media Streaming Industry. With companies like Netflix, Hulu, Hotstar, Amazon Prime emphasizing more on OTT media services, even smart TVs will be a thing of the past in a few coming years. Everything will be put in your Pocket.  Source: Unsplash Netflix already leads the OTT Market with an active user base of approx. 140 Million people. They used to sell DVDs 20 years back. Crazy right? Wish to read more such interesting statistics? Check this blog. #3 Internet of Things (IoT) The number of Internet-connected devices will reach 237,500,000,000 globally and the average number of connected devices per person will be 25 approximately. Internet of Things (IoT) is growing fast. Billions of smart objects, and soon hundreds of billions, will connect to the web over the coming decades each constantly sending bits of data into the cloud. Here\u2019s a very recent example, Samsung had launched their IoT enabled Washing Machines last year in January of 2018.  Source: Samsung Newsroom But, why would you need a washing machine to be so high-tech when all you need is to get your clothes clean? You may wonder what are the benefits of such a Machine? Well, you can check for errors and troubleshoot them with just a touch on your smartphone. You can also instantly start or pause it and monitor cycle selections, remaining time and finishing alerts. Pretty cool right? #4 Autonomous Passenger Drones We talked about Autonomous driving in the beginning but do you remember those flying cars in \u201cThe Flintstones\u201d?  Source: IMDB Well, the future will look quite similar.  Source: Houston Chronicle Uber Air, the on-demand Helicopter service soon will be a thing of the present. It was announced in June of this year. These flying taxis will feature sleek and simple design in interiors and super futuristic design at the outside. They\u2019re expected to test in Dubai in 2020, followed by in Los Angeles and Texas in 2023, various steps have been taken to foreshadow the continual progress in this field.  Source: Google The UberAir pilot program will offer cost-effective ride options unrelated to its luxury-focused UberCopter that was launched this July. #5 Drones will make Deliveries Waiting for a delivery boy will become a history. Soon, drones will knock at our doors and deliver the parcels. Isn\u2019t it cool? And guess what, various companies have already been testing this, with Amazon and UPS to be on the top of the list.  Source: The Sun Soon, we\u2019ll be getting our Groceries in just 30 minutes delivered to our Doorstep. Amazing! #6 Virtual Reality will replace School Books You would be able to teach lessons and take the kids to a completely different environment. Basically, one will be able to explain things more clearly as compared to traditional teaching.  Source: Unsplash Apps like Google\u2019s Expedition have already been around for almost a year now. It lets students take trips in VR to places like the Eiffel Tower and such. #7 3D printed houses Yes, You read it right! We\u2019ll be able to 3D print a full house in the near future. A company from Beijing has already printed a two-story villa and they say it\u2019s durable enough to withstand an earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale.  Source: Inhabitat #8 A Matrix-like world could be possible With current advancements in Nanotechnology, it will be possible to plug our brains into computers and live in a simulated world.  Source: Hackernoon The concept is a bit like what Tesla CEO Elon Musk outlined when he talked about Neural Lace. It's a concept that Nanotechnologists have been working on. Neural lace is a wireless brain-computer system that would add a digital layer of intelligence to our brain.  Now, let's talk about some concerning aspects of Technology. #1 Data will be the new Oil In an article published by The Economist in 2017, it was told that the world\u2019s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but Data.  Source: Unsplash The Big 5 namely, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft have always been in the limelight regarding how they process your data. They are the five most valuable listed firms in the world. Amazon alone captures half of all dollars spent online in America. Google and Facebook accounted for almost all the revenue growth in digital advertising in America last year.  Source: Unsplash Ever wondered when you\u2019re talking about something with your friend and suddenly see an AD about the same thing in your Facebook feed? It\u2019s no coincidence. All of the data you upload over the internet is saved, studied, tracked and sold if needed. If you\u2019re someone who thinks all of your data is safe over the internet, sorry my friend you\u2019re late. Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. know exactly who you are, your personality traits, your very personal details, what kind of content you regularly access on the internet without your knowledge. This is just the beginning though, brace yourself for a future driven by Data. #2 Coffee will become a Luxury Yes. Your favorite drink, Coffee will become a Luxury that only a few will be able to afford. This is due to the adverse Climate change and lack of Sustainable Farming Land for growing Coffee Beans, as most of the land will be used to build some greater technologies and establishment of Industries. Maybe now is the right time to grow your own little farm for Coffee?  Source: Unsplash #3 Air Pollution As the world gets hotter and more crowded, technology will continue to pump out dirty emissions. Though there will be systems to solve these problems but it's hard to escape, no matter how rich an area you\u2019ll live in.  Source: Unsplash Microscopic pollutants in the air can slip past our body\u2019s defenses, penetrating deep into our respiratory and circulatory system, damaging our lungs, heart, and brain. Around 60 lakh people will die per year from complications with Air Pollution. So, THIS IS IT. I hope you had a good time reading my Answer!
