            "answer_text": "First you need a smart TV. A TV with no HDMI is probably not smart. If the TV has an Ethernet port and you can see it from any Windows machine as a DLNA device, you may still be able to mirror your phone on it. Be clear that Mirroring or Casting to the TV is a network function. The phone and the TV are both talking to the router and it is there that the magic occurs. The older your TV is, the less likely it is you will be able to \u201ccast\u201d to it. The web is awash with tutorials about this. Read some of them. ",

            "answer_text": "If you're using an iPhone, try getting an Apple TV. Otherwise, get a Chromecast for Android. Chromecast works with Apple products as well, but you can't stream your screen from an iDevice to a Chromecast. If you don't need to stream your screen, get a Chromecast, they're cheaper and smaller. Plus, no remote to lose. Some Smart TVs (with Wi-Fi) actually support casting directly without a set-top box, examples include Samsung Smart TVs with allcast. ",
