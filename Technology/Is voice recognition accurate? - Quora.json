            "answer_text": "Is voice recognition accurate? Okay, I\u2019ll bite. Here is my considered answer \u2014 it depends. As a user of Dragon NaturallySpeaking and Dragon Professional individual for over 10 years, I feel somewhat qualified to answer your question. Incidentally, I will do so using DPI 15.3 and Windows 10 on a desktop computer that has 8 gigabytes of RAM coupled with a SpeechWare 3-in-1 TableMike, which has a built-in soundcard; and I will not correct any misrecognitions that occur as I speak. I will not touch the keyboard as I dictate. I will edit the text for clarity only, and I will do so by voice. Now, why do I say, \u201cIt depends\u201d? Note that I listed the operating system, computer memory, speech recognition software, and microphone I am using. All of those are important, although the operating system is perhaps less important than the other two, since Nuance also produces speech recognition software for Apple\u2019s desktop and laptop computers. I will not address speech recognition on mobile devices for two basic reasons. First of all, the microphones built into those devices are not well suited to speech recognition, meaning misrecognitions are common. Secondly, the speech recognition software accessed through mobile devices is located \u201cin the cloud.\u201d It cannot be customized. What do I mean by \u201ccustomized\u201d? Users can\u2019t train the software, and vocabulary, or write custom macros to control the computer \u2014 all of which can be done with the professional Dragon software. Reading over what I have written, I see one misrecognition. In the previous paragraph, I dictated \u201cadd vocabulary,\u201d not \u201cand vocabulary.\u201d If I had typed this answer instead of dictating it, it would have taken me twice as long, and I would have made several typos. So to answer your question\u2026 yes, voice recognition software is accurate, provided you do it on a desktop or laptop computer that has been properly set up for it. ",
