            "answer_text": "HA! I see this all the time.  I stop talking and when they hear the silence and look up from their pocket G-d, I politely tell them.  Oh I'll wait until you're finished or you can catch me later when you're not so busy.  They usually put the stupid phone down. If they don't, I just wave at them and mouth..\"Later when you have time\" and Walk away.  I find it rude, in fact if I'm in a meeting. I take out my phone and either 1. Turn it off and put it in my pocket so that I can give my 100% attention to my meeting and the PEOPLE IN IT . or  2. If my kids are not at home or something along that line where you actually DO have to be available. I say: \"I'm expecting a call on a personal matter, so sorry\" \"or waiting for a call from my kids nurse\" or whatever it is if its important enough to be waiting on it and then I only check it if it vibrates.  WHEN IT DOES, I say \"Excuse me please. Check the phone, and then get up and leave the table for the conversation if it the call I'm waiting for.  If not, I just apologize and continue the meeting.   If it doesn't vibrate I don't \"double check it\" , I'm paying attention to the people I'm meeting.  On one hand it is mere manners, I'm meeting with business people who value their time and I VALUE their time. It's just respect.  Secondly, I'm not so ego driven. The world will go on spinning if I don't spring back onto the phone within seconds of someone calling me.  ",

Another idea is to start throwing random comments at them, sometimes ending with a questioning uplift to your voice, just to see if they'll make themselves look stupid by agreeing with whatever absurdity you just said.
