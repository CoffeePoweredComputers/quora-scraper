            "answer_text": "Many VoIP providers offer services which are well adapted to poor network conditions. There are technicals details which are mostly managed by adding an extra software to reduce the bandwidth consumption thereby making the VoIP Calls possible even in poor network. To get a positive experience of VoIP even in an unstable network, select your service provider carefully. The quality of service matters a lot when the network is not stable. Providers who use Mobile Dialers and Softswitch without bandwidth consumption reduction software, often end up with quality complaints. Therefore select your VoIP Service Provider carefully and enjoy your VoIP Calls. ",
