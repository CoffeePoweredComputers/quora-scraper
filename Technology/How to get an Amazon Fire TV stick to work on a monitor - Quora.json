            "answer_text": "Amazon Fire TV uses HDMI, most PC monitors today don't actually have an HDMI port (only TVs mostly do), so you'd might to get an adapter to connect to your PC monitor through DisplayPort (newest standard), DVI, VGA etc... or use some sort of converter box or cable with an HDMI port and audio ports. HOWEVER, the problem is the PC monitor probably most likely DOES NOT have built in speakers or an audio jack port for external speakers (they assume you're just going to use the audio port on your PC computer). So in that case, you'll probably need to research and find a converter that will accept HDMI but also have some sort of audio jack so you can plug it into your PC desktop speakers or other speakers to listen to the audio. There are tons of converters and converter boxes for things like this, just look online. But IF your PC monitor DOES have an HDMI port, then I'm not sure why you're asking me this question.. you can simply plug it in\u2026 but like I mentioned, you'll just have to figure out how you'll get the audio to play since most monitors have NO speakers on them, and some also have NO audio port. So that's why I mentioned getting adapters and converters. Yes, SOME monitors do have built in speakers and a 3.5mm output audio jack\u2026 but I haven't seen that many and most actually don't have them at all. Usually, if it does have built in speakers, the speakers are absolutely terrible and sound bad. So really, it's not that convenient to plug in the Fire TV stick to the monitor, but you can make it work with adapters and converters. I used to have an over-the-air antenna TV tuner box that connects to my monitor\u2026 I was able to watch antenna TV on my PC monitor (and it looked very good by the way).. the TV tuner box had all kinds of ports and connections so I could plug it into my PC monitor and get the audio to play on my external PC speakers.

            "answer_text": "A monitor? As in no monitor in particular? That\u2019s hard to say There are a wide variety of monitors on the market, with a plethora of options, resolutions, aspect ratios, features, ports and configurations Something that may work great on one monitor may not work at all on another, one may have the exact port you need while another may need to go through a series of dongles just for it to be slightly possible to connect, one may support audio while another doesn\u2019t, one may have an LCD panel while another may have an OLED panel, one may support HDCP while another doesn\u2019t, etc. This can go down to the specific model of monitor, you can have say an LG monitor with 2 DisplayPorts, 2 ThunderBolt 3/USB-C ports, 1 DVI port, 1 VGA port and no HDMI ports, right next to another LG monitor that has 2 HDMI ports, no VGA ports, 1 DVI port, no DisplayPorts and no ThunderBolt ports The best you can do is just try it, if it works, it works, if it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t If it doesn\u2019t work, there may not be a way to get it to work with that particular monitor First, check the ports, does it have HDMI? If it does, plug it in, if not, find an adapter for a port it does have Next once it\u2019s connected, do you get an image? Is the screen blank? Do you get an error message?, if you do get an image, try playing something, does it display the video or do you get an HDCP error? If you get an error or it doesn\u2019t display anything, it might just not work If it works, do you get audio? If it does, it works and problem solved, if not\u2026 Does the adapter (if using one) or connection type support audio? HDMI, DisplayPort and ThunderBolt supports audio, VGA and DVI does notDoes the monitor have internal speakers? If so, check the volumeIf the monitor doesn\u2019t have internal speakers, does it have audio out (typically 3.5mm jack)? If so, connect speakersIf none of the bullet points above work or apply to you, you need to get an HDMI audio extractor and connect it before the monitor/adapter ",
