            "answer_text": "VCR stands for Video Cassette Recorder. So it\u2019s a device that can record onto a video cassette. This is usually VHS format, but could instead be the competing Betamax format. A VHS player would be a device capable of playing VHS cassettes. It doesn\u2019t specify whether or not the device can record or just play back. In the vast majority of cases you\u2019re likely to come across, they are exactly the same thing. VHS quickly won the \u2018format war\u2019 over Betamax to become the de facto standard. A VHS-format VCR became the recording device used in most homes, and could both record incoming TV channels, and play back recorded material. ",
