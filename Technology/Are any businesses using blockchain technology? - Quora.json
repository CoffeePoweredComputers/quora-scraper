            "answer_text": "Hey there, that\u2019s a very good question! I am the founder of a blockchain job-board called CryptoTalent so I think I can help you out here! Let me break it down in the simplest form possible: Cryptocurrencies: While this isn\u2019t yet clear to majority of the people, most of the coins/tokens that are trading on the cryptocurrency market today have actually been created by real companies with real teams. The goal of these companies is to use blockchain technology to improve or revolutionise traditional processes and industries. In most of the cases, the purpose of their coins/tokens is a way for them to raise funds and allow customers to access their services.Startups: The number of traditionally funded startups that use blockchain technology have sky-rocketed in 2017. These startups, similar to cryptocurrencies, are applying blockchain technology to solve specific problems across different industries. Here is an extensive list of companies using blockchain technology.Traditional companies: Banks, consultancies, and companies across other traditional sectors have also begun to explore the potential of blockchain technology. I believe this article can give you an idea of how this technology is being used in one of the most traditional sectors.I hope that this quick answer was helpful! If you are looking to get involved yourself, head over to CryptoTalent and create a profile so top employers can find you. You can also read our blog for some additional reading on the topic. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me directly on yavuz@crypto-talent.com! Best regards, Yavuz ",

            "answer_text": " XinFin\u2019s XDC is a hybrid blockchain technology in development to deliver real world and enterprise grade integrations into the financial ecosystem. The Singapore based fintech is working on providing blockchain connectivity, transactions and financing mechanism to the real world applications through the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices or projects. XinFin has rolled out TradeFinex (https://www.tradefinex.org/) platform that enables enterprises around the globe to trade and finance projects that banking institutions are unable to take up. XinFin focus is to bridge the huge inefficiencies in global supply chain and bridge the $5 trillion infrastructure deficit.Anyone holding XDC tokens can become a financier on the TradeFinex platform. Investments are subject to risks; XinFin recommends carrying out due diligence before investing. An investor can finance a project along with several other financiers. Their underlying smart contracts will support this. Smart contracts will provide transparency and visibility on repayment to participating financiers. Beneficiaries can post projects on TradeFinex platform and reach out to global financiers for funding and global suppliers for procurement. However, XinFin is currently working on providing a peer to peer financing platform through its XDC network directly into the IoT Enabled water Purifier ATM machine in remote villages in the parts of Africa and India that supplies clean drinkable water at a highly subsidised rate. The same architecture can be easily scaled up in the long term by the Governments or institutions to secure/raise finance from global investors for critical infrastructure projects that are neglected and glamour-less for investors. The applications of XinFin\u2019s XDC platform are endless and can be applicable to institutional/retail as well as Government Financing. From the compliance aspect, XinFin\u2019s XDC network will work with regulated or existing market makers or money changers in the long term. The platform can be integrated with existing legacy systems using XinFin APIs, thereby, making it simple, economical and convenient to use. XinFin hybrid Blockchain also offers a secure digital ledger for storing data performing settlement using XDC protocol. Applications for XinFin\u2019s Blockchain technology are immense and XinFin is currently working on several in-house projects in the area of Solar power, Travel, Payments, Aerospace, Medical ambulance services, Water solutions, etc. to name a few. Recently Singapore\u2019s fintech was also invited to speak by Central Bank of India\u2019s research arm at their event.

            "answer_text": "Such companies as IBM, Microsoft, Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, Nasdaq, Foxconn and Visa are pursuing blockchain technology; so too is Maersk, the shipping giant. Venture capitalists have also invested some $1.5 billion into it. There is some question about whether such businesses have a full understanding of how blockchain technology might be of benefit to them, but there is great optimism about its future \u2014 and ample reason for other companies to get on board. William Mougayar, a venture capitalist at Virtual Capital Ventures, advisor to such blockchain organizations such as the Ethereum Foundation and author of the book \u201cOpening Digital Markets,\u201d told Forbes that blockchain is at present where the Internet was in 1993-94 \u2014 poised to explode. In his mind, blockchain can be viewed through technical, business and legal prisms, in that the technology provides not only a ledger but an exchange network \u2014 an alternative to traditional currency and banking, as it has been called elsewhere.

            "answer_text": "Many use-cases being adopted by businesses right now of blockchain technology are contained within private blockchains through companies like Hyperledger, R3, or Ripple. This is because businesses are happy with private databases and don\u2019t want to overhaul their systems to interact with public networks. The private blockchain model generally fails to achieve the 3 key benefits of blockchain technology: transparency, immutability, and decentralization. These benefits, which have far-reaching implications for security, will likely only be realized on blockchain architectures that are open, public, and distributed. Our company, Hydrogen, is using APIs to bring the benefits of the Ethereum public blockchain to private businesses. Our APIs interact with smart contracts, so businesses can achieve blockchain functionality with just a few API calls. I think this will be the approach that brings blockchain to businesses in the near future. ",
