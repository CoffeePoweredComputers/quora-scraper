            "answer_text": "Well first off you shouldn\u2019t have any more than two boxes to get everything\u2026 1 - A Cable/Dish box to receive those services 2 - A streaming Box (or Dongle if you don\u2019t like boxes) for all the app based services that are available. As to the question why don\u2019t they put it all in one box? Well they really don\u2019t want you to watch those other services they prefer you watch theirs. But if you really want to reduce the number of boxes connected to your TV there is a way to do it if you have a good provider. Many Cable and Dish services offer apps that can get most if not all of the channels you subscribe to. These are available for most of the streaming boxes out there (Android especially). So you could get away without a cable/dish tuner and do everything on your streaming box. That way everything would be on the one box. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer your question simply. You need those devices because all of the manufacturers are competitors. To the extent that they cooperate, you can get a lot of over the top services likr Netflix or Amazon via apps on a single device like Apple TV or Amazon fire stick. It\u2019s really the traditional cable companies that aren\u2019t playing ball. ",
