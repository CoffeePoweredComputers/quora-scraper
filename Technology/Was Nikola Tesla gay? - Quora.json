That he had issues with \"modern women,\" is clear. What is not clear is if he simply preferred to avoid them in most contexts (including sexual) or if he preferred men in a sexual context. The only hint in that direction is that he kept a private -- some characterize it as \"secret\" -- apartment that his peers and colleagues never visited. Was it a secret homosexual trysting place? Maybe, but there's insufficient evidence to really decide that.  He was not attracted to women. Maybe he was attracted to men. But also, he might have been asexual, as we now use that term.

He did mention several times that he felt attracted to women, he just did not have the time for them. So no he was not gay.
