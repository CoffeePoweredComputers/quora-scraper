            "answer_text": "They understood that computers were going to get more complex, and that meant adding more components. Since the number of components was growing at a faster rate than the individual components were shrinking, it was perfectly reasonable to believe computers were going to get bigger. For a time, they were absolutely right, computers did get bigger \u2014 until the components started to shrink faster than the rate that the number of components grew. With the invention of microscopic transistors and integrated circuits, the size of the components dropped by several orders magnitude in a generation. Computers began to shrink. We\u2019re getting to the point where computers are made of components so small, that we\u2019re skirting the edge of what\u2019s physically possible. In a generation it may become true again that in order for computers to become more powerful that they will need to start growing in size. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do most predictions in the 1950s about computers say that they were going to get bigger in size? I do not recall ANY predictions that computers would get bigger in physical size. Everyone knew they would grow in capability and complexity. A lot of effort was put into packing more memory into a given space. However, I think it likely that early computer engineers may not yet have realized how important size was to increased speed and performance. Unlike most machines, \u201cbigger\u201d did not mean more powerful when it comes to computers. That\u2019s because the time it take an electron to travel is actually a major factor in computer speed. It\u2019s hard to speed up an electron, but smaller means the distance is less. ",
