It is always based on personal preference and on what each program focusses most on PC: today version of Gimp: Heavily focused on Photo retouching and editing Inkscape: Heavily focused on Line art and Vector based art Ios/android: Sketchbook: overall focused on Digital painting me personally pay a few bucks and use sketchclub on ios($3,49) (have been using it for 8 years and it is my portable alternative for Photoshop on pc) ",

            "answer_text": "I recommend Photoshop Sketch! It\u2019s really easy to use and I\u2019ve had no problems with it on my ipad pro. If you are looking for something more technical, Autodesk Sketchbook is my great. I Both are great free programs, but I would also encourage you to look at Procreate if you have 5 bucks to spare. Admittedly, I mostly use Sketch since it\u2019s pretty easy to use, but I\u2019m slowly migrating to Procreate as I become more comfortable with it\u2019s tools. Cheers! ",
