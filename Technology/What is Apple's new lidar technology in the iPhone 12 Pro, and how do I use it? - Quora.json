            "answer_text": "LiDAR isn\u2019t new, it was invented in 1961. I\u2019m not even 100% sure Apple is the first to put it in a phone. It can be used to build a 3d map even in the dark, which can be useful in AR and in simulating classic lens depth of field effects with lenses that have more depth of field then you want. It can be used to dramatically accelerate auto focus, and can provide focus information in environments that are too dark to for normal autofocus techniques. Unless you write iOS software, you use something that already takes advantage of it (for example the camera app \u201cjust focuses faster\u201d, you don\u2019t need to find a LiDAR button). Frequently even if you are an iOS developer the frameworks you use blend in LiDAR data as appropriate (for example ARKit). ",
