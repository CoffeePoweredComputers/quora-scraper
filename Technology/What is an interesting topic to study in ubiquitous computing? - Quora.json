            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not an expert in this area but it has always been a huge fascination of mine - as a consumer I\u2019m craving invention in this area. My expertise is in finding things however and I recommend starting here: Category:Ubiquitous computing - Wikipedia Also, I would research the terms you find there in Google Trends. I know that IoT is a trending concept that originates with the bigger/original concept of ubiquitous computing.  Or dive further into the components/technologies specifically - for example, haptic technology. You can also take the route of looking into the electronics themselves. I\u2019m biased because of my employer (full disclosure) that PCB design and specifically rigid flex are important topics because with the flourishing wearables market there are more design constraints depending on the chassis.
