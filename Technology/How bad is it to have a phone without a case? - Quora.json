            "answer_text": "This is one of those arguments that will probably continue as long as smartphones are in existence. A lot of it is personal preference, something that you'll realize after you use the phone for awhile both with and without a case. However, there are a few indisputable pros and cons for each side\u2014both obvious ones and the not-so-obvious. Here's a quick look at the arguments for and against using a case. Bundle Up: Reasons to Protect Your Phone   You might think that cases are only for the anal retentive that care about keeping their phone pristine, but there's more to it than that. Things you want to think about include: Drop Protection: Look, no matter how careful you are, gravity is just stronger than you. You'll probably drop your phone at least once or twice in the years that you own it. How much protection you need, though, depends on your phone: lots of Android phones are built a bit tougher, and are more likely to survive the occasional drop (I'm speaking from lots of experience here). The iPhone 4 or 4S, on the other hand, while blessed with gorgeous looks, are a lot more likely to break when you drop them, so the argument for using a case becomes much stronger. It's also worth mentioning that even cheap cases can give you drop protection by preventing you from dropping the phone in the first place. A lot of phones have particularly slippery backs, and a good case can add a bit of grip to keep it from sliding out of your hand and onto the concrete. It still isn't as good as getting a quality case, but it's better than going naked. Protection for More Than Just Cosmetics: Even if you don't care about the occasional scratch or even shattered back, there's more to your phone than that. Some phones (like the iPhone) have a camera lens flush with the back, meaning its much more prone to scratches and other damage\u2014which can make your photos look pretty awful. You could also damage one of the buttons on your phone, which would make it much more of a hassle to use than just a few scratches. Resale Value: That said, even if you aren't obsessive about the little scratches on your phone, many people are\u2014and while dropping your phone without a case may not break it, it will create little nicks and scratches on your phone that will lower the resale value. Putting a case on your phone is one of the best ways to upgrade to your next phone for free\u2014so if you sell your phones instead of keeping them around, a case can be a great idea. Stand Out in a Crowd: While there's always an argument to make for \"individuality\", a case can also make you stand out in a practical way. Next time you're at a social gathering, count the number of people with the same phone as you in the room. Now imagine none of those people had cases on their phones, and left them on the table or counter (as so many people do) Conversely, lots of people are heavily anti-case. Popular reasons include:  Added Bulk: This is the most obvious reason, and doesn't really require a lot of explanation. A case is going to add more bulk to your phone, plain and simple. Silicone ones make it harder to slip into your pocket, and a lot of people think they cover up the design of the phone, which is often one of the reasons you buy the phone you do. A Case Won't Save You From Every Drop: It's a bit of a weak argument, but it's true: a case isn't going to miraculously save your phone from ever being broken. Just because you have a case and an unbroken phone doesn't mean the two are directly linked. A soft case will protect you from breakage better than a hard case, and no case is completely immune from damage\u2014it just depends on how your phone hits the ground. It'll certainly protect your phone better than no case at all, but whether that's worth the other cons is up to you. They Get Dirty Very Easily: When you put a case on your phone, you're adding a bunch of extra nooks and crannies for dirt to get in. And, while it's easy to clean off, it's a bit of a hassle, and if you're too lazy to clean it, you're going to end up with a dirty looking phone. Cost: You can get a simple case for pretty cheaply, but the more you spend, the better protection you get\u2014and once you start getting into quality case territory, you could end up spending upwards of $40 or $50. That's not horrible by any means, but it is probably 1/4th the cost of your phone\u2014and, if your phone does break, it may not be as expensive to repair as you think. The math isn't perfect, and it all depends on what case you're looking at, but it's something to consider. Again, in the end, it all comes down to personal preference, how accident prone you are, and what phone you have, not to mention how you're using it\u2014if you regularly hike, play sports, or impress your friends with your phone juggling skills, you might want to take a closer look at a case. If you're particularly careful, you might be okay with a less intense form of protection. Our recommendation: try out a case and see how you like it. You can always take it off and try both ways to see which method you prefer. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do you think it is bad? It is not bad. Why do you need a case when current smartphones usually last around 2 years? The phone may get a few scratches. If you do not have a very expensive phone, I think you can get over a few scratches. I tend to think that a case may help overheat the phone. No case is better. You are actually enjoying your phone the way it is. When you put a case on your phone, the look and feel of the phone changes. The things we own are meant to serve us. It should NOT be the other way around! FYI I have Lenovo S90. It is no flagship phone. It is quite thin. I do not have a case for it. I only put a screen protector on it. So, my short answer to your question is: No, it is not bad. However, screen protector is a must. Scratches on the back of the phone are ok :). If they are on the screen, it will be nagging. ",
