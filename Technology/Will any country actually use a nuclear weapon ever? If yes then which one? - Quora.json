            "answer_text": "Back in the early 90's there was a story aired on the early morning live NPR broadcast from Washington that said the CIA had confirmed reports of a Soviet Air Force fighter plane firing an air to air nuclear missile at an Afghan Air Force met. The report said there was a blue-white flash and the Afghan aircraft disappeared with no debris falling to the ground. According to the report, a CIA Agent witnessed the event. I'd been on my way to work in LA when this aired at 0300 Pacific Time. When I picked up my coworker I mentioned the story, he was very interested to hear it. When the rebroadcast came on, the segment on the event had been removed, something we both found interesting. So apparently, the Soviets were the second to use nuclear weapons. ",

            "answer_text": "While a lot of people are saying North Korea I would say Russia. While North Korea is unstable their use of nuclear weapons would literally guarantee their countries down fall. Russia is more stable for sure however Putin has said he would use nuclear weapons in a first strike. He has also said he would use them to de-escalate conflicts. For example if NATO built up troops on the Russian border they might use a nuclear bomb on them to stop an attack even if war isn\u2019t declared. Anoth huge reason Russia might launch first is an accident. We know Russia is behind on all military aspects after the Cold War so the nuclear weapons probably arnt all up to date. Yes I know they brag about how the keep updating their nukes but how serious are they? Have they updated all 2,000 ICBMs? I doubt it. The threat of an accidental launch is worryingly high. Maybe a computer detects a launch from the US and Russian officials decide to counter launch. This is becoming more unlikely by the day due to new technology but it\u2019s still a possibility. The main possibility is a computer launch. Where the computer launches a nuke on its own. Russia doesn\u2019t have as many safety nets as the US. Once a ICBM is launched there is no backing out (I have no clue why nations don\u2019t have an explosive on board the missile to stop it if needed). While North Korea likes to boast its nukes it likely won\u2019t use them. Russia probably wouldn\u2019t use them as a first strike but the possibility is there especially since the president alone decides to launch. I hope an accident launch or a launch on purpose happens but the chances are all ways there when nuclear weapons exist. ",

            "answer_text": "Well If I had to put down an order most to least likely 1. North Korea: They have a history of randomly attacking South Korea for no reason, it's only a mater of time before they push to far, the south seriously retaliates starting a war which the North stands no chance at winning, and in desperation the North uses their nukes. 2. Pakistan: there are a lot of issues going on with Pakistan leading to higher chances of them purposely or a rouge commander using one. 3. India: Pakistan and India wind up in a major war against each other 4. China: Possible if tensions flair up between Japan and China or China getting involved in a war between South and North Korea leading to an all out war leading them to a war with the US 5. Russia: If they start annexing more former Warsaw pact nations and the west retaliates leading to WWIII which then starts going bad for them. 6. France: Basically same as above but Russia is successful and about to completely over run France 7. UK: Same scenario as above, they are just slightly less likely because they are an island and therefore less likely to be over ran before France is. 8. US: Being far away from other major threats, all of which don't have much capability to project their power to effectively attack the US which leads to the US being unlikely to be put into a position of needing to resort to using Nukes. *Israel: Left of the list because I am unsure if it was ever officially confirmed if they had nuclear capability. If they, do then I'd place them between India and China ",

If a limited force of tanks/soldiers invaded a country that country would try and respond conventionally. If however someone used a nuke a line has been crossed which implies they may use more. If you have your own weapons the fear is either you use them or lose them.The vast majority of Nukes are under the control of people which we may not like but it is extremely unlikely they would use them as they know we will retaliate. Unfortunately there are unstable countries/regimes and terrorists who because of their beliefs or fear of invasion they are much more likely to use them. That is why proliferation is such a bad thing for EVERYONE. ",

            "answer_text": "The cost/benefit analysis of a nuclear first strike makes it a viable option only if the state faces Debellatio. If you value your nation above your species and are about to lose your sovereignty, go ahead and launch every nuke you have in your arsenal. You have nothing to lose.  Nuke your invader. Nuke your other enemies. You never liked \u2019em anyways.  Nuke your neutral neighbors. Are you sure they were neutral? Hell, nuke your allies. Where were they when you needed them?  Those nations would be Israel and Pakistan. No other nuclear state could reasonably be conquered short of WWIII. Beyond that we are looking at a second strike against a non-nation state. If Daesh gets ahold of a nuke, expect them to use it. If Daesh uses a nuke, expect whatever mound of dirt they are standing on to be nuked in turn. It doesn\u2019t really matter who they hit. Paris in nuclear flames will trigger the glassing of Raqqa as surely as Washington or Moscow. So really it is up to the non-nuclear attackers to decide\u2026\u2026 \u2026 And every nuclear state has lots of insane enemies. There is no way to guess. ",

It also feels that it has a moral right, as the Jewish state in the region has nuclear weapons, so its only fair that they have them as well. The US is turning a blind eye to this. If any other oil rich Muslim nation wanted to spend hundreds of billions of dollars developing a nuclear industry, the US would be all over them with sanctions and threats.

As Iran has more than what\u2019s necessary to acquire one except the will.  [1] The only way Iran would be least likely to go on that path is if the US takes all the reasons that could justify acquiring a nuclear weapon for Iran. But, with the current degree of pressure and hostility, Iran might do that very soon indeed. Last year (2017/18) when Washington was sending so many signals ( Disinformation ) that its going to take down Iran ( for instance, Trump could be prepared to strike Iran, Australian Government sources say) did raise the serious conversation of leaving Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons or NPT in Tehran (Tehran Threatens To Leave Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty If Trump Kills Iran Deal). Japan is also a good candidate. They are naturally an independent nation even though they have conducted their policy according to the US will since WW2, but, as its becoming more and more definite that North Korea nuclear threat isn\u2019t going to anywhere, I think Japan might soon begin to take the matter on its own hand and repel North Korea nuclear threat by acquiring one. Some might say Saudi Arabia but I really doubt it. The US might attempt to scare Iran by claiming it would let Saudi Arabia have it but again, even if the US allows it, Israel would never allow the shaky kingdom in Saudi Arabia acquire one if you know what I mean!

They facilitated the attacks against Mumbai in 2008 without notification to, or consent from, the administrative and civilian leadership of their own country. This could have been a casus belli with horrible consequences. At some point it is possible that the extremists will be able to foment a war with India; a war that Pakistan cannot possibly win by conventional means. If it becomes apparent that the defeat and dismemberment of Pakistan is imminent, the central government will authorize the use of nuclear weapons. This would probably be prefaced with an ultimatum and a demonstration detonation against Indian supply lines to forces besieging Lahore. Until the central government regains control of military hardliners and the Inter-Services Intelligence Agency, and by those actions the full control of Pakistani foreign and military policy, Pakistan will remain the most likely initiator of nuclear war in the world today, with India following immediately thereafter.
