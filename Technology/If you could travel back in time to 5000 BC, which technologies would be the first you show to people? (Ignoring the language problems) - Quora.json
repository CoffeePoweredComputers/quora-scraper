Glass-making would be relatively easy to implement in any area with sand.Phonetic alphabets for writing would be something one could teach locals in nearly any area without industrial manufacturing, as well as the concept of zero.Possibly the shadoof if I\u2019m in area where irrigation would be possible.",
