            "answer_text": "ANSWER CREDIT Sylvain Saurel Elon Musk is known to be a workaholic.  Legend has it that he would work up to 20 hours a day ... I think this is something that is greatly exaggerated and adds to the myth of the character. Nevertheless, you can be sure that Elon Musk works much more than the average person. He runs two successful companies like Tesla and SpaceX while developing many other projects: Neuralink, The Boring Company, ... This requires an enormous amount of work time. That's for sure. More than 20 hours a day, I think Elon Musk optimizes his working time to be hyper-productive. In spite of that, he works a lot, and that's probably why he was seen to be behaving suspiciously a year ago when he smoked marijuana in a fun interview. This can be attributed to a kind of burnout where the person goes crazy and does things to relieve the pressure. For the average person, it doesn't really matter. But for an entrepreneur running companies like Tesla and SpaceX, this behavior is obviously not well seen. Elon Musk had of course been called to order. Since then, he has calmed down and has come back in better shape. .
