However, a neutron star is also supported against the gravitational collapse due to the PAULI'S EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE or more precisely NEUTRON DEGENERACY PRESSURE i.e. no two neutrons can occupy the same quantum state at the exact same time and as neutrons were forced to come closer, there would arise a repulsive force.
