            "answer_text": "To actually build a modern car and airplane, you're transporting a vast \"technology stack\" and \"manufacturing knowledge stack\" to that time.  In particular, since modern cars and - especially - planes are essentially mobile datacenters, the Romans would have computers and computer networking in addition to modern manufacturing processes (as well as stuff like electricity, power generation, etc).  They'd definitely figure out how to make tanks, transports, and military aircraft, and would have conquered Eurasia and probably Africa quickly. After Eurasia, they'd figure out advanced ships and encounter - and likely conquer - the Americas; the same disease wipeout of native Americans that happened in the 16th century would have happened 1500 years earlier.  Advanced communications technology would allow easier maintenance of a global empire. Whether social reforms would follow quickly is a question, although it's likely that with so many conquered peoples, a huge slave-economy society would exist for awhile.  But the end of borders and global trade would likely lead to a worldwide economic boom, and the construction of the Internet 2000 years earlier may have led to a massive tech boom as well.  Wealth tends to push social changes - and slavery is \"economically inefficient\" in a more knowledge-driven society - so the slave society would have eventually ended. If they built space tech, we may well be a solar-system spanning civilization by now. But there were also many civil wars in ancient Rome - and with a globe-spanning empire, all wars are \"civil\" - and with all the wealth and tech, there's a nontrivial chance that that they'd use nukes, bioweapons, or even more fancy weapons, and we may not exist. If we did, we may well still be led by \"Caesar\". Another option is that we may still have had a fall of the empire, leading to a dark age with better technology.  If that happened, much tech knowledge would be lost, but since it would have been more widely dispersed by the initial growth of the empire, the dark age would have ended more quickly, possibly leading to a world of national states like we have now (but with much better tech).

            "answer_text": "If you traveled back in time to Ancient Rome and told people how to make cars and planes, how advanced would our technology be now? 2 answers here already, and they've dealt with a number of technological and historical issues, but I going to go with a different tack. There were a number of impressive inventions during the Rome's heyday.  Steam turbines, water powered automatons, even a computer of sorts.   Why didn't they advance those items to be more complex and useful?  Because there wasn't any need. Rome ran on slave and plebian labor.  Slaves were cheap and plentiful (it's said that at one point there were more slaves in Rome than there were free citizens).  Getting from point A to point B was about as fast as you could go, even with a car.  Horses are much better traversing the rough roads of the day.   Cars and planes require a lot of fuel, which has to be pumped and refined.  Maintenance and repair is expensive, also.   Slave were fed the cheapest food, were given the minimum accommodations, and were easy enough to replace when they died or were otherwise unable to work. Romans would probably have rejected cars and planes since they had everything they needed at the time.   ",
