            "answer_text": "Some do, some don\u2019t, like anything else. But it\u2019s a zero sum game. If you increase the gain, you effect the coverage. A unity gain antenna has a toroidal, doughnut shaped pattern, like this.  Plotted on a graph, you see on the left what the coverage looks like if you are looking at the antenna from the side. On the right, you are looking down from directly above. If you want to increase the gain, you have to sacrifice coverage. Imagine that doughnut is made of rubber, filled with air. If you push down on the donut, it will make it have a larger diameter, but it will be thinner vertically. Or, if you put a reflector behind it, to bounce power in one direction, you lose it in the direction of the reflector, like this.  So, yes they work. Probably every cell tower you see has higher gain, directional antennas. As to the ones they sell for consumers, that allegedly improve performance, the same rules apply. I have no practical experience with them, but I am skeptical. ",

            "answer_text": "A high gain wireless antenna can work, it depends on your application. A unity gain, ideal antenna will sent RF energy equally in all directions. Since we cannot make energy from nothing, a high gain antenna does not send RF energy in all directions. A good analogy is a light bulb. If you have a normal lightbulb uncovered it will spread light in all directions out to a given distance. If you put it into a properly shaped reflector you can turn the lightbulb into a spot light. It will send light much further in one direction, but leave most of immediate area unlit. Just like with a spotlight, a high gain antenna will have some energy that spills out. No antenna perfectly sends the energy in one direction. But the majority will be sent in one direction. So do you want to connect two buildings with a WiFi bridge? Then high gain antennas will work great. Do you want to provide good coverage to the whole house? Get something different. ",
