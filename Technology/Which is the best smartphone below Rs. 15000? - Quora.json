            "answer_text": "If you would\u2019ve asked me this question a few months back, I would\u2019ve definitely told you that the best smartphone below Rs. 15000 is undoubtedly the Redmi Note 8 Pro priced at Rs. 13,999. However, with the latest launch of Realme 6 on March 5, 2020 I cannot think of a better option in the below Rs. 15000 price segment.  While every other brand was busy earning profits on their high-priced fancy smartphones, Realme just swooped in and brought the most essential features packaged into one slim-and-sleek captivating smartphone which focuses on the design as well as the performance of this pocket-friendly device. The Realme 6 comes powered with the MediaTek Helio G90T processor which was earlier seen boosting the gaming experiences of smartphone gamers in the Redmi Note 8 Pro. Now, it makes Realme 6 one of the best budget smartphones of the year. Apart from making great gaming features available to mainstream gaming geeks, Realme 6 also helps in keeping up with the enthusiasm of shutterbugs. Here are some features of Realme 6 which make it the best smartphone below Rs. 15000 in my opinion: Dramatic Display & Design: The FHD+ ultra-smooth 6.5-inch display with a screen-to-body ratio of up to 90.5% is a blessing for those who anyway keep immersed in the digital world. Now they will be able to do so with utmost clarity without compromising on their entertainment. Also, good news for those who had issues with notch displays. This one cornered the notch and turned it into a punch-hole selfie camera.  Catchy Camera Specs: The 16MP in-display selfie snapper is a new development from many other smartphones in the price range. It comes with AI Beauty, HDR and Bokeh modes to modify your selfies to their best capabilities. Now taking up those selfie challenges won\u2019t require an additional filter. The huge similarity with the Redmi Note 8 Pro apart from the MediaTek processor is the presence of a 64MP AI Quad Camera setup where 4 different lenses are leveraged to individual strengths for far more versatile and detailed photography. Gamer\u2019s Paradise: Well, this is the most favourable feature for all millennials who are addicted to playing heavy games like PUBG and Fortnite on smartphones. There was a time when smartphone gaming was a luxury, but brands have collectively put in their best efforts to make such virtues reachable to youngsters without digging a hole in their pockets. What could be more fun than playing your favourite games anytime, anywhere. The MediaTek Helio G90T chip is a great support when it comes to gaming with its fine-tuned HyperEngine gaming technology in addition to outstanding CPU and GPU performance.  Power-Packed Battery Backup: What keeps a smartphone together is its battery. No power backup halts all the essential tasks which often becomes a deal-breaker when you\u2019re doing smartphone shopping. Now in Realme 6 you not only get a mega power capacity of 4300mAh but it\u2019s also endowed with 30W Flash Charge feature to fully charge your smartphone within one hour. It is because of these upgraded features that Realme 6 in my opinion is the best phone available under Rs. 15,000. What makes it even more likeable are its basic utilities like Side Fingerprint Sensor, realme UI with Android 10, 8GB + 128GB storage + RAM along with a 2 SIM Slot + 1 MicroSD Slot and 3.5mm headphone jack which are handy in everyday functioning.
