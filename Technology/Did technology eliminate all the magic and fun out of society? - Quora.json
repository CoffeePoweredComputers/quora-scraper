            "answer_text": "\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" -Arthur C Clarke Technology has succeeded in debunking and/or explaining countless phenomena previously attributed to magic. At the same time it has created countless more such phenomena, on an unimaginable scale,which we take for granted today, but would seem like magic to anyone from any bygone era. For example, even knowing how the manufacturing process works this still amazes me every time i think about it: a 128gb MicroSD card, smaller than my thumbnail, requires over five hundred billion individual components all operating in unison in order to operate, and you can pick one up for $50, over the internet, without ever leaving your chair. Technology has destroyed the fake magic once touted by sensationalist storytellers, instead replacing it with truly amazing and real magic, and it continues to do so on a daily basis. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmmmm, interesting question. I think technology enabled us to try new magic, which is the magic of 21st century. This magic include (but not limited to) Internet, computers, smartphones, video calls, online video conferences and events, social networks and so on. Some experiences are changed. We meet our friends and significant others more often on Facebook and Twitter, than in real life. We have more fun online. Of course, there are some disadvantages of this situation. People became less socialized and prepared for interacting with each other face-to-face. But technology is a progress, it is a future. ",
