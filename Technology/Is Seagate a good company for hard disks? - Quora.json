            "answer_text": "There are currently only three companies in the world that manufacture spinning disc hard drives: Western Digital/HGST, Seagate, and Toshiba. According to production data from Backblaze, an online backup company that uses large numbers of consumer grade drives rather than the more expensive enterprise models, Seagate drives are significantly less reliable than WD or HGST drives (they don't buy enough Toshibas to evaluate them).

            "answer_text": "I bought a Seagate 500 GB HDD. After 15 days it died. I replaced because it was within warranty period. The new one died again within a month. Seagate HDDs are not that reliable. In fact many people faced problems with Seagate. But the Barracuda lineups are good, as I have heard about them. But still they lack credibility in comparison to WD. ",
