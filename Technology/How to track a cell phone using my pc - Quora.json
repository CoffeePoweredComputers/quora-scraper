            "answer_text": "The best way you can track your lost cell phone (I am talking about an Android device) using your PC is by making use of the Google's ADM (Android Device Manager), if you don't have any third party app installed. But before you do this,  you will have to make sure that your Google account is connected to your device. You device will need to have an  access to Internet, and device location turned \"ON\"Allowed the Google's ADM to lock your device and erase its data.If your device was setup this way, then get to your PC (but it will be better using another or a friend's Android device), open the Google search page and type in \"where is my phone\" you can see the picture below.  Once you open this page, Google will tell you to sign in with the account that is connected to your device, your cell phones location settings will need to be turned \"ON\" before Google can locate it.   Once you locate your device, you have three options which is to Lock itRing itOr Erase the device's data.I hope this helps.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well, that depends. If it is your phone, it's quite easy. If it's an Android phone, Android Device Manager will work. I know Apple has something similar for the iPhone. Now if your trying to track a phone that isn't yours, the first question is why? The carrier can easily get at least a rough location, if not a precise one. However, unless the phone belongs to you, or is at least on the same account as yours, good luck getting them to hand over that location. ",

Then go to your profile in Google on a PC, and there is an option to find out where your phone is. If you mean the search according to the base station, then for this you need special software, and the judgment :) The search is the destiny of the security services. ",
