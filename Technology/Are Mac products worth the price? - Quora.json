            "answer_text": "Oh, hell yes. I've used Apple computers for a very long time; my first Apple was a Lisa, the forerunner of the Mac, way back in the day.  In the time since then I've owned almost every computer you can imagine. A Sony, a couple of Dells, a couple of Hewlett-Packards, a pair of PDP-11s (an 11/03 and an 11/24), a Sun SPARCstation-10...and many Macs, ranging from a Mac IIvx to the computer I'm typing this on, a Macbook Pro. Consistently and reliably, the Macs have been better values than any other computer I've owned. Better than the Sony, better than the Dells, better than the HPs, yes, even better than the SPARCstation. For one, the profit margins in PC machines are brutally low, and it shows--the manufacturers cut costs like crazy even on high-end machines. HP laptops are notorious for flimsy power connectors that break (and sure enough, that happened on mine). One of the Dells I owned was so shitty in its design that upgrading RAM required almost an hour of disassembly; the RAM slots were located beneath the power supply! They have cheap plastic cases. They aren't built to last. How can they be? With razor-thin profit margins, there's not a lot of money to be spent in design and less money to be spent in fit and finish or high-end construction. Apple makes rather a lot more profit on their computers. A lot of folks think of Apple computers as expensive, even overpriced, but that's really not the case--it's that Apple does not play in the low-end, low-margin arena. Their products aren't aimed at low-end users. If you price like for like, getting machines of equivalent spec (and equivalent ports), you find they're generally at the same price or sometimes even less expensive than their PC cousins. It's just that their PC cousins hemorrhage money on the low-end crap. The most expensive Mac you can buy is a fully-loaded Mac Pro, for which you will pay more than $5,000 US. But try speccing a similar machine from another vendor for less. (I've tried.) You'll typically find you'll spend more for a PC machine with similar specs, if you can find one--the closest I could get was a high-end Dell, and it lacked Thunderbolt ports or ECC memory and was still almost $500 more.  Macs last a long time. I typically find myself replacing my PC machines every 2-3 years. Macs just keep going and going. The server sitting to my left is an iMac 9,1: a 2009-vintage iMac. It's running the server version of the most current OS, El Capitan Server. It's a far more capable machine today than any 7-year-old PC I've yet encountered. ",

            "answer_text": "I have used a Mac at work in the past, but not recently. I've also run a Hackintosh not all that long ago (10.8 perhaps? - I turned my old PC in to one at one point), but I was asked to answer, so here goes: My PC is five years old. It cost me about $900 to build, and it has received one $500 upgrade in its lifespan. Total cost, $1400. My PC outperforms a top of the line iMac in its optimal use case scenario by approximately double. Outside of the optimal use case for my PC, it will perform about 20-30% slower than a loaded iMac. The iMac comes with a display, which I will value at about $1000. The pricing for the most comparable iMac to my computer is $2849 - that would be a 3.3Ghz i5 (Slightly faster than my old 3.4+Ghz i5), 16GB RAM, and a 3TB fusion drive. To gain the noted performance advantage above would require a $250 bump to the top of the line i7. I have 2 3TB internal hard drives and an SSD, but I'm ignoring some of that here as one drive is for backup... Excepting the $1000 price for the display, that puts the cost, today, at $1849 for the computer. The primary differentiators between these systems are twofold: the iMac has OSX, and my old PC has far more expandability. My expectation for my PC is that I will use it as configured for another 2 years before replacement. I may add another hard drive in that time if my spinning media storage is overflowing, or if I need more backup space - but I would need that space if I had an iMac too. I don't have a use for a thunderbolt port, so it provides no value to me. I lose some convenience versus the iMac with a boot/application SSD versus the fusion drive. I prefer Windows to OSX. OSX does have some advantages over Windows, probably the most notable one is that system usability is a bit better when performing a very heavy background load, and the second most notable one being greater UI consistency, but my experience is that both are very reliable OSes that do what people ask of them; computer problems aren't things I deal with on anything resembling a regular basis. I've never had a virus, and have not had any significant issues with spyware for ages. Xupiter is the last one I can remember that was problematic for me, and that was circa 2000-2002.  I generally find Windows more logical to use, but if I could have one thing from OSX, it would be ctrl-shift-Q to quit an application while alt tabbing. I find the window management better in Windows for my use. Both OSes have different interface methodologies, and what makes sense to one person may not make sense to another. In short, I find that the value proposition of my 2011 PC with a 2014 upgrade compares favorably with a new Apple computer, never mind a new PC. It features an OS I prefer I don't like to tinker in my computer. I know how to, but don't find it particularly enjoyable. I spent an hour or so putting together this machine, and then another 30 minutes or so installing Windows. The upgrade to Windows 10 was painless. I have a retail CPU cooler, spent 3 minutes setting up a mild overclock on the CPU when it was new, and haven't looked back. I have the knowledge of a \"power user\" but in the real world I just use my PC like most people do. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on a few factors, including what\u2019s important to you, what you need it for, and how to best do that which you are planning to use it for, but at the moment FOR ME I'd say hell no. I'm not saying don't buy it, but know what you are buying and know why you are buying it for. If you just want to buy it to join the club, or to have a $4000 machine to just surf the web with, then yeah, they win. Let me defend my position before the mac fanboys decide to downvote this answer. In a bid to cater to the average user/newcomers, the Mac conveniently forgot about their pro/longtime user, you know, the actual diehards who were with the company back when it actually was obscure, back when they were on the brink of disaster a few times; you know, the medieval times. Also, Apple as of late is making all of its computers un-upgradeable after purchase and unrepairable by design. If something happens you can\u2019t put a bandaid on it and keep trucking like you used to; you now need to take it in to the Genius Bar to get these fixed. Happen to live in a country where there are only resellers, and no \u201cApple Store\u201d (like my own)? Good luck getting it repaired on a timely manner if at all in that case. And as we know, down time means lost money, and it\u2019s not practical buying two just so to have a spare when one is knocked out. I love macOs. Hands down my favorite OS, perfect for all of my tasks. The hardware however, while undoubtedly beautiful, is leagues and bounds behind what you can get elsewhere, and Apple seems obsessed with anorexia as of late as well: pursuing thinness for thinness sake. It's become function over form, and that's bad. The first time you need that usb-c to hdmi adapter you forgot at home to connect to a projector to deliver that important powerpoint, you'll know what I'm talking about. Also, if you keep making it thin by removing connections, do I not still have to carry around the basic cables and connections I need to, well, use the thing? The Mac Pro\u2019s neglect is basically criminal. The one mac that was built for professional users, the Mac Pro with dual radeon videocards and easily upgradeable hard drive and memory? MIA, last seen circa 2013. Since 2013 has that poor trash can not received a update in the hardware department. And they are still selling them at full price at the Apple store. For the price they are asking, nowadays, I can make a 24-core 48 thread dual xeon actual beast (used processors, but still). With a big form factor, but in there comes a ton of hardware, such as hard drives for ZFS raid, a proper GTX 1080 video card w/ 11GB ram, etc. Take the current macbook pro for example: if you are a pro user you should have undoubtedly come across quite a few times where you were missing that dongle that you need (left it at the girlfriend\u2019s), the battery would run down while encoding despite being plugged into the 5K LG screen, you can\u2019t type at will in a library because it is now unnecessarily loud, inconsistent battery life while unplugged, still impossible to upgrade post purchase (New internal NVMe drive down the road? Forget it). But it has a nice screen and great speakers though. But why buy a $4000 headache? One answer: macOs. It\u2019s still great, and just keeps getting better. They could have made two lines. One for the \u201coooh shiny\u201d people with lots of disposable income, and one for people who actually take their job seriously. But they didn\u2019t. They chose to make everyone have to use the mainstream line, which is being shrunken just to appease the \u201cooooh shiny\u201d crowd at the expense of bona fide pro users. It\u2019s sad. Moral of the story: never let the marketing department take over the product line. Macs are becoming more of an expensive fashion accessory that can also get some things done (showing \u201cbravery\u201d by removing ubiquitous and useful ports for thinness sake) rather than a tool for pros to get their jobs done and look good while doing it, as they used to be. If you are cool with that, then yes, they are worth the money, and could probably get away with charging even more. I, however, am completely disillusioned with the direction the company is taking.

Here's why, I own a Macbook pro and am a software developer (not iOs or XOs) You're not more productive, probably just as productive as you would be on Windows/Linux. You just have to learn how to efficiently do your work on the machine you're on. OSX is not better (or worse). Just different. The retina display looks nice, but I fail to see how this is improving your productivity. The battery life is amazing, true. But then again, I'm hardly longer than 2 hours away from a power outlet. And bringing the charger never has been a problem. The trackpad works like a charm. But it's useless if you have to work on Windows/Linux machines (via RDP or virtualization). A lot of functionality on those machines is behind the right mouse button. Which doesn't exist on the trackpad (or I haven't found out yet how to do; or isn't supported in RDP/virtualization). Some myths: Security. With the implementation of UAC in Windows 7 the security of Windows has been improved a lot. Yes, you still have to buy a virus scanner. I've bought my old laptop 7 years ago for 900 euro's (and it is still working). My macbook costs about 1600 euro's. So I could buy a licencse for a virus scanner for over 20 years and still paying less.  Hardware. Yes, the mac looks lovely. But so do some laptops. In the end you want to do some work on your machine. The hardware must be sturdy. I've heard 'complaints' from others that the metallic case of the macbook feels cold to their hands (I've never noticed it though). And it has been years since I've had problems with my hardware. Or have been asked to take a look at computers of others beacause of hardware problems. As long as you don't buy cheapass products.  The most important question you have to ask yourself: what do you want to do with your computer? Just mailing and some surfing: get a chromebook. If you have to do some extra office stuff: Windows. If you have to do more professional stuff, you probably wouldn't have asked this question?   ",

The largest con is it being expensive and the largest pro is it being of premium quality and posh, Mac book gives a really good and mouthwatering experience if you use it for the right purpose. Most people buy Mac for sake of buying it, to show every or to have the pride of using an Apple device ; so they go for Macbook Air, because it\u2019s the cheapest one in the market and still has the apple emblem and it has moderate functions. The Macbook has become of some use to me during as it allows me to maintain quick notes, keep reminders, mess around with garage band and I even use it to help me in my work, to create prototypes, review project reports, etc. The i 5 core is fast enough for me and I am quite comfortable with it. However there are many more premium models of laptops and other devices that can do the exact same functions and perhaps even do better for some people. The Dell Xps 15 is one example and this is i 7 processor with Microsoft OS, which seems good enough for most people the price is still very high at around 1900 EUR (Even more expensive than the Mac book Pro 13 inch). Microsoft Surface Pro 3 is also a quite reasonable investment. So is the Hp Elite book x360, Dell Latitude 14 7000 and many more devices. All of them are not without there problems but they will prove useful to people who make use of there features. All these computers must be taken into consideration before you buy them. To wind up with YES/NO Macbook is useful that\u2019s all up to the user. ",

            "answer_text": "After years of doing computer support for corporations using Windows based computers, I decided I wanted to join the art community and as they seem to mostly use Macs, I decided to buy an IMac to learn about it. For awhile,  I used both my IMac and my windows computer side by side, seeing how they interact and see what programs run on both machines. I did learn how very similar they are, having similar commands that did the same thing just with different keys. I had photoshop for both computers so I could do my photo editing on either one. But eventually Adobe changed their licensing so that you would have to pay for each version separately and I had to choose one or the other, Mac or Windows machine. Even though they could do the same things, I ended up using the IMac as my main computer and shutting off the windows machine. I see the Mac as being more refined, that someone took time to design it rather than just throwing together a hodge podge of various components. To me it's like a difference between a Lexus and a Corolla. The Corolla will still get you there but the Lexus is more refined with an attention to detail. The other thing that sold me on it is that because Apple lags far behind in market share, there are very few viruses written for it so I can surf the internet without too much worry. My IMac desktop can do everything that a windows desktop can do, except for the annoying thing that you can't easily change the internal hard drive. But it works for me, I use the internal hard drive just for the operating system and use external hard drives for my data, which is a good thing because either the operating system or external hard drive can crash without affecting the other. On the other hand, I still use a windows laptop. I find that the huge price difference between an Apple laptop and a similar powered windows laptop is not worth it for me. Then again, I use my IMac desktop for my editing and use the laptop just for surfing the internet or when traveling, so it's a matter of what you use it for.  ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cAre Macs worth the money?\u201d Short answer, no. Save your money and buy a Dell XPS or similar. Long Answer, I loved Macs from my first Powerbook until I gave away my last Macbook Pro (late 2009). When it came time to buy a replacement for that around 2013, Apple had eliminated ability to upgrade memory or hard drives. So, a $1300 machine that shipped 4GB of Ram and a 128GB SSD would require a new Machine. The SSD can be upgraded, I\u2019ve done it for friends, but the RAM is not. They also eliminated the discrete graphics in many models. Additionally it appears that every single model year has some flaw. Keyboards, overheating, graphics, etc\u2026 This is not new. Outside my first gen iPad (which we still own) I did not own a mac without a recall or issue. Powerbook G4 had the screen fail, first gen Macbook had the CD drive lock up, Pre-Santarosa 15in Macbook Pro had a battery recall due to bad batteries, and the 13.3 in Macbook Pro 2009 had a failed trackpad. Same story with the three iPhones I had. To contrast this, my 2014 Lenovo Y410p is still in near mint condition and has had 0 issues, and my wife still uses a 2008 Lenovo. To top it off they recently implemented a \u201cfeature\u201d that will lock the machine for any unauthorized repairs. I\u2019m not shilling for Lenovo, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus, etc\u2026 all will sell you a decent machine with similar specs for far less. Personally, my favorite is a Xiaomi 12.5in Notebook running KDE Neon. ",

            "answer_text": "In short, If you spend considerable amount of time on your laptop making money or learning or if you are filthy rich then Yes else Big NO! Anything\u2019s worth varies from person to person. A million dollar painting would be worthless to you but a collector would pay double the amount to get it in an auction. Same goes for Mac, iPhone or any other gadget that you desire. To answer your question, Yes a Mac is worth if your time is precious and you spent a considerable amount of time working on your desktop/laptop (no matter what your nature of work be) Macs tend to \u2018hang\u2019 lesser as compared to Windows but the difference is not huge that it would change your life upside down. If you compare it with Ubuntu (where you can do most of the tasks) the difference is even lesser so you might as well install any Linux distro on a cheap laptop and have such experience. The only I have been using MacBook Air since last 2 years and once I had to delete my user profile because it was lagging too much ( I had already contacted customer care for the problem but they couldn\u2019t resolve). What I really like about my mac is the dimensions (13.3 inch screen, super thin), weight (1kg) and of course huge battery backup (8\u201310 hours) which I can\u2019t get from any of the competitor for the same price. No one in the market can beat its Trackpad and is a delight to use. The virus bullshit that everyone talks about is crap. These days most of the viruses/malware is made to infect your Browser rather than your storage (Hard Disk/Pen Drive) because that\u2019s where the information lies. Some of my friends who use Mac and are not tech savvy have some shady search engine installed and loads lot of pop-ups. Also you need to be a little careful with your Mac as a small malfunction would cost you fortune to get it repaired if not covered under warranty while you can get any other manufacturer\u2019s laptop repaired for a small amount (Been there, done that) If I had the chance to return back to my old Windows laptop, I would not hesitate once because I don\u2019t need to carry it everywhere and resides mostly in my cupboard. Its like whether you want a luxury sedan or a normal sedan would also work for you. ",

What pro-Mac people say is 1)Macs have better build quality,hence they last long- Agreed2)They have better Technical support- Agreed3)They are better than PC's- This is subjective and I will economically approach this Now I will divide the consumer group into 21)Consumers who have increasing computational needs and2)Consumers who have the same need (Includes professionals,Businesses and homes, which have very basic needs) It is absolutely stupid and Less cost effective for the Group 1 to purchase a mac because they will be investing on a machine which will be obsolete in 2-3 yrs.So, the point of better build quality does not arise here (Until and unless you deliberately damage a PC) .Speaking in costing terms,it is a loss if your Mac last long because it's productivity decreases in the long run.So a PC which is branded will do the trick here. People will get the warranty +the economical option of replacing the product. Before you purchase any asset apply the basic formula and chooseCost per year = initial investment-Scrap Whole divided by Expected life In case of Mac,by applying the above formula, the Initial investment and the Scrap value will be high, but the cost will be high since the device is being replaced in the Short Run. For Group 2, Professionals and Businesses .The chance for replacement is very less because it is the same old word-processing ,mail ,Power point, Excel Sheet ,Accounting softwares ,Billing softwares .....Blah!..Blah! which requires no up-gradation at all. In fact My Parents are lawyers and any pentium processor will suffice them! Again here, one should Never Choose MacBook Air, MacBook Pro or iMac as they have more tendency to fail (The first two will be because of continuous movement and the latter because it has an HardDrive ,which has a high tendency to fail. The only Mac I would recommend is Mac Mini. It starts @  40K and goes upto 52K .The 40K model will be enough for most users of the second category. I will definitely recommend this to the second group because the Build quality shows here. It will easily last for 10-15 yrs and in the long run,it is a very inexpensive investment. Hope it answers your Query.To be concise.If you have growing needs,stick to a PC and if you have the same monotonous need, get a Mac Mini ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely they are. Firstly, all this nonsense about \u2018you can buy a PC with the same specs for half the price\u2019 is just that, nonsense. Cheap PC\u2019s generally do not last that long and are worth nothing in resale value. By contrast Macs will last as long as you want them to (obviously there are always exceptions on both sides). As a result there is a strong second hand market for Macs. I bought and sold used Macs on eBay for around 9 years and the average age of Macs I sold was around 4-5 years. The resale value for a Mac of that age is around 30\u201340% of it\u2019s original purchase price. Therefore, yes you can buy new Macs, but they don\u2019t have to work out expensive if you look after them and sell them on. Alternatively, you can buy used Macs, get a couple of years use out of them, still sell them on for a decent amount and buy another one. I once worked out that over a 15 year span, I spent just over \u00a3100 a year, and that included all upgrades. During that span I bought three Macs new and also several used ones, having two macs for a good percentage of that time. So, not only does it not have to be expensive, it really can be exceptional value given the quality. There are no doubt good quality PC\u2019s out there, but not at half the price of a Mac that is for certain. ",

If you see the US Apple Online Store they\u2019re selling for $2,799 (assuming you have to pay 10% taxes, that\u2019s $3,078.9 which is still cheaper than what you can buy from Malaysia. So, in that sense, it is not worth the money as you can buy good (not better) and cheaper laptops here. But when you look at Apple\u2019s hardware and software, they work so well and last longer than the normal laptops. I\u2019ve used many Apple computers in the past: the Intel Core Duo iMac 20\u201d (7 years), 2009 white MacBook (9 years), and currenly I own a 2015 15\u201d MacBook Pro. To me, they\u2019re all worth the money. The secret? Buy them from secondary markets. You can often find good used (sometimes new) Macs from forums, eBay, and/or Craigslist at a huge discount. Oftentimes the discounts could reach up to 60%! My current Macbook which I bought almost two years ago only cost me RM6,500 ($1,669) when Apple was selling them for RM11,000 ($2,499). It only had 18 battery cycles (charged 0\u2013100 only 18x!), came with the box, a week of Apple\u2019s standard 1-year warranty, and perfect condition (zero wear & tear). That\u2019s value! I, then, bought ACPP (Apple Care Protection Plan) off the secondary market as well for about RM900 ($230) to extend my warranty which will end July 2018. I recently sent my MacBook Pro for service and Apple replaced my right speaker AND gave me a new screen! Yes, they\u2019re all covered under ACPP and the replacement parts only cost my time and gas to drive to service center. Was I lucky? Hell yes. Was it worth it? Without a doubt. TL,DR Buy Macs from secondary market and add AppleCare for additional value. Your purchase will be a lot more worth your money. :) Thanks for reading, Farvin the Macguyvin. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay, I don't technically own a Mac. I have an 11-inch MacBook Air that my school provides me. I didn't have to pay for it. At my house, I also have a Windows laptop. The MacBook is definitely worth it.  My MacBook costs $800. That is comparable with a lot of other laptops that are around the same size with close to the same specs. The cost is totally worth it because of a few features: Build quality is amazing and we have a really strong, substantial device in a thin and light package.The trackpad is just utterly amazing and great to move your hands on. The keyboard is substantial and works really well, even for the low travel time. The Operating System is perfectly integrated with all of Apple's apps, allowing you to do really cool things that you could never do on a PC.These things are real game changers. You won't think of them as such now, but when you finally use a Mac for 6 months and then go back to a Windows computer, but the difference is night and day. The trackpad, keyboard, and OS integration are all better. The fan rarely starts up and the price is actually competitive. So, yes a Mac is worth it and I recommend it for everyone.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. I would say yes, but I rarely would ever buy one new. I buy used Macs people are selling too cheap, replace the hard drives, bump up the memory and sell them; now and then I find one that\u2019s good enough that I keep it. If nothing else, Mac is worth it for avoiding all the hassles of viruses and malware. Sure, it exists on the Mac, and is theoretically possible, but in my 20-some years of Mac use I\u2019ve never had it be a problem, and I\u2019ve very rarely found other people who\u2019ve had a problem. They\u2019re also worth it for avoiding the bloatware that Windows manufacturers insist on adding. I get the same \u201cout of the box\u201d software every time, and I can easily revert to that by reinstalling the OS, which I can usually do from the keyboard (Command-R) without even needing a disk. I mostly work with MacBook Pros. The hardware is solid and simple, especially the sweet spot of 2010\u20132013 or so, while the bodies were metal but they were still using hard drives and replaceable memory, and I could replace a screen or a keyboard if I needed to. Newer models are essentially disposable if anything breaks, resellable if you need to upgrade, but they sure are great looking. If my company bought me a Mac - several have - I\u2019d appreciate it. If I had to buy my own new-ish, I\u2019d get an Apple Refurbished, but spend the extra on bumping up the memory, drive space, and CPU speed if I could afford it. Otherwise the 2012 Mac Mini and the 2014 MacBook Air I\u2019m using are great, and nearly as fast as new models. ",

            "answer_text": "If you compare like with like, Macs are really not wildly expensive compared to their PC counterparts. If you price up a laptop with comparable build quality, SSD, hi-def screen, all that, the Mac will be a bit more expensive, and it\u2019ll have a worse GPU, but that\u2019s about it. If you\u2019re a gamer, no, Macs are not worth it, avoid, avoid, avoid. If you want a solid, nice laptop with a gorgeous screen and a battery which last approximately forever, Macs are worth it. macOS is a very nice OS, the benefits over Windows are not what they were though. Windows has marched on, recovered from mistakes in Windows 8 and Windows 10 really is now a pretty good Operating System. macOS is no longer head and shoulders above Windows. However, Macs can run Windows too, if you want, so they\u2019re pretty flexible compared to a stock PC. If you\u2019re looking to get a budget machine, i.e. $500 or something, no, Mac is not for you. If you\u2019re looking to spend maybe $1000 or more, then they\u2019re definitely worth checking out. Macs aren\u2019t, that much more expensive compared to the premium brands and models from the big PC players like Dell, Lenovo, HP etc. if you look at their fancy laptops, they ain\u2019t cheap. If you compare to some PC maker you\u2019ve never heard of with a creaky plastic case, spinning disks and crap screen, yes, Macs are a lot more expensive. ",

            "answer_text": "I think Macs are fantastic pieces of hardware. I currently own a 2015 MacBook Pro, and it\u2019s the best machine I\u2019ve ever owned. Trackpad, screen, reliability, smoothness, the OS itself, it\u2019s all awesome. That said, Apple hardware is horrendously overpriced. I bought this MBP for $1300. A massive bargain, off eBay. 500 GB SSD, powerful i7 quad core, an AMD Radeon discrete GPU, a 15\u2033 screen\u2026Apple would\u2019ve originally priced this at well over $2000, probably close to $3000 when it first came out. That would absolutely not be worth it. The new fancy TouchBar MBPs are even worse, for as useless as the TouchBar is. Oh, and don\u2019t tell me that a Windows laptop will have better specs than a Mac at the same price. That\u2019s not true at all. Macs are better. They don\u2019t have to be restarted all the time. They just work. They run on a flavor of Unix. They\u2019re hardier. The hardware (screen and trackpad) is superior. They can run any OS! Even if the Windows machine is better on paper, it usually loses performance over time. Apple hardware is NOT worth the price that Apple charges. It is worth the slight premium price you\u2019ll pay in comparison to a similar Windows machine. So yes, Macs are worth the money. Just, shop for one off eBay, not the Apple Store. ",

            "answer_text": "I bought a cheap car. And a good Mac. The car I use less than an hour a day. And to be frank, it's really not a great product.  I could live without it.   The Mac I use about seven or eight hours a day, and it's essential to me. I love using it.  It's super reliable.  The car cost five times more than the Mac.   So from my perspective, the Mac was great value. The car was expensive.  I think people compare Macs with Windows PCs.    Macs can be more expensive. But the real question here is why are Windows PCs so ridiculously cheap.    The market does not think they have much value, I suspect because of a  combination of fierce competition, and ever declining product quality.    ",

They talk about this a lot and it's easy to pass it off as rhetoric until you really look at the specs of the machines. Apple could make a cheaper computer but they don't. If you've ever worked with a cheap PC you've experienced the frustration of it being slow as hell and having to wait for it to keep up with you. This is because they have cheap components which aren't as fast as the ones they put in base level Macs. There are Equivalent Macs and PCs - when you're talking about laptops - these generally are slightly (5-10% cheaper) if you go the PC route. And this can easily be argued that you get ecosystem benefits with Mac (if you have an iPhone or other Macs) and software benefits - free upgrades and an office suite. But the iMac is where Macs come into their own. Completely unparalleled in the PC space. All-in-one PCs are more expensive like-for-like. TL:DR: Equivelant PC's are roughly the same price. Apple doesn't have low end Macs because it would deliver a poor customer experience. ",

            "answer_text": "A very interesting case in Business Models is that of Apple. If you have noticed Apple is built on the reverse Gillette Blade model. Gillette Razor came up with this model that they would keep their initial product, ie the Razor Stick priced very low and make a killing on the attachable blades that you need to buy specifically for the Razor Stick. So, the customer was stuck to the brand and Gillette earned a lot of revenue in terms of selling extremely expensive Blades to their customers and the customers who had already spent significant money on the stick kept buying this blade. You must remember that many people don't like changing their stick because despite being reasonably high up it is a longer time investment and in their bid to get back their money on this investment they actually end up spending a lot more. However, Apple went ahead and said that it would give very very inexpensive apparel products - the iTunes and make a killing on the main product. People see that they can make a lot of purchases on iTunes and save money in buying their favorite songs but what they didn't realize is that they were invariably spending a significant amount of money upfront and they didn't mind this cost because of the relatively inexpensive songs. This is a very interesting model. Also the way that Apple products are sold is more like - you own it, you flaunt it. However this cannot be said of other consumer electronics despite their superior quality. ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience, a definite yes. I used PC/Windows computers from 1986 to 2007, and had to replace them at roughly 4-year intervals at a cost of about $1,500 each. From 2007 to 2009, I had one of the first Intel iMacs; it was very pretty, worked well, cost a few hundred dollars less than a new PC would have, but had about half the resources. In 2009 I got a Mac Pro for something like $2,500. No power/resource problem with that one. In the 7 years since then, its average yearly cost has gone down to well below that of any other computer I've ever owned. It works incredibly well, it has never needed repair or upgrading, and I feel no pressure to replace it any time soon. As \"user experience\" goes, I've never had a better one. I'll probably have this machine for another four or five years at least. If and when the time comes to get a new one, I'll probably shell out whatever Apple wants for its Pro model at that time. It will be considerably more than I paid for the present one, and it will still be well worth it. As a side benefit, buying a pricey, beautifully engineered computer that lasts 10 to 15 years is much more environmentally friendly than buying an economy-class one that lasts 4 years. ",

Eight years is an eternity in technology years.  Try running W10 on a 2008 PC!  In the amount of time I've had my 2008 MBP, I would have gone through at least 2 PCs.   OSX updates have been free for awhile now.  The included apps have no real Windows equivalent.  And there are a lot of free third-party tools out there created by a devoted and passionate developer community. These things and more make Macs worth the money, and they're not even that much more expensive than similarly spec'd computers of comparable build quality.  ",

You don\u2019t have to think much about how the computer can be made to do what you want; you JUST DO WHAT YOU WANT. With Windows and Wintel HW, that is NOT EVER the case. First you have to worry about how you must make it work on a PC (driver installs, HW compatibility, usability of the SW, etc.) and only after wasting a bunch of time, do you get to doing what you wanted. The ONLY value anyone gets from computers is the latter, and rarely ever the former. The former is useful if you are a computer newbie still learning \u201ceverything\u201d or if you have a job, like IT, where the complexity of Windows/Wintel for end-users is central to your job security - end-users need you and you need Windows to be a cluster fuck to keep your job and keep them needing you.

Let me summarize why it worth the money: 1- Easy to use, yet powerful Operating System, the Mac OS X. (It is for both pros and newbies ). I learned using Mac in just 3 days. 2- Stable and secure (almost no viruses or malware). Aside from rarely occasional crashes of Microsoft Office products, everything else almost never crashes. 3- The quality of the material that a Mac is built with (Aluminum) is way better than than the cheap plastic of other laptops. It is strong, lightweight, and loses heat faster than plastic. 4- The compatibility of the Mac with iPhones, iPads and iCloud is comfortable and trustworthy to use. 5- The Eco-system that Apple has built over years, is really paying off now, I am referring to the Apple store and other services that are Mac-specific. 6-Long Battery life. With an amazingly 7 to 10 hours of battery life depending on your usage. The Mac is totally killing it in this point. And it worths mentioning, that I don't turn off my Mac, I do restart it like once every 3 months or so. Bottomline, it worth the money. ",

It\u2019s not worth buying a top-end PC either. Is it worth paying for an exotic holiday if you\u2019re going to sit in your room watching the TV?

Buying anything else would have meant figuring out how to get my stuff out of a Time Machine backup, and probably a good bit of manually sorting through it, plus time spent settling on substitute apps, working out the best way around features I use constantly (like the spacebar preview, tags, and so on), and then just generally getting settled in until it felt natural. All while also dealing with getting the damage to the house repaired and so on. And this even though I use Windows 7 all day at work, because I do different things there. Even had I been considering switching, it wouldn\u2019t have been the time. ",

The new Windows 8 is fast, fluid and most importantly (to me) BEAUTIFUL. The PC boots up in just 8 seconds, without requiring the extra SSD flash drive. And yes it comes with apps too.  Being an Indian what I really don't like to spend money on the stuffs which can be earned for free. And Apple charges you for many stuffs which you can earn some where else for free. As far as the hardware is concerned, well that simply depends on the manufacturer.  The most beautiful feature with windows now is they can be treated like a tablet. Recently ASUS introduced the 3 in 1 device Windows 8 device, a desktop, a laptop and a tablet (as the keyboard is detachable). So they are designed in a way to consume least battery. If you really have lot of money to spend, go for Windows 8 tablet PC. It's worth buying. Before the advent of Windows 8, if I were to answer, I would have definitely suggested the Mac.

I question the extra cost, but he made it clear that the \u201cextra cost\u201d is only a matter of appearances. He suggested that I choose a Mac, then look for a PC that used comparable quality parts. Suddenly the cost wasn\u2019t so different. For those who have been around computers long enough, you may recall when Apple decided to license their operating system to other builders. Suddenly there were dozens of less expensive \u201cMacs\u201d on the market! There were also dozens of less reliable \u201cMacs\u201d on the market. Funny thing, but when you source cheaper parts to build cheaper computers, you get less reliable computers. That\u2019s why Apple licensing their system to other builders, and why cheaper PCs are less reliable. ",

Some people think PCs are always cheaper, but this is not true This is because most consumer PCs are low end machines.  Apple simply does not make a low end product, Apple's product line starts at the mid range and goes up.  Because Apple Macs are made of quality components they last longer than the low end PCs. So over time a Mac will be the best value for the money and cost less. This does not even count the Free OS X upgrades and the Free software that is included when one buys a Mac.  ",

I am too using the one and still today also I don't regret to spend such a large amount of money on this. TIP:-It will happen that you had read plenty of reviews of Mac but bro forgot everything about them , One can't get the taste of the food by seeing it and the same is with the Macs , you can't get the user experience just by reading the reviews.
