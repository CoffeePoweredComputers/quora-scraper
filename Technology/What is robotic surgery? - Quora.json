            "answer_text": "Robot assisted or robotic surgery is a kind of minimally invasive surgery. The technique involves a computer console controlling the robotic arm mounted surgical instruments. This technology allows surgeons to perform complex surgeries with high level of precision for both motion control and the surgical incision. The incisions are less than 2 inches. Smaller incisions mean that you can heal faster and return to activities more quickly. The advantages of Robotic Surgery are: Reduced pain and discomfort post surgeryFaster recovery time and return to normal activitiesSmaller incisions, resulting in reduced risk of infectionsReduced blood loss and transfusions less than 10%Minimal surgical scarring on the bodyNot everyone is a candidate for Robotic surgery. The concerned surgeons will advise whether you are good candidate for robotic surgery or not, after evaluating the reports and examining you. Factors that affect your candidacy include your age, medical history, and lifestyle, as well as the overall severity of the disease. ",

            "answer_text": "Robotic Surgery, computer-assisted surgery and robotically assisted surgery are terms for technological developments that use robotic systems to aid in surgical procedures. Robotic Assisted Surgery was developed to overcome both the limitations of Minimally Invasive Surgeries and enhance the capabilities of surgeons performing open surgery. The surgeon uses controls in the console to manipulate special surgical instruments that are smaller, as well as more flexible and maneuverable than the human hand. The robot replicates the surgeon's hand movements while minimizing hand tremors. The surgeon thus can operate with enhanced precision, dexterity and control even during the most complex procedures.
