            "answer_text": "Modern SSDs range in speed from about 540 MBps (megabytes per second) to just over 5000 MBps. The sweet spot of price/performance as of the end of 2019 is at about the 3000 MBps rate for both read and write in an M.2 NVMe PCIe format, where a well rated 2TB drive can usually be had for about $215. A farly typical high end RAM at the same time is DDR4-3200 SDRAM. It reads and writes at 25,600 MBps. So comparing typical high end products, RAM is just over 8 times faster than an SSD. These speeds are mind-boggling\u2026 Though it is perhaps much more mind boggling that Google\u2019s Curie undersea cable between the USA and South America is able to move 9,000,000 MBps (9 terabytes per second, or 360 times as much data per second as your fast modern DDR4\u20133200 RAM shuttles to and from your processor) over 10,500 Km between countries. Of course, your RAM probably has lower latency, so there\u2019s that. ",

            "answer_text": "There is this little tool, CrystalDiskMark, which looks like follows on my 500GB 860 EVO :  Same but in GB/s for comparison ease ..  Of course this tool is to benchmark hard disks and SSD\u2019s, not meant to measure RAM.However I configured a 2GB RAM Disk on my system, running the benchmark on that disk shows the following :  The RAM modules are DDR 3 1600MHz powered by an i7\u20134770K at 4GHz Ofcourse RAM should not be measured in how fast it can read and write 1GB of data.I would expect a much higher outcome in how fast RAM can store tiny files like 1 to 5 KB as would happen in every day use, but 1) I don\u2019t know the works of this tool well enough.2) As stated before, it\u2019s a disk measurement tool, not meant for RAM. The tool has an option to run in \u2018Real World Performance\u2019 Which shows :  On the SSD it looks a bit different :  IOPS : Input Output operations Per SecondThis is what RAM is so incredibly good at ..
