You can find the specifics regarding the number of businesses and how much they took out in loans in the FY 2015 Agency Financial Report (AFR). For example, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll learn from the 2015 financial report: In FY 2015, the SBA supported nearly $33 billion in lending through our 7(a) and 504 loan programs. These loans supported over 680,000 jobs across the country. Hope this helps your search. -Jared ",
