            "answer_text": "THIS IS JUST GOING OFF WHAT I LEARNED ON THE INTERNET AND PERSONAL OPINION I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN CYBER SECURITY EXCEPT FOR THE YEARS OF HANDS ON EXPERIENCE. Every phone can be hacked it just depends on the version of phone you have and what software update you have. If it\u2019s up to date it can take a while before it\u2019s hacked. For example iPhones are notoriously hard to hack especially if you have one of the newer ones and of course have a passcode. It got so hard that the Government of USA requested that apple add a backdoor to every iPhone so they could get into \u201ccriminals\u201d phones (obviously they said no). But it just goes to show you it cannot happen overnight. What you also have to factor in is if you have access to the phone or not. If they have access and you don\u2019t again it will depend on what I stated before. But if you have access to the phone it will depend on if you have antivirus and if you access dodgy websites, emails, links, etc. Now if you have information on websites or god forbid the cloud it would be extremely easier for them to get access to your phone if they manage to get their hands on it. Which is another good point that shows everything can be hacked it\u2019s just a matter of time. There are blackhats and whitehats (good and bad hackers) which work around the clock for good or malicious reasons to gain access to whatever they are working on for a list of reasons which is why you always want to educate yourself on internet security, sounds childish but it\u2019s no joke when it comes to this day and age which is why the demand for cyber security is increasing because with how fast the internet and technology is advancing so is the amount of people who will get interested in it which means more information to steal.Again this is just going off what I learned I\u2019m a cyber security fan haven't taken any courses yet but plan on it.
