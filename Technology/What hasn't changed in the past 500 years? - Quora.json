            "answer_text": "Social inequality. Egalitarian society remains a dream. From the simplest to the most complex societies some sort of social inequality has always existed. Especially it took momentum after the \u201cinstitutionalisation of private properties\u201d came into play and its legitimacy further augmented the interest of the ruling minority. It led to the emergence of two classes respectively. Ownership class andNon-ownership class.From the feudal times till now, there has been an unparalleled unequal distribution of power and prestige. In feudal societies the class relationship was that of \u2018Lords' and \u2018serfs'; in ancient societies: 'Masters and slaves'; in capitalist industrial societies : \u2018bourgeoisie\u2019 and \u2018proletariat\u2019. It has persisted since then,; the form of relationship/mode of life has been switched but the concept remains more or less same. In the western industrial society, the social classes have been replaced by a hierarchy of unequal positions. Though earlier the basis of social inequality used to be ascribed now it's largely based on achievement criteria or meritocracy. But it doesn't come without loopholes. As per Melvin.M Tumin, \u201cOccupational groups often use their power to restrict access to their positions\u201d. Thus now there is an unbroken continuum of occupational statuses which command varying degrees of prestige and economic reward. In the early 1900s, whites used to claim biological superiority over blacks and used to defend this biological argument of racial stratification using some scientific evidence on intellectual performance neglecting the fact that they had not been exposed to education, power, or a better environment for a long period of time, Thus even their IQ tests are considered biased. The same applies to the stratification based on the traditional Hindu Varna system based on the notion of 'ritual purity' which clearly manifests that this has been a tactic by the dominant groups to justify their prestigious positions in the society. Therefore the inequalities persist and the dream of an egalitarian society is yet to be achieved. What are the ideal conditions to nourish the environment for an egalitarian society remain a topic of debate. But one cannot do away with the fact that most of the inqualities have a social \u2014 not biological \u2014 basis. ",

            "answer_text": "I love your question it is wonderful and I think the answer is very important. The answer is simple HUMAN NATURE. This has profound influences on how we do things so be careful. Most modern society problems arise from people failing to know this one fact. I don\u2019t intend to go into the details here but if you see a solution to a problem and it relies on human nature to be changed, it will end in a mess. It is also the counter to the argument that the US Constitution is out of date. The US Constitution was written understanding and working with human nature. Adjusting it for supposed modern times is dangerous. Now I will give you a puzzle question: What does mankind do that the other animals on this planet do not do? I have looked into this in depth and concluded that it is cooking. Maybe you have other ideas. ",
