            "answer_text": "I will narrow the focus of my answer based on the fact that you tagged your question with Generation X and Millennial generation. The tail end of Generation X and the first years of the Millennial generation really represent the years of transition in technology. They didn\u2019t experience smart phones the entire time of their younger years but they did experience an \u2018analog-to-digital\u2019 experience. Those younger Millennials experienced the birth of the smart phone and reasonable access to the Internet. Along the way, you had visionary Baby Boomers and older Generation X creating all of those technologies that in turn because the platforms and tools used for creation of mobile internet and social media. Unless you fit into the visionary group as a Baby Boomer or older Generation X, jumping on board was a lot harder or something you didn\u2019t quite get. Likewise, those younger experienced adaptions of technologies to work better for non-technology people, and also interactively shape and by shaped by the technologies and services that evolved. If you are of an older generation and you weren\u2019t among the visionaries, chances are good that you either didn\u2019t jump on board or you just enjoy the bits that fit with your lifestyle and age - especially since things like screen size, form factors, accessibility and the like are far worse on mobile devices than they are on established platforms like the desktop computer. The mobile consumer focus, with a far larger and fully adapted younger target market means that younger generations are more interactively targeted, satisfied and at ease. ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to death and taxes, there seems to be two certainties in life: 1. Young people will more than easily embrace and adapt to change; and 2. Old people will whine about the spoiled \"youth of today\". Been there, seen/done both. In my youth, our nation's long history of segregation was still strongly fighting back against the Civil Rights Act, and interracial marriage was still strongly frowned upon (by both sides). Divorce was extremely rare (our elementary school class had kids whose parents died or divorced and the rest of us were unanimous about preferring the death of a parent to divorce), and women's reproductive options remained right out of the Nancy Reagan playbook. All of the above radically changed within the span of a decade or so. The social change we experienced, as groundbreaking as it was (although largely common sense today), pales in comparison to the technical changes (computers, modern medicine, the moon landings, etc.). My generation's current difficulties with adapting to modern changes are almost certainly not caused by the fact that we haven't seen much change during the course of our lives, so what might be the explanation? So while I won't give you a lot of specific examples, perhaps a bit of explanation might help? Most of us spend the early stages of our lives trying to learn (and earn) how we might fit in. Having expended so much time and effort, we don't easily let go of our hard earned \"knowledge\" (hold on to this thought because we'll come back to it later). Then one day you meet the right person, and the rest of the world seems to get placed on hold while nature takes its course, and effectively hijacks the main focus of your existence for the next three decades (marriage, kids, college, more marriage, stepkids, grandkids, and what you have to do in order to pay for everything, etc.). Then one day the kids are gone, and you look in the mirror and barely recognize the old face staring back at you\u2014 and now life really begins (again). Sadly, there's no school available to cover all of the aspects of pop culture that you missed over the past 30 years so there's a substantial hole in your history of life experience that largely prevents you from gracefully picking-up where you left off (a few decades ago). So you're faced with a choice; dive-in and try to drive your old brain in the \"fast lane\" (and suffer the consequences\u2014 noting the mayhem that can result when some old coot is cluelessly driving his old 65 Chevy at 50mph in the fast lane of the freeway), or go back inside the house and enjoy your frozen dinner while watching reruns on the TV. The right answer probably rests somewhere in-between the two extremes, but suffice it to say that our broader lack of modern social context, and our stubborn tendency to default back to our comfort/expertise with how things were done \"back in the day\", can hinder our embrace of modern innovation (along with our failing fine motor coordination, eyesight, etc.). However, when we finally do get around to it, the results can actually be kind of comical (if not occasionally tragic). Case in point my ninety four year old grandfather getting a ticket for driving 120mph out on a desert highway. An ex-hot rodder, he had picked-up an Acura Integra RS in a trade for an old (1941) truck. He was so impressed by its \"modern\" handling and acceralation that he wanted to wring her out a bit (he was spotted and clocked by a CHP airplane). The \"old man\" sports car sitting in my garage reveals that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. ",
