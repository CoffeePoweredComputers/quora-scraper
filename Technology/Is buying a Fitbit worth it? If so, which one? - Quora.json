            "answer_text": "I really enjoyed my Fitbit wristband when I had it. I initially got a Fitbit Flex as a present, and thought it could be interesting to use.  Initially, I used all the functions including sleep monitor etc. But after a month or so, I started slacking off. It was simply too much hassle to register each time I went to bed, and each time I got up. So I stopped using that function. I stopped using it after some four months, and after a while I borrowed my brothers Fitbit Surge. Now this was much simpler to use, and I actually enjoyed it for quite a while.  My only gripe with it is, that if you really want to use it you have to wear it almost all the time. If you wear it almost all the time, you\u2019re much more likely to be one of those who develop a rash or an allergic reaction to the fabric. I\u2019m one of those lucky someones. After having used it nonstop for a month or maybe two, I got a reaction. From one day till the next, the skin underneath it looked like it had been burned and started itching like mad. I took it off and waited two weeks, put it on, and the next day same result. So I haven\u2019t used it since. But I definitely liked the newer model a lot better. Just the fact that it automatically registered my sleep patterns, instead of having to be told whether I was awake or not, was a huge improvement. My advice, if you want a Fitbit wristband, opt for the more expensive models. Do some research and find out which model fits your needs. It might very well be a better use of your money to give that little extra. I\u2019d rather pay more for a product that I\u2019ll use, than less for one I\u2019ll toss away in frustration after a month. I\u2019d probably be leaning towards either the Fitbit Surge or the Fitbit Charge HR models\u2026 but I don\u2019t have any idea if they got some newer models. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a Fitbit 2 I think, it looks like the photos a few answers down. I have always worn a metal link type band and didn\u2019t care doer the band that came with it. It had a band with holes and a little catch like a belt. My personal opinion was that it looked cheesy. I coworker bought a black steel one with a magnetic catch. It was around $15 on the internet. I love it. The bands with holes would be too tight or too loose. When mine dies I am considering an Apple only because it has a lot of features but can link to my iPhone and use that instead if you are a certain distance away. I get notifications on it and it\u2019s pretty good and $150 beats $400, but I\u2019m a gadget kind of guy. I will use the Fitbit until it dies. There is a watch similar to the Apple for under$100 in the internet, but if I don\u2019t need it, I don\u2019t buy it. ",
