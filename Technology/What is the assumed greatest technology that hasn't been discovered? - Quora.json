            "answer_text": "\u201cGreatest\u201d implies that nothing could surpass it, so that would have to be the science/tech allowing us mastery over all forces in this universe and, if possible, the multiverse itself. If you\u2019re really asking about science or tech that we believe is attainable but haven\u2019t quite found a practical way to implement, there\u2019s a lot\u2026. Functional Immortality - There is really no practical reason that a body that can grow and repair itself for years can\u2019t continue the process forever. However, we\u2019re wired with a self-destruct system that causes us to age and degrade over time. Synthetic/machine Sentience - I don\u2019t refer to this as artificial intelligence, because AI has come to mean something else in the commercial lexicon. With sufficient computing power, we should be able to virtually emulate the natural processes that resulted in the emergence of sentience even if we have to do it through brute force trial-and-error. An engineered sentience is probably a lot less likely unless/until we have a better theoretical understanding of how sentience emerges and functions. Mastery of the human genome (and then the genome of every living thing) - We\u2019re just scratching the surface, but it\u2019s just a matter of time. Along similar lines is enough of an understanding of how DNA/RNA works to be able to effectively model and simulate any changes and predict the results. Organic/Biological Nanomachines - I don\u2019t think that mechanical nanobots are where the real action is going to be, but with mastery of genetics will come an ability to create biological machines that can do similar things more efficiently. Viruses that destroy cancer or reset telomeres? Bacteria that can deliver targeted drugs and treatments? Synthetic spiders that eat rust and extrude metallic webbing? Nature makes amazingly powerful machines and we should really look at stealing the designs, hacking them and reusing them. AR/VR - A lot of our consumer tech is focused on delivering content and experiences to one or more people. I think that we\u2019re getting very close to individual experiences surpassing group venues (we\u2019d still need to improve or even create the group interaction, but we\u2019re getting close). More people are consuming content on small screens, ear buds and headsets, etc. We\u2019re going to get to a point where the personal experience is far superior to movie theaters, live concerts, etc. Silent discos are a precursor, but it\u2019s just a matter of time before personal oculars, AR and VR interfaces replace movie theater screens, concert stages, billboards and advertising and anything else that can be delivered more effectively direct-to-consumer. Instead of a big screen TV in your home (or even artwork), you\u2019d have blank walls as a VR/AR canvas for you and your guests and the experience would be a shared digital overlay. Further out there, but game changing\u2026 An understanding of gravity and the technology to use/manipulate it. Practical nucleosynthesis - A surprisingly large portion of the population seems to think that 3d printing is already at this level, but we\u2019re not even close. The ability to literally create any element or new material from some sort of base stock would change everything from agriculture to space colonization. I don\u2019t think that practical faster than light travel or information exchange is really possible within the current laws of physics. We need to find ways to cheat and circumvent the laws of physics by warping spacetime. But that still leaves us with a lot of practical temporal issues between the travelers and the rest of the universe. My hope is that there\u2019s some practical way to poke tunnels or holes through from one area of space to another. Along similar lines, teleportation that relies on disassembly and reassembly of matter is a non-starter. Tearing apart a living creature is murder even if you build a copy at the other end. As for non-living matter, if you have the tech to reassemble it, you have the same tech to make it at the destination without having to tear something apart at the other end. Viable teleportation would need to be some sort of practical shortcut or portal to be of any value. Transferring consciousness - We don\u2019t need to understand it if we can just find a way to copy it into something capable of hosting it. This might be the ticket to immortality (machine upload or just a stack of cloned bodies), synthetic sentience (you could copy a fledgling mind from a newborn, a dolphin, etc. and let it evolve as a machine) and teleportation (if you could receive data and load up a clone or synthetic body at the other end, you could keep the original on ice and just load the updated version back when you\u2019re done. It would probably pass the sniff-test for people worried about the soul and personhood as long as the original was the only recognized \u201cperson\u201d.) ",
