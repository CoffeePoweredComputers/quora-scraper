            "answer_text": "Satellites for photographic imaging, like the GeoEye-1 are about 675km above the Earth. They use telephoto lenses to get their view as close as possible, getting a resolution these days where one pixel of the image is about 10cm by 10 cm of ground area. It really doesn't matter at that point what frequency of light you are looking at. Visual light, infrared, ultraviolet. That's just a matter of making the sensor of your camera sensitive to that frequency of light. People already do that with regular DSLRs. The resolution might drop, but not your ability to just shoot the picture. But the resolution that satellites get is not sufficient for most aerial thermal imaging uses. Instead planes are used. Takes a look at this image and the article it comes from:  Revealed: Up to 6,000 'beds in sheds' set-up by rogue landlords are found by spy plane's thermal image camera  This was captured by a plane, not a satellite.

            "answer_text": "There are some differences between cameras. For example, ultraviolet is blocked by ordinary glass, so some materials used for visible light photography are not suitable. The spacecraft itself can get warm, so applications that are noise sensitive might require additional cooling. There are also the usual issues concerning the space environment, such as being tolerant to more extreme temperature swings and being rugged enough to survive the G force and vibration during the ride to orbit. But really, it's much the same as photography on Earth. Except it's way cooler, of course. ",
