            "answer_text": "All the resources of South America where they were, primarily along the coast of what is now Chile and several hundred miles inland. They divided the entire coast into three sections. Fishing was only allowed in one sector at a time rotating every year. That gave two thirds of the coast two years to replenish. For a thousand years they did this and never ran out of fish or sea food. Starvation and poverty did not exist in the Inca Lands. Starvation and poverty were introduced by the Spaniards when they killed off all the Inca government workers and leaders. ",

There were large quantities of bronze, gold and silver in the Inca Empire and a lot of it was used for ceremonial purposes.
