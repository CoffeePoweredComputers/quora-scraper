            "answer_text": "Well, to be frank it doesn\u2019t. All the smartphone manufacturing companies have made a fool of the just social media savvy photoenthusiast. Ask any photographer or a dslr armed photo enthusiast. He/She will tell you that a 10 MP dslr camera is mile sahead of a 108 MP smartphone camera. Megapixel count is never the basis of good quality pictures. The only time megapixels actually do matter is when you zoom in or when you crop it or for that matter when you want to take print out pictures. The average smartphone customer uses the camera just for social media consumption. So, it doesn\u2019t really make a difference. So, on what does image quality depend upon? Why can\u2019t smatphone cameras match the quality offered by dslrs. Ok, for starters, photography is all about capturing light. The camera sensor does that work. Larger the sensor, more is the light captured and better is the image quality. The more the number of pixels you cramp it in a sensor, the more the pixel reduce in size. So, basically if sensor size is same and the number of pixels increase, you are actually decreasing the light capturing capacity of individual pixel. You must have already wondered how come smartphone cameras give really good pictures with such a tiny camera sensor. Well, the used software algorithms to process the image. In a dslr you get just the raw data, you have to process the image yourself. Also, most smartphones use a technique called \u2018pixel binning\u2019 wherein data from a number of pixels is combined to form a single large pixel. So, if a 48MP smatphone camera is using pixel binning, you are actually getting output as 12 MP images(4 pixels binned to form 1 pixel). Next, is the aperture size. Aperture is a tiny opening in the lens which lets in light to be captured by the sensor. More the aperture size, more the light captured. But, the camera will really differentiate the amount of light coming form the scene. For instance, objects in the foreground will captured well than objects in background. This effect is called background blurring or bokeh mode in dslr parlance or portrait mode in smartphone. This effect is now created by smartphone cameras by using a secondary lens for calculating the distance between the object and the background. It then applies algorithms accordingly to give the desired effect. And I must say smartphone cameras produce this effect really well. Another importing thing which effects image quality is Shutter speed. Shutter opens and closes to control the amount of light entering the camera. The longer the duration the shutter remains open, the more is the light captured. However for slower shutter speeds, you really require good steady hands, and this is where Optical Image Stabilisation comes into play. However, OIS has capability to compensate just for minor shakes and vibrations. So, the best bet while shooting long shutter speeds is a tripod. Last but not the least is your ISO. It is the sensitivity of the camera sensor to light. More the iso, more is the sensor sensitive to light, which means more light is captured. However, Increase in iso causes lots of noise(pixelation). So, whotography is all about achieving a balance between Aperture-Shutterspeed-ISO. Now You might wonder that you never see these things in smartphone camera. Well, if you open the manual mode, you can see them. The only thing smartphone cameras cannot change is its aperture which is fixed. ISO and shutter speed you can change to a great extent. Any photographer would understand, photography is real when you decide the output of the camera and not the camera deciding itself.(auto mode on all cameras and smartphone cameras). Hope it helps you understand. ",

            "answer_text": "1st off all i wanna say, these 48cam, 64mp cam & higher mp smartphone cameras are mainly used by the companies for marketing. It's true that when u go to buy a smartphone 1stly you will be fooled by this mp count , u will think more number means more quality. You can see the cameras of iPhone which is 13mp, which produces more stunning images as compare to those highly mega pixel cameras, even in Google smartphones(Google pixel) u can see the qualities in image. The reality is, if your smartphone has better image stabilization, then photos which u shoot, those will comes with professional quality. So finally the answer of your question is no, 48mp smartphone camera doesn't work exactly like 48mp, but it's true that it gives you high sized images. Hope i'm successful to clear your doubt. ",
