            "answer_text": "Steam engine has the highest efficiency of all kind of engine, theoretically. In fact early engines are steam engine. But efficiency is not everything, power-to-weight ratio and torque is actually more important for cars. Steam engine is extremely huge, early steam cars only produce power equivalent to todays small motorcycle. Considering the weight of it, whatever power it generated is just enough to move the engine. It has huge boiler and huge condenser and huge water coolant tank. It is not practical at all. Later, stirling engine were invented that is much lighter and then otto engine then diesel engine. Todays fuel injection engine incorporate both otto and diesel engine principle. Steam engine requires almost half-hour to start, the power output could not be suddenly increase or decrease, that is another big problem. Another problem is power loss at low rev speed, both otto and diesel engine perform exceptionally well at low rev, hence higher torque. ",

            "answer_text": "We did, or at least used to have steam lorries. They out performed diesel lorries but were seen as old fashioned so people swapped to diesel lorries. At the risk of going slightly off subject the swiss rebuilt a steam locomotive running it on light oil instead of coal. They made loads of alterations to it and the documentary about it said that it was cheaper to run than electric and out performed diesel. There are other examples but the problem with steam power, be it cars lorries or locomotives is its labour intensive and more expensive. ",
