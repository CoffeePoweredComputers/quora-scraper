A nuke, no matter how powerful, is simply a spear that creates a small sun. Writing, for all it's complexity, is simply cave-man finger painting evolved. The wheel is simply overrated in it's effect. Not only did the progenitors of Native Americans not have the wheel, the Mayan, Incan and Aztec Empires built, well, empires without it. Just because the empires of Europe and Asia weren't tough enough to do so without the wheel doesn't make it \u201cworld changing\u201d. It was Eurasia and Africa changing. That just makes the wheel a glorified crutch. Technology is defined by Merriam-Webster as 1(b)- a capability given by the practical application of knowledge. Our capability for advancement as a species started by tapping certain stones together to make tools and fire. Without the ability to hunt for the extra protein needed to build our big brains, or grind grains and other plants to better access the sugars to fuel our big brains, or the ability to cook our food to better take advantage of our joke of a digestive system, we would still be running from lions on the savannah. Without tapping and shaping stones, nothing we have today would exist because we likely wouldn't exist in our current form. ",

Imagine what the world would have been like without it. The wheel helped move whole civilizations, gave rise to faster transportation and a means to move goods to market. The wheel led to more efficiency, including the ability to wage war in distant lands, haul back booty to the conqueror and accumulate wealth and power. Of course, there are drawbacks. ",

Sure, there\u2019s boats but how do you reach inland easily where there\u2019s no rivers? It allowed people to move around the world easily, allowing them to escape war, disease, pestilence and famine. Generations of communities have loaded up what they owned into wheeled vehicles and moved. Can you imagine trade without carts using wheels or how war would have been much different without the chariot through to the tank? ",
