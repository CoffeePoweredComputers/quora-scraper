            "answer_text": "Yeah you can certainly use the internet even if you don\u2019t have a data pack. You can use the Wi-Fi service from your ISP and use the internet or can use the dial up connection and use internet. But almost half of the world recommends Wi-Fi for surfing as your data pack expires early if you use it much. Dial up is ignored because it has a very less speed-56 kbps or less and has to be dialed up every time you use the internet. Wi-fi has a speed of at least 256 kbps or above. This is the way you can use internet without a data pack. ",
