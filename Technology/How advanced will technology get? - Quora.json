            "answer_text": "In the Philippines, we are big on texting on mobile phones. It came to a point where we were passing load to each other because we ran out. A teacher then mentioned, in science class, that we don\u2019t know exactly what the extent of technology is. We were given the same example above. When before, you could only get load from a top-up card and have to manually enter it on your phone, to now, being able to ask for load from other people. She, my teacher, speculated that \u201cwho knows, some time in the future, we\u2019ll not just be passing load to each other, but battery charge.\u201d Although it seems impossible at a specific time, it might not truly be impossible. I know, it was far-fetched at that time, but it gave me a concept of how technology can advance. That is to say, infinite. Some technology may take some time, but I know of hovercrafts/hover motorcycles (search for Scorpion 3) being invented today that are just waiting to be mass produced. What we see in movies, like the Avengers or any futuristic movie, like back to the future, may just be decades away. That\u2019s a short time, when you think that the invention of cellphones was two to three decades ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology always advances when there is always someone to work on improving that. It doesn\u2019t improve by itself. If nobody works on a particular field, technology actually worsen. For example, VR technology is in existence from early 1950\u2019s but it wasn\u2019t out for customers\u2019 reach. It only went on becoming a consumer product when Oculus and Google took the technology and improved into a mobile-compartible device. So here, the technology was is a state of stasis for nearly 60 years before reaching people. It only got advanced when someone worked on that technology. ",

Think god.You will be able to create your own universe and be the god of that universe, manipulating both time and matter the way you want. This is how far it will get.The question is what \"you\" will mean by that time. Maybe all of our minds will merge into a single being (not my preference, as I find diversity important). Maybe we will randomly merge and re-separate consciousness. ",

Its been doing so for a couple of centuries and the advent of the internet and wider connections of people on the planet, is making it faster. Reflect on the technology of just 2 generations ago, now reason on how it will be within 2 future generations, with an accelerated expansion. ",
