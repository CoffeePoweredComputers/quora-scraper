            "answer_text": "20 EMISSIONS REDUCTION BEHAVIOURS Here are twenty things to do to help combat climate change and reduce emissions of CO2. Some of this is still quite expensive or otherwise difficult to achieve, but it\u2019s becoming cheaper and easier all the time. It\u2019s generally far cheaper to operate any cleantech equipment than conventional systems over time because lifecycle costs are lower. Here we go: 1. Use light emitting diode light bulbs (LEDs). These are now almost as cheap as incandescent bulbs but consume only 15% of the electricity. 2. Replace your fossil electricity supply with renewable electricity. This is often a simple subscription option with your utility. In New York, ConEdison offers Independent power producers (IPP) access to the grid. Many, like Verde Energy, use run-of-the-river or wind. 3. Replace your gas cooking range with an induction range. While still more expensive, chefs say they are better than gas and they use less power. It\u2019s like a cooking LED. 4. Another household appliance that can soon be replaced is the air conditioner. New liquid desiccant machines offer the same cooling service but for less than 40% of the energy. 5. Plant many trees. Tree seeds can be bought on Amazon for pennies, and you can select local species. If everyone on the planet planted 132 trees each, we\u2019d have reached the trillion-tree target that studies show will take out a decades\u2019 worth of all the carbon mankind has generated. If like we do, you live in the city and have no access to appropriate land to plant on, the best thing to do is choose an offset mechanism that plants trees for you. It\u2019s a good idea to download the Plant for the Planet app. https://www.plant-for-the-planet.org \u2026and the Global Forest Fund can help for example: https://www.gff.global It must be remembered, however, that trees planted badly can have negative impacts on indigenous species, ecosystems and water supplies. 6. Replace your internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle with an electrical vehicle (EV). The acceleration will blow your mind and you can get 3 miles to the kilowatt hour. If you have 5 kilowatts of solar you might generate more than 50 miles of distance a day. The average US based car drives 21 miles a day so only needs 4 hours of sunshine. There are at least two cars that integrate solar panels, the Sion and the Lightning in Europe, that exceed this distance with their own battery charging each day. Supporting infrastructure is growing fast with EV charging points becoming ubiquitous. You can tell anyone who criticizes you for still using coal electricity to power your car, that with 60% efficiency of the EV, you are still diluting the pollution per mile enormously over gasoline. 7. Install solar power. It\u2019s 81% less expensive since 2010 and getting cheaper all the time. Solar installers will pay for it in exchange for a per kWh subscription, or you can pay for an installation yourself. Either way, this will halve your electricity cost over 20 years. 8. Install an air sourced heat pump to provide all your winter heating and hot water by extracting the heat from the cold outdoors. This is the same as your fridge extracting heat from its freezing interior. Some units can even work as A/C in the summer too. 9. Install insulation in your house. Remember, if you are at the North Pole at its coldest point but safely inside a perfectly insulated space, your own body heat would warm it up. 10. Exploit passive systems to help your house find cooling and heating. Use winter solar greenhouse effect and heat exchangers. Breezes, evaporation vessels and updraft chimneys ventilate and cool an interior. 11. If you own fossil fuel or other carbon emitting companies like cement in your equity portfolio, sell them and buy into faster growing sustainable energy companies. 12. If you must drive an internal combustion engine (ICE) car, use biofuels, which have lower CO2 emissions. Soon you will be able to buy carbon neutral gasoline made from plant cellulose as well. 13. Don\u2019t fly. It\u2019s a big source of emissions unless you offset and until the fuel that planes consume is carbon neutral, which is happening in a small expensive way currently but will take over eventually, and, as batteries improve, electric flying, initially just short haul, is going to be more common. A round trip flight from San Francisco to Paris, France will produce 1.25 tons of carbon emissions per passenger, more than 25% of the emissions the average person worldwide produces from all their activities in a year. The UN Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme, signed in 2018 in Montreal, caused all international flights to be offset by the airline so that passengers don\u2019t have to, but you can still offset your own domestic flights. 14. Audit your own carbon emissions. You can hire experts or simply fill out a questionnaire online to assess how much carbon your family produces. Here are some useful websites: https://co2.myclimate.org/en/ https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/ https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx 15. Offset your carbon emissions. Efficient carbon offset groups will be transparent about their methods. Here are some entities which can offset your CO2 for a price: https://www.cooleffect.org/content/donate https://sustainabletravel.org/our-work/carbon-offsets/calculate-footprint/ https://offset.earth/ 16. In a global world, food which is often seasonally grown, can come from distant locations. It\u2019s not just the air or ship freight emissions that are bad though, sometimes local distribution by diesel truck from only a few miles can be worse. Also food has a lifecycle that includes planting, tending, harvesting, processing, packaging and distribution. Distribution, even by plane from far parts of the world, can be just a small part of the emissions profile of any food. Reduce meat in your diet. 86% of global agricultural land is dedicated to animal husbandry. A 20% drop in global meat consumption would imply an almost doubling of land available for human consumed grains and vegetables. Talk about food security! It is also a money saver and if you grow your own families\u2019 vegetables, that\u2019s the best. 17. Don\u2019t buy or throw out single-use plastics, unless they are biodegradable. If you have them, recycle. Select products with less packaging or which have environmentally benign packaging. Also, pick sustainable products like soap products by groups like Seventh Generation, which are made from plants and are benign when flushed into the world\u2019s wastewater systems. It\u2019s crazy to think of but Fuji water distributes its plastic water bottles tens of thousands of miles, when local water is really indistinguishable from it. 18. Vote for politicians brave enough to reduce emissions, scrap fossil fuel subsidies and stand for the planet and thereby for humans. 19. Think of doing Thanksgiving by Facetime! Don\u2019t travel but use a big screen and group meeting software produced by many companies including: Zoom, BlueJeans, UberConference, RingCentral Meetings, Microsoft Teams, Webex Meetings, Skype, GoToMeeting, and Join.me. 20. Help to spread the idea that addressing climate change is not a huge, expensive unnecessary burden for humanity, but is instead the biggest economic opportunity we\u2019ve been presented, which is totally true and far easier to commit to.

            "answer_text": "Carbon Footprint means the amount of carbon molecules you release other than the natural process of breathing. The extra amount leads to Green house effect or Global Warming. You need to reduce it so that your children or grand children could see the earth in the same way you are able to because global warming leads melting of Glaciers, Change in weather patterns and even migration of people due to shortage of food and water. Use electricity wisely, Don\u2019t keep devices on standby.Use LED lights and devices with excellent energy ratings.(4 star or 5 star)Live near your workplace. (Decreases your fuel usage)Take public transport as much as possible.( Fossils are major contributors of carbon footprint)Stop eating meat. (Cows release methane (CH4) which is 23 times more dangerous than carbon dioxide, Beef cultivation leads to 12% of total Green house gas emission, Even switching to chicken will bring it down by 10%.)Buy Local grown fruits and vegetables.Don\u2019t use deodorants or perfumes or use them in a controlled fashion.Make sure your next car is an electric car (if you don\u2019t already own one)Try and install Solar cells at your house or workplace if you are an entrepreneur. (Its still not cost effective, But rather than splurging on unnecessary items, it will be a good investment eventually)Don\u2019t send unnecessary e-mails, try and communicate in other manner maybe verbal, if not possible try and put as much information on one email than sending 10 short emails. ( every 65 emails sent is equivalent of driving a gas car 0.6 miles)Stop eating Doritos, Frito Lays etc. Look at the items you buy, if its prepared in Palm Oil, try an avoid. (Palm Oil is one of the major contributors of vanishing forests)",
