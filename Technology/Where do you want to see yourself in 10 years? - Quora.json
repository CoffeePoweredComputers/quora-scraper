I\u2019d like to be under the sea in an octopus\u2019s garden with Aquaman\u2026 But failing that, the dream plan is to be living somewhere close to the sea and the Forrest. Somewhere to build a retreat for the broken, the beaten, and the damned. Somewhere for them to heal their body, mind, and spirit. Somewhere they can hopefully find peace within themselves, by finding peace in nature. I want it to be a place where they feel safe to just be. Somewhere for their families to take a break also. I\u2019m not talking about the stereotypical Hippy commune. Firstly, I not very Hippy. I love learning about all things esoteric, but I take what I need from them and integrate the knowledge a little more practically. Secondly, I know way too many Hippies that have lost the true essence of what it is to be a Hippy. They spend most of their lives self-medicating, doing every enlightening, vibrational lifting, Kundalini cleansing experience they can find, in the hope that one day they will wake up and their lives will be perfect. Problem is, they don\u2019t put what they have learned into practice in their every day, so nothing changes and so they try the next big thing. In ten years time, I will be a practicing Psychologist. This means I can help fix the head, clear the mind, organise the thoughts, reconcile their past, blah, blah blah\u2026 But I also know how important the body is in all of this. You can\u2019t have a healthy mind without a healthy body. This is why I want the ocean and the forest; exercise that doesn\u2019t look or feel like exercise. This also leads to nutrition, so I will have a veggie patch/garden of course. Where they will be taught food prep and nutrition. Having been a Veterinary Nurse, I also understand the healing qualities of animals, especially in those on the Autism Spectrum; there will be a menagerie. Now I just need to convince the Government to back it, because it is these people who least can afford this treatment. There will also be if I haven\u2019t found him already, an opening for an Aquaman who cares about the less fortunate, loves animals, enjoys adventures, swimming, riding, hiking, long walks on the beach, meditation, Pina Colada\u2019s and getting caught in the rain. Will preferably have previous experience in controlling Psychotic Redheads. What am I doing now to achieve this? I am currently studying a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Psychology, with a minor in Indigenous Knowledge and then specialising in Autism Spectrum Disorder, ADHD, drugs, addiction, suicide prevention, sports psychology and nutrition. All of which have had a pronounced effect on my life at one stage or another. I will finish these studies in 5 years from which I will go out into the big wide world and do the practical side until know I can fulfill my ten-year dream. ",

            "answer_text": "(Disclaimer, this is all what I want to happen, and most likely, not much will ever really happen.) I\u2019ll be 23. Fresh out of college. I\u2019ll have gone to Juilliard and emerged with a Bachelor of Music. Right away, I\u2019ll move to New York City and start performing covers in small venues, to make enough money to get by. One night, after I finish a particularly good set, a semifamous talent scout will approach me while I\u2019m cleaning up the stage and offer me a record deal. I will, of course, accept, and thus will begin my career as a singer. I\u2019ll be famous but not too famous, so that I won\u2019t get recognized too often and I\u2019ll still be able to settle down to have a family. In a few years\u2019 time, probably when I\u2019m around 30 or 35, my contract will expire and I\u2019ll either stay in NYC or move back to my hometown. I\u2019ll scout for nearby positions as a choir director, have a job interview, and get the job. One day, I\u2019ll meet a wonderful woman, or man, or person, fall in love, and start dating them. Eventually, we\u2019ll get married, and adopt two cats. Maybe we\u2019ll have a child. Maybe we\u2019ll adopt a child. I don\u2019t know. When I\u2019m somewhere between the ages of 55 and 70, I\u2019ll retire from my job and my partner will retire from theirs. We\u2019ll use the money I made from my performing career to buy a lovely little house in Atlanta, Georgia, where we\u2019ll live during the cold winter months that the northern parts of America don\u2019t take too kindly to. Our children, if we have any, will go on to follow their dreams and be successful in the field they\u2019ve always dreamed of going into. Our cats will have long been gone, but we\u2019ll have adopted a new one, who we\u2019ll have pampered with love and showered with affection until they, too, have passed away. Now we\u2019ll have one last kitten, hopefully a calico, who stays with us until we pass away in our sleep at ages 97 and 98, just past the turn of the century. The calico, if still alive, will either go to our lifelong friends or to our children, if we have any. It will live out its days happily, also dying in its sleep after having lived a long and fulfilling life. There will be no legal complications involving my and my partner\u2019s will, and after we\u2019re gone, all of the lives we\u2019ve touched during ours will be better for the time they have known us. -fin-  Welp, that got funeral-y, fast. Anyway, I do know all this sounds very hopeful and a little na\u00efve. Again, this is all what I want to happen and how I want it to happen, and probably not much of this is likely to occur in real life. So\u2026 yeah, there you have it! :) - Your favorite nerd, (Not That) Katie ",
