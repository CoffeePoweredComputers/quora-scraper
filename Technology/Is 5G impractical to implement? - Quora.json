And in some territories I think 5G in the sense of consumer thinking about it will be impractical to implement in a cost effective manner, but this is nothing new in telecoms and I doubt it will be a major problem long term in most locations ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on the country you live in and if your willing to pay a higher price tag. If you live in China and can pay the price: Yes, but if you wait, a larger variety of 5G phones will be avalible If you live in Europe and can pay the price: Sure, but only if your in highly dense populations, and waiting will also give better options If you live in the US: Definitely not yet, 5G is hardly in the US and buying a 5G phone would make 5G pointless. Only buy 5G if you desperately need the speed. ",
