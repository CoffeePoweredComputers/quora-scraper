            "answer_text": "Most things that will stay and will not change are things that people depend upon and love already that are not technology. Some examples of things that are not going to change in the next 10 years are: Porn - Dr. Perry Cox of Scrubs put this very nicely: \u201cI\u2019m fairly sure that if they took porn off the internet, there\u2019d only be one website left and it be called BRING BACK THE PORN.\u201dSex - Pretty sure this one will never be able to go away. No matter what you do to people they will always find a way to get their porn and get their sex.Entertainment - The Entertainment industry has been alive as long as people have been able to stop worrying about survival even for a second, and it will only grow the more freedom we have to ourselves.Drugs & Alcohol - Most people will never face their problems and would rather face the bottom of a bottle or the end of another trip just to forget all the worries they have, even if only for a night.Shopping - It will always be nice to look at what you could have and what you could obtain when you finally get that big win in life. In 10 years people will still want to think of a better future, even if they only shop online.Death - Death is just a part of life like living. However as our lives change with the growth of humanity, our deaths will still be the same.Stories - The countless stories people come up with every day will only grow in number as more people are able to share their stories with the world, even if they are made up, a story is still a story.Successful People - There will always be people doing more, getting more and wanting more than the rest. They will always step up where no one else is willing to.Growth - Only through personal growth do we feel like we are progressing in life and make our life meaningful. Humanity will never stop to grow, as that desire is what pushed us to be here since millions of years ago.Love - People will fall in love, will fall out of love and the whole concept will still be idolized by the media and masses as it is one of the cornerstones of being alive and one of the most fundamental needs we have.The only things that are really changing are the ever growing advancements in technology and our understanding of the world. As we grow, as the internet becomes a bigger place and businesses grow more and more they will bring change to the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Funny story. When I first heard the title of Ryan Holiday\u2019s new book \u201cPerennial Seller,\u201d I knew it\u2019d teach me more about how to make something timeless, which I\u2019ve been obsessed with recently. For some reason Amazon Germany shipped the book a couple days early, so I thought it\u2019d be fun to let Ryan know.  Lo and behold, I might actually have gotten the first real-world copy:  The book is brilliant. It takes me forever to finish because I\u2019m marking things left and right and taking breaks to think about what I read constantly. I\u2019ve added my own, but here are some of Ryan\u2019s examples of things that never get old: Stories. Humans have connected through stories for 1,000s of years. Star Wars was built around the hero\u2019s journey, so was Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. It\u2019s a timeless framework we subconsciously understand.Tradition. Culture, religion, nation. Serve any particular one of these and you have a shot at legacy. No big nation or world religion is going away any time soon.Birth. What to Expect When You're Expecting is a book that can expect to keep selling, because we can expect people to keep expecting. About 560 babies have been born since you started reading this.Education. Until we\u2019re adults we all need a hand and always will. But we\u2019ll need new ways to learn the ABCs and math and history as time passes.Entertainment. I can\u2019t imagine what it must\u2019ve been like when kids movies weren\u2019t fun to watch for adults. Thank you Pixar, Disney, DreamWorks and co. Adults procrastinate a lot too.Aging. Babies do baby stuff, teens do teen stuff and old people do old people stuff. Some things about each 5\u201310 year period in our lives remain the same. Work with that.Death. So far this little quirk of fate in the human experience hasn\u2019t been fixed and I\u2019m guessing it never will.Imagination. The day we\u2019re all dull and sapped of creativity is the day we\u2019re doomed. Humans will always be creative and inspired and have dreams. Give them something to fuel those.Biology. Humans need raincoats when it\u2019s raining, scarves when it\u2019s cold and ice-cold drinks when the sun\u2019s out. Health, weight, nutrition, we all have to deal with these.I could go on. As you can see there is one central element all of these revolve around: humans. If you want to create something that lasts, don\u2019t base it on some trend, technology or problem that\u2019ll eventually solve itself. Focus on the core of what it means to be human and you have a chance to touch people not just today, but tomorrow too. Or, in Ryan\u2019s words: You can\u2019t make something that lasts if it\u2019s based on things, on individual parts that themselves won\u2019t last. ~Ryan Holiday, Perennial Seller Hats off, Mr. Holiday. I have a hunch your book will be around for a long time. ",
