            "answer_text": "It's making experiences seem... almost pointless. Technology as a whole has given us more options, most of which are even cheaper. Instead of having to wait to get home to use the computer, I have one in my pocket and can just look stuff up there. Before that, if I wanted to look something up, I would have to go all the way to the library and sort through so many different books before getting the information that I wanted. Now, all I have to do is type a few words into my phone and I save myself both time and money, which is great. But it goes even farther than information: I don't have to go to the crowded theater on Fridays anymore: now, I can just wait a month and it will be on Netflix without me having to deal with people or pay extra money for tickets. I don't have to go to the Grand Canyon, I can just do a '3-D' tour of it from the safety and comfort from home. I don't have to go shoe-shopping and search high and low for extra-wide shoes: I can just order a couple pairs on Amazon, then return the ones that don't fit, again, never leaving my home. I don't have to go to the bar or dating locations to find a compatible person: Tinder will make the end result that much quicker and save me time. In short, there's no need to experience the journey, only the end result that was the point all along. Future generations are going to look back at our era without digital technology and wonder how we managed to waste so much time traveling and going through entire processes because anything they want they can get immediately.

            "answer_text": "By the way, technology does not disrupt life. It rather uplifts life, by disrupting existing products and industries. There has been a virtually endless list of examples of digital disruptions. Here are few of them: Smartphone and wireless connectivity\u2014we no longer feel disconnected. We no longer also carry multiple gadgets likes PDA, portable music player, camera, or even torch light. Mighty smartphone with wireless connectivity has disrupted so many industries, in order to uplift our way of life. Digital currency and payment\u2014Starting from cash to cards, all are on the way to be forgotten. Digital currency and means of payment are making significant change in our financial culture. Wearable and embedded health devices\u2014They are already around, just about to make big disruption in our healthcare sector. Digital technologies in farming\u2014 We need increasingly more food from depleting land to feed growing population, causing less pollution. Innovations around digital technologies starting from drones to big data to implanted sensors are about to cause big disruption to existing way of farming. Digital disruption in jobs\u2014human free production is no longer a science fiction. Starting from driving cars to processing food, all productive activities are constantly being innovated by digital innovations disrupting the job market. As a matter of fact, every part of life starting from embryonic stage is being uplifted through digital disruptions. ",
