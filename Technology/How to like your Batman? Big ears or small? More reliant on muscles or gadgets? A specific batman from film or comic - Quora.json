            "answer_text": "Somehow I got my first A2A... Should I be excited? Anyways, how do I like my batman? Personally, animated. Even though I love Nolan's batman to bits, my favorite batmans will always be animated. But let me list a couple of things I think are important to batman. Please note that I will be limiting myself to on-screen Batmans. 1.His costume I do not have a preference about ears and capes and stuff. Batman has gone through a lot of incarnations and all of them have their quirks and advantages. Let's have a look:  Adam West: this was the very beginning, trying to stay true to the silver age of comics. Even though he has no visible armor and isn't really inspiring fear, he can move and uses his trained skills to fight. Michael Keaton: okay, now we're getting somewhere. Defined muscles, armor, black colors to blend into the night and a giant yellow logo on his chest. I'll get into this logo later. Big hole in the design though... HE CAN'T MOVE HIS HEAD. I saw a critic once praising this because it was meant to make him move in an unique way... Nooo. Batman is supposed to fight, to dissapears, to turn his head... But okay, that's my only gripe with this design. Val Kilmer: I know, I know. Bat nipples. I'm not sure what these have as purpose outside of an S&M setting, but hey the guy dresses like a bat, we should expect some eccentric stuff. But all in all, powerful looking body armor with okay mobility. If a guy walked up to me looking like a tank, I'd be impressed. George Clooney: Okay, so looking this up I learned that not all of these have good things, so let's forget about Clooney's clown suit. Christian Bale: YES. Okay, so this guy looks dark and threatening, he  can move freely in his suit (first one since Adam West to actually turn his head in a Batman costume). This suit was created to move stealthy, fight efficiently and take a hit. But, as promised, I'm going to talk about that logo now. This is a minor thing, but potentially fatal. So Bale is stalking a criminal from the shadows and does his threatening voice. The criminal turns around and shoots at the only thing he sees in the shadows. Take a close look at the suit and guess what that is. Yup, HIS MOUTH. In all that dark mass, his face (and only weak spot) is on full display. That's why a big yellow circle on the chest is interesting. \"Sure, shoot the small flash of color you saw move. That's why it's armored.\" But once again, a very minor gripe I have. Ben Afleck: Jury is still out in this one, but I like it. A batman suit that's battle scared from the get go? Awesome. He shows that he's been in his share of fights and that he came out victorious. Personally, I also love the way they went slightly back to the silver age/Adam West theme with grey and lighter looking fabric and a small eared mask. Now, I did say I like my batmans animated. So here come some other explanations:  Like I answered on other posts, this will always be my batman. Remember all the small gripes I had with the other batmen. None of those here. Because he's animated, his suit just doesn't HAVE to make sense. He can move like a ninja in light armor without endangering himself.  Once again we start out with the yellow bullseye to draw fire towards the armor. Now of course, I keep defending it, but it does have a major flaw. It's a bright yellow logo and he's a stealth fighter. So yeah, I do see why they got rid of it. Otherwise, the main three designs are very similar, with the spexceptio of the ears. And personally, I don't mind the ears, as long as they get a reason. There's no logical reason for ears that big, unless they are antennas (which in some iterations, they are). So I give the ears a pass. Bonus for the Batman Beyond suit. I really really like that suit. The black and red motive is different, but the dark red is still perfect for blending into the shadows. He lost the cape (quote Edna Mode: \"NO CAPES\") and incorporated his gliding into the arms. This was a huge plus because of the fact that a new person dawned the cowl. A person that wasn't as trained into martial combat and thus not as able to incorporate a cape into his fighting style. So yes, I'm a fan of this one as well.  I don't really know how the reception of this show was, but I think it was okay. The Japanese-inspired animation was on point and the same thing goes for the batsuit.  This is supposed to be a younger, less experienced batman and for that intend and purpose, this suit did fine. The cape is longer, but otherwise it's very much inspired by the original animated series version.  It took me some time to learn to like this batman. He's definitly going for the more campy look and feel of the Adam West era and for that, this design works fine.  Say what you want about this show, I love it. I might go into more details later, but for now just look at it. Look at that suit, that streamlined physique. That flat fitting belt. This was designed to be sleek and offer zero resistance and it looks that way. This is the suit I'd want to wear if it were physically possible. Are the ears huge... Yes, I'm sure he'll poke someone's eyes out (hey, another use for giant pointy ears). But strangely, they work here. I tried and imagine him with short stumpy ears and it just felt off.   Suit conclusion: all these suits are adapted to convey specific messages or fit in specific situations. From being a hero in the '60 to moving in a very distinctive way. From paying homage to a classic look to reinventing the character and trying to make it their own. And most of the suits (not Clooney) succeeded brilliantly in their set-up. So what suit do I like my batman to be in... It depends what situation I find my batman in. 2. His Origin  Yes, we all know the origins of batman. Yes, it's been done to (his parents) death (to soon?). But it's an important part so let's have a bit of a look.  Thinking about all iterations I mentioned in the previous section, his origin story hasn't been as hammered is as some other super heroes. In most of the animated series they have a small flashback or a conversation with Alfred and that's it. And usually that's all we need. There are a few exceptions though: Michael Keaton: okay, SPOILERS. Joker killed batmans parents before he became the joker. (\"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight.\") This changes batman's motives about halfway in the film. Do I like that... Not really.  First it gives the joker, the most mysterious character in the batman's rogue gallery a history. Not a good idea. Then it makes batman a person ready to kill in vengeance (comming back to this later). Christian Bale: This is why people love Nolan's batman. He gives us the origin story we need AND the one we deserve. We don't get: parents shot... One thing lead to the other... Batman. No. We get Bruce's training. We get how he's advancing his mind and body to become a crime fighter. And we get a look at the bond young Bruce had with his parents, mainly his father (\"Why do we fall, Bruce?\"). The bat motive isn't just a whim here and unlike most other versions, it actually shows how he first interacts with the police. Batman: the Brave and the Bold: say what you want about the campiness of the show. Complain as much as you want about how over the top it is. It did one thing very very right.  There is one episode dedicated to origins, revenge and justice. It's an emotional ride that shows batman's inner turmoil when he confronts his parent's killer. This isn't completely an origins story, as it is one take on coming to grip with your origins. It's that point where our hero must decide on why he's doing this. Revenge? Or justice? The Batman: This is a look at a different type of origin. This one isn't about how Bruce trained or lost his parents. This is about how Batman grew into a hero. I like the take on this one, where the police is out to get him at all cost, but he keeps fighting crimes nevertheless, even teaming up with select detectives. To me this show showed us the trouble a new batman had to go through in his starting period and how he handled it. All in all a great concept later excellently used by Nolan as well. Beware the Bat: At first I had planned to put this together wit The Batman since they have the same premises. But then I noticed interesting differences. This batman is still very much in training with a kickass Alfred. The only time we actually see battle hardened MI-6 spy Alfred Pennyworth training Bruce in combat tactics. There are also more subtle hints towards his training with Buddhist monks and several dojos, but those are only references. Origins conclusion: Batman is a very complicated character and had to go through a lot to get where he is now. So I like my batman deep and complicated, but done in a way that it doesn't slap you in the face. A very fine line to walk, but it can be done.  3. His Personalities Yes, I said personalities, multiple. Because, like it or not, batman is insane. He checks off all boxes that should land him in a padded cell in Arkham. And one is a possible split personality, mainly between Bruce Wayne and the Batman. Now, as I write this I realize that this isn't completely accurate and I'll go into that with some examples. But however you turn it, Batman has to maintain two lives and they're both important. Michael Keaton: Now his Bruce usually is a calm and collected but eventually loses it as Bruce when facing his parent's murderer. But all in all he keeps his company well run and fights criminals at the same time. Basically, his Bruce Wayne is \"bland\" (not talking about performance here) enough to fly under the radar of the authorities and villains. As for his Batman.... Yeah, no. This is a problem many people have with his portrayal, but it's a big one. Keaton kills several people. His batman is a deranged psychopath, putting bombs in people's pants and smiling as he watches them blow up. His car has more guns than most country's armies have. So yeah, great Bruce but disturbing Batman.  Christian Bale: As mentioned before, Nolan gave us a great origin story. That story also contained Bruce Wayne, learning to balance his affairs. So what do we have... This guy is a playboy billionaire running around and putting million dollar cheques in a waiter's pocket, pretending he bought a hotel (that's one happy waiter btw. Yay, tip money). He has Alfred convince him to give a gala that he blows by giving the most insulting speech ever. There were other ways to evacuate the building, jeez. He is so uninterested in his company that it's almost being stolen from under his nose. Yes, he was young and unexperienced... Wait, what? They tried again and succeeded? Well, there you go. If anyone would meet this person they'd notice him, remember him and pretty much label him as crazy enough to wear a batsuit and fight crime. This whole thing is because he's primarily Batman. Bale doesn't care about Bruce Wayne and spends all his time on Batman. Not a good ballance. But what is the result? How does his Batman stack up? Surprisingly, not as good as I thought he would. True, he doesn't kill people (he just lets one person die...) but let's see his progression. The first movie he's learning how to fight and beat organized crime. So far so good. He's doing great. Second movie, still fighting the endless struggle, you go get them. And now he's taking the blame for Dent's death. Very good. Batman is not a symbol of hope, that's what Superman is for. Batman is a symbol of fear. Perfect, he can keep fighting from the shadows. Third movie. Wait, what!? Batman dissapeared and stopped fighting for several years? Because he wasn't feeling well? That's not right. But he's back now, that's good. Oh no, he just defeated Bane and is sipping coffee with Catwoman now. Gotham can burn apparently. So yeah, even though he started out fine as Batman, Bale's/Nolan's version just gave up, something batman NEVER should. The animated serie: this is the one to imitate, there is this subtle change in Conroy's voice whenever he goes back and forth between Bruce and Batman. There's this one scene where Bruce is sitting at the batcomputer and talking to Alfred. It doesn't sound like he's doing anything with his voice, until he receives a telephone call as Bruce Wayne. His facial expressions and voice immediately morph into something else. It's beautiful.  Even though this Bruce has the same mindset as Nolan's Batman, as in that the Batman part is the most important part of his life, he never neglects the Bruce part. He runs a successful company, keeps a decent public profile and regularly uses his identity to help the Batman. But in all that, he never looses track of the mission until the very end. About that very end, that's also the beginning of Batman Beyond. So I gave Nolan's batman bad points for giving up and this batman gave up as well. Sort of. This batman fought until he was so old and weak he had to grab the one weapon his ethics code never allowed him to use, a gun, to protect himself. Once he learned he couldn't protect the people he gave up. But even after that, he was still batman. And there's one piece of conversation I simply love to show his mindset:  Plus point: he doesn't need to imitate throat cancer to be imposing. His presence does it all.  The Batman: another aspect I think this show did very very right. Batman is still learning to balance Bruce and Batman. He comes late to a meeting to save his company because he hunted villains all night, he gets an online date but has to cancel. You know, the usual. But every time you can see his struggle. And every time you can see how he's one step closer to actually holding on to both personas until he has grown that balance that The Animated serie's batman has.  But this batman NEVER lost track of his mission. There is one very interesting episode, set in the future. Archeologists discover the bat cave because they're looking for a method to beat mister Freeze. The episode flashes back and forward between an old batman fighting alongside Nightwing and Oracle, almost getting killed several times. When they urge him to retire he insists that the mission isn't over. So even after his death, he has stored all information about crime fighting into the batcave so anyone who found it could finish the mission. (\"If you are seeing this recording, it means the mission isn't over.\") Personalities conclusion: There should be a balance in that crazy head. But my Batman is Batman and uses Bruce Wayne as a cover. Never the other way around. (Rachel Dawes: \"not this mask. The other one.\") 4. His entourage Yes, even Batman can't go it alone. He has surrounded himself with some pretty noteworthy people so let's compare a few: Alfred Pennyworth  Probably the most constant member of the bat family and rightfully so. I'm going to focus on 4 main ones Keaton's Butler: I really don't like this Alfred. Yes he has Bruce's best intressts at heart, but come on. Alfred has one major job description. One rule above all others. Don't tell anyone Bruce Wayne is the Batman. Let's see what happens. Movie 1: walks into the flipping batcave with a reporter on his arm. That's where Bruce should go: \"Alfred, you're fired.\" But, to his little credit. There was very good chemistry between him and all the Bruces. Yes, even with Clooney. Bale's Butler: What can you say. He's probably the most quotable character in the Nolan trilogy besides the joker. He is the guy with the sage advice that he clearly got through life experience. He has that older mentor role. Does he talk too much... Maybe, but when you e got Michael Kaine, you'll use him as much as you can. Animated Butlers: I'm casting a net over most of the animated series here (excluding Beware the Batman). Most of the times, Alfred is portrayed as the caring old father figure and it's a role that fits him extremely well.  Beware the Batman: I never knew I wanted a ripped, kickass Alfred until now. This dude is awesome. I'd love to see a live action version of this Alfred, really showing his MI-6 skills. Robin The most important part of the batman entourage and also the least used somehow. I'm not going to go into extreme details with this one (this thing is getting waaaaay too long). Most Robins are portrayed as carefree joking kids having the time of their lives, swinging along with their hero. Let's forget the whiny teenager that joined Clooney and were good. Not much to work on.    So... How do I like my batman. Dark and complex, dedicated to his mission and dressed in black. All other aspects are a matter of where and when he is. Sorry for making this so huge, I got excited about the A2A.  ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: All images are from google images, and all videos are from YouTube, so please don\u2019t collapse this answer for \u201cviolating image policies\u201d or some crap like that. The Suit: First and foremost, the suit needs to be black and/or grey and very, very intimidating. I always thought that Batman\u2019s suit spoke more about the man on a psychological level. There are many levels to the suit on a fundamental level. #1. He\u2019s a man in a period of constant mourning, not just for his own parents, but for the Wayne family as a whole, since it could be argued that Bruce Wayne himself also died that night and was replaced by the being known as Batman. And with every tragedy he suffers, his mourning period is prolonged, trapping him in a life of self-inflicted misery and loneliness. #2. The suit must strike mortal terror into the hearts of the guilty, yet be a symbol of hope to the innocent. You tell me; who would be more afraid of this image, the man being mugged or the mugger himself?  #3. The design of the suit, all of its gadgets and intrinsically protective nature, must reflect the character of Bruce Wayne and are a window into his highly analytical and strategic mind. He isn\u2019t just some mindless thug who beats criminals within an inch of their lives . No, he attacks their spirit, breaks their minds before he EVER lays so much as a finger on their bodies. He bypasses every security system, removes every sentry, makes a mockery of every precaution and safety measure like an avenging wraith in the night. And by the time he reaches his prey, they are already so utterly defeated and so terrified of him that the beating they receive is really just overkill at that point. To paraphrase Sun Tzu; \u201cThe victorious Batman only seeks battle after the victory has been won.\u201d The Car: I\u2019m rather open to the various batmobile iterations I\u2019ve seen over the years. The only cars I really dislike are the Adam West batmobile, the abominations from \u201cForever\u201d and \u201cBatman and Robin\u201d, and the \u201cBatfleck\u201d-mobile. In all cases, the cars did not truly represent who/what Batman is (In terms of \u201cBatfleck\u201d, the car is simply too small, too SIMPLE. It\u2019s hard to explain, but something crucial is missing). Surprisingly enough, I think my favorite Batmobile is the one from the Arkham Knight game, as again, it reflects Batman\u2019s strategic mind. Why drive a regular, vulnerable vehicle when you can have a nigh-indestructible, highly mobile/agile tank? First Place:  Second Place:  Third Place:  The Man, and the Stories that follow him: Batman, while being a tortured soul, still genuinely cares for people in his own strange way. His stories show that even in the darkest of places, there can be true beauty, true emotion that could never be seen anywhere else, certainly not in the gleaming city of Metropolis. The stories involving Batman prove why he is a greater hero than Superman, perhaps even the greatest superhero ever created. He has no powers, and yet will even try to risk his own life for them, going so far as to willingly connect with them on an emotional level.    Even his replacement, Terry Mginnis, cares for the villains he faces:  The Cave: I\u2019m sorry, but the whole \u201cunderground box\u201d just doesn\u2019t do it for me.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. What is this, the Bat-Garage?! No, the Cave must reflect the Bat himself. Gothic, technological, with a somewhat industrial design. It should be a place that inspires feelings of sorrow and hope in equal measure. A dark place that is the home of a hero. Hope that springs from the shadows. The home of a true Dark Knight.  The Signal: While I appreciate the classic bat-signal:  I prefer the newer Bat-Signal from the Arkham games:  A vast, imposing symbol gleams over the dark streets and gothic architecture of the filthy city. The Bat, that legendary creature of the night, is on the hunt. Just imagine being anyone, criminal, innocent, it doesn\u2019t matter, and seeing that symbol appear in the skies above you. Perhaps at the same moment it appears, thunder rumbles in the distance, as if some great beast has been awakened and is moving to take revenge on the guilty. THAT is what the Bat-Signal must symbolize, in my opinion. They\u2019re not just calling a hero to help them, they are in fact invoking the image of a primal, immortal creature. No one knows where it comes from, nor do they know if it is truly human. They only know that It does not tire. That it cannot be defeated. That it cannot be killed. It cannot be stopped. And that it will never stop until it finds the one it\u2019s looking for. THE BATMAN.   ",
