            "answer_text": "My first wife and I needed something to do. We found a cat furniture manufacturer from Katy Texas that developed a product line from a high school art project; sculptured carpet of trees, cactuses and every day objects. We made a joint effort in two cat shows and did OK. Myself being raised in Southern California and my wife having creative abilities we decided to manufacture the product ourselves. Although it was patented, we proved through myself producing a one page technical paper that we have created a different product and were released of any infringement. Our crowning achievement was a Palm Tree 6 feet tall, 6 feet wide with six removable leaves and three coconuts. In four years time with the help of about 12 employees we were producing enough furniture for a container 40 foot to go overseas or a 53 foot box trailer for back east +3 or maybe four cat shows each month. The success was in the uniqueness of what we were able to produce, Pagodas for oriental breeds, trees, houses, cactuses, big hollow tree called Big Purr. I found with a tight schedule I only had room to produce a maximum of two new models per year with variations of others. The product had a real cartoon flavor with soft edges and contrasting colors. On the Pueblos and cottages large and small each we would add what we're called decorations, scraps of carpet cut to the shape of flowers, birds, stars, panoramas on a model called the Park Bench. It was a lot of work and fun and my second wife and I decided to join up again on it. ",

            "answer_text": "You can talk about a lot of things here, like Facebook's launch. But I think your interviewer probably want to hear something fresh since this question has probably been asked a lot.  Fallout Shelter would be a product that had a great launch. To start, it\u2019s a mobile game in the Fallout franchise which is already well known. The biggest difference between this game\u2019s launch and every other game\u2019s launch is that it was launched on the day of announcement. No one knew it was coming. Usually games will hype and do a lot of warm ups before launching the game to gather interest, but Fallout Shelter didn\u2019t do this, but it did draw in so many people. Here is what happened. Bethesda, the creator, is a huge AAA PC/Console game company that works on two well-known series. Fallout is one of those, and this year everyone knew they were going to announce a new Fallout game. It has been 5 years since the last Fallout, so everyone was already hyped and anticipated. During a panel during GDC where he was talking about the new Fallout (along with its own launch days and trailer), he suddenly dropped the news of a new mobile game. He then starts playing it on stage, and told the crowd and everyone watching that it is now available on the App Store. Why did this work? There are several reasons: 1. Everyone was already hyped for a Fallout game, and having been told there is a new one they can\u2019t wait to play it. Then all the sudden they have an alternative game to scratch that itch. 2. Everyone watching are Fallout fans, so this targets the exact audience. 3. Everyone didn\u2019t see this coming, and this in itself become a huge piece of news, thus gathering attention and promoting more downloads. 4. The game was played on stage at E3, one of the biggest gaming expo. So most gamers were watching. 5. Bethesda already planned this out with Apple, and had the game launch on this exact moment as well as getting Apple to feature it. 6. The game was fully playable, with content lasting for more than a few weeks. Because of this, the game received a ton of organic traffic. The game continued to be updated after the launch, and reached top charts and stayed there for a few weeks. PR news started to flood out about this launch, and a lot follow up PR came in as well. So it didn\u2019t really miss any of in the PR part. However, this game\u2019s launch was not 100% perfect. There were several problems. 1. While the game was feature complete and had enough contents for a few weeks, there was no updates following it to provide more content. Players ran out of things to do. A lot of players churned as a result after a few weeks. 2. The game was not available on Android for more than a month. This was probably a deal with Apple to get featured, but it still hurt. Android does have the bigger market share after all, although definitely not the revenue. 3. Bethesda reportedly did not spend any money in advertising the game, so after the initial organic wave of traffic for both Apple and Android (it was later released on Android), the game received no further traffic. In the end though, the game\u2019s launch was still a success. It generated a lot of revenue. While it had a bad post-launch, the launch itself was perfect. Because of the shock factor, the attention due to the shock factor, and the perfect marketing to the right crowd at the right moment (and for free, imagine that, since Bethesda was going to announce the new Fallout at E3 anyway), the game\u2019s launch was successful.
