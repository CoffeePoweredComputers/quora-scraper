            "answer_text": "How much laundry detergent do you really need to use? No one knows, really. You have to consider the fact that the laundry detergent manufacturers have us hooked on the stuff. Everyone has a brand of choice that they buy, almost religiously, unless their second choice brand is on sale, or something. Sales of the stuff are basically guaranteed. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone \u201cgiving up\u201d laundry detergent, like a teetotaler. So, they\u2019ve got us, coming and going. That means it isn\u2019t a matter of whether or not you\u2019re going to buy the stuff. It\u2019s a matter of how often. This leads me to believe that the amount they suggest you use is a little more than you really need. It\u2019s kinda like those wide mouth beer cans. Miller Brewing knows you don\u2019t need to chug that beer but they really want to see you on your second one. Or your third. It\u2019s just better for their bottom line. I suggest you do an experiment. Do a load of laundry with half the amount of detergent you normally use and decide if you like the results. If so, then that is how much you need. If not, add a little more the next time. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you noticed the TV ads for those laundry detergent \u201cpods\u201d now show the demonstrators throwing in two and sometimes three pods instead of one? Does that mean one pod does not do the job or does it mean the company is hoping you will use more so that you will buy more? After many years of doing laundry and of using the same brand of detergent (liquid Tide), I know now how much to put into a load based on the size of the load and the dirtiness of the clothes. Almost every load I use less detergent than is recommended on the Tide jug. If my clothes did not come out clean I would start using more detergent (or, perhaps change brands if Tide didn\u2019t do as good a job as I was expecting). Laundry detergent is ridiculously expensive and I will not use a drop more than I need per load. ",
