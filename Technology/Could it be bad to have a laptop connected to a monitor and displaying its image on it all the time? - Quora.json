            "answer_text": "This could indeed be bad... for the monitor. It depends on the type of display, but showing a static image for long enough can eventually leave behind lasting afterimages. I get them with my monitors (Samsung 2343BWX) for example. Since I have four monitors, certain apps tend to be open all the time and remain stationary for days on end, and when I do something atypical and (for example) put an image viewer where my web browser normally goes, I can see elements of the web browser's user interface \"bleeding through\" the picture even if the web browser is closed so I know it's not just an Aero effect. Fortunately this is temporary, but it can take hours to go away on my displays, and there are other display types (plasma and OLED in particular, and CRTs back in the old days) that are highly vulnerable to burn-in damage. This is why screen savers were invented. You could possibly experience the same damage to the laptop's native display if you left it on all the time with the lid up, too. However, all that is being damaged is the display itself, and typically displays intended for computer use are not prone to permanent damage from such use. (You never know if the manufacturer cheaped out though.) I'm sort of running such an experiment with a Chromebook right now. I changed the OS to GalliumOS because Chrome was much too restricted for me, and now I have it successfully hosting my Minecraft server. The problem is that closing the lid seems to be hard-coded to suspend the machine as even Xfce's power management doesn't let me disable this behavior, so I have a pair of socks lying on the trackpad to keep the lid from closing all the way. The display never shuts off. I won't be immensely surprised if I find out that the never-changing location of the Minecraft server console burns its way into the display after a while. ",

            "answer_text": "Is it bad to start a car up and drive? No, it's specifically engineered/designed to do that. So worrying about using a capability of your laptop is pointless. Every single one has at least one port to drive an external display. That port is always active; it never shuts off. So having no cable vs a cable plugged in is exactly the same thing. That port is also about the last thing that could fail on your laptop too. Use a monitor, keyboard, and mouse and you don't have a laptop...it's now functionally equivalent to a desktop. ",
