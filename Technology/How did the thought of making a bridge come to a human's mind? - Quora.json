            "answer_text": "Take a look at following images :    These are natural bridges that have formed because of various reasons like erosion of rock due to water or wind. It is totally plausible that there existed such natural structures in large numbers, before we populated the earth. In fact, it is quite possible that they existed even during times of Dinosaurs. And many land/arboreal animals have been using it. The idea of bridge is quite natural too. We all have a natural instinct to find a path of least resistance. To reach from point A to point B, if there is another way with lesser obstructions, it is always a preferred path. Ofcourse, a fallen log may have aided in making the idea a reality, given that only natural thing available that was long and strong was lumber. ",
