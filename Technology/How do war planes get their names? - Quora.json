            "answer_text": "It varies. In the U.S. the DOD maintains final approval today, but the process varies. In the case of the new B-21 Raider (under development), Raider was selected from suggestions that were submitted. History is often utilized. The F-35 Lightning II , was named after a great WWII fighter produced by F-35 prime contractor, Lockheed, the P-38 Lightning. The A-10 Thunderbolt II shares its name with the P-47 Thunderbolt. The list goes on. The USAF has had a propensity for using birds of prey names for its fighter aircraft. F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon (a name I have never heard used by a F-16 Viper pilot, maintainer or associated personnel; other than the Thunderbirds Flight Demonstration Team announcer), F-117A Nighthawk (an attack aircraft, not a fighter, and a name possibly selected to perpetuate that deception) and F-22A Raptor. I'm responding from a tablet on a slow connection that limits my ability to research and respond, but another interesting collection is Grumman Aircraft's Cat series. F4F Wildcat, F6F Hellcat, F7F Tigercat, F8F Bearcat and F-14 Tomcat. Regardless of country, especially in the case of fighters an bombers, the name needs to be cool and imposing. After all what taxpayer would be pleased to be paying for an incredibly expensive aircraft named a coot? ",
