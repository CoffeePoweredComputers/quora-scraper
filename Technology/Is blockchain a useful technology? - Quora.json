            "answer_text": "Having cryptocurrency without investing it is just owning a fertile land that doesn\u2019t yield. Leaving your coins in your wallet exposes your coins to hash market trends like the fall of bitcoin early 2018. Hoarders lost a lot as bitcoin fell from about $20k to as low as $7k. To tap into the vast opportunities crypto has to offer you need to invest. The best investment strategies available are cloud mining services and the best cloud mining service provider available are hashnow, I would recommend hashnow. crypto investment is like other forms of investment were you put money into a business and expect profit. The methods of investment in crypto are different from that of conventional business. The popular methods of earning in crypto are mining (generating new coins by confirming transactions), trading and benefiting from market price hike. However, investing in crypto has its own risk, the risk is posed by the rise of fraudsters is a very big challenge to investing in crypto and deter a lot of new investors.

            "answer_text": "Hi, blockchain technology is transformative, and several commentators expect that it will have a massive economic impact similar to the one the Internet has had in the past few decades. The blockchain development services are being actively adopted by finance, retail, insurance, and other industries as it helps to achieve well-established workflows through simplifying record and identity management, transaction processing, goods provenance and traceability. When enterprises start adopting blockchain, typically, there arise problems from understanding blockchain itself to building an application. While blockchains can be associated with DApps, smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, ledgers, tokens, and shared business processes, not all blockchain applications require all of these things. Once enterprise figures out what it wants with blockchain (speed up, secure or simplify transactions or processes), the next step is developing an application. I want to say that blockchain solutions allow you to reduce deviations in your processes, increase flexibility and transparency, automate your processes, secure operations, enhance planning and more.  Why permissioned blockchain Pre-verification of the participating parties within the network is requiredAll data must be shared between participants (companies or its departments)Companies with multiple departments need either to request or grant access to the informationAll data must be completely and permanently recordedAny intermediaries need to be eliminatedAny data loss and security risks must come to naughtI recommend reading the article - Blockchain Technology Transforms Bond and Stock Markets If you have any questions regarding blockchain development services for logistics, we are always there for you.
