They often relate it with something really high-tech and consider it too much of a burden for their toddlers. They think that their children\u2019s shoulders already carry too much of a workload to handle learning a programming language which is based on an older generation\u2019s mindset. I recently got my sister enrolled in WhiteHat Jr. After almost half a year later, I can proudly boost about the changes I have seen in her and how much her creative capacity has grown given her current age of 8 years. When I first came across WhiteHat Jr\u2019s. advertisement, I got a bit intrigued by the fact that they were successfully teaching coding children ranging from the ages of 6 to 14. Given the situation of pandemic, my family was looking for an extra-curricular activity for my sister to keep her occupied. Thus, this seemed like an interesting opportunity. We booked a demo class which they were offering at absolutely no cost. The tutor was so well-versed with the curriculum and suggested what would be best for the toddler after having a one-to-one conversation with her. The sent us all the details of what all the course included, how and when the classes were going to be conducted, number of classes, etc to keep us included in the loop. Now, mainly because of the outstanding one-to-one sessions offered by them, I can honestly see the change in my sister. The way her creative thinking has improved and the increased confidence she displays now is something the entire family is proud of. Instead of beginning with really difficult coding languages, they begin their courses with easy and fun drag and drop commands which immediately widens the smile on the toddler\u2019s face. The innovative way of using badges and beautiful hats to make the weekly and monthly assignments interesting not only gets the kids to enjoy these tasks but also creates a bit of competitiveness. The 21st century is the century of technology and WhiteHat Jr. is ensuring the next generation is fully prepared to make the most of it.  ",

            "answer_text": "WhiteHat Jr. is actually for kids between 6 and 14 years old. Simply put, this is for children to learn coding \u2013 which is a very broad subject and can take years to master. So if you start them young, which is exactly what I did for my son, then your child can be a master coder within just a few years. What I like about WhiteHat Jr. is how they divided the courses from beginner to professional levels. Depending on your child\u2019s age and skill level, he can enroll in a coding course and advance through the years. It is not rushed and WhiteHat Jr. doesn\u2019t give out all the info and lessons to students in just one huge file or session. Teaching happens gradually so there\u2019s no information overload. This means that even if your child has zero idea on how coding works, he will eventually learn and become a master. When you look at their curriculum on their website, you will see that it is divided into 4 different categories: beginner (grade 1), intermediate (grades 2-3), advanced (grades 4-6), and professional (grades 7-9). The category levels are quite self-explanatory so you shouldn\u2019t have any problems with that. They do have a free trial, which has limited slots only. During the free trial, your child can experience first-hand what happens during teaching sessions, which is typically 1:1 \u2013 1 child to 1 instructor. During the free trial, I was monitoring my child and the teacher also, and it seemed like the teacher was really an expert in this field. I chose WhiteHat Jr. for my child because they specialize in online coding lessons. While other online schools for kids offer a variety of other subjects, WhiteHat focuses on coding, which is one of the top deciding factors for me. And since we all know that everything that happens on the Internet changes over time, I feel like, with this focused coding study they offer, they will continually update their lessons depending on the changes that happen in the coding world real-time.

            "answer_text": "Many people could have perceptions that teaching coding to the students at this early age of 6-14 years will make them robots and suppress under undue stress but this is not true. My daughter has recently become part of Whitehat Jr. sphere. It will be too early to give feedback about services of the organization rather I would like to share my experience of what changes I have observed in my daughter within this one week. Initially we were in need to be get into the stream of getting information about courses and duration. Wherein we found Whitehat Jr. has designed very interactive courses for kids of all grades from 1-12th and above. Demo class facility provided by them is the best tool which enables tutor to suggest program according to the competency level of kids. We went for a demo session and I found the tutor was very professional and well equipped to understand the psychology and her caliber to which course she will best fit in. Accordingly, we proceed further to opt beginners program as per feedback. They sent us the complete curriculum details like number of classes, duration of classes and duration of program so that along with them kids and their parents are also aware about everything. She is getting dedicated 1:1 classes with undue attention. Her competency to understand the methodology to solve the algorithms is not only pacing up her brain skills but also developing her level of confidence and interest too. Rather than let student perform large coding syntax initially rather they have opted very interactive and easy ways to understand the coding language to make kids familiar with the codes like to drag and drop the code which is already written, appealing dashboards have been designed and kids are getting appreciated on weekly and monthly assignments with badges and beautiful hats. Only purpose which I felt Whitehat Jr. serve is to make our next generation ready to create next tech platforms. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I can speak for myself on the basis of my experience with the services of WhiteHat Jr. I wanted my sister to do a course in coding during this lockdown just to invest her time in some productive work and Coding being the future of the upcoming world, I thought why not equip her with the tools to thrive in such an AI driven world to come. So, my sister has now been doing an advanced course in App Development within WhiteHat Jr. , for a month now and she has never been so happy with an academic course as she is with this course in coding. Being a computer programming enthusiast myself, I have been keeping a close watch on what kind of teaching services are being provided by WhiteHat Jr. and how they cater to the doubts of the students. I was really impressed to see the system of one to one online live classes where the teacher concentrates only on one student at a time and the students are comfortable enough in clarifying their doubts. WhiteHat Jr.has a well formed education structure where the types of courses are divided according to the level of grades in which the child is studying. These courses are also bifurcated on the level of interest of the students and the interest of the student. These courses are subdivided into the following: Introduction to coding App Development Certificate Advance coding with Space Tech. My sister is doing an Intermediate course in App Development Certificate and she is literally having the time of her life. WhiteHat Jr. has certainly made coding a Child's play. They are teaching coding in such a manner that a student never gets bored, rather they are rejuvenated with a hunger to learn more and develop something new after each and every class. The rewarding trend of WhiteHat Jr. surely boosts their level of interest. WhiteHat Jr. recently introduced a challenge in which the best of the ideas got a chance to be pitched to the investors of Silicon Valley. After learning about this challenge my sister has been bringing various unconventional ideas to me as she has made it her resolve to pitch her ideas to the investors of the Silicon valley. It\u2019s like someone has given wings to her imagination and it seems that now the sky's the limit for her. Well, seeing the rising graph of development in my sister I think that WhiteHat Jr. is actually one of the best coding educators in India and they do what they preach with sheer efficacy. Here is a like that might help you understand about WhiteHat Jr. : https://in.mashable.com/tech/7968/meet-these-indian-coders-as-young-as-six-who-are-shaping-up-a-powerful-digital-future ",

My brother is in class 11th (Commerce stream) along with the main subjects he has chosen IT as his elective subject. He is not much interested in commerce subjects like Accounts, business studies, economics, etc. but yes, he feels very cheerful while discussing with me and mom and dad about whatever new he is learning in IT. Looking towards his interest I discuss this with my comrade (Abhibhan Pillai), without a second thought he suggested me to go for WhiteHat Jr. an online platform which he has also opted for his nephew(Jeyasilan Pillai). He explained me in brief about tremendous changes in competency level of his nephew after joining beginners course at WhiteHat Jr. in logic, structure, sequence and algorithmic thinking--to generate creative outcomes eg. animations and apps. I attended demo class at WhiteHat Jr. online platform along with my brother sitting next to him. The tutor explained very well about highlights of WhiteHat Jr like 1:1 teaching pattern, Expert curriculum designed according to different age groups, refund facility, immediate query response, flexible class timings, and above all motive of empowering the next generation to become creators rather than becoming consumers. Obviously it matters when a student received special attention while learning something of his keen interest which has been specially designed by experts considering different age groups. Further, we began with intermediate course at WhiteHat Jr. just one week ago. I can't explain in words that how gleeful was my brother at first day of his online class at Whitehat Jr., that he finished his school assignments just in half of the time than he normally takes to complete. It\u2019s been one week now he is successfully pursuing the course curriculum without any hassle and doubts are cleared by the tutors instantaneously. I love to hear his tales daily related to his new learning after office hours. ",

            "answer_text": "I had a personal experience regarding this WhiteHat Jr. courses. I advised my sister to try out coding classes for my niece, as I thought it would be helpful with her future. But my niece had no interest in sitting before a computer and listening something. She had a very short attention span, and many activities disinterested her. She\u2019ll just walk off if she loses her interest in a particular activity. In such a case, I thought she will definitely walk out of these online classes, and waste some money. But I asked my sister to give it a shot, as they had a free trial. We enrolled our niece in the free trial, and started our classes. The first day class was fun, dealing with what is coding, and just a warm up session. And on the following days, we observed that the course interested my niece a little bit. For some reason, she didn\u2019t stray from the lesson videos. As days went on, she became more and more interested, glued to the concept of coding, and trying out the activities they provide in the online classes, even after the class was finished. This came as a huge surprise to me and my sister, as we wondered how they could catch her attention through an online class. My niece said that she liked the teacher very much, and she found the course \u2018fun\u2019. I was astounded to hear this, and understood that this platform had some serious work done behind building the curriculum, and enrolled my niece in the beginner program. She became more and more interested, and is now actually coding her way into making apps. I believe that this is a good platform, where students can learn personalized coding classes, suiting their tastes and needs. I will also recommend your kid to try it out too. ",

The organisation's sole motive is to preach among the crowd about the creativity that coding brings along with it. It is not unknown to you how important and essential the knowledge of programming languages and the ability to code has been . Also looking at the factors that coding contributes to your creativity and Ideation process , it becomes a really good choice to opt. A lot of your kids are going to be working in the same sector, and I say this since I know and we all know how Technology has started to supersede manpower. White hat jr. is devoted to provide coding courses online so that \u00b7 Needy people get to know about the course in the comfort of their home \u00b7 A need to teach kids since their childhood is sighted by them \u00b7 It promotes creativity , ideation process ,though process and the concentration of kids. \u00b7 It makes children have a greater vision. They have divided their curriculum into 4 parts as well . You see to unscrew each srew ,you require a differently sized screwdriver. Just like that if the curriculum is divided according to the age of students , it really helps in their better learning. Dividing the course curriculum into parts so that the kids evolving at such a high rate get what they desire based on their then abilities. Some friends of mine have tried giving the courses to their younger brothers and they have sort of liked it. Service seems fine. Trial class is free by the way. Instead of reading this message you just try it out on your own. Top 1% of the kids also get a chance to travel all the way to silicon valley and pitch in their ideas which again ,I guess is a whole lot of exposure provided to these kids. Well ,I may say this since I \u2018ve had only positive experiences there , you can have your experience and then accordingly make your choices. Got check it out yourself !! Great day !! Hope you are safe !! The telegraph uploaded this .Do skim through once,might be helpful WhiteHat Jr shows how to make coding child\u2019s play  ",

            "answer_text": "Games, robots, applications, mobiles all fascinate kids a lot. The latest technologies are making everything readily available at your doorstep just within a click, this doesn\u2019t imply only for your household things but also for everything from pin to planes. We are getting so much habitual of using technology that we want everything in hand as early as possible. Numerous online and offline platforms are coming in existence to prepare the next generation from very age of 5-6 years as the next high tech platforms creator. Astonished when I come to know after reading that experts believe that this is the best age for kids, to begin with, learning to code. I wonder how come parents will agree with this as at this age they are not even ready to send their kids to kinder garden or schools so this is really very tough to engage them in coding. But the logic, exploration and phenomenal research done by experts is very much sufficient to guide parents about to modify decisions about the interest of their kids rather than guide them and let them decide what they want. This is not mandatory that every time they will seek your advice. Ok fine do one thing ask your kids with only overall information about coding that is he/she interested in coding or not. If he/she will say yes then no need to complicate the things by saying it is tough, you won't be able to cope up with it, etc, etc . rather if interest has been shown parents just have to find out a best possible way to develop their interest in that. Like I get this revert from my son unknowingly and believe me I Find out the best online platform for him i.e Whitehat Jr. for him to learn coding. He is performing great. ",

Recently I had seen this website White Hat Jr. which introduces coding for kids. I would like to share some views and experience on it. Being an engineer our life always lands up spending on going parallel with technology and staying in tuned with upcoming thoughts. So after seeing this website White Hat Jr. I was amazed to see very creative mode of teaching kids how to code, keeping this course available for kids from age group of 6-18 years.  Also they have 4 different modules. Starting with beginners to professional level. So I got my nephew enrolled for this free trail course for intermediate level. Where she develops interest in moving ahead with python for which this can help her go ahead with web development and even app development. This made her sharp and confident in learning. How effectively she has been handling her studies and extra subject (programming language) makes me very happy to see her grow this way and be a passionate designer. Why can't your child develop interest in coding and learn coding when my nephew can!! My nephew gets inspired to learn more continuing with White Hat Jr. as they motivate and offer perks like certificates and opportunity to participate in new upcoming challenges. Hope this enlightens your kids too. ",

            "answer_text": "Whitehat Jr. courses are very well structured, unique, and precisely designed. Those who are not interested in coding are a separate matter but those who are interested and can be interested with little more awareness, for them I highly recommend Whitehat Jr. coding sessions to learn coding. Dear parents when it comes to the selection of attire, perfumes or even for bathing soap for kids you become very choosy and select the best which is soft, cozy, comfortable with exceptional quality then how can we become so lenient and unaware about something which can improve competency, aptitude and let kids be the designer of their own future. With this thought, I tried to comprehensively go through every module of WhiteHat Jr. curriculum to check if it is worth or not for the engagement of kids. I found Grade one kids will learn to build their own computer games with logic and abstraction, Grade 2-3 kids will build art and single-character games with code. Grades 4-6 kids will build Games & Apps with Full UI/UX Interface. GRADES 7-9 minor will design entrepreneur-ready games and apps with Object-Oriented Code. Grades 10-12+ mature will Learn Artificial Intelligence and can utilize it in fields of human exploration like Space-Tech, Self-Driving cars & Life Tech. WhiteHat Jr team has understood the innocence of kids age and the integrity of the designation to teach coding to kids so well resulting kids are getting interactive and contended live teaching sessions which are making them feel that coding is more like playing games with just one click or movement on a mouse pad. After practically experiencing the seriousness and the eccentric approach of the WhiteHat Jr team to serve with best efforts is making it the first choice of parents and kids to learn coding. ",

The more inexperienced ones will begin from beginner level at that point and advance to the following levels as they complete around 144 classes each at 3 classes for every week. More established children can begin at the level fitting for the age and their coding abilities level. For 6 to 7 year kids, they have beginners course in which the kids can learn block coding and basic concepts of coding using fun games and puzzles. For 7 to 8 years, they have intermediate course in which kids are taught to make simple games and apps for themselves. For 8 to 11 years age group, they have advanced course in which your kids are made ready to make some useful apps, games and websites from their own choice. Last, for 11 to 14 years, they have professional level course in which your kids can learn coding in deep and may add their skill in resume also because after professional course they will be able to use coding in any field as they are also taught Artificial intelligence and simulation. WhiteHat Jr. will organize \"Silicon Valley Challenge,\" where kids will participate with their apps to solve a real-life problem. Winners of the competition will get a chance to visit Silicon Valley. I hope I have answered your question\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "If I had to answer this question in a single word I would just say that the courses offered by WhiteHat Jr. are the BEST. And I am able to say this, as I have closely experienced to this. But what makes you all believe that, right? Let me just tell you from basic about how is a company and how is it working! So originally WhiteHat Jr is Mumbai based Edtech startup by Karan Bajaj, former CEO of Discovery Network. He invested his 5 years on research with the alumni of IIT, IB and MIT and launched a solid curriculum for kids ranging between 6-18 years. This broader concept of online coding classes becomes more of worth when it is specifically designed for kids and had hard segregation of curriculum. You might be thinking why is there the need for dividing the course according to age, that hardly makes any changes, right? But this is not it, kids have tender minds. We need to be extra careful when it's about our kids as we need to make sure that whatever we are feeding them is suitable for them and you all might be aware of a quote that 'Everything has a right time'. Therefore this division of curriculum is made so that kids learn things accordingly. (1) BEGINNER CURRICULUM (GRADE 1):- Build Your Own Ruled Computer Games with Logic & Abstraction. (2) INTERMEDIATE CURRICULUM (GRADES 2-3) Build Advanced Art & single-character Games with code (3) ADVANCED CURRICULUM (GRADES 4-6) Build Commercial-Ready Games & Apps with Full UI/UX Interface (4) PROFESSIONAL CURRICULUM (GRADES 7-9) Build full entrepreneur-ready games and apps with Object-Oriented Code. (5) APPLIED TECH CURRICULUM (GRADES 10-12+) Learn Artificial Intelligence (AI) in frontier fields of human exploration like Space-Tech, Self Driving cars & Life Tech They also go through a stringent selection process for teacher candidates that kids learn under top 0.01 % of early kids coding experts. Thus, coding can be fun if you get proper guidance therefore I believe WhiteHat Jr is an ideal place for your kids to learn coding. Toodles ",

I would say I was impressed after attending the class. There were certain unique offerings of this platform which I really appreciated and based on which I decide to enroll for a Professional curriculum for my daughter.

Coding has become a vital part of our lives. It is known to be future literacy, so you must enrol your child to learn to code. There are numerable online platforms, my personal favourite is WhitHat Jr. My sister enrolled her son with WhiteHat Jr. I was overwhelmed to hear her feedback about them. She told me how her son has become focused and can complete all his tasks with utmost dedication. She also bragged about an app that her son created. Isn\u2019t it amazing how children can develop apps that even adults can\u2019t?  So I researched about this platform and was astonished to discover how awe-inspiring this site is. WhiteHat Jr. hires the top 0.01% of certified teachers after a rigorous five-step selection. I believe that their 1:1 online live class helps your child to have a healthy relationship with his teacher, enabling him to ace this field. They not only allow your child to use codes in real-time but also provides many opportunities beyond their course. They organize competitions like the Hackathon where your child can compete with others for gifts. Not only this, but they also provide an opportunity for some students to pitch their ideas to venture capitalists of Silicon Valley. We all know how coding has transformed the world and has become an important aspect of our kids' future. So I would recommend you, to not waste much time and enrol your child with WhiteHat Jr. They are worth every penny. ",

            "answer_text": "WhiteHat Jr. is an online site for kids that teaches them coding. I came across it when my friend at IIT suggested me about it and suggested me to have a look at it. My younger brother(Abhiram) had an interest in computer programming but had never tried it out. When I went through the site, I found it quite exciting and going back home in the vacations, I told my brother about WhiteHat Jr. At first, he refused by saying that it was a pretty ordinary site like others and why should he enroll in it. But as I had gone in detail about the site I knew clearly how interesting and useful it is for students of his age and finally convinced him for at least a trial session before opting for the actual course. Both of us sat down and attended the demo session and my brother\u2019s mind was completely changed after attending the session. He was so deeply influenced by the mentors that the other day he got enrolled himself in the Beginner's course and now today after 2 years I can proudly say that he has become a Master Coder and is currently working on two apps in developmental phase with his other friends he met on the site. Talking about the website, I would say that when you look at their courses on their website, you will see that it is divided into 4 different categories: beginner (grade 1), intermediate (grades 2-3), advanced (grades 4-6), and professional (grades 7-9) which are designed such that the child could develop his skills naturally and not in a haste. The main thing which I want to mention about WhiteHatJr. is that it helps the students develop their own passion without forcing them about the highest-paid courses they should opt for. Here, students are mentored in a 1:1 live interactive session and are also taught about the use of coding in future times. As per my experience, I believe that WhiteHat Jr. aims for making the students ready for future technologies and empower them to be creators rather than consumers of Technology. ",

Parents keep on their kids busy in so many vocational activities sometimes during vacations and once in a while along with their studies. Courses of WhiteHat Jr. have been designed by qualified experts for kids\u2019 development just to overcome the rigid academic educational system. Education never bound you to limitation rather it open ups all the boundaries and brings you to flow flawlessly. By keeping in mind different age groups they have created customized course curriculum patterns for different age groups and come up with the hands-on solutions to make them industry-ready. Further Whitehat Jr. learns different coding concepts, numbers, mathematical operations, units of measurements and develops spatial reasoning. Kids combine logic and abstraction to experiment, stumble, debug, and create commercial-ready apps and games. Standardized learning systems emphasize peer acceptance, severely restricting independent thought and creative trajectories. Whitehat Jr\u2019s Applied-Tech course equips them to apply the skills of the next century. Sometimes I think that they have selected something unusual to do for the development and in field of creativity for kids. As just imagine how tough it is to understand psychology of kids of 6 years and design something which can be very interactive, effective, fruitful and engaging for them. They must have really break hard nuts to design something incredible like WhiteHat Jr online platform which is trying to hold the agile heart of these innocent creations and keep them involved in something which is going to give a shape to their mindset and future. My curiosity to engage my son in something different leads me to study coding platforms although he is very small right now after 2 years for sure he will be joining as a beginner in the coder's group.

Astonished when i came to know after reading that experts believe that this is the best age for kids, to begin with learning to code. I wonder how some parents will agree this as at this age they are not even ready to send their kids to kinder garden or schools so this is really very tough to engage them in coding. But the logic, exploration and phenomenal research done by experts is very much sufficient to guide parents about to modify decisions about the interest of their kids rather than guide them and let them decide what they want. This is not mandatory that every time they will seek your advice. Ok fine do one thing ask your kids with only overall information about coding that is he/she interested in coding or not. If he/she will say yes then no need to complicate the things by saying it is tough, you won\u2019t able to cope up with it etc. WhiteHat Jr Live Online Coding for Kids | WhiteHat Jr. for them to learn coding is a great platform.

            "answer_text": "Create a Special Environment for Students and Faculty Your institution and program offerings define your platform\u2019s unique learning experience. Online programs must show the distinctive characteristics of the faculty, student community, and the university for students to feel as though they belong to it. Your online platform should capture the essence of what it is like to be a student at your school. This means while physical branding plays a part, it is important that your faculty\u2019s personalities, and the rigorous course content your school is known for, becomes palatable online. It is essential that students feel like the same factors that make your university\u2019s classroom learning successful go into the distance learning experience as well.  Be Outcome-Focused and Fix Student Expectations Online students have the expectation that the level of education and skills they receive in your online program are similar to those of on campus program. Online programs and courses that are designed without first establishing a lucid set of learning objectives risk lessening their effectiveness and overall value if students don\u2019t graduate with the skills needed to achieve their goals. Make sure your program has merit by outlining desired learning outcomes for each course, then determine how they can be taught most effectively online. These are the important features to have a good online course set in a platform. WhiteHat Jr. complies with all those expectations. And even sometimes, exceeds them. Try out their free trial and check them out for your own. Have a great experience coding! ",

            "answer_text": "WhiteHat Jr. is an online site for kids that teaches them coding. I came across it when my friend at IIT suggested me about it and suggested me to have a look at it. My younger brother(Abhiram) had an interest in computer programming but had never tried it out. When I went through the site, I found it quite exciting and going back home in the vacations, I told my brother about WhiteHat Jr. At first, he refused by saying that it was a pretty ordinary site like others and why should he enroll in it. But as I had gone in detail about the site I knew clearly how interesting and useful it is for students of his age and finally convinced him for at least a trial session before opting for the actual course. Both of us sat down and attended the demo session and my brother\u2019s mind was completely changed after attending the session. He was so deeply influenced by the mentors that the other day he got enrolled himself in the Beginner's course and now today after 2 years I can proudly say that he has become a Master Coder and is currently working on two apps in developmental phase with his other friends he met on the site. Talking about the website, I would say that when you look at their courses on their website, you will see that it is divided into 4 different categories: beginner (grade 1), intermediate (grades 2-3), advanced (grades 4-6), and professional (grades 7-9) which are designed such that the child could develop his skills naturally and not in a haste. The main thing which I want to mention about WhiteHatJr. is that it helps the students develop their own passion without forcing them about the highest-paid courses they should opt for. Here, students are mentored in a 1:1 live interactive session and are also taught about the use of coding in future times. As per my experience, I believe that WhiteHat Jr. aims for making the students ready for future technologies and empower them to be creators rather than consumers of Technology. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this question I would like to post the article I wrote earlier. A.I., M. L. And data science courses for kids \u00a9 Bhushan Vardhekar AI, ML, Data Science related courses are currently considered as the most appropriate job oriented courses. At present, the overall education policy is being changed at the national level and the online virtual marketplace for teaching programming, coding, etc. becoming hyper to attract parents and their children. This is definitely at a loss for school going children. What once was in the field of engineering colleges, or even worse, will be in the field of AI, ML, data science such trendy courses. Because of the way in which marketing is being done there is no option other than AI, ML, Data Science courses to get new high paying jobs. This is a kind of blind propaganda. My personal opinion is that long ago in Maharashtra MSCIT courses were conducted and failed to cope up with ongoing job demand then. Same way these AI, ML, Data Science courses will be going to decline to cope up with new trends in the upcoming job market. This is because of the background that is required to understand AI, ML, data science is not often overlooked. Whether you know how to code or program to solve problem using coumputer, you are taught temporary tricks on how to use some popular libraries and how to operate on which data to get results. Similarly likewise MS Office packages many office tools are present. Any basic computer course teaches us how to use those tools and what to do using the office utilities for typical desktop office work. The courses for AI, ML, Data Science would taught such similar workaround usage of existing tools. Nowadays there are stereotype data models being taught and built in project or in application. Today, people in any field are building many libraries to find out if some implementation can be done through AI, ML, Data Science for research and make many changes in it and make it available for others to use on open platform. Basic researchers are making invaluable contributions. These libraries are used to solve new questions every day. Some application specific frameworks are used to solve specific problems. Some programming languages \u200b\u200boffer supportive and derived packages. They can be used to solve real time problems after customization in existing libraries. Of course those who have already used a programming platform to solve a real life problem do not need to learn much new just AI, M.L. Corresponding algorithm or technique could be learned and used. At the same time, if you understand many basic concepts of mathematics, you can use them to create solutions then AI ML is much easier to deal with. Considering all this, there are two main factors that needed to be considered, such as how to use AI, ML, etc., and the details of the field in which real life problems exist. The current market is engaged in building an army that is only aware of AI, ML, data science, etc., without considering the basics. Those who have completed their college education have been tempted by this virtual market, can have such job oriented courses for getting jobs. Not needed for kids at all. But at present, after the national education policy is in picture many portal claiming every child has to learn coding from childhood as future job market is full of such requirements. it is not true that most of the next generation jobs needed only AI ML support. Many parents are being trapped by the pull of advertisements of coding genius. Basically in India only urban educated people are often deceived because they are effectively hypnotized as they have a lot of purchasing capacities. The overall system has been developed such that the people in the urban then from rural areas always got looted. People who are suffering from poverty is never aware of such so called waves in education. This will affect those who can spend extra amount for child education. At an age when brain improvements are happening so such period is not for feeding plug n play course content of AI ML and Data Science. They needed to be explored in other activities to nurture their overall growth. Imposinng forcefully to coding will rise intellictual slavery in future. If this persists, the next generation of donkey workers will start to emerge with only clerical programming \"Do as Directed\" type jobs. Understanding questions, root cause analysis of the problems needed to be taught for AI ML aspirants. School going children are never suitable for these things. To learn about the causes of a problem and different methods to solve them at least formal education of respective field is much needed. The stupid companies working in education sector ruining the overall aspect of coding and programming. Claiming coding genius would be created in low age upto 15 years after teaching AI ML Data Science courses. It is always worst thing for that generation. Situation and requirement is most important to learn a particular problem. Then solution or resolution can be found based on the earlier experiences. School going children needed to be explored for fundamental aspects of respective fields. Languages, Maths and science basics would be good to teach. Efforts should be made for the children growth in all aspects of fields. In future an army of coding genius would be used as AI ML model to solve the problems. The Indian market is one of the best in the world to dump anything that is not needed for rest of the world. In such an environment, it is not possible to live without the turmoil in the education field. In fact Education sector is supposed to be Service but it became Business and all wrong things started happening. Take a look at a simple example. Many video tutorials on various topics related to school education are available for free on YouTube. Although there is a lot of similar content available on many similar portals, web channels for free of cost, many online portals claim that they have created and set up exclusive educational content into the market. In fact most of the content is regenerated or recreated by copying existing setup. During the Corona period, there was a flood of such things. Many competitive websites are available for free for coding practice. Who study with proper planning and emphasis on the essentials strategies, can have good utilization of such open source material. Children going to school needed to ask to use proper available content under parental guidance. The prospective customers are nothing but these parents who are cheated by so called coding genius advertisements. In the future, urban school children will be the biggest consumer market. The impact will be less in rural areas as the good internet system, which will run continuously, has not yet arrived. Current is based on mobile internet in villages. In places like Pune, people come from rural areas to prepare for MPSC UPSC and then become permanent customers of this market. Due to influence of the motivational speeches delivered by eminent personalities students from rural areas motivativated to come to the city and get dumped in the intrusion of competition. Something similar will happen in the future of certified unemployed like AI, ML, Data Science aspirants. Just as a gang of contractors arrives at the labor base in the morning and picks up the laborers like the wholesale goods as required, some of the certified labor bases in the IT sector will be seen at the crossroads. So called Coding Expert in children will be in the same situation as a certified coder who is immersed in urban industrialization. The basic concepts of a field should be well understood and taught how to use it, how to solve problems in daily life and how to find solutions differently from retrospective experience. But we do not know the difference between blind imitation and following. The most important part of AI, ML Data Science is the study of how to use experience data, categorized data and processed data to create models. Based on this, we have to understand the models made by experts in different fields to study and develop something new. This requires comprehension and minimum academic proficiency. For that, it is important to have basic knowledge of any field. Being certified and being qualified are two different things. A new generation of slaves is being formed by creating a pull of coding genius as donkey workers. The natural way of thinking should be cultivated. Such a process is formed and implemented in school life. It needs to happen. Time and attention is must to mature the brain, thought process and decision making sense. Parents are falling prey to delusions and throwing their children into the pit of future insecurity. Knowledge of the computer science field is not the only requirement for AI, ML, Data Science. The study (or at least understanding) of disciplines like psychology, biology, health sciences, logic is much necessary. People who understand multi-disciplinary branches can solve problems in this area very well. People with clerical knowledge of programming can only temporarily provide solutions or resolution to the problems faced. Such clerical masses can look for different options of education depending on the different paths ahead. Because today's clerical masses are at least degree holders. These masses can try their luck in different areas of employment. But in the future, a generation of coding geniuses will be less likely to try their luck. The future effects of Digital India's rate are not to be overlooked. After Corona, there is a huge market for online education, internet-based employment opportunities and more. The available customers have been taken into consideration. It is not a new thing in our country to trap our customers in a fraudulent market by showing the lure of prosperity. Accompanied by self-proclaimed experts, the chances of fraud are strong. It is important to think about what is needed and what is required. However, the current market formula is to force customers to buy the things. People with a lack of understanding and a society with so much useless attention always fall victim to exploitation. As far as education is concerned, no one is looking back to spend more for better and strong career options in future. Especially the parents having capacities to spend more are a prime source of customers for companies to focus. To take advantage of this, greedy traders in the hollow market set up traps and sit down to pick such stupid blind customers. Society's prestige is one another aspect of such parents to show off their children are getting good facilities. Impressing people on social media is not so difficult these days. This is more dangerous for the middle class who are always influenced by comparing oneself to others. The biggest market share of such business strategies to influence such prospective customers by different tactics. Today, the situation is such that virtual education is trying to emerge like coding and programming is one and only field of career for future. In fact it is not true in all sense. Programming and coding is needed to solve the problems using computers. While all areas are in a state of decline due to corona situation. Many capitalists looking this as a business opportunity to grab attention spreading fake news regarding national education policy are demanding coding and programming in school education. School education business is a never ending field as everyone wants to have a good education for their children. As Industry 4.0 is emerging and trying to fix its roots in developing countries so the whole world is demanding AI ML Data Science related experts. It is purposefully spreaded that AI ML will be ultimate career options for the future. It is true that Industry 4.0 is going to revolutionize the world. But it is very cruel to make a business model to trap kinds and their parents in the name of coding genius. After any industrial revolution, there was an upheaval in the society. It has some advantages and disadvantages. The branches of art, commerce and science have once been very influential for many generations. Therefore, in accordance with Industry 4.0, appropriate changes have been made in our national education policy. They are certainly welcome. But it is not right to force children to learn coding. There are so many demerits of such enforcement. The two branches of mathematics (Pure and applied) and science will reach the grassroot level to build qualified professionals. The main focus of any education system to deal with right implementation of such teaching and learning strategies in school education. In the current scenario only private schools offer good science and math education in schools for high costs. Government aided schools fail to nurture kids in schooling. This is the fault of our systems. It is important to create expert teachers to teach them first. It is a great tragedy of our country that our plans are very revolutionary but they fall short in implementation. In the case of kids going to acting workshops at summer vacation camps, there is a sweet misconception among parents that my kid will grow up as a very good actor, and somehow, as shown in a coding genius advertisement these days, parents think my kid will grow up and innovate remarkable things in IT and Computer field and became future Bill Gates or Steve Jobs and so on. This is ridiculous. Everything that was invented at that time was based on that situation and its necessity. The available conditions and tools were studied. Therefore, it is important to learn what tools can be used to analyze the root causes of the problems we currently have. Among those tools AI, ML Data Science related tools that can be used. AI ML filed is so vast and huge. It has been developing since decades. To understand its importance and its application to society the formal education of any field is must. A thorough study of what is available before that is needed. If someone is working in the field of marketing, then digital marketing for business growth could be the next domain to explore and would have exponentially grown. In such cases the study of how to reach more people using these new tools having AI ML applications is good to be taught. It is necessary to study and teach how to use existing frameworks and the limitations of the same so that new innovations would happen. In order to learn some things, one has to have an innate understanding and from time to time he has to come to it. Only then will people take advantage of the opportunities available for that skill. This awareness comes to everyone. Some people do through introspection and plan for kid education. But In India blind followers run a big chunk of the market. This will ruin the future generation in the name of so called geniuses in AI ML. Give time for the intellectual growth of the children. At present it is not advisable to push kids into the rat race for coding. ",

            "answer_text": "Me, being in the IT sector always felt \"How nice would it be if I learned coding from schooling!\" In the lockdown period when I was stuck home with family, my nephew was fascinated to know what exactly I work... You know 11-year-olds interested in technology (computers etc)  So I looked up online to get him engaged in some coding if it was possible. And, I came across soo many websites that provide such classes. But I really liked WhiteHatJr's online platform. They give out 1-to-1 online classes with certified teachers. where the kids will get proper attention. & they provide classes way more than coding eg. To creating animations, apps, websites, etc... So, I booked a few trials for my nephew. Yes, they even give out a few trials but with limited seats. & then, got him enrolled in the classes. He seems to really enjoy it all... It's really nice to see 'Kids learning Coding.' So, I really recommend you to go with WhiteHatJr\u2019s courses for kids. All the best! :) Image source: Google (looks similar to my nephew) ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking from my personal experience and feedback from my younger brother, I would say that WhiteHat Jr. courses are one of a kind and fun to engage with. My brother is in the 7th grade, and he is currently undertaking the App Developer Certificate (48 classes) under the Professional curriculum for Classes 7, 8 and 9. The decision to opt for WhiteHat Jr.\u2019s classes when compared to other alternatives available on the internet (for instance, Vedantu, Coding Elements, Codecademy, Khan Academy, etc.) was taken after much deliberation at the start of the lock-down to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. My brother was looking for ways to spend his time productively, and wanted to take up a new skill that would prove to be useful in the not-so-distant future. We inquired about WhiteHat Jr. (which we had seen as an advertisement on social media) to friends, family and acquaintances, and we received positive feedback about the company and the courses offered. The courses follow a 1:1 ratio, and the coding sessions are live and interactive. The faculty are from eminent institutions and are from the Top 99 percentile of their respective fields. They are trained to explain seemingly confusing and complicated concepts to children as young as six or seven, in an elementary manner. The activities are gamified and the projects are extremely engaging and of international standards. Their pedagogy is one of a kind, and they are committed to keeping up their promise. I would urge you to go through their website, articles by popular media outlets and testimonials on YouTube or other review websites, so as to make an informed decision. ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly parents wonder that if learning to code is really useful at an age between 6-14 years or not. 6 years is an age when kids begin with standard 1st wherein they hardly understand how to manage themselves to sit in the class at that moment. My heart comes out with the thought that if we will overburden them with one new complex subject of coding along with other important subjects then it will be tough for them to go about it. Further, I am concerned if these online and offline platforms dedicated enough to take care of kids and make them study without exhausting them or not? Next, I don\u2019t feel that all kids are having the same tendency, adaptability to learn coding. Sometimes kids are not getting an appropriate study atmosphere at home therefore sending them school makes them follow a schedule, become punctual and dedicated. Above all concerns were taking my steps back to initiate something with an approach to make my kid learn to code until I have met with WhiteHat Jr. team. I met with one member of team WhiteHat Jr. unknowingly at an after seminar party. Wherein I put all my concerning points in front of them to discuss which they begin to answer one by one. Firstly knowledge of kids is nowhere associated with age numbers, complete research chart was explained to me showing minute brain study of kids that the proposed age to teach coding to kids is the duration when their level of creativity is at its height. Secondly, they have structured curriculum as per different age groups, thirdly they want to design future creators. Lastly they find out only playful ways to bring coding into existence for kids. They concluded never to force your kids towards coding rather make them aware and wait till they themselves approach you for that. ",

I wanted to study different approaches to teach programming languages to my students online, as I am habituated to teach with the whiteboard and marker and teaching online was one of the necessities of the time in the pandemic. I was impressed with the website of whitehat jr. It was user friendly and informative.The course structure was designed by IIT and IB trained professionals. The class timings were flexible, which I felt was the best thing about it. The teaching approach was friendly and joyful. The courses include different interesting factors according to the age of the child and the difficulty level goes on increasing with each lesson completed. To know more, I booked a trial session for my niece who is in 4th grade. I was happy to see how whitehat manages to focus on developing the logic building ability of students by providing them ample amounts of assignments. It helps affect the IQ of the kid in a positively. It develops problem-solving ability through creative thinking.I also tried checking the reviews on different social platforms and guess what! they are satisfactory. I was amazed by the 5 levels of the candidate selection process for appointing the most eligible candidate to teach coding to kids. It went as I expected, and I enrolled my niece. It is amazing how they keep children motivated by awarding them with beautiful badges and hats. I am very happy with their teaching techniques. Searching on the internet and selecting what you want is a very subjective thing. One can only give suggestions. I chose the best for me and my niece. Hope you find this answer helpful. ",

Years rolled on, and now is the era when coding has emerged out as a mandatory skill to land upon a great job. This scenario has compelled the parents to think about introducing the concepts of coding to kids at a very little age. Many parents are seen searching and enquiring about which are the best coding courses for their kids. After some research over the web, I think I\u2019m now eligible to answer this question. I went into searching for some of the best coding courses for the kids, where I came across the platform called Whitehat Jr. online coding platform. Their website has all the relevant information required for their courses and teaching. Whitehat Jr. believes that kids\u2019 of ages 5-6 age are the most creative. Thus, teaching and learning the newer concepts of coding becomes easy for the kids of this age. So, Whitehat Jr. offers programming courses for kids of ages 6-14. Interestingly, the courses have been made highly engaging for the kids to enjoyably focus on learning. Not only basic coding, but also advanced concepts of mobile application and games development, robotics, AI, ML, and much more are taken up at Whitehat Jr. Unlike sitting in a crowd of 50 students, and lacking proper attention to the mentors, the teaching a pattern of Whitehat jr ensures that every kid is given equal attention and importance during the entire course. Parents and kids are also invited to attend demo classes at Whitehat Jr. before enrollment and fees payment. This is highly helpful in knowing the exact teaching methodology, and check if the courses offered will be helpful to the kids or not. ",

They are holding kids at every crucial point of age when it is required proper support and guidance for them regarding future. I literally found Whitehat Jr methodologies as really helpful to keep our kids engaged in doing something creative and different. When the question is about career then passion is primary and money is secondary. Therefore, parents should have a check about likings and disliking of their kids so that accordingly they can come up to be a helping hand on the way to their dreams and aspirations. I would say that WhiteHat Jr is moving towards bringing a great change in the teaching methodologies and curriculum for kids which will be more on practical than cramming. ",

I heard a lot about Whitehat jr. and decided to book a trial class for my son, within 24 hours the trial class was arranged and my son was satisfied and he decided to enroll in the app development program. It has just been a few months and his interest in app development is astonishing. His teacher, Ms. Meenakshi is also very cooperative and understands my son\u2019s learning pattern and gives undivided attention to his progress and mistakes. A few days back he has published his first application on Google play store and seeing his progress I feel proud. Overall my experience with Whitehat jr. is highly positive. They have courses curated for different age groups 1.Beginner- For kids in grade 1. 2.Intermediate- For kids in grade 2 and 3 3.Advanced- For kids from grades 4 to 6. 4.Professional- For kids from grades 7 to 9. 5.Applied Tech- For kids in grade 10 and above. There are numerous programs like \"Introduction to coding\", \"App developer certificate\" and \"Advanced coding with space tech\" and many more. All the sessions are 1:1 so there is no scope of any doubts and since the curriculum is prepared by IIT alumni and IB professionals, kids stay ahead of their competition. I believe that Whitehat jr. is the best start a child can get for coding. ",

Using this platform, kids can use new tools to solve actual problems and create real solutions to real world issues. It's an incredibly powerful platform for children - and is becoming more important as children develop their critical thinking and spatial awareness, and we use the real-world apps to learn more about how children work and play with technology. And in the future, we, as adults, should hope to inspire young learners to innovate and be creative in making the world better. Kids are naturally curious and creative, and often times they want to explore a problem they've never encountered. However, finding creative solutions is not just for fun and games. We often find ourselves having to find a solution to a problem that is simply out of our hands. This often leads kids to believe they need to know some form of programming to solve that particular problem. The truth is there is a plethora of software out there to help out their personal development and develop their analytical thinking skills. However, I had never encountered a platform that thinks in the long-term development of children with tech until I came across WhiteHat Jr. ",

Disruptive platforms like WhiteHat Jr. are preparing this Gen Z to become creators of these advancements in fields like content creation, marketing, data science, cybersecurity, healthcare, etc. It's delightful to see kids learn to code and enhance their problem-solving and creative-thinking skills to solve imminent global problems.

Depending on your child\u2019s age and skill level, he can enroll in a coding course and advance through the years. It is not rushed and WhiteHat Jr. doesn\u2019t give out all the info and lessons to students in just one huge file or session. Teaching happens gradually so there\u2019s no information overload. This means that even if your child has zero idea on how coding works, he will eventually learn and become a master.  When you look at their curriculum on their website, you will see that it is divided into 4 different categories: beginner (grade 1), intermediate (grades 2-3), advanced (grades 4-6), and professional (grades 7-9). The category levels are quite self-explanatory so you shouldn\u2019t have any problems with that. ",

WhiteHat Jr. stood out for a couple of reasons. The staff and the structural organization of the platform are very professional. The curriculum is set according to skill sets and properly bite sized to make it easy for beginners to catch on and not lose interest. There are plenty of tasks and projects as the course progresses which boosts confidence and measures progress. Unlike many platforms, WhiteHat Jr. offers 1 on 1 tuition and they are very effective and productive. While it is undoubted that the teachers are very qualified and skilled, apart from the programming learning itself, my child is also more confident in his social life and is improving at school too. Besides, they offer a free trial so you could see for yourself if it's practical enough for you. Since every child is different and therefore their preferences differ, you have the option to trial first and then enrol your child as per their needs. What I personally found attractive about this platform is the fact that \u2013 their main aim is not only to teach coding and programming but rather also to equip the growing generation with the proper tools and knowledge to prosper in the future where technology will be at the core foundation of all organizations and structures. In schools and other websites, the lessons are very basic ideas of computing but at WhiteHat Jr. they take a more comprehensive approach. They are apparently also working to bring their curriculum to schools across India. In short, I would definitely recommend it. It\u2019s more than worth a try. ",
