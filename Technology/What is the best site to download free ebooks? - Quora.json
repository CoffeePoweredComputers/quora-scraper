            "answer_text": "I know everyone has their list of ebook sites on here, so as an avid reader im going to give my top 3 go to websites for free ebooks.  1. Top Shelf Book    Pros.Quality free ebooks.- while there are tons of sites that offer free ebooks the books at top shelf book tend to be of a better quality and more desirable to read No Sign up - One of the most annoying things a bookworm can encounter is to finally find the free ebook you want only to be met with a long sign up process to download it. User Friendly/Multi platform - Its amazing how sites can offer such a great service not make it easy for the user to access the content. top shelf book will still look beautiful and function perfectly no matter what device your on. Computer/Tablet/Phone Author Upload - If you have written a book and want to gain publicity as an author or just want to have your book read and reviewed by a large group of people, top shelf book allows authors to upload their books and have them published to the site. Cons. Book Availability - Top shelf is only about a year old, so its a fairly new site. While new books are added daily it still doesn't have the amount of books as an older ebook site would. 2 Project Gutenberg  Project Gutenberg is probably one of the most well know free ebooks sites around. For the most part they have a wide selection of classic ebooks (some written hundreds of years ago), however they do have a few books that are a little more recent. Pros.No Sign Up - All you need to do is find a book you like and download it directly to you device. No sign up required. Lot's Of Books - They have over 50,000 books available to download and over 100,000 through sites they partner with.cons.  Site Design/Not User Friendly - While Project Gutenberg is a great site to download free ebooks it can be the searching part that's unpleasant, especially if you're using anything other than a desktop or laptop. The design of the site is outdated and not responsive. 3. Amazon.com: Free Popular Classics  while this is usually my last choice amazon does have a section with free ebooks. pros.  Pretty good selection - While they don't have an enormous amount of free ebooks they do have some good books from up and coming authors. Cons.  Have to use kindle - I know there are many people that love kindle, but i enjoy reading on many devices and don't always want to have a kindle app on all of them. There is one app in particular that i like to read on and i cant download the free amazon books to the app because you can only download the books to the kindle app. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't have a specific site to download ebooks from but I have a trick that helps me find ebooks. Search \u201ctitle of the book filetype:pdf\u201d on Google and you'll probably find a pdf version of what you're searching (sometimes you don't get pdf of whatever you're looking for). Eg: The bell jar filetype:pdf Download it. Now go to google play books. General settings > check enable pdf uploading > open your downloaded pdf using play books. Congratulations! You now have an ebook which you can access offline and on any device of your choice. ",
