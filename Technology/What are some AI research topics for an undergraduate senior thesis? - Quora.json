            "answer_text": "A2A: It's very hard to answer this for someone without knowing a lot more about their interests, skill set, goals, and locally available facilities and advice.  If you are in university where there are some AI researchers, I would suggest you seek out some of these people and see what projects they might be able to suggest.  Or if you have made any AI contacts in summer jobs or other activities, they might have suggestions.  Unless you are super-brilliant, a project that is advised by someone with experience in the field will have greater potential and lower risks than anything you do all by yourself.  You will almost certainly find that you have re-invented the wheel, and possibly a square wheel at that. ",
