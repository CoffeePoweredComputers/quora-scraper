            "answer_text": "I\u2019m using 650W corsair 80+ Gold for last 7 years, it works brilliant, no noise, no stupidly glowing attractive LEDs(Which is kinda annoying thing to have), excellent finishing, well insulated cables for better protection from clamping into fan blades. I havent gone through new models of PSU, but I would suggest anyone to go for higher power rating if you have any idea of buying GPUs or water coolers, since even gold rated 650W which I have was only 85% efficient which means I received less than 650W of power supply overall. I hope this helps. ",
