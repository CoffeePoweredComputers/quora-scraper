            "answer_text": "Learn Python! Python is easy to use, powerful, and versatile, making it a great choice for beginners and experts alike. Python\u2019s readability makes it a great first programming language \u2014 it allows you to think like a programmer and not waste time understanding the mysterious syntax that other programming languages can require. For instance, look at the following code to print \u201chello world\u201d in Java and Python. Java: public class Main {\u00a0  public static void main(String[] args) {\u00a0     System.out.println(\"hello world\");\u00a0   }\u00a0}\u00a0Python: print(\u2018hello world\u2019)\u00a0Isn't it awesome? Instead of focusing on how to get your code to even run, you\u2019ll be able to focus on learning actual programming concepts. And once you have those tools under your belt, if you move on to other languages, you\u2019ll be able to easily understand a given piece of code. But don\u2019t think that because Python is easy to use it\u2019s a wimpy language. Python is incredibly powerful \u2014 there\u2019s a reason companies like Google, Dropbox, Spotify, and Netflix use it. The Dropbox desktop client is written entirely in Python, which speaks to its cross-platform compatibility. In addition to their desktop client, Dropbox\u2019s server-side code is in Python as well, making it the majority language used at the company. Google uses a mix of languages, with C++, Python, and now Go among them. Early on at Google, there was an engineering decision to use \u201cPython where we can, C++ where we must.\u201d Python was used for parts that required rapid delivery and maintenance. Then, they used C++ for the parts of the software stack where it was important to have very low latency and/or tight control of memory. Like Google, Spotify and Netflix use a mix of languages. Spotify uses Java heavily, but uses Python for things like their Web API and theirInteractive API console, which lets developers explore endpoints with an easy-to-use interface. Spotify also uses Python for data analytics and other non-customer facing processes, such as a DNS server recovery system, their payment system, and their label content management system. Netflix uses a mix of Java, Scala, and Python, and gives developers autonomy when choosing which language fits the problem best. Where do they use Python most? They heavily use Python and iPython in their real-time analytics group. If you take a look at these companies, you can see they benefit from Python for its ease of use and because it\u2019s great for rapid prototyping and iteration. You can also see that Python can be used for a wide variety of applications, and as you learn the basics of Python, you\u2019ll be able to create almost anything you want. Many great developers contribute daily to the Python community by creating Python libraries. These libraries can help you get started so that you don\u2019t have to write code to reinvent the wheel. So for example, if you want to do complex image processing, the Python Imaging Library will help you get started. Want to create games? PyGameis a Python game engine. If data science is your thing, SciPy is the library for you. Source: Why Python? - Code School Blog ",
