            "answer_text": "Nowadays, it seems like we\u2019re just about surrounded by some form of technology at all times. Most jobs even require a little bit of a background with computers, especially desk jobs and the like. While the majority of us are pretty confident in our abilities to work around a desktop, there are small details in plain sight that we don\u2019t always catch. Specifically, the different types of computer mice we work with. The Mechanical Mouse It used to be that the only type of computer mice was the mechanical mouse, which harbors a hard rubber ball within that translates its movements along a surface into information, which is then sent to the desktop and allows you to move the cursor around as you please. But, all good things must come to an end, as did this old tried and true mouse. The Optical Mouse The most common, and one you\u2019re probably using right now is the optical mouse, which is far more convenient than the mechanical mouse because instead of using a ball that could become dislodged, it uses an LED sensor to detect movements along a tabletop, which is of course sent off into the computer like the former. The Wireless Mouse Wireless mice come in two types, the infrared and the radio frequency. Both mice relay signals to a base station wired to the computer\u2019s mouse port. Considering they don\u2019t have a cord to directly connect them to the computer or laptop, both types also require batteries or some form of charging. Even with the small disadvantage of occasionally dying on you, they are very easy to carry around on the go if you\u2019re someone who travels a lot, and there\u2019s the added benefit of not having to deal with messy cordage tangles. Good stuff! The Trackball Mouse Similar to the function of the track pad on laptops, a trackball mouse looks a lot like a mechanical mouse placed upside down with the ball facing upwards that you\u2019d move manually with your thumb or index finger. While it definitely takes a while to get used to in comparison to its other mice mutations, but because it stays mostly stationary, it doesn\u2019t need a lot of room, and it likely wont tangle as much as others might. You don\u2019t really see many of these out in the wild any more. That\u2019s just a very very brief rundown of the different types of computer mice. ",

            "answer_text": "The different types of computer mouse are:::\u2014- Mechanical mouse: Houses a hard rubber ball that rolls as the mouse is moved. Sensors inside the mouse body detect the movement and translate it into information that the computer interprets.Optical mouse: Uses an LED sensor to detect tabletop movement and then sends off that information to the computer for merry munching.Infrared (IR) or radio frequency cordless mouse: With both these types, the mouse relays a signal to a base station wired to the computer\u2019s mouse port. The cordless mouse requires power, which comes in the form of batteries.A mouse with many buttons: The extra buttons can be programmed to do specific things, such as navigate the Web or turn pages when you\u2019re reading a document. The typical button-ified mouse has about five buttons.Trackball mouse: Like an upside-down mouse. Rather than roll the mouse around, you use your thumb or index finger to roll a ball on top of the mouse. The whole contraption stays stationary, so it doesn\u2019t need a lot of room, and its cord never gets tangled.Stylus mouse: Another mouse mutation enjoyed by the artistic type is the stylus mouse, which looks like a pen and draws on a special pad.Cordless 3-D mouse: This kind of mouse can be pointed at the computer screen like a TV remote.",
