            "answer_text": "Allow me to explain something first. Per country, it should take no more than 2 months to get the cases under control with complete lock down or strict restriction on movement. 2 months ( 8 weeks ) = 4 incubation cycles. you can certainly push it to 3 months if necessary. It\u2019s only effective if the entire country are to cooperate properly. If some people decide to give no shit about it, such as hosting a massive underground party or perhaps some religious leader decides to hold some religious event secretly, this lock down will be utterly useless because those who kept breaking the rule will keep reviving the infection. This is pure logic. You don\u2019t need to be a scientist to understand why the lock down in China is very successful and why other countries are now doing the same thing to varying degree. Immediately after the lock down, you will see new cases every day. These new cases might even increase daily. For the first incubation cycle, these people who are infected are those who are infected prior to lock down. After the first 14 days, if the lock down or restriction is done properly, you will see an immediate drop in new cases. The second incubation cycle are those who are infected by those in the first incubation cycle. These will mostly be those of same household, colleagues in essential service and those unfortunate ones who are infected by them. However, as lock down are usually followed by strict measures, such as social distancing, no loitering etc, being infected at community setting are very low. The 3rd & 4th cycle are mostly to eradicate those stray infections, people who perhaps broke the law and sneak away. People who perhaps spit at lift buttons or perhaps just sheer bad luck. By the end of the 4th Incubation cycle, the numbers will usually however are single digit or none and that\u2019s even if you have massive massive infection right now. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have 1 million cases right now or 1000. If the lock down is done properly, If everyone were to cooperate, new cases will be close to 0 at the end of 8 weeks or 0. The only problem for those with large numbers is that their healthcare will be overwhelm and you will see higher mortality rate, but aside that, if troops are deployed, or perhaps everyone just behave and follow the lock down measures, you can still get the infection rate down. If nothing is done, the rate will even shoot up higher and you will see higher mortality rate. The reason i\u2019m saying this is because all everyone needs to do, is a proper lock down or restriction for the next 2\u20133months. It is tough but once this is done, your country is safe. Is Covid-19 going to last until the end of the year 2020? Assuming everyone does this soon, by July or August, we should see a huge decline. However it will be impractical to assume every country will do that. Some are unable to. Some don\u2019t give a shit. Some tried but somehow failed miserably because certain parts of the country refuse to cooperate. When this occur, travel restrictions will be strict until vaccination or a cure comes up. This unfortunately will take another 12\u201318 months. If we are lucky, we could see them in 6\u201312 months but that\u2019s not practical to hope for. In short. COVID-19 effects will easily last till the end of the year. Your country may allow full freedom to roam internally, but travelling overseas and returning will MOST LIKELY be met with a 14 days quarantine or perhaps even a 21 days as there are isolated cases of people who only show symptom 21 days later. This however could be combated by a highly sensitive test but that also means that instead of a 14 day quarantine, maybe it\u2019s a 5 days with test, or perhaps just a test. Such will take place until the entire population or most people are vaccinated OR a highly effective cure are available OR the virus just someone dies off like SARS. One of them must occur for life to resume smoothly prior to the infections. Given the severity in some countries, you can expect the economy to take an extremely heavy toll. This may take a few years to recover. ",

In fact it\u2019s changing already; the Chinese have isolated three distinctly different versions of it, and if they have just in China where it started, then it\u2019s likely that there are another three or four varieties elsewhere around the world by now. By the end of 2020, COVID-19 will probably still be around, but it might well also have turned into versions -20, -21, -22, -23, -24, -25\u2026. . . . Okay, I looked at how they name it: COVID-19 means corona virus disease 2019, the name of the disease resulting from the virus called SARS-CoV2. So a new strain would have a new name \u2014 but the disease would be named after the year it pops up in. So I might just be right about COVID-21, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "As per whatever I have read so far, there are two ways in which the pandemic can end- 1. with the R0 for coronavirus being 5.7, at least 70\u201380% population gets infected such that the more host is available for the virus.  2. If we are able to come up with a vaccine. Unless we get the vaccine every government is trying to flatten the curve by the lockdowns. Now that might be working well but at a reduced rate of spread, it might take years before we hit the 70\u201380% infection rates. And again, the antibody might last only for 6 months(similar to flu) in those who are infected. Also, most of the countries have already reached a stage of community spread, so it will spread. Thus the only option left is how long can we sustain the lockdown before the pain of staying home becomes more than the pain of exposing population to infection. My personal view is that the lockdown would be removed partially. Most probably Whack-a-mole strategy will be implemented by dealing with hotspots and rapid spread. We should also be ready with multiple rounds of lockdown until the time we have the vaccine available. In short, yes we will be out of our houses before end of 2020, but will we be safe outside is the question to be asked. (This is my interpretation of the situation as reader of articles on coronavirus and I am in no way an expert in this topic!) ",

            "answer_text": "Michael Levitt sees \u201csigns of recovery\u201d as number of new cases drops everyday  Image source:Internet. The worst might be already over for the world as it deals with the coronavirus pandemic, says Michael Levitt, a Nobel laureate and Stanford biophysicist. \u201cThe real situation is not nearly as terrible as they make it out to be,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times. Levitt\u2019s statement assumes significance as he correctly predicted the trajectory that the coronavirus would take in China. After analysing the numbers in China from January, the biophysicist calculated that China would get through the worst of its coronavirus outbreak long before many health experts had predicted. Taking note that the number of new cases being reported each day have fallen, Levitt wrote in early February: \u201cThis suggests that the rate of increase in the number of deaths will slow down even more over the next week.\u201d As predicted, the number of deaths began decreasing every day. Subsequently, long before the world expected it, China is back up on its legs, with the most affected Hubei province all set to open up after more than two months of lockdown. In fact, he predicted a ballpark figure of around 80,000, with about 3,250 deaths, when others were calculating deaths in the range of millions. As of Tuesday, China has reported 3,277 deaths with 81,171 positive cases. Now he foresees a similar, tapering trend in the rest of the world. After analysing data from 78 countries that report more than 50 new cases everyday, he says there are \u201csigns of recovery\u201d in many of them. His calculation does not focus on the total number of cases being reported in a country, but the total number of new cases identified every day. Levitt notes that the number of new cases in countries like China and South Korea were consistently on a decline. \u201cNumbers are still noisy, but there are clear signs of slowed growth,\u201d he says. At the same time, the scientist acknowledges that his figures are messy and that the official case counts in many areas are too low because testing is spotty. But even with incomplete data, \u201ca consistent decline means there\u2019s some factor at work that is not just noise in the numbers,\u201d he notes. While his observation brings hope for millions of people across the world, Levitt emphasises on the significance of the ongoing mitigation efforts by countries. The social-distancing mandates are critical \u2014 particularly the ban on large gatherings \u2014 because the virus is so new that the population has no immunity to it, and a vaccine is still many months away. \u201cThis is not the time to go out drinking with your buddies,\u201d he warns. The goal needs to be better early detection\u2014not just through testing but perhaps with body-temperature surveillance, which China is implementing\u2014and immediate social isolation. In addition, he says that the anti-vaccination mentality of Italy was perhaps one of the strong reasons why the virus spread so rapidly in Italy. Getting vaccinated against the flu is important, too, because a coronavirus outbreak that strikes in the middle of a flu epidemic is much more likely to overwhelm hospitals and increases the odds that the coronavirus goes undetected. Levitt\u2019s observations are a cool breeze in such troubled times. The key, he says, is to control panic. \u201cIn the grand scheme, we\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d he says. The recipient of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2013 defies the doomsday predictions by various epidemiologists saying the data simply don\u2019t support such a dire scenario\u2014especially in areas where reasonable social distancing measures are in place. For him, the more pressing issue is the slowing economic activities caused by the coronavirus infections. Countries across the globe have halted economic activities, including production, with many instructed to work from home. The unorganised sector, including labourers and those dependent on daily wages, will stand to be the most affected as the world stares at a COVID-19 induced economic recession ",

Immunity comes two ways: By people getting the infection and survive. (Most people get it mild, but elderly people and those with some other illnesses like diabetic and high blood pressure may get it more severe - and very few not older and without other illness also get it severe - why we do not know.)By vaccine.
