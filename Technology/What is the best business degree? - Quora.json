            "answer_text": "You do not need a degree to start a business. You ever heard older people saying this : \u201cGet a degree , work for some years, save money and start a business\u201d. This phrase is the most mediocre advice given and received. 99% of those who received this advice and followed it in the intention to start a business one day never actually started a business in their life. Why ? Starting a business require skills that you need to learn , test and acquire. You can\u2019t actually get them from some classes or books. You can actually get those knowledge and skills from books . but if you do not execute them , its a waste. Selling and communicating skills are among the most important skills an entrepreneur should and must have. Don\u2019t miss out on management , team building and financial skills. Well , for me the no 1 aspect to start a business is the mentality. Mindset matters because your mindset is where your head is , guides everything else. Your mindset guides how well you can think big , how much you believe in your ability to succeed , how well you can think creatively and outside the box and whether you can really stick with this and stay motivated. Also , if your mindset is all junked up with limitations about who you are and what you can accomplish , you\u2019ll be finished before you even start. Getting a degree is good , but if it comes first to your mind when you plan to start a business , something is wrong. We are living in an era where every information are free and available with an internet connection. You should be someone who is able to learn things independently. If you need a teacher for everything , even for you to get started , you need to fix your mindset. A Business Degree is good for management ? A CS degree is good for coding ? Or you want a degree to become a subject matter expert in a particular field to start a business in that field ? Well , before even you consider a degree for that , spend a month to study that subject on your own. What business do you exactly want to start ? Is it a product or service ? You got an idea ? Good , now google it up and find out more. Read books on it. I offer cyber cafe building services since 2016. I teach myself on how to do that. I also make video games. I teach myself on game development as well. I am also a business student. In my last semester now. I apply whatever I study in real life things. I apply those knowledge in building my video game startup , Joe Games. I worked as a marketing manager in 2 different companies before. I pretty much grab opportunities where I can actually apply and test those knowledge I get from my lectures. If you want to achieve something different from the others , you should be doing things differently. Good luck\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "In answering this question, I'll assume you want to start your own business rather than applying to work at a startup. Considering that half of your college degree experience are classes outside of the core knowledge required for the degree, I would skip the degree entirely and focus on the classes and knowledge you need in business. I started and built up a business that earned over a million dollars in net income in under 4 years, and successfully sold it - all without a college degree.  But I read a lot and did take several business classes at my local university that were very helpful. (I finished my Bachelors degree and MBA after I sold it).  If you have no college experience, you'll need to take an English composition class as well as a minimum math requirement to enter most of your business classes.  Then you'll need to take an Intro to Business class as a prerequisite to any additional business classes. (welcome to academia, where you learn to jump through hoops!) The most valuable classes for me were Business Law, Managerial Accounting, and HR/Labor relations.  Business Law isn't something you can really teach yourself. You need someone who can point out legal fallacies and answer your questions. It's helpful to know what makes a contract enforceable or not, terms used for shipping, civil law terms, business legal structures, etc.  Accounting is something that is also difficult to self teach, as you don't know that you got a concept wrong without someone to tell you. The real valuable material is in Managerial Accounting, which teaches you what to do with the data you have. But in order to take Managerial Accounting, you have to slog through Financial Accounting which is less helpful. HR covered a lot of Labor Law that I was unaware of that could have gotten me in a ton of trouble. Those laws change as the number of employees you have grow, so you have to know how to interview, hire, and fire someone properly, or you could lose everything you worked for.  Marketing can be helpful as well, depending on the professor teaching. I've had good and bad experiences here. I would like to say that Management and Leadership classes would be helpful, but I've taken several in my Academic career and all of them were pointless and taught by professors who've never lead anything in their lives. It was a bit like learning to ride a bicycle by someone who has only read about one in books. Economics is somewhat helpful, but can be self taught. The value of Operations Management and Supply Chain depends on the type of business you'll be running. Check out your local Universities and see if any of then have dedicated Entrepreneurship programs that can connect you with other like minded people. Check the bookstore and flip through the business books you'll be using in class. Some of the Entrepreneurial textbooks I've seen are simply repackaged general business books with a few chapters on Venture Capital and going public. (Talk about putting the cart in front of the horse.) All in all, your classes will be taught by professional academics who have never started or managed a business, but they can still be helpful. Save your time and money, and take classes that fit your needs and schedule, and invest the money in your own startup. Network with other entrepreneurs in your area, and read a lot on your own. www.personalmba.com has some great book lists that will get you started. Hope this was helpful. Questions and comments are welcome. ",
