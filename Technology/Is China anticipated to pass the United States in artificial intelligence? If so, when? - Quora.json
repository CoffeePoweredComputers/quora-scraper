            "answer_text": "China is very rapidly catching up to the United States in artificial intelligence and anything technology related. Chinese companies are rivaling American companies in terms of innovation and persistence. Even though the Chinese do not have the best materials or the best engineers, the way China functions as a country is contributing big to the boom. The Chinese do not have a system preventing collection of big data from its citizens. Unlike the recent Facebook scandals, the Chinese government does not have any restrictions that prevents companies from taking citizen\u2019s data and using it for various purposes. For example, WeChat is processing about 7 billion photos a day, which is helping the company improve its image sensing mechanics. The Chinese also has began to actively deploy its robots into society. Medical robots are now everywhere and automated tasks are being done increasingly frequently with A.I. While the US dominates in machine learning, China leads in the actual robot making business. Sooner or later, restrictions are going to start impacting Chinese ai makers but for now, everything seems to be heading for an epic showdown. In the end, I doubt that China will ever pass the US in machine learning but it has a head start on robot application to real life.    https://technode.com/2017/10/22/china-vs-us-ai/ China will win the A.I. race, according to Credit Suisse CZ ",

            "answer_text": "Today any country can overtake the United States since they do not make AI. They are content to try to make believe that they have succeeded (Google, Facebook, UBM, etc.) to deceive the media, so the public. In fact, they are programs that are incapable of reasoning and talk to us, developed by computer scientists with computer languages. There is only one functioning AI today, it is French and is called the reasoning AI. As she writes programs much better and faster than computer scientists, they never talk about them. The first country that will seize this technology (operational since 1986!) Will be immediately in front of others since anyone can make intelligent machines, able to speak like everyone else and especially to learn constantly at an extraordinary speed. Even the French government (Villani report 2018) does not know (or wants to know anything about) this technology! ",
