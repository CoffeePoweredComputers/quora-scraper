(Drones as such might be thought of as the flying bit in any system.) Generally, these systems enable humans : to avoid danger in hazardous environments - they collect data -images; sensor readings of smells, radiation, gases etc without human prescenceto save money by substituting relatively inexpensive technologies for more expensive ones, eg drones for helicoptersto save time by doing inspections, tree planning, hunting for missing persons etc more quickly ( and more safely and more cheaply)one day, effectively carry packages, tourists, casualties, etc .",

            "answer_text": "Yesterday I red this article [Drones and robots are taking over industrial inspection] and this is absolute answer to your this question. I want to share one of valueable excerpt of it: The effort shows how low-cost drones and robotic systems\u2014combined with rapid advances in machine learning\u2014are making it possible to automate whole sectors of low-skill work. While there is plenty of worry about the automation of jobs in manufacturing and offices, routine security and safety inspections may be one of the first big areas to be undermined by advances in AI.
