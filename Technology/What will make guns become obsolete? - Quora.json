            "answer_text": "he current directions of weapon development point towards energy-based weapons rendering the projectile gun obsolete sometimes during the 21st century. The biggest drawback of the projectile gun is the weight of ammunition you need to carry, as the gun was developed to provide enough punch to penetrate trough defenses such as shields, armor and fortifications. the ammunition is heavy and once depleted renders the gun useless.Another big drawback of the projectile gun is the ballistic attributes that govern its range and accuracy. Bullets fly in a ballistic arc, and are also affected by attributes such as wind, heat and elevation. The last drawback of the projectile gun is its limited range, based on the amount of propellant you can pack into a cartridge. Generally, most people find that they can see farther than they can shoot accurately at. For these reasons, a plethora of solutions was devised to support todays weapon systems, from training to accurate scopes, ballistic tables, guidance systems and corrective features such as stabilizing fins. A future energy-based weapon will also have its drawbacks and limitations, but it will be able to shutter some of the limitations of the projectile gun and replace him to a large extent. there are several potential candidates:1. Laser gun - some military weapons are already deployed, mostly as counter missile/rocket systems but also as a replacement naval canon. The power output required no makes this solution viable only for a stationary base or on a ship large enough to sustain its power drain and overall size. But the last century has aced the challenge of miniaturization, and it's likely that such weapons will appear in the form of canon, machine gun and eventually rifle-like footprints in the coming decades. A personal laser weapon will probably be limited in shot count due to power demands, but the accuracy, longer range and relative resiliency to environmental factors will compensate for that. 2. Sound gun - ongoing experiments in amplifying and directing sound waves have been going on for decades. Currently, there are militarized defensive solutions that can disable people from quite a distance, and test have shown that massive sound projection can also disable vehicles, disintegrate certain defensive materials and detonate explosives in projectiles or charges. It is is likely we'll see the first wave of such weapons as defensive measures, but as the ability to control and direct sound improves, we will see them as offensive weapons in battlefields, detonating minefields, killing tank crews and disabling fortified positions. I'm not sure whether this weapon will evolve enough to replace a rifle or pistol, but theoretically it's in the realm of the possible. 3. Nano gun - why use a projectile-like weapon at all if you can switch to sentient hive payloads? A swarm of nano pellets using sensory input to ficus and home onto targets, then swarm and overcome them like a cloud of angry gnats is already at the threshold of possible. Such a weapon can use projectile-style or rocket-style launch methods, and be accurately controlled and directed from a field unit, or perform an autonomous attack based on preset functionality. 4. Chemical weapons - Chemical warfare may have given the field a very bad reputation, but that is tied to the massive destruction of the current weapons. Now consider the most effective chemical weapon routinely used against civilians all over the world - crystal meth. It's pinpointed, effective, cheap to manufacture and can vary between incapacitating to killing, depending on dosage. Chemical weapons are already in wide use as a projectile by large animal control personnel in agencies such as National Parks and Forestry. Some forms of chemical weapons can use cheap alternatives to projectiles to reach a target, from nano swarms to fixed defensive charges. Gas masks are effective only against inhalation, but all it needs is a pinprick.  I think we will see most of not all of these types of weapons militarized and used by law enforcement and hunters in a few decades. many of them can be configured for non-lethal use so the issue will be more about regulation of use than about technical feasibility.

            "answer_text": "Nothing is on the horizon that looks promising. Possibilities include:  Directed energy systems, laser or similar: Such would require exponential increases in battery technology, and significant advancements in other areas. Rail guns:  Also require exponential increases in battery technology. Most any system requiring lots of electrical power has the same flaw...  Battery technology simply isn't there, and we are talking about revolutionary technology developments to get us there.  It's unclear if such is even possible, to say nothing of when it might happen. Li-Ion technology has been essentially unchanged for 25 years, and current pathways aren't the sort that are going to see us delivering systems that are competitive with traditional firearms systems... not even close. Right now, firearm technology is pretty much on a plateau.  While significant improvements are possible (guided projectiles, caseless ammo, advanced optics, etc.) they will probably still continue to be guns in the sense of projectiles driven by an explosion of gunpowder for quite some time.

Like a bow, they will always be extremely deadly, therefore will always be an effective personal weapon.  ",
