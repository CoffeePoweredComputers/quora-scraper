            "answer_text": "Edit: I am glad somehow several Indians showed up to prove my point.  India has a better death rate than the US and Germany. US, 226149/8520307=2.65%Germany, 9955/380898=2.61%India, 115950/7649158=1.51% (I made a mistake by dividing the death number of India by the confirmed number of Brazil, which made the death rate higher, the number is actually much lower, if not the lowest in the world. )And a Indian mate told me that they don\u2019t take China\u2019s number seriously. LOL. Only if you believe that India has a better medical system than the US and Germany. I mean, THE GERMANY. Do you know the death rate in Switzerland? They country which has many nuclear shelters with operating room to perform surgery opertaions. Switzerland, 2145/86167=2.49%This is the result of governmental diversion. Indians are now in a hype of beating up China rather than noticing their own trouble.   It\u2019s a crazy year. At the beginning of it, almost every western country were cheering about the total failure of China to not being able to contain a simple virus. And now, China is already the 54th in the world, with 1.4 billion population. So there is a huge rise of nationalism and xenophobia against Chinese. After all, they need to find a way to divert people\u2019s attention from internal problems to somewhere else. POTUS Trump provided a good thought to everyone, and Pompeo may prove the effectiveness again by winning the election in 2024. That was why CNN almost unbiasedly reported about Wuhan after the lockdown, just to disrupt Trump\u2019s plan. So why Sweden banned Huawei and ZTE? Because: 1) it has Ericsson, and 2) it needs to show their determination both to the US and to the people.  China has a very good reason to not do the same. In this crazy year, there should be at least one country which stays calm and acts as the mature one.  31 March 2020, the result of the second stage of 5G network purchase was announced. Huawei has 57.25% of the bidding, ZTE got 28.68%, Ericsson got 11.45%, DVBCN got 2.62%, and Nokia got nothing. According to a earlier news in January, there were about 130 thousand 5G stations in China. about 50% of them is Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia combined got 25%, ZTE got 20%, and DVBCN got 5%. The US made Huawei a political dispute. This forced China to keep it alive. However, China is not losing its mind to keep all eggs in the same basket. It\u2019s still vital to introduce other suppliers, especially international competitors. Without competition, the Chinese supplier would eventually lose their spirit of innovating. China introduced Tesla for the same reason. To give the Chinese car manufacturers some sense of crisis.  It\u2019s very important that China doesn\u2019t join the crazy trend of over politicalization. According to the data from Chinese custom, the export of fridges between Jan and Jun increased for 9.3% comparing to 2019. If China became crazy and stop to export things, not just Chinese workers would lose jobs, your food would go bad too. ",

            "answer_text": "It would be expected if they do, after all from the start Huawei was more or less a complete Ericsson ripoff. A result of Ericsson outsourcing manufacturing to China. But reasons why Sweden is doing it is not to protect Ericsson. One of the main reasons are actually national security, FRA (a Swedish military version of NSA) have found some disturbing issues regarding Cinese law related to how their exports products can be used (not necessarily being used) as tools for intelligence gathering. Mind that it is actually not agains Huawei per say but how Chinese government can use it for their \u201cexpansion\u201d ambitions which, the latest decades has become rather aggressive. It should not be forgotten that when Lenovo laptops started flooding the markets their keyboards had a key stroke reader capacity which made it an excellent intelligence gathering tool. Chinese government deny any involvement but why would Lenovo risk doing that on their own. So China doesn\u2019t have to worry about Ericsson doing similar things because our law prevent it, China\u2019s doesn\u2019t. But just for retaliation purpose it is of course expected that China ban Ericsson. ",
