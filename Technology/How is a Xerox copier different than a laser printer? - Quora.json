            "answer_text": "The basic principle in the techniques of both are different. \u2018Xerography' (name-Xeros, meaning dry, derived from a Greek word and graphy meaning photo process) is a dry photocopying process working on the principle of static electricity- positive and negative ion of electric charge acting on the reflected light beam from the original. The ink to print is dry toner fused by heat to retainthe images on the medium (paper ) printed. The printed copy is placed as original to take multiple prints from them. The other printers like Laser printer, Jet printers and Digital printers are also working on photographic transfer process or principle where in the information packed on the computer- whether in the form of digital images or words- is converted into printable electronic command. The laser that gets the ink on the page, using static electricity in a similar way to a photocopier. When the command is received by printer unit ie the laser, it convert the electronic printers into printable form and ensure inkjet leave the inked image on paper. The printer receive the digital image stored in electronic format including scanned copies if any from the computer where they are kept stored unlike Xerox where the print command is taken from printed original or photo print originals.

            "answer_text": "Most \u2018copiers\u2019 these days are essentially a printer (all current Xerox devices are laser until you get into their Production Inkjet devices) with a scanner combined / integrated into the device. With that scanner, you are able to make a \u2018copy\u2019, where as with a laser printer, you can only make a print (from a computer / electronic file). ",
