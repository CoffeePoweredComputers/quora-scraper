            "answer_text": "While it is true that some hair loss products can have this effect \u2013 during the first few weeks the hair starts shedding because the hair follicles enter the growth phase and the older hairs make way for the new growing hair \u2013 I don\u2019t believe this should happen with this particular product. It just works to boost hair growth in a different way. WOW Skin Science Onion Black Seed Oil contains only 100% pure cold pressed oils \u2013 onion black seed oil blended with castor oil, almond oil, jojoba oil, olive oil and coconut oil \u2013 and it is free of mineral oil, hexane and silicone. It is non-sticky, non-greasy and can be used on any type of hair, even on color treated hair. So nothing in its composition can potentially cause hair loss as a side effect. Now that we got that out of the way, to go back to how it does act, this oil contains two main natural compounds that help boost hair growth: thymoquinone and nigellone. They are both natural antihistamines that reduce follicle inflammation, nourish the hair and reduce dandruff. Rich in over 100 nutrients, onion black seed oil also nourishes the follicles, making them stronger. It also contains alkaloids, saponins and proteins, known to boost hair growth. The best benefits will be seen in time, but your hair should look and feel better even from the first uses. So if you\u2019re experiencing hair loss, most likely there\u2019s another cause.
