            "answer_text": "A very good question. For clarity, we\u2019re suggesting that currently, no computer game gives so much immersion that a person couldn\u2019t tell it from Real Life (tm), but are coming close enough to give us an ill-defined feeling of \u201cwrongness\u201d. In simple terms, I think the answer could be \u201cNot any time soon.\u201d Even with 100% fidelity graphics, animation and perfectly recreated sound we still have many other senses. One of the biggest senses we would need to overcome is touch, but that isn\u2019t as simple as \u201cYeah I can feel that object.\u201d Our skin, which can discern temperature, the smallest of breezes, texture, even viscosity isn\u2019t limited to our hands. Almost every part of our bodies will need to have near-perfect representation. It would only take us not having these totally correct, that is to say, exactly what we would expect to give us a feeling of wrongness and lead us right back into the uncanny valley. I suspect unless and until we have the ability to fully \u201cfool\u201d our brains with total sensory inputs (think The Matrix) we will remain to have the ability to discern a virtual environment and therefore a game, from real life.
