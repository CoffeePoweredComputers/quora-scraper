            "answer_text": "Firstly: EMPs in real life are nothing like EMPs in comic books. But electronic systems could be damaged to a similar extent by a solar flare. What would happen? Everything would carry on as normal. The internet-connected, satellite guided, tractor that puts fertiliser on the crops can still be driven manually. The driver of the truck taking the crops to market would just have to know his way or consult a map. All banks have paper backup systems. Only the most bullshit jobs cannot be completed without the internet, doctor/nurse, teacher, refuse collector, chef/server, etc. would be business-as-usual. However if you do some bullshit you couldn\u2019t explain to a 5-year-old you\u2019re probably screwed. ",
