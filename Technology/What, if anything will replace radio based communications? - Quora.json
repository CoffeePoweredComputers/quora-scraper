            "answer_text": "The problem with radio - electromagnetic waves is that they are very bad in penetrating matter, plus amount of bandwidth is limited. Mobile networks provide you impression that you have one to one wireless communication, but in fact radio is mostly used on the \u201clast mile\u201d - mobile base station to your phone. The rest goes through fiber optical cables or through microwave backhaul links. There are some experiments to use other types of media for data transfer, such as using Neutrino - Wikipedia, which are not affected by the matter and can even penetrate our planet, but this is the problem, because if they penetrate everything then how are you going to detect them on the receiving end.

            "answer_text": "Radio is the simplest and easiest way to do one-to-one or one-to-many forms of communication. It gives a variety of \u201cstations\u201d that allows for MANY messages to be sent at once. It is super cheap to maintain and easy to control. So I dont think they will every get rid of it, just improve on it. Cell phones also use radio waves to send signals, so communication is based off of that. It is quite difficult and ungodly expensive to send cables long distances to communicate, and even then these cables can get damaged. ",
