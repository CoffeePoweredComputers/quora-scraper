            "answer_text": "A degree is only a piece of paper\u2026it\u2019s what you learn that counts, but many companies won\u2019t hire someone without a college degree into management-level jobs or jobs demanding a critical technical skill. Going to college is like \u201cgoing to the gym for your mind\u201d. \u201cDo I need to go to the gym to get in top physical condition?\u201d If you\u2019re self-disciplined enough, have the right resources, and know what you\u2019re doing; you can get in shape without going to the gym. Similarly you can learn some of the same material you would learn in college on your own. However, going to college can be a life-changing experience in many ways. You may forget many of the facts but you will remember problem-solving techniques and thought patterns for the rest of your life. Whether you need a degree or not will also depend on the job - \u201cIT\u201d is a very broad area. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think you have to have a degree, but it will depend on want you want to do in IT and what kind of skills you have. If you want to write code, the more languages you know the better c++, java, javascript etc. If you want to do software testing you don't necessarily need to know how to code but you need to be logical and be able to follow the project requirements. I personally don't think a degree is the distinguishing factor for a good IT employee. If you already have good skills play them up on your resume. There are a lot of really good IT people out there that don't have degrees. ",

I work for a large company - and a couple of jobs ago, a similar sized company - both manager of the IT department has PhD in computer science. They certainly make a lot of money, and if that is what you want, you should get a computer science degree. ",
