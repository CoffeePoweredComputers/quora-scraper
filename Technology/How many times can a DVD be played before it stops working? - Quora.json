            "answer_text": "The playing of the DVD has no effect on its lifespan and causes no wear. However, given enough time the DVD polycarbonate layers will likely begin to separate, exposing the data layer to oxygen, thus slowly destroying the data stored on it. This happened to many of my early double sided DVDs from New Line and Warner. I ended up getting rid of all my early titles as better re-releases came out. As a disc repair person for a chain, I saw this was common among releases from the 90s. This article explains more about CD/DVD disc rot. ",

They can be played thousands of times with minimal degradation, but the oil from your hands and aging (I\u2019m talking more than 10 years) is actually the issue. The heads don\u2019t touch the DVD, they merely read the contents, so playing the DVD does not degrade the recording at all. ",
