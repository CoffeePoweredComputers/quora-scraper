            "answer_text": "Loading buffer is used to help \u201cload\u201d a DNA sample (any DNA sample, not just PCR products) into an agarose gel for electrophoresis. While it usually contains buffers like Tris-HCL and calcium chelators like EDTA to help maintain the stability of DNA, its primary function is to increase the density and viscosity of the solution so that it falls neatly into the wells of the gel (usually glycerol, occasionally sucrose), and to include dyes - usually bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol, sometimes additionally cresol red and orange g - that can help monitor the progress of electrophoresis. Usually loading buffer is prepared as a 6x concentrate and is added to a PCR sample after the reaction, because some dyes can interfere with polymerisation. However there are a few dyes that don\u2019t, and there are commercial \u201cmaster mixes\u201d that include loading dyes and glycerol in the PCR buffer so that the sample can be pipetted directly from the reaction vessel into a gel. It does sound lazy, although if you\u2019re routinely doing hundreds of samples per run, reducing the number of pipetting steps per tube starts to sound like a great idea! ",

            "answer_text": "Typically, a buffer is a solution that can resist pH changes by chemically neutralizing small amounts of added acidic or basic compounds, thus maintaining the overall pH of a medium. Why is this necessary for PCR? DNA is pH-sensitive. At low pH levels (< 7), the chemical bonds that bind nucleobases to DNA are broken via hydrolysis. At higher pH levels (> 10), deprotonation disrupts the dinucleotide bonds that form the double helix.[1] Polymerase efficiency and specificity in catalyzing DNA synthesis is pH-sensitive. 10X (Taq Polymerase) Buffer includes the following compounds : 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8 at 25\u00b0C)500 mM KCl15 mM MgCl20.8% (v/v) Nonidet P40 *Tris-HCl In PCR, the four individual deoxyNucleotides which make up a DNA sequence are usually added to the solution in equi-molar amounts. The free nucleotide reagents are nucleoside triphosphates containing phosphate ions in solution that bind free H+ ions to form phosphoric acid, increasing the acidity of the PCR solution.  In order to maintain the optimal pH level of 8.0 - 9.5 for the polymerization chemical reaction, Tris-HCl[2] is used as the main component of the Taq buffer solution. It is a weak conjugate acid (or salt) of its base (Tris) that can maintain a pH level of 8.0 - 9.5 by regulating the amount of H+ ions in the solution.  KCl  DNA is a negatively charged molecule. The backbone of each strand is composed of alternating sugar and negatively charged phosphate groups connected by weak hydrogen bonds. KCl facilitates the binding of the primer to the template by stabilizing both for annealing.[3] The K+ ion in KCl binds each strand\u2019s negatively charged phosphate group, reducing its net negative charge, so that the negatively charged primer and template do not repel one another. MgCl2 MgCl2 acts as both a cofactor for Taq Polymerase and an additional stabilizing agent for annealing.[4] During the elongation phase of PCR, deoxyNucleoside Triphosphate (dNTP) disassociates into deoxyNucleoside MonoPhosphate (dNMP). Polymerase catalyzes the formation of a phosphodiester bond between 3' OH of the substrate nucleotide chain and 5' Phosphate of the precursor nucleoside monophosphate.  Polymerization Reaction: [math]dNTP + dNMP_{n} \u2192 dNMP_{(n+1)} + PP_{i}[/math] The divalent Mg++ ion of MgCl2 binds to the alpha phosphate group of dNTP and facilitates the removal of its beta and gamma Phosphate forming dNMP. It has been reported that increasing the concentration of Mg++ increases the activity of Taq Polymerase but at the expense of fidelity. On the other hand, lower concentrations of Mg++ lowers Taq Polymerase activity but increases its fidelity. Nonidet P40 (* Optional) Polymerization can result in the formation of secondary structures in the DNA via folding or knotting of DNA template or primers, leading to decreased product yield or failure of the reaction. At low concentrations < 1%, non-ionic detergents, like Nonidet P-40, function to suppress secondary structure formation, remove contaminants like SDS and help stabilize the DNA polymerase, resulting in increased amplicon production[5].

            "answer_text": "PCR is a complex thermal reaction which amplify some specific molecule(DNA, RNA etc). To do that there are several biomolecules those are taking part in that process. The most important molecule is a polymerase which is very special in nature it can withstand the ups and downs of temperature cycle without any damage ; cycle after cycle. To keep it healthy (in native form) you need to adjust the pH of the buffer /environment very efficiently thus you need some salts. There is also some additives those protects the stalts to precipitate out in a solution (time of temperature change) some extra ions those provide good mileage and acceleration to the process. Thus PCR buffer make a uniform optimum environment to run the PCR reaction. ",
