            "answer_text": "It is possible to install spying applications on a phone which will record all calls and send the recordings to someone. You generally cannot remove such an app without wiping the phone and starting over. A backup does no good because the backup contains the spying application and will simply reinstall it when you restore the backup. This can mean having to copy off and reload everything on the phone. Law enforcement can order your phone calls to be recorded as well and the carrier will do this. Nothing on the phone is touched, so wiping the phone will do nothing. If the \u201cperson\u201d doing this has an \u201cin\u201d with the carrier they might be able to get this done for themselves. It would be highly unethical and would at least get them or their associate at the carrier fired. It might result in some jail time as well if they got caught. Law enforcement sharing your recorded calls with someone outside the law enforcement community would be unethical and result in at least job loss if not prosecution in most places. I suppose in some third-world places all it would take is the right bribes to make this happen. If you live in one of those places, I have great pity on you. Be thankful you can ask this question at all. So, if the carrier is doing it, you can\u2019t ask anyone if it is happening and you can\u2019t do anything about it. You can try engaging a lawyer who can chase this down and find out if your calls are being recorded. Depending on the country, he might be successful. If a \u201cfriend\u201d borrowed your phone and installed a spying application on it, they must really want you. These things are expensive to use and operate on a subscription - as much as $100 a month. If you have friends and associates that would spend $1000 a year listening to your phone calls you have a serious friend problem. ",

            "answer_text": "It sounds like they\u2019ve \u201cdoubled\u201d your phone, or they\u2019ve installed a software that records your activity. Doubling your phone would be where they have set up a software that makes their phone look like yours. They\u2019d be able to open their phone and watch in real time of what you are doing. They could listen in on calls, watch your online orders, etc. Scammers use this technology to steal credit card numbers/social security card numbers without your knowledge. They simply watch you fill out forms online. A software that records your activity is simply like a video camera on your phone. Scammers can also use this for the same purpose as doubling, but they don\u2019t have to sit and wait. They simply get video feed of what you do. I\u2019m not sure why someone would want to souly listen in on your calls. Maybe they\u2019re crazy interested in knowing things about you that you rather them not know? Whatever the case this situation is just as I said - crazy. You should take action immediately. It\u2019s possible that a professional phone technician could help single out the software and reverse it. It\u2019s worth looking into. Otherwise, I suggest buying a whole new phone. Drop any and all contact with this person. The situation could turn dangerous depending on the type of information they know. However, another thing that could be happening is that the people you are talking to are telling this person. This could be unlikely depending on if the people you talk to on the phone actually know this person. I wish you the best of luck on solving this. I hope I helped! ",
