However, if the information you\u2019re looking for is important, say its for business, school, health, or an important life decision, you really should come to the library. Librarians have a Masters Degree in research, and we can find the best information quickly. ",

On the other hand, it is simultaneously much worse than a library because of the huge amount of irrelevant and misleading material, which you are just as likely to find with your search terms if you are not an experienced searcher.
