            "answer_text": "I know this question is very old, but during my quest of trying to find answers to something related I stumbled on it and thought what the heck. So the first pornographic website wasn\u2019t actually a website. The first pornographic websites which technically weren\u2019t pornographic websites were BBSs (Bulletin boards). A bulletin board system functioned very much like a modern day internet forum only it had a much wider range of purposes. Users were able to share files, create posts, email each other etc. During the rise of the internet, when dial up modems became generic and most people had one, some people would host such a BBS in their area on a self hosted server (usually an old pc) and people were able to login to that BBS and then share files with one another. Now, most of these files weren\u2019t what you could call high quality image sharing. Because the internet was slow. People would exchange what is called, ASCII pornography. These were computer generated visualisations of images completely made out of symbols. Now to spare you from any unwated explicit visual images you don\u2019t want to see to demonstrate what ASCII porn is, have a picture of Mona Lisa instead. In the end, it\u2019s all ASCII.  Now, aside from the fact that this is the very oldest and first form of internet pornography. It is very diffictult to determine what the very first commercial pornographic was. Even tho websites such as theHun, sex(.com) and worldsex(.com) existed back in the 90\u2019s. Most of these websites did not have any actual content and were heavily advertisement driven with ads towards retailers or links towards external hosted images. According to some sources, which I can\u2019t confirm myself there was a website which was called Sizzle, which was the first big commercial website and were one of the first using video.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to prove definitively, but it\u2019s believed that the first porn site was sex.com. It was registered in 1994 by a guy named Gary Kremen. Yes, that rhymes with semen. However\u2026 Gary did not have pornographic intentions with sex.com. At least that\u2019s what he says today.  A guy named Stephen M. Cohen, which rhymes with bone (and \u201cmoan\u201d\u2026 and \u201csex, phone\u201d and \u201cshe moves her body like a cyclone\u201d), DID see the pornographic potential of the domain. So he contacted Network Solutions, which administrated all domain names back then, and fraudulently had the ownership of sex.com transferred to his name using a series of fake faxes and forged documents. He quickly turned it into a thriving, profitable and dirty porn site. Kremen was furious, and sued Cohen. After a long court battle, Kremen won a $65 million judgment and got the rights to sex.com back. Before he could get the money, though, Cohen fled to Mexico and moved his money to an offshore account. He was tracked down in 2005 and turned over to U.S. authorities. Kremen sold sex.com for $12 million. In between fighting for sex.com, he had the time to found match.com. Which, I\u2019d guess, has led to exponentially more actual sex than sex.com. ",
