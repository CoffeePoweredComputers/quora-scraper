            "answer_text": "Forever. I mean, the things that make the computer can and will fail. Here I am replacing a few dead capacitors on my uncle\u2019s motherboard:  And then here is the reassembly.  My thinking is that something was incorrectly overclocked. An ohmmeter can run you a few dollars these days. That, along with some basic understanding of electronics, and you\u2019ll be able to make repairs for a few dollars. A soldering gun and flux can run you under $50. The capacitors, in this case, cost me around 85 cents. Everything other than the capacitors are fixed costs. The actual repair itself is dirt cheap. Here is one of my set-ups at home.  I\u2019ve been doing this since the earliest days of Dell deliveries we would get to our home. I would unbox the tower to eventually remove it from the tower, too. That\u2019s the motherboard on the right, above. The big brick to the right is the cooler hanging over the CPU and the GPU is the thing sitting slant across the board next to it. The darker object to the left that the wires protrude out of is my power supply. The board to the left of that is a graphics tablet I sometimes use (badly) for Quora answers. I have a stack of hard drives I load videos and photos on, equivalent to 10 TB of storage. There are a few reasons what I have done is stupid, a number of them include that I might step on this board, break it, hurt myself, etc. It is a 750 Watt power supply powering this thing. However, this is also easy for me to work with. It\u2019s cooled pretty efficiently. It\u2019s easy to clean, although it\u2019s a mess right now. Most importantly, I can instantly fix anything I think is wrong with it. If I want to upgrade my GPU, that\u2019s simple. CPU is also simple. RAM upgrade is instant. Everything is within reach whenever I need it. I don\u2019t know if it will last forever, but at this point, it has remained functional for a good number of years. I upgrade it whenever I need or change parts, but it\u2019s unnecessary as it supports everything I need and more. ",

            "answer_text": "A desktop computer should last at least ten years, so long as you didn\u2019t buy a poorly built bottom of the barrel system. You might make a hardware upgrade or two along the way: more RAM, bigger and/or faster storage. (If you still have an older PC with a rotating hard drive, get an SSD right now.) Laptops don\u2019t last as long because they suffer more physical abuse. Also because their performance is often more marginal to begin with, which is often because the laptop\u2019s components are chosen for minimum power consumption (for better battery life) rather than maximum speed. You\u2019re likely to have to replace the battery after five years or so if you keep the system. Businesses typically get rid of computers after five years. The five year old systems coming off lease can be a good buy, especially since the refurbisher has often adjusted the configuration with more RAM and an SSD. (The RAM likely came from other off-lease computers from the same lot that were broken in other ways, but that\u2019s not a problem.) Some perfectly good computers get retired before their time, often because the owner had a serious run-in with some kind of malware and simply doesn\u2019t want to bother to clean it up. Those will bring down the \u201chow long does it last\u201d average, but it\u2019s not the computer\u2019s fault! Computers are often still FUNCTIONAL long after that. I have a 20 year old PC that still runs and that I use for a few specific purposes, primarily to run a piece of hardware that doesn\u2019t have drivers for Windows versions after XP and requires a parallel port. But past the ten year point, they tend to be too slow or have too little memory to run modern software well. ",
