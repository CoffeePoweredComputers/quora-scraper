            "answer_text": "If the dirt is really caked on and it is impacting the feed horn - it may impact reception but generally speaking no.I have been taking in satellite downlink feeds for ABC TV for 39 years and a dirty satellite dish has never once been a factor on video reception from my experience.. What does impact reception is heavy rain and/or snow - it is call rain and/or snow fade. A Thunderstorm or Blizzard is will frequently impact video reception and the network has to use another dish from a different location as a backup. ",

            "answer_text": "Does a dirty satellite dish affect reception? It can. How much depends on the properties of the dirt. If it is heavy in metals, the signal will be weaker. If it causes extra refraction in the signal, it will be weaker to non-existent\u2026 It is one of the reasons the dish is usually mounted rather high - and allows any rain to wash it off. ",
