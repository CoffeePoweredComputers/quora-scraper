            "answer_text": "That depends on what version of HDMI do you have. Can you be more specific? HDMI 2.1 supports up to 10K resolution and 100 or 120 Hz refresh rate. It also supports 4K resolution at 50 or 60 Hz refresh rate. Perhaps you have a HDMI 1.4 device in which case it can support 4096 x 2160 (so-called 4K) or 3840 x 21260 (so -called UHD) The original HDMI 1.0 specification only goes as far as 1920 x 1200 resolution, which tends to be for computer monitors of 16:10 aspect ratio or 1920 x 1080 (so-called Full HD) for the typical 16:9 aspect ratio TV.
