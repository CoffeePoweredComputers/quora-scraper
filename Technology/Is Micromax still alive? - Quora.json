            "answer_text": "Yes, it is. It is not easy for a brand to die. Just as it takes years to build up, it takes years to die down. But as we all can see that Micromax is not doing well because it is not in the news. You don\u2019t see people around you buying Micromax smartphones. There is no more outburst of Canvases and Bharats. Do not fool yourself with the news and eyes. Micromax is still around and it did well in the last year. Micromax\u2019s revenue for 2017 is $1 Billion. It became the top smartphone company in India for some time in 2014\u201315. But after the entry of chinese budget smartphones by brands like Xiaomi, its presence is in danger. It launched the Bharat series after Jio introduced cheap 4G services. Bharat 2, which was introduced in Q3 2017 became the largest selling phone in the under Rs 5,000 budget segment in India. The company will expand its Bharat series of phones and will launch Bharat 5 in India. I think this is the only hope if they want to take some position again. It is not doing well this year as the market has been taken over by other companies. Bad strategical management and lack of funds crippled its market. Micromax launched its first smartphone of this year in September, the YU ACE, under the sub-brand YU. The company earlier revealed that they\u2019ll be launching 13 new smartphones by March 2019. Micromax sub-brand YU looks to be making its debut in the TV sector. The first YU-branded TV has now been listed at the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and is labelled as YUPHORIA S. Having lost its hold in the smartphone market, it\u2019ll be interesting to see Micromax try its hands in the TV business considering a lot of smartphone brands have devised their way into the sector like Xiaomi.  Hope this helps. ",
