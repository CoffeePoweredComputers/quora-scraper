            "answer_text": "The most famous self-realized soul in recent times is undoubtedly His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, Srila Prabhupada. 1 September 1896 \u2013 14 November 1977.It is not possible to know the mind of such a great Vaisnava, but by his actions we can understand something of the person.Although in his 70\u2019s and standing only a little over 5 feet and slightly built, he would dominate whatever situation he was in.At times he could be extremely grave and at others full of wit and good humour. He lived only to serve Krishna and never spoke about anything else. It made no difference if he was alone with only his servant, or in front of massive crowds at a pandal or meeting dignitaries in any country, he was always the same. He never did or said anything unnecessary and urged whomever he was with to take up loving service to Krishna. He remained always the personification of humility and regarded himself as simply a servant of Krishna delivering His message. Directly or indirectly he managed crores of rupees and dollars without ever having his own personal bank account, insisting that every paisa was Krishna\u2019s, and could become furious if his disciples misspent money. He slept no more than four hours a night, and spent the early morning hours translating and writing commentaries to essential scriptures like Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam and Chaitanya Charitamrita. He had a deep and touching compassion for all living entities, and wished only to bring them to the shelter of Krishna\u2019s lotus feet.He was extraordinarily pragmatic but never compromised on his principles imbibed from his spiritual master Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur to whom he would give the credit for any success he achieved. He could reassure a fumbling nervous person with simply a smile, and he could crush an arrogant person with a withering look. He showed an utter disregard for his personal health and followed a grueling schedule of touring and lecturing that left young men in the prime of their lives exhausted. In 12 years he circumvented the world 14 times teaching the message of Krishna.  He was never disturbed by any situation and used whatever came to him in Krishna\u2019s service. He had the most amazing insight on topical issues and a vision so grand and broad that his followers were bewildered as to how it would come to pass. He inspired the loyalty and total commitment of thousands and insisted that anyone who wanted to be counted among his followers refrain from eating meat, fish or eggs and taking any intoxication, and avoid any illicit sexual relationships and gambling.It is Kali yuga so there will always be envious people who want to detract from someone far greater than themselves, but in terms of self realized souls I cannot think of anyone in the last 500 years who will have had a greater impact than Srila Prabhupada.
