            "answer_text": "\u201cCoping with new technology\u201d makes it sound like new technology is some debilitating condition. LOL! Elders have to cope with many things - Arthritis, incontinence, tremors, lonliness, depression, etc.,. Technology shouldn\u2019t have to be one of them. For, a lot of the emerging and current technology if used properly can lead to a much better quality of life for elders. Here are a few ways in which technology can help elders Using the internet and net banking allows elders to pay their bills online without having to put up with all the hassles associated with going out, standing in queues, dealing with impatient service personnel, etc.Using apps like facetime and skype, whatsapp and instagram can help elders keep in touch with their immediate and extended families. So even if they are living alone, far away, or in a retirement home, they can be just a click away from their family.Using ecommerce and delivery apps can help with their shopping from the comfort of their homes. Apps like UberEats and Swiggy make it easy to order out and eat a variety of food without necessarily going out to eat. Not that going out is bad. Going out is good and they should be encouraged to do so. I am just pointing out that now they have a choice, if they choose not to go out for some reason on some days.Apps like uber and lyft and ola and other regional taxi aggregators have made it easy to find the means to travel without having to haggle with the drivers and getting taken for a ride of a different sort.The self driving (driver-less) cars that are emerging will also help elders who are unable to drive any more travel around in the comfort of their own cars.Fall detection devices, emergency contact devices, mobile phones and similar products with GPS controls and geofencing features can help loved ones keep track of elders better.Mobile wallets can eliminate the need to carry cash or go to ATMs and banks. This alone can make elders less attractive targets for thieves.So, as you can see, technology can be used to definitely improve the quality of life for elders. The challenge is to train them to use the technology correctly and wisely. Training sessions created specifically for elders can go a long way in helping them not only cope with technology by get enriched lives because of it. ",
