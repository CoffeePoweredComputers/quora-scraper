            "answer_text": "The modern Approach towards Better Agriculture Management aim for maximum utilization of sensors towards the better management of Agriculture requirements. Some of the sensors and its usage are as follows \u2022 Electromagnetic sensors: Used for measuring soil texture, salinity, organic matter and moisture content. \u2022 Optical sensors: Used for predicting clay, organic matter and moisture content in soil \u2022 Mechanical sensors: Used to estimate soil mechanical resistance, i.e. compaction \u2022 Airflow sensors: Measure soil air permeability \u2022 Acoustic sensors: Used for determining soil texture \u2022 Electrochemical sensors: Measures soil nutrient levels and pH ",

            "answer_text": "Sensors are useful in various research areas. For instance, a PT 100 sensor is used to measure temperature. Similarly, there are other sensors which are used for monitoring macro-climate. In addition, wireless sensors (which are generally known as nodes) could be used to record microclimatic parameters within the crop canopy. Normally they are set up at certain distance depending on their precision and all of them communicate to a remote datalogger or server where this information is collated and used for further analysis. Thi s data is useful for modeling purposes either for predicting the yield or for forewarning pests. ",
