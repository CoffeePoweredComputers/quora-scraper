The farther you stray from realism, the easier it will be to avoid the uncanny valley. Basically, your options are: Stick to cartoon style.Avoid faces comletely (helmets, masks)When faces are visible, avoid overly emotional expressions and smiles, unless you have pro modelers and animators.Because when you\u2019re close to realism, one minor messup can create a major creepy effect. Case in point\u2026 In early 2000s ATI released their Radeon 8500 and an amazing sdk which displayed such advanced things as gloss maps, per-pixel bumpampping lit by 4 point lights at once, and so on. Among all the demo there was \u201cRachel\u201d demo, which depicted a woman\u2019s head. The woman looked absolutely fine\u2026  (Keep in mind that this is 2001 we\u2019re talking about). Until she started TALKING.  Her smile in early 2000s was absolutely terrifying. Then the reached 2015, and a similar \u201csmile from hell\u201d could still be observed in Fallout 4. Alas, despite the number of times I played through fallout 4, I failed to capture this abomination on a screenshot. Basically, if you\u2019re making a game, you are not the guys that made this girl:  Because this stuff costs money and requires significant expertise. By sticking with masked grunts, you can avoid uncanny valley.  Most of the time\u2026  As long as your animators are good. ",

            "answer_text": "for obvious reasons, realism should be relative to the game, sports games are getting pretty good looking, but other types with realistic characters or perhaps even a pokemon game that looks better than that detective movie, a Metroid Prime 5 or 6 that just looks crazy real, that you want to take a napkin and wipe off that tiny spec of dirt on her suit, people would go nuts, D&D or The Elder Scrolls ??? hell ya, but Mario, Kirby, Sonic and other meant to be out of the real world, can be made to get awesome looking, but should stay as fictional apparitions ",
