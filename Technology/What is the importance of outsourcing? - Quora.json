            "answer_text": "Outsourcing can help businesses in many ways, including the following: Time: This is the one thing that all business owners need more of but is impossible to create. By outsourcing, you are taking something off of your plate and freeing up more of your time. This allows you to spend more time growing your business.Money: Outsourcing almost always is the cheaper option which in turn saves you money. For example, outsourcing your bookkeeping allows you to save 50\u201375% in comparison to other options. This money saved can be put towards other parts of the business.Productivity: As a small business, you likely have a small staff of dedicated employees. It is important to make sure you are getting the best production from your team by allowing them to do what they do best. A lot of routine daily tasks such as bookkeeping are usually handed off to someone on the team who could better spend their time doing something they are skilled at. By outsourcing, you are allowing your employees to do what they do best.Customization: Nothing about starting a business is static. It is constantly fluctuating so you want to have services that can scale with you. For example, if you hire a full-time bookkeeper, you are going to be paying them the same amount whether they are busy or not. If you outsource, you can get a solution that is custom to your needs.Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. ",

            "answer_text": "I am currently working in IT Outsourcing, so I will share with you some of the reasons why our clients choose to outsource, IT in my case. ScopeMost of the time the business outsource activities that are out of their main business scope.For example: if you are an accounting firm, your expertise is accounting and your employees / managers / partners are very good at it and they get paid for their expertise. But IT is not within their scope and they will waste too much time on dealing with IT issues rather than focusing on accounting points and making money for their business.Efficiency / EffectivenessIf you focus on something the whole time, chances are high you will become an expert at it and your output will be higher than the one of a non-expert.For example: again with the accounting company. If your employees keep working on accounting for your clients, they will be able to do their job faster or find issues easily over time. They will get better and better at doing it. But if an IT issue arises once a year, their expertise will be limited and they will spend too much time on solving it when they can just pay an outsourcing IT team and get it done faster and better.TimeBy now you should understand where I am going. If your time is worth a lot and you get paid handsomely with it, you do not want to waste it for smaller issues from other activities out of your scope and that do not make you money directly. Outsource them and get busy with your own scope where you are more efficient and effective.If you are in China and need to talk about IT Outsourcing, feel free to contact me. ",
