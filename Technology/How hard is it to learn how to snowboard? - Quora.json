            "answer_text": "For context, I've taught full-time for one season and part-time for five.  Many other instructors will have worked with more students than I have, but my several hundred beginners over the years provide enough of a sample that I think most instructors would generally agree with the below.  I'm not sure how one measures how hard it is to learn to snowboard.  Is it harder than learning to use an iPhone?  Yes.  Is it easier than learning organic chemistry?  Yes (for most people, anyway).  Since \"hard\" is vague, I'll address time to learn and factors that influence learning. Time I've seen 2-3 people out of several hundred who strapped the board on and intuitively knew how to snowboard immediatelyOn the flip side, I've seen another 2-3 who just did not ever \"get it,\" even if I worked with them, hands-on, for three days.  Never got up off the ground on their own, never slid on their heel edge for more than a few feet without falling/sitting down.There is, of course, a bell curve between the really speedy learners and the ones who never get it.  The majority of new snowboarders will feel fairly comfortable turning on easier runs within 2-3 days.  People who just go out and ride without a lesson will immediately start trying to turn on a real run, but I'd wager that it actually takes them an additional day or two to get to the \"comfortable\" stage.  There's something to be said for learning the basic movements first.Once you get past the initial 'learning to turn' stage, there's also a pretty wide variation on how long it takes to be able to ride most of the mountain.  Some folks might stay on greens forever, and others might be comfortable on black runs within 5 days.  The next section is what drives the differences in the above time variations. Key factors that influence learning Internal vs. external motivation: this is probably at least 50% of the equation.  If you really want to learn to snowboard, it will be easier to do.  If, on the other hand, you've signed up for a lesson because your boyfriend really wanted you to try it or because that's what your friend wanted to do, but deep down you're not really sure you want to learn, then it will be much harder.Fitness level: Some people are in better shape than others, and this matters.  Both cardiovascular fitness and strength are important.Experience with relevant sports: There are no hard and fast rules here, but I've noticed that gymnasts and people with strong experience in board sports seem to pick up snowboarding faster than others.  All of my exceptionally fast learners had been gymnasts growing up.  There's something to be said for having strong body awareness and control, and also for understanding the basic movements of riding any kind of board (skateboard, wakeboard, etc).There are certainly other factors, but I've found these to have the greatest effect on pace of learning.  And I suspect they're also closely tied to whether these individuals would say learning to snowboard is \"hard.\" ",

            "answer_text": "I concur with Simon Crump that Snowboarding is more difficult to pick up than Ski at first, but it is an easier journey to intermediate and advanced levels. Coming from personal experience however, your progression as a newbie is heavily depended on the competence of your coach and your determination.  I tried snowboarding a few times when I was in high school. I made the mistake of not getting any lessons to begin my journey. It was a completely painful and demoralizing experience -- to the extent that I didn't want to go to the snow anymore.  But I did go back to the snow and this time I stayed on the mountain for a few days and spent money on lessons -- and it made a world of difference. Learning in a beginner group is much more fun than face planting all by yourself. Seeing how other people struggle the same way as I did gave me a lot of confidence and reason to keep trying. A good coach will be able to give you many easy-to-remember rules that can get you on your heel/toe edge for a reasonable duration at the end of a two-hour lesson.   In my case, I was just able to do toe-side C turns at the end of my first lesson. (Snowboarding newbie progression: Grooming -> Falling leaves -> J turn -> C turn -> repeat all of these steps for the other edge -> S turn -> graduation!) Then I spent the remaining day going down the beginner slope for 40-50 times, skipping lunch and toilet entirely because I was so excited of my progression! (lunch time is the best because the slope is not crowded and the lift queue is short). By the end of the day I was able to do S turns and is almost able to go down an entire slope without stacking! (I have never been good at any sports, was quite chubby and never learned to skateboard, just FYI) Here are a few tips that I have learned: 1. Wear knee pads and tail savers. They cost $20 and they are the best bang for buck for a beginner boarder. You will stack A LOT and these cushions will keep your motivation level up. (I learned this the hard way) 2. Don't sit on the ground and pity yourself after a stack. It will not improve your skill, only eats away your confidence. Get back on your feet right away: don't even wait for the board to stop, punch the ground and stand back up! 3. Pick a favorite edge! You will be better at either Heel side or Toe side at the beginning. Once you found your better edge, keep practicing that edge and switch only when you are tired from those muscle groups. Don't stress if you can go down the entire beginner run with your toe side yet you can't even do falling leaves on your heels. Mastering one edge will significantly boost your confidence because just like most people mentioned, once you got the hang of snowboarding you can progress extremely quickly.  4. Be brave. Snowboarding is something that benefits with a relaxed posture and a forward center of gravity. Most beginners are very nervous and very tense - this will cause you to stack a lot more because you are not leaving any rooms for the board to correct itself once the edge catches an obstacle. Leaning forward will lighten the load on your back (power) leg, which makes turning much easier. However this requires a lot of faith as it conflicts with your natural instinct (staying away from the danger - i.e. lean backward & put most of the weight on your back leg). Once you learned to lean forward on a board, your confidence and skill level will snowball.  5. Ditch your friends. If you are serious about learning snowboarding in the shortest amount of time, I recommend you to train alone and focus on your current skill set - until you have hit a plateau and needs more coaching and encouragement. The reason behind this is that you can rarely find a person with similar skill level as you on a slope - especially during rapid progression at the beginning. Most the time if you are with friends, it's either them waiting for you or vice versa. It either waste a lot of your time and interrupts your flow of progression or it makes you feel frustrated / being a burden when you keep stacking in front of your better skilled friends. A better way is to improve your skills in a short time through dedication and repetition, once your level is up to others you can always join them then.  6. Watch the pros. You may come across decent skilled boarders on the beginner slope. Pay attention to their postures, lines and center of gravity. Although some may have incorrect techniques, the one whose movements are aesthetically pleasing is normally employing the correct techniques. I find it very beneficial and motivating to analyze their movements when you are stuck on a chairlift.  Enjoy the view and have a good time on the mountain! If you stuck on a particular technique, just think that there are a whole mountain of people who have been through this. There are boarders that are fat, thin, tall and short, all of them able to carve beautiful S on the white slope.  The pain and frustration is just part of the initiation to join the club. If everyone else can do it, so can you! ",
