            "answer_text": "Partial charges prolong battery life of a lithium-polymer battery. 2500 cycles (Every 1.25 days at 25% DoD) = 8.56 years (3125 days) 1500 cycles (Every 2.5 days at 50% DoD) = 10.27 years (3750 days) 500 cycles (Every 5 days at 100% DoD) = 6.85 years (2500 days) What hurts the battery more is when it\u2019s charged in a hot temperature above 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) , so whenever possible charge in a cooler area. \u201cA battery dwelling above 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) is considered elevated temperature and for most Li-ion a voltage above 4.10V/cell is deemed as high voltage. Exposing the battery to high temperature and dwelling in a full state-of-charge for an extended time can be more stressful than cycling. Table 3 demonstrates capacity loss as a function of temperature and SoC. (State of Charge)\u201d See Table 3 How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries If the battery lasts 500 cycles of 5 days per recharge (i.e. Blaze, Alta, Charge2, Flex2) you will have 6.85 years (2500 days) of use and I think you would have upgraded your device by then so don\u2019t worry if you charge it more often. See Table 2 in the above link for how many cycles depending on Depth of Discharge level. How to improve battery life from Fitbit: Can I improve my tracker's battery life? I plan on upgrading to Blaze2 so I won\u2019t reach the 6 - 10 years mark, so I don\u2019t even mind maxing out all the features. I\u2019m not concerned on improving battery life because li-po batteries are excellent and in this case the life on my device will be longer than I plan on keeping it. Li-polymer Battery: Substance or Hype? \u201cLi-polymer uses laminated sheets that do not need compression. A foil-type enclosure reduces the weight by more than 20 percent over the classic hard shell. Thin film technology liberates the design as the battery can be made into any shape, fitting neatly into stylish mobile phones and tablets. Li-polymer can also be made very slim to resemble a credit card.\u201d ",
