            "answer_text": "Start with the Market, not a Problem. Amazon, PayPal, Tesla, Google, IBM, those are market makers, not products for customers. Granted, they have products, making them easily seem like a tech solution to a problem, and they started simply relative to what they are now but those perceptions distort what they really are - they define the market rather than being defined by the tech they bring to it. It\u2019s a bit counter intuitive but Product/Market fit startups, the kind of business that follows the problem - solution (Lean Startup) line of thinking, tends to result in applications of ideas. And ideas are prolific. Ergo, not innovative. Such startups certainly CAN be innovation - solutions to problems are very often innovative! - but since the pretense of your question is starting massive tech success, you have to start but working out what\u2019s innovative to the market at large. How do you do that? Flip those conventions. Really. Just reverse them. Be a Market/Product fit startup by thinking through a solution - problem. Examples probably work best: The market of people on the internet and the websites they consume should have something more than a web directory of sites. Technically, it\u2019s possible to index everything in the world. Let\u2019s do that.Google. The market wants something -> it is possible -> let\u2019s build the product -> and distinguish the problem. What\u2019s the problem solved? They actually created problems resulting in greater internet tech innovation (speed, security, etc.), businesses needing to figure out how to appear properly and prominently (search marketing and SEO), etc. The market should have an effective, reliable, inexpensive alternative to oil. Solar and wind are working but they can\u2019t work for everything. Where do people experience the implication of oil most? Cars. We can build electric cars, let\u2019s make them work.Tesla. Problem created? The cars are expensive, they have to be. So make them luxury vehicles and more innovation built in so they\u2019ll justify the price. Now take those examples and apply them the other way around, the traditional and popular problem solution statement approach - starting Google or Tesla from a Problem Solution, Product Market fit point of view. People can\u2019t find things on the internet so we\u2019re going to index everything and make it available. Of course people can find things on the internet; Yahoo is just fine. Who is your customer? Who is going to pay you for that? Ah well, no one (yet, keep in mind the early days of Google). We\u2019re going to give it away, but the cost of developing the algorithm, data centers, etc. will run us tens of millions of dollars so fund us! Yeah\u2026. (I don\u2019t even know the problem statement for Tesla, um\u2026) People don\u2019t want to pollute the environment with fossil fuels and are seeking a luxury car that can be plugged in at home You mean like a Lexus Golf Cart? How will it have power to commute for hours a day or travel road trips?? Yes precisely that. Well, we need exceptional amounts of funding as we\u2019ll have to invent new batteries and charging stations we\u2019ll build throughout the country. And we\u2019re talking luxury cars here, $200,000+ to cover the costs of all we\u2019re doing. Okay\u2026 you have an MVP yet? How many customers do you have. Wait, sorry, you don\u2019t have any customers yet, you haven\u2019t even invented the battery yet that will make the car possible, right? Right, that\u2019s why we\u2019re talking to you about funding our idea! Start with the market. You\u2019re thinking product first (referring in your question the PC as an example of my point) and logically that makes one think, for what reason would we do that again?! Flip your thinking and start with the market and the solution you want to build. Know it intimately: all the players and how they workthe technology available nowthe technology available soonhow the marketing and user experiences workwhat people really wantwhat\u2019s possible but not availableProvide a solution for a problem they don\u2019t know they have. Build the product that serves the market problem you foster by enabling a solution to something not yet realized, and build that product (Google AdWords, or Tesla's battery) only AFTER you've worked all that out. That\u2019s innovation. ",

            "answer_text": "Start with a solution to a problem. I used to think in a narrow field of vision, in that , everyone is already thought of pretty much all great ideas and created market leaders around them. Transportation: Planes, Trains, Automobiles It\u2019s done: Boeing, BNSF, Ford. Technology: PC\u2019s, Internet, PhonesAlso Done: IBM, Google, Blackberry But wait, for each of these sectors, others saw opportunities and build or at times took down leaders (ex. Blackberry). For Transportation, came Airbus, AmTrak and Tesla For Technology, Apple, SamSung, Facebook, Twitter, iPhone(Apple), etc.. For Software which used to be installed, came Cloud and Soft-as-a-Services for pretty much every service you can think of. Try to connect the dots and realized between each there is an opportunity. Hardware needs parts, Internet needs Routers, Bandwidth, ISP\u2019s, etc.. Phones require cases, suppliers. And for each company is the need for productivity and efficiency. So you have Software and services that simplify / improve those pain points (ex. SalesForce, Google Apps and Analytics, WorkDay, etc\u2026 So the point is, find a solution to challenges others are having and find a means to improve it, create a proof of concept and test it out, and when you get a couple bites use it as motivation to take it to Market. Along the way, don\u2019t forget; Customers matter more than you\u2019ll ever know. Get their loyalty and they\u2019ll stick around and bring others behind them. Build a great team that shares your passion and believe. And last but not least: Don\u2019t get in a habit of burning money, run a lean machine that can be self sustained and nurtured. ",
