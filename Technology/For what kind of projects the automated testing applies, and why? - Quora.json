            "answer_text": "To answer that question let's first point out what the top value imho automated testing provides: 1- Quickly re-test code as feature is being developed. 2-  If done right, make sure software is designed properly. Testable code adheres to better design principals and is easier to maintain and extend. 3- When feature is in maintenance mode and no active development is done on it, if an occasional bug fix or minor change or even common library code change goes in, automated testing ensures old feature still works That said, I would say any serious project that needs to be properly designed and maintained for a more than a few months can benefit from automated testing. The level of automated testing required is a completely different beast and will depend on the specific project you have. ",
