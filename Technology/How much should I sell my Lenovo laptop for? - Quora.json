            "answer_text": "You're talking about a laptop that was bought 4 years back with 1 GB of RAM (DDR2 I believe). I'd say Rs. 10,000 - 12,000 should be a fair price. That is considering that you're giving away a legitimate copy (an OEM one at that) of Windows 7 along with a new battery. Be warned though - you might be asked for less than that. ",
