            "answer_text": "i assume this question is because of their partnership with lg? these are my guesses based on their twitter, but i don\u2019t 100% know anything so i could be wrong. i think they all have an iphone x except for jin namjoon: iphone x/xr/xs etc  this is a screenshot he posted on twitter. the little bar at the bottom is the way you slide to your home screen on an iphone x. plus the whole format with this clock in the left corner and wifi/battery in the right fits the whole iphone x format. seokjin: (maybe) iphone 6s apparently he had expressed a dislike for the iphone 7 not having a headphone jack, so he never upgraded from a 6. by now he may have an iphone x, or an android, but the last known phone he had was an iphone 6s. yoongi: iphone x/xr/xs etc  same bar as namjoon\u2019s phone hoseok: iphone x     the camera cut out on his phone case is for an iphone x  plus if he had an LG i don\u2019t think there\u2019d be an issue where he had to cover the camera because bts and lg have a partnership. jimin: iphone x   jimin's tweet with the home screen bar. i was thinking this could be the same screenshot from yoongi\u2019s tweet but the time is different in the pic\u2019s corner.  a few months earlier he tweeted a screenshot from a facetime with jk (in september) and since the iphone xr/xs we\u2019re JUST released i assume he just had an iphone x taehyung: iphone x/xr/xs etc  same formatting thing as the others jungkook: iphone x  i know this is an iphone case, but the camera cut-out isn\u2019t clear enough for me to tell which model. but you can tell that the iphone is post-iphone 7 because there\u2019s no headphone jack.  jungkook tweeted this which is obviously a facetime screenshot and once again the white bar at the bottom of his picture indicated an iphone x. the iphone xr/xs are also a possibility, but they had just been released when this was tweeted so it\u2019s not as likely.
