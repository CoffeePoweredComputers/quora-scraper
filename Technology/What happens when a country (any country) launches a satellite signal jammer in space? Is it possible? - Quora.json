            "answer_text": "First of all let me tell u how a signal jammer works. Lets take an example of mobile phone signal jammer. So what is does is it just creates radio waves of same frequency on which the mobile functions. As a result the phone gets confused between the two similar frequencies and donot function. Now coming to your question.. A satellite operates on a large number of frequencies that means you would have to make jammer circuits for diffrent band of frequency to jam the satallite completely. Even if u manage to do so, u need the signals to be very powerful and near to the source of signal(satellite). To place your device near a satellite is itself a huge task because of high speed revolving motion of the satellite. Over all I can say that its not impossible if you are targeting a single satellite, but it would be expensive. ",
