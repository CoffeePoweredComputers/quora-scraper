            "answer_text": "When you start on the business route, you first have to decide three things do you want to be an employee, where you can specialize on one thing, a freelancer where you do things for your clients or an entrepreneur where you create your own company. With that said I will continue talking about being an entrepreneur which in my opinion is more about bootstrapping than anything else. it is: \u201cTo finance your company's startup and growth with the assistance of or input from others. Anyone who's started a business on a shoestring is adept at bootstrapping, or stretching resources--both financial and otherwise--as far as they can.\u201d I recommend reading the ENTRELEADERSHIP book by David Ramsy as well as their podcast. They help small to medium-sized companies grow. Once you have the basics you can decide what is better for you. There are two ways of doing this, the first is studying things that you are totally clueless about. The second is looking at things that you have some experience or skills and go all in. For Finance I recommend PROFITS FIRST, it goes against all the GAAP principles which I find to be bad for small businesses. if you set this up at the beginning you will be ahead of the curb. For sales, I love the sales acceleration formula, that helps you use data and inbound marketing to grow. For performance, I recommend reading about IKIGAI, so you can find your flow. If you learn about it and you apply the principles you will fly through everything. You also have to organize yourself, time management and all that interesting stuff. Try out TRELLO or WORKEP to get you organized. For Marketing, read Story Brand, Expert secrets, growth hacker marketing, and make sure you pay real attention to THIS IS MARKETING by Seth Godin. Today it is about being honest and trustworthy, doing things right. As a company, make sure you position yourself as a guide and make your clients the heroes of the story. also never forget that \u201cSuccess is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.\u201d ",
