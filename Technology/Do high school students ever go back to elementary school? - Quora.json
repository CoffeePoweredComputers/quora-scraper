            "answer_text": "As a student, no. It would be a disaster for the teenager to be in a learning environment where some of their peers are a decade younger than them. I also imagine the parents of the young children would be upset about a teenager in the class. Once graduating college, the high schooler can go back to elementary school as a teacher, but they will no longer be a high schooler or a teenager. If a high school student feels they are academically at a much lower level than the grade they are enrolled, there are many options to solve this. Find a tutor or mentor to help you improve on missing knowledge and skills. Talk to the teachers and counselors at school to see what resources the school can offer. Look into what homeschooling can do to accelerate your learning process. I\u2019m sure there are lots of other options, this is just what comes to the top of mind. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a little confused on your question. Is it that You want to know if high school students go back to elementary school to possibly visit? Well if thats the question then yea I am pretty sure alot of high school kids go back and visit a past elementary teacher. I did it when I was in high school only to show my 6th grade teacher that I survived middle school. He was an asshole and told me that middle school was going to eat me up and spit me our in a million pieces. What a jerk huhh. In today's world if a teacher were to make a comment like that he would lose his job. Good old 1982. ",

            "answer_text": "If a high school student needs remedial learning, elementary school wouldn\u2019t provide what they need. It would go too slow. It would spend too much time on material they already understand. They\u2019d have a hard time relating to their fellow students. ;-) It\u2019s a fallacy that school neatly doles out all the material people need in 12 precise packets that each take 9 months to learn. In school there\u2019s a massive amount of repetition. That\u2019s because schools are set up for students to memorize, not to understand the material. Humans don\u2019t memorize that well. That\u2019s why school takes so long. It\u2019s an attractive idea to start all over from the beginning to \u201cdo it right\u201d this time. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re wondering. But it\u2019s pure fantasy. If a high school student was struggling they would do far better with a tutor who could focus on the specific areas where they were having problems. They wouldn\u2019t need to waste time with stuff they already know. Unschooled kids don\u2019t do school-style learning. They spend their time learning through exploring their interests. Those who want to go onto college, don\u2019t need to spend 12 years studying what they \u201cmissed\u201d. Some go right into college. Some find it useful to take a semester or two of math and English. That gets them up to speed on formal math notation and writing. That\u2019s generally all they need to get what kids in school spend 12 years learning. ",
