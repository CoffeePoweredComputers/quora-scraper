            "answer_text": "What are strategic implications and how are they implemented? The strategic implications are the major consequences arising from not understanding and tackling the multitudinous impact of forces and dynamics of change that can often impact a business from various angles: political, regulatory and legal;economic and monetary;social-cultural;technological;ecological and environmental;In my opinion, the best tool to study and analyse in depth these implications is a powerful tool known as the Implication Wheel, conceived and developed by author-filmmaker-futurist Joel Arthur Barker. I have had the wonderful opportunity to learn and practise it back in the mid-90\u2032s, when I was a strategy consultant to small businesses. Strategic implications can come at many levels, first order, second order, third order, and so on, and to me, the Implications Wheel is the most effective tool to chart them accordingly for deep analysis. Upon completion of the analysis, then it become easier to work out practical and even novel solutions to counteract those implications, systemically and systematically. So to respond to the thrust of your question, I want to say that you don\u2019t implement strategic implications. You study and analyse them in depth, preferably with the Implications Wheel. Then you explore practical solutions from the study and analysis, following which you proceed to implement and execute your tactical plan. Meanwhile, you can read more about the Implications Wheel at this weblink: The Implications Wheel ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not certain what you are asking. An implication is not something that can be implemented. Let\u2019s say you have a strategy. What are the implications of that strategy? Some good things could happen or some less desirable things could happen after implementing that strategy. By considering these when thinking through the strategy, you can figure out ways to address them, to take advantage of the good things and help eliminate the bad things. ",
