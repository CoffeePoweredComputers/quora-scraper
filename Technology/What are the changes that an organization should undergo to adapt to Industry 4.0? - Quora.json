            "answer_text": "Very good question. Industry 4.0 is about automation and data exchange in manufacturing technology. This includes a whole host of technology changes. Smart factory concept could be related to Industry 4.0 which is about Automation systems monitoring physical processesCreating virtual copy of physical processes ( & creating digital twins)& using this data to make decentralized decisions.A whole host of Machines are involved in Manufacturing industries, in addition to machines, there are different set of people involved, different departments involved, there are suppliers and customers involved, business processes involved, and factory governance involved in running the factories. When we talk about Industry 4.0 change \u2014- it is likely to touch all this. The required changes for this transformation could be across few dimensions: Management and Leadership related changesStrategy and Planning for the changesCommunicating the changesImplementation of Technology needed for the changeImplementation of business process changesWorking with Upstream and Downstream partners to ensure changes required at their endTraining the right set of peopleGovernance and Regulation updates as neededThere are a whole host of challenges involved in implementing Industry 4.0 which are: Lack of visibility ( or not full trust ) of the expected benefits due to this transformationAvailability of appropriate and diversified skill sets required in the whole process of transitionIT security issuesReliability and stability required for critical machine-to-machine communicationMaintaining the integrity of production processesAvoid any IT snags, which could cause expensive production outageskeeping Knowledge and Industrial know-how intact during the automation processLack of enthusiasm from different stakeholders involvedFear of additional burden for the IT department - they may come back pushing it back.Training process related changesFear of job loss and hence lack of motivation among the critical workforce required to make these changes.lack of top management commitment - the attitude could be why to change when something is workingLegal and regulatory issues \u2014 support from regulatory authorities",

            "answer_text": "I have interacted with over 100+ industries/companies that are working on the path of industry 4.0 and each of them has faced a different challenge in implementation of these technologies. Before reorganising a company, the challenges faced in implementation of these technologies is more important. Recently, I had a talk presented at the India Electronics Week in Bangalore where the topic of discussion was something similar. I classify IoT challenges in 3 main categories Technical challengesBusiness challengesSocietal challengesTechnical Challenges These challenges are typically faced in implementation of technologies. Till today, companies had different departments that handled very specific issues. And when it comes to implementing IoT solutions, this comes as a big challenge. Since each department has knowledge of their own domain, and IoT is implemented across different domains - finding a resource in the company that knows about hardware, sensors, gateways, protocols, cloud and mobile apps or desktop apps is a must. And by understanding i don't mean the typical tech jargon, but real knowledge about this. Most of the times when I meet clients, my first job is to request for a slot to have an IoT knowledge session where i request the client to have different departments attend the 1 hour session. Also, having the knowledge of right tech to use is very important. Most of the time solutions have failed because, the wrong technologies were taken up in the wrong manner. Have a person in the organisation with the right knowledge Business Challenges Organisations need to revise the way their business ran. With more high resolution data being available they should be able to take decisions faster and better. Having the right resource who can interpret the data is very important these days. From a product selling perspective, earlier a product was sold and the only expenditure the company had to make was on the customer care and repair work; but now with IoT and cloud services, there are additional IT expenditures that the company has to envision while pricing the product. Cloud rents, app maintenance etc. becomes a critical part of the product life cycle. It is very important to have a management who can envision the business challenges and view the entire business from another perspective. A lot of my clients went wrong in the pricing system for such tech. Societal Challenges Paranoid behaviour of customers over ownership of data, the shop floor employees are afraid of automation as they feel that it will affect their jobs, they would believe that the management would be more aware of their activities and most of the HR issues would see a spike Looking at solutions from societal point of view is very important to solve these problems. Having an organisation reorganised is very important for IoT implementation on a scale that will affect the organisation. ",
