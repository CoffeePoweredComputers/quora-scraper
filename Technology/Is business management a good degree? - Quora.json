            "answer_text": "If by good degree you mean a degree that will help you find a good job in the future, Business Management is the way to go. Firstly, It is a degree where you will learn a bit of everything, I am currently in my first year and I have learned so much, from law to economics to marketing you will get to look at every subject that could be of use if you ever have your own business or work in a business environment. Secondly, this degree will open a lot of professional doors for you. People will say business management is a degree that is \u201ctoo broad\u201d but I think that the fact that you get to look at all these interesting things and study them will only be beneficial professionally and for your personal life. Every domain has a business side to it, let it be fashion, music, or writing. What i\u2019m saying is that whatever your passion is or your interest is, with a business management degree you can pursue it and go far. Thirdly, you have to take in consideration that a lot of people especially in the UK, take this course, meaning that it is quite competitive, so if you want to go for it you should put all the efforts you can and you will strive in what you do. Nevertheless if you work hard, you will accomplish great things with whatever degree. ",
