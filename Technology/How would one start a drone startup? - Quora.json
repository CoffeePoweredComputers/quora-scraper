            "answer_text": "To get your drone startup off the ground (pun intended): there are two aspects of which you have to put in place which is the technology and the business. Let\u2019s start with the business aspect. As with politics and real estate, the potential of the nascent drone market today hinges on one key factor above all else: location, location and location. I say this because the regulatory environment of the country plays a key role on what you can and cannot do. This will decide how you will be selling services or products or maybe both. The pros of becoming a product focused drone company that develops hardware, software and firmware is that you are not bound to be restricted by regulatory strangleholds as most of them deal with operating drones and it is fairly easy to comply with the technological demands they ask of products, you can also pursue overseas sales in case there is more demand abroad for your products. The cons of product based startup is that it is already a crowded market with potential for established players to enter the fray and take over such as your Intels, DJIs and Nvidias. Opting for the service route entails a longer sales cycle, more regulatory hassles but more secure flow of recurring revenue, greater scope for expansion and you are more or less agnostic of being stamped out by technology competitors as the market is young and the potential is larger than any single company or handful companies can fulfill and your main differentiator is the understanding with the customer, the tech is just a means to solve a problem he hired you to solve. Hence, the first step is to understand the technicalities of the regulatory environment in your country and see how the nature of your business model will operate within in that business environment. The next step would be about technology. Again if you are product focused, most of your team will be concerned with programmers, developers, embedded engineers and product managers. Most product focussed companies offer a full stack of solutions that is they make the drone, offer the OS to operate the drone and the tech needed to use the data that comes from the operation. The potential for making each one of the steps better and more efficient is developing and that is also something that can be looked into because as the market expands so does the potential for diversified specialisation. When it comes to a service oriented drone company, the tech has more relevance in automating processes so that more projects can be done better and faster. This involves developing better software for faster flights, more efficient processing and an amazing platform for data delivery. Hence your tech team will need to have a strong core of data managers, security specialists and front end developers. In summation, the technology aspect of things requires you to select the right team of technocrats based on the trajectory you choose. There will always be an overlap, yes, but the right mix counts for the right push.

            "answer_text": "We'd have to widen or narrow your definition of \"drone startup\" to be able to give a more accurate answer. There are many opportunities in this field - however, the highest in terms of risk is probably the manufacture of the products themselves. If you want to get a sense of some of the recent history, do some research on 3D Robotics, a US/Mexican startup which was created by a former editor of Wired Magazine. You can find numerous articles on their growth and methods. To move the conversation forward, let me give two examples of getting into the drone business. 1. A hobbyist on one of the big R/C sites decided to start a US based outfit selling the toy drones and differentiating his company by being available for advice and parts. His story is on his site:MassiveRC Home Page 2. I decided to enter the business on a small scale about 15 months ago. I identified a niche which fit my needs...since I was a beginner, I decided to write about how to get started in the hobby. I created a blog, small forum and then wrote an ebook on doing so:Drone Flyers - Quadcopter, Multirotor and Drones Resource Site Although I did not enter the business to make a living, it would be easily possible for me to do this if I desired by expanding my site and offerings.  In summary, the field is growing and there are many possibilities for businesses based on aerial robotics. Read the other answers for some of the general rules of business and consider what angle you might enjoy and/or which skills you posses which could add value to such an endeavor. ",
