            "answer_text": "Hi.. I assume you are in the wall of your house..Your question is a little vague..May I suggest you get some help on this..OR at least have a volt Ohm meter to let you know what you are doing..It will show, whats hot and whats not. Anyway, I\u2019m assuming you are in the wall..The solid Black is your AC power..I guess you can call that positive..BUT\u2026 you need to flip the fuse on this, before messing with it..Ok.. a white wire would be your AC return..The black and white..DO NOT get twisted together.. The Black and white is a trace wire, coming from something else..like another switch, maybe a lead for a fan unit.. A solid copper should be earth ground, maybe a green wire would also be a Ground. Solid white wires usually get twisted together..2 solid black wires would be on a switch..for an outlet, One side should be solid black..and one side should be solid white. So when you plug something in..AC hot and AC return. Your deice plugged in has a resistive path for electrons to flow..Also on the outlet..is a green screw, for the plug earth ground. The White/ Black is probably a power lead for a device on your line..Its usually called a tracer wire. EX.. You have an outside light for the house, the light has an electronic eye, to auto switch the the light on/off automatically as the sun sets and rises..The wire that powers the light sensor, might be Black and White..its power for a device, not directly tied to your fuse box. (I\u2019m not sure on the BK/WH color) Hope this helps some..you need to do better research, or reach out for some experienced help with this..This forum isn\u2019t that good, for what you may be trying to do.. Be Safe Dave ",

            "answer_text": "In an AC circuit, the convention in the US is that black and red are \u201chot\u201d (alternates between positive and negative,) and white is \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201czero\u201d (with a close-to-zero potential difference to earth/ground) and greeen or green-and-yellow is \u201cprotective earth.\u201d If you have a three-phase system, the third hot phase (in the US) is blue. In a DC circuit, the convention in most of the world is that black is the \u201cground\u201d and any other color carries a signal or power rail of some sort, with red and yellow being popular for power wiring, but it can really be any color on any particular connector. For example, for a typical PC \u201cATX\u201d power supply. you\u2019ll find black is ground (zero) and +5V is red and +12V is yellow; -5V is white, -12V is blue, and +3.3V is orange. DC circuits typically do not have protective earth, and thus green is not generally a ground/earth signal. ",
