            "answer_text": "How to destroy an industry? One company took everything down with it  Anthony \u201cTino\u201d De Angelis is a simple man. Tino, a seasoned conman, had created one of the biggest vegetable oil companies to sell for salad oil, but it was all based on lies\u2026 One of his employees thought to themselves Doesn\u2019t Tino think this has gone too far? we don\u2019t have enough vegetable oil Tino had about $6 million worth of vegetable oil, but he was reporting that he had $150 million worth in his accounts. This meant that Tino could borrow money from banks claiming that he could pay back $150 million when he sold his oil. When he received the bank loans, he invested in vegetable oil (mainly soybean oil) futures (a contract to purchase an asset at a date in the future), which pushed up the price of vegetable oil. This meant that he made money from the futures he held and when the vegetable oil was worth more, he could borrow even more money. The employee thought I don\u2019t think I can go through with this Tino\u2019s answer was once again simple The inspectors test for oil by looking at the top of the tank, right? Well, Oil floats on top of water. Fill up the tank with water and just add a little bit of oil, then the inspector will think that the tank is full of oil. When he moves onto the next tank just use a pipe from the first tank to transfer the oil to the second. And so that\u2019s what they did. They tricked every inspector who came their way and Tino made a lot of money. Their company received loans from the likes of American Express, Proctor and Gamble, and even The Bank of America. Everybody trusted Tino. At one point, Tino claimed that the company held more vegetable oil than the US was capable of producing. Yet, nobody realised. Until\u2026 One day an employee at the company told an inspector about all the tricks the company was using. The company was found to have been misleading inspectors and overnight they became bankrupt. This led to a 20% decline in soybean-oil futures. However, not many people realised the crash because there was much bigger news at the time. On the 19th of November 1963, the \u201cSalad Oil Scandal\u201d came to an end wiping out the market but on the 22nd of November 1963, US President John F. Kennedy was assassinated causing a bigger shock to the market. As for Tino, he received a 7-year prison sentence. When he was released he continued scamming people and was in and out of prison. If you are interested, I will leave ways that you can avoid being conned in the comments. I hope you enjoyed the story! ",

            "answer_text": "The South Seas Trading Company. Basically it was a pyramid scheme in England in the early 1700\u2019s based on government debt and inflating stock prices, under the guise of being a merchant company handling trade in Latin America (no one seemed to notice that Spain controlled all those ports, and Spain was at war with Great Britain at the time). Essentially the company was given responsibility for the government\u2019s debt held by the public), then traded shares in the company for said debt. But at a rate determined by when they received the debt. As long as the share price went up, the owners of the company could pocket the difference. They pulled every trick they could think of to jack up the share price, offering no down payments, no payments for 5 years, 50% dividends, special loans to people just so they could buy shares, etc. At is peaked it\u2019s annual revenues were valued at more than the entire GDP of Great Britain. They were pushing through bills to shut down competing stock markets because they were concerned there wasn\u2019t enough cash in the WHOLE OF GREAT BRITAIN to keep this scheme going. When it finally collapsed it very nearly tore down the monarchy.  ",
