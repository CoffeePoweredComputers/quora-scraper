            "answer_text": "Medical imaging is in light speed development than before, the big companies investing in artificial intelligence technology to simplify decisions and view. For example observing MRI technology it is well known for scanning and widely used by neurosurgeons and physicians and helped a lot in brain surgeries. The technology now introduced 3T intraoperative MRI to perform effective brain surgeries.  What is Intraoperative 3T MRI Scan. 3T intraoperative MRI works along with brain surgery. The neurosurgeon can scan patient brain during surgery time without sending patient to MRI scan room to measure surgery success. 3T MRI or IMRI technology reduced the number of surgeries and reduced the recovery time and hospital stay. Like this the future of imaging technology may simplify detecting early stage cancers. ",
