            "answer_text": "Well, Apple will by now know what they are bringing out in 2021. My thoughts are the \u201c13\u201d as a name may get missed out simply because \u201c13\u201d is considered an unlucky number and some people really believe that bad things will happen from the number \u201c13.\u201d However, while there are already some rumours around about what might be around for the next iPhone in 2021 nothing is creditable. Apple does not leak information. So yes, it is confirmed within Apple but not to the public. If you need an iPhone now just buy it. I mean you can keep waiting and waiting as each iPhone every year is an advancement on the last. ",

            "answer_text": "By leakers, yes. By the company? Of course not. Now this will likely put people on edge when they read about leakers citing official Apple documents that show certain upgrades (especially with 5G). Rest assured that what I mean is that Apple has not made a public statement on the matter, and likely won\u2019t until their next iPhone event. Besides, we should be seeing more Apple news on their ARM Macs at the moment now that they got the iPad Air and iPhone 12 out of the way. ",
