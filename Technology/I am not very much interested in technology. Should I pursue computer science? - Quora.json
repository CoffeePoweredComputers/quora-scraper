            "answer_text": "Computer Science is principally about technology, revolving around technological advancements and emergence of new innovations. The backbone of Computer Science is Coding and Technology. Why we study Computers? Not to mug up the outdated curriculum taught in Indian Tech Institutes, but to be in touch with state of the art revolutions - \u201ca break with tradition\u201d. On the Institute level it does look like that CS is primarily about algorithms, coding and testing but it\u2019s only after Industry ingress the bigger picture is revealed which speaks out LOUD and CLEAR that CS and technology are best pals and go hand in hand. Be it Facebook, Amazon, Google, WhatsApp, Apple, Microsoft etc all have their roots in Computer Science and Technology. It\u2019s evident that Computer enthusiasts have poured a great deal of efforts, burned mid-night oil and have worked round the clock to make this globe a more technology-friendly space. To be a big shot in this field requires that kind of commitment and dedication. It requires the awareness and consciousness of delayed gratification. For example The team of many techno wiz; slogs for hours, days even weeks to develop that \u201cApp\u201d or new product; waiting patiently through its alpha, beta, gamma testing stages, making necessary modifications and up-gradations whenever required and finally reaping the result after the official release. Most of the domains like Cloud Computing, Data Mining and Warehouse, Business Intelligence, Nano Computing, Big data, Robotics, Quantum Computing are revamping the market and industry. They carry watershed significance and require assortments of tools and elite demonstration and training. These technologies in future will mark the turning point of the trade and business, performing knotty and intricate wonders. Many Indian Tech Institutes (most of them) do not boast of having these fields integrated in their curriculum. So after 4 years of degree completion you will have to take up further studies to master such technologies. TLDR - If you are not serious about your career in Computer science then don\u2019t pursue it. We often take the plunge first only to discover later that we are unable to cope with it. These technologies are quite overwhelming and require a lot of meticulous attention and effort. You would be sucked into it and it\u2019s very demanding by nature. It would be preferable if you direct your attention towards a field which you are keen about. It\u2019s undeniable that with your lack of interest you cannot make much contribution to the field anyway. Go fore with a domain of your interest. ",
