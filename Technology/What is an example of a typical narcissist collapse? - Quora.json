            "answer_text": "The reality of narcissism is a pendulum swinging between grandiosity and deflation, entitlement and vulnerability and beneath this personality pendulum at the very core of a narcissist is a deeply fragile emotional core. A narcissist collapse occurs when the externals come crashing down and that emotional core is disrupted. Failure and criticism will result in a narcissist collapse simply because they (the narcissist) lacks the core stability that comes with a healthy sense of self. A narcissists inflates sense of self is extremely fragile and as such extremely susceptible to negative social, professional, and personal feedback. An easier way of understanding the narcissist collapse is that this occurs when the narcissist is unable manage and maintain the charade or rather the gap between their false self and real self. Reality knocks, and the vulnerability of a narcissists false self is completely exposed. Narcissistic Collapse will typically present itself as a massive mental breakdown after which they become withdrawn and isolated, essentially going into a state of hibernation as they struggle to face themselves, and as a result unable to face the world. Narcissistic Collapse is generally permanent as the narcissist never completely recovers for the rest of their life. Narcissistic collapse tends to become more likely to occur as the narcissist ages. Most narcissists thrive well into their 20s and 30s, having given the impression to everyone they have been popular or the \u201ccool person\u201d since childhood. \u2192 By the time they reach their 40s, the tables begin to turn and as they begin to age they resent it, they lose the power to charm and entrance people by using their looks \u2192 By the time they hit their 50s and 60s, most narcissistic people start to lose friends and have less influence.

            "answer_text": "Collapse postulates originated in physics, primarily in relation to the hypothetical wave function which dictates a particle\u2019s probabilistic location. Applied to Narcissistic Personality Disorder, it is again a hypothetical construct. It's quite frankly amazing to me, how people develop elaborate thesis about purely speculative notions concerning a relatively rare personality disorder. The confabulation, storytelling and mythopoeic verbiage used by these individuals is actually quite narcissistic in its tone: they wish you to believe they alone have the true inside story about clinical narcissism. I'm going to give to you now the complete diagnostic criteria, listed in the DSM-5 specific to a Narcissistic Personality Disorder. You will not find narcissistic collapse. It is not a reified, officially established criterion of any kind, but it is discussed voluminously. On the other hand, so is the flat Earth concept. In the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), NPD is defined as comprising a pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), a constant need for admiration, and a lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by the presence of at least 5 of the following 9 criteria: A grandiose sense of self-importanceA preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal loveA belief that he or she is special and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people or institutionsA need for excessive admirationA sense of entitlementInterpersonally exploitive behaviorA lack of empathyEnvy of others or a belief that others are envious of him or herA demonstration of arrogant and haughty behaviors or attitudes",
