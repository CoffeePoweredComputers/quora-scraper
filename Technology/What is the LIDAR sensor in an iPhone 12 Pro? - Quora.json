            "answer_text": "The iPhone's new lidar system will measure the distance of objects both close to the camera and far away. ... Software then uses the time of their round trip to derive the distance of the objects or surfaces from the camera lens. It's very similar to the way radar works, only lidar uses laser light instead of radio waves. ",
