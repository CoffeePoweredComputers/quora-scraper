            "answer_text": " The most powerful nuke presently in inventory with the US is the B83 air-dropped bomb, pictured above. The B83 is 1.2 megatons in yield, 12 feet long, 18 inches wide and weighs 2,400 lb. Disassembled, it looks like this:  The rear third of the bomb (to the right of the picture) is the parachute, which is there to give the bomber time to get out of the blast radius. The short section ahead of that is the electronics required to make sure the bomb goes off when it\u2019s supposed to and not when it isn\u2019t. The next cylindrical section is the so-called physics package, or the nuclear device itself. And the nose contains fusing mechanisms for detonation at altitude, on contact with the ground or after a certain time. The largest nuke in inventory for a while was the B53:  The B53 was a 9-megaton bomb. It was 12.3 feet in length, 4.2 feet wide, and weighed 8850 lb. The actual physics package was the entire central section between the nose and the tail:  The last of these monsters was dismantled in 2011, but hadn\u2019t been in active service since the 1980s, and were kept in storage in the years between. Edit: Since this has been getting a few more views recently, I\u2019ll just add the Mk 17 and Mk 24 bombs, which were based on the unexpectedly powerful Castle Romeo test.  The Mk 17 and Mk 24 were nearly identical, differing only in some internal details, with the Mk 17 having a yield 15 megatons (I can\u2019t find the yield of the Mk 24). The bombs themselves were enormous, being 7.5 metres long by 1.5 metres wide (call it 25\u2032 by 5\u2032) and weighing in at 19 tonnes; so big, in fact, that only the B-36 bomber could carry them, and so they were retired at the same time the B-36 was, in the late 50s. Edit the Second: But the biggest (in yield) bomb of all in US service was the B41 bomb, that had a yield in its Y1 configuration of 25 megatons.  The B41 was 3.8 metres long by 1.3 metres in diameter, and weighed nearly 5 tonnes. These were brought into service in 1961, but were progressively phased out of service to be replaced by the B53 starting in 1963, with the last retired in 1976. ",
