            "answer_text": "Yes. Politics is the art and science of working together to figure out what to do and how to do it. Not only must any group of people larger than a handful require people who practice politics, but they will have such people, whether or not they are called politicians. There are, of course, good and bad politicians, with a spectrum in between. In a democracy, a good politician is one that does their best to avoid benefiting themselves, directly or indirectly, at the cost of others. In the real world, it is very difficult to avoid this temptation and even harder to avoid the appearance of committing this mistake. Politicians are unavoidably human. Still, there are those who contribute much, much more than they get without stepping over the line. Those who claim that politicians are inherently bad have probably not spent much time in the political system. A direct voting systems is simply impossible; nobody has the time to learn the ins and outs of every issue, but this is the only democratic alternative to a representative democracy. Thus, we need good politicians, and we need to spend the time to ensure that they actually represent us (we have a problem with this in the USA, actually). If we can bring our representatives back into line with our collective needs and desires, we can ensure a successful future for our country. ",

            "answer_text": "Good evening. R Cardona from Costa Rica (happiest country on Earth). First of all, what is politics? Merriam Webster defines it as: a : the art or science of government b : the art or science concerned with guiding or influencing governmental policy c : the art or science concerned with winning and holding control over a government So, to apply the art and science of government we do need individuals who are knowledgeable on both. Now, can business people who have been working in for profit companies master this art / science? Can former actors master them? Can sports stars do the same? Personally, I believe that there should be individuals who understand how to get to power in a way that respects such a fundamentally robust system as the one in the USA. Those same people might be qualified to define the policies that best serve a country like the US or Costa Rica. Perhaps they need others who know more about governmental policy than how to get to power. In a nutshell, if we use this definition, I consider that politicians are vital. Bringing an amateur in the art/science of getting to power and defining policies that benefits the nation in the short and long run can be NEFARIOUS. US has great people from right and left (Lincoln, T and FD Roosevelt, Kennedy, Grover Cleveland); I consider them to be politicians and I hope US produces many more like them. The same applies to my country, one of the 22 nations where every mother knows that her son or daughter will never be a soldier. ",
