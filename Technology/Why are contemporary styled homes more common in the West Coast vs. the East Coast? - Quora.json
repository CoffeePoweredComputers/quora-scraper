            "answer_text": "Contemporary homes are built with flat roofs, which are only good in dry climates and are a problem in wet climates. To make a flat roof work, like a commercial building, a builder will have to spend lots of money on the roofing to make sure that rainwater leaves the roof. Normally builder like to save money, so they avoid the extra costs and build architectural styles that fit the environment. The west is more dry, the east is more rain forest like. The west can build flat roof without so much reinforcement, because it barely rains. The east coast builds high pitched roofs the makes the rainwater slide through the gutters down the spouts and to the ground, protecting the house. ",

            "answer_text": "I have two ideas about that, first I wonder if it relates to the age of the community the East Coast was developed before the West Coast maybe leading to a difference and how contemporary the homes are in general of course. My second idea pertains to the general differences between East Coast and West Coast lifestyles. The West Coast tends to have a lot of entertainment industry and I\u2019m wondering if that isn\u2019t something that would have an effect upon how contemporary the architecture is. ",
