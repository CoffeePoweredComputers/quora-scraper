            "answer_text": "Gasoline cars are already obsolete. The average American car is in use only 2 hours a day, and driven an average of 30 miles a day, and with Chevy Bolts now going for under $30K and having a 238-mile range, most people should be driving electric. You can pick up a used Nissan Leaf for almost nothing. My Bolt is faster, much quieter, and cleaner than most cars on the road, and I\u2019m getting the equivalent of 150 miles per gallon. (PG&E in California gives 50% off to all EV owners for all electricity used after 11 p.m.) And my car is maintenance free: in the 2 years I\u2019ve owned my Bolt, all I\u2019ve had to do is keep the tires at 40 psi and wash the car! Nowadays car rental places come right to your house and pick you up, so for a long trip in areas where there aren\u2019t many charging stations, just pick up the phone and rent a nice gasoline car when you need to! I\u2019ve always done this for long road trips, long before we owned electric vehicles. About 1/3 of Americans already clearly understand the unequivocal warning of the October 2018 UN climate report: our planet is only 12 years away from catastrophe unless \"far-reaching and unprecedented changes\" are made. Understanding this, we realize that people who unnecessarily* drive gasoline cars and vote Republican are simply bad parents and/or bad grandparents. It\u2019s a gradual kind of child abuse to steadily ruin the future for all the children now alive in the world. With a bit of objectivity, these still-unaware (or just plain selfish and suicidal) people could realize that failing to get on board with the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d is actually quite sickening and immoral behavior. WTF are they waiting for?! *People who live in frigid climates; people who have to go on long trips as part of their livelihood and don\u2019t have time to charge on the road; people who live in apartment complexes that don\u2019t allow tenants to install charging stations; and people who simply can\u2019t afford anything but an old gasoline car, are, for now, excused from the moral judgment of our children 12 years from now. Because our representatives on both sides of the aisle, at present, are serving a handful of billionaires at the expense of their constituents and the whole human race, our society remains geared toward using primitive and dangerous fuel sources for our transportation needs. This must end, and EV\u2019s are part of the solution! Check out my motor!!  ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhen do you think gas cars will lose their popularity?\u201d Not in the foreseeable future. A Tesla Model 3 with decent options costs $44,000 (in August 2019): https://www.edmunds.com/tesla/model-3/ A comparable gasoline powered car might sell for $15,000. That gasoline car might get around 33 mpg. With gas around $3/gal, that car would burn $18,000 worth of gasoline to drive 200,000 miles, which is a reasonable driving life for both that car and the Model 3. Even if we assume that car insurance premiums are equal, and electricity to recharge the Tesla costs nothing, and maintenance on the Tesla costs nothing, and lifetime maintenance on the gasoline car costs $11,000 (what a lemon!), we still only have a tie: both cars cost $44,000 to drive 200,000 miles. But even this artificially favorable-to-Tesla comparison results in the Tesla losing: with the Tesla, you pay everything up front, but with the gasoline car you pay 1/3 up front and the rest over 15 years or so. Plus, the Tesla owner still has range anxiety: recharging stations aren\u2019t as common as gas stations, and recharging takes hours, vs. a few minutes to fill the gas tank. Plus, the Tesla owner still has support anxiety: will Tesla actually survive? What happens to his $44,000 car if Tesla goes bankrupt: who will provide service and parts? I don\u2019t see a rational car buyer wanting a Tesla. They will have a small niche market among technology enthusiasts and affluent Leftists wanting to virtue-signal to fellow shrub-huggers and PCSJW. Which is fine, they can waste their money that way if they want to. I just don\u2019t see it becoming the pastime of millions. This could only change if politicians put their thumb on the scales: carbon taxes, EV subsidies, onerous design rules, or other measures to make gasoline cars more expensive, thus making the Tesla seem relatively cheaper to users. Even a continually falling quota of gasoline cars to be sold, regardless of price. All of those things could theoretically happen, but they would require politicians to risk their re-elections. Historically American politicians have not been willing to impose any real pain on their voters in pursuit of environmental correctness, outside of a few Progressive bastions. ",
