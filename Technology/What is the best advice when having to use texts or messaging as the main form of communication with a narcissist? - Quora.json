            "answer_text": "Great question. Firstly and absolutely the most important point is that if you must communicate with a narcissist never, ever react or provide an emotional response. Ensure you only provide short factual responses. A narcissist or person with ASPD will try to bait you with lies and false accusations all in an effort to start an argument. They need you to engage. DO NOT. You will look as crazy as they have accused you of being. Say nothing. As hard as this is to do it is absolutely imperative that you remain poised, dignified and ignore all of the rubbish they write in the three page + email simply designed to betlittle and harass you. This way you will look like the rational, calm person who focuses on facts and is trying to actually resolve issues. Crucial for legal proceedings or dealing with law enforcement. I have a very strict rule. I never respond immediately to emails. Write a draft and then give yourself time to really think about what you are writing and the consequences. Also, don\u2019t let anyone rush you into giving a quick response. Narcissists love this manipulation tactic. Take your time, unless there is a strict deal line. You really don\u2019t want to write something you\u2019ll regret later because you rushed. No is a response. No explanations needed. Any information you give a narcissist they will absolutely use against you. Give NO personal information or details. Also, if you don\u2019t wish to respond or are unsure how to respond you can simply write an acknowledgement such as \u201cnoted, with thanks\u201d or simply \u201creceived and noted\u201d. Ignore the narcissists repeated attempts to coerce you into providing a response. Avoid texting with a narcissist as much as you can. Emails give you the time to carefully consider each response and you\u2019ll not have to be concerned with a narcissist blowing up your phone with their nonsense drama. If you must text a narcissist in the instance of children\u2019s arrangements get a separate phone to your personal one. That way the time you have your children you can simply check the phone the narcissist messages whenever. ",

            "answer_text": "Llimit engagement to the bare minimum. No emotion, just facts, and reveal no unnecessary information. Anything you say can used against you, even seemingly random meaningless information can serve to make a terrible lie seem believable.2. Keep exchanges 100% neutral or positive. NO negative exchanges! Period. No matter the context. The Npdp can and will use your negative texts to support lies about you, damage your reputation to others, and even to blackmail you in the future. If you cannot control your feelings, simply put down the phone. 3. Immediately (\u201c\u201cerase for all\u201d) delete texts you send if he/she has read the text, in order to leave no trace. Leaving a trace allows them to be used later in manipulative ways, eg by showing to others things you said but out of context. 4. Notice periods when the npdp suddenly starts texting more/less often than usual. Sudden silence over days could mean they are now busy with other supply; hyperactive texting could mean manipulation is imminent. Notice what they will not write down (eg, no written \u201c i love yous\u201d could mean that the nodp is trying to avoid leaving traces of you for the new supply to find. 5. Do not trust photos etc of places where they say they might be, etc. Notice if they say they are with x but that person is not in any photos. Check the metadata of the photo, as it could be recycled. 6. Do not trust screenshots of texts they show you claiming they sent/were sent or the narrative those screenshots support, as they can easily cut out context to twist meaning. 7. Keep a record of texts by screenshotting important exchanges and saving them elsewhere. 8. Do not send anything with metadata that could reveal your whereabouts if you need to stay no contact. Take a photo of photos, docs etc from an anonymous device and send from that device, if you need to send them such things. 9. Consider having a unique phone number/SIM only for the purpose of communicating with them, to prevent the npdp from using your number to gain access to your phone (hacking) and the crucial life info that can provide. Make sure they do not know you have another number or what it is. The same goes for social media accounts. Make sure FB and other platforms restrict visibility only to friends. 10. Narcissists can be persistent with texting. Answer texts at a normal pace, when it is best for you ( eg not when you are working)and do not give in to persistent texting from the other person. Answering immediately when inconvenient for you will only train them to expect it. Excessive texting is a way of controlling you and keeping you focused on the npdp instead of your life, friends, job, etc. It can severely damage your connection to others and sabotage your work performance. 11. Stay alert. Become immune to the emotional impact on you of the npdp\u2019s words and remember that texting is an easy way to fake missing emotions. The narcissist may not actually be feeling the way his/her texts portray. Stay alert to the fact that texts lack context\u2026you cannot see how, where, with whom etc the other person is writing or speaking. It js easy to project onto texted words a scene or meaning that does not match reality. In fact, an\u201dangry\u201d narc may be smiling as he types, and a \u201cloving\u201d one may be in that moment sending similar texts to other lovers. Read the words but do not trust the feelings conveyed. Focus on the practical response when help is requested. 12. If baited to argue or do something you don\u2019t want to do, abruptly end the conversation with ready excuses (my mom is calling, the phone has 1% power). 13. Do not, under any circumstances, give the person physical access to your phone. 14. Be fully aware that your texts and messages to the other person may not be private. He/she may well be sharing them with others who may even be present with him/her on the other end, or the npdp maybe forwarding your texts to others. ",
