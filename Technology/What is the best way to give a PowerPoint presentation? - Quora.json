            "answer_text": "Who doesn\u2019t want to present their ideas to others more effectively? When you present effectively, your audience engages. They give you better feedback. They offer support. They connect you to others. They expect you to move forward. When you fail to connect with your audience, they seemingly turn into harsh critics who are unwilling to help! They ask question after question, tell you to go figure more things out, and come back at a later date. Have you ever thought about how to make a presentation as TED speakers? It is more than possible, just follow a few important tips. 1.Properly prepare You need for a careful analysis of audience members to know whom you\u2019re speaking to, and what they are expecting or needing from the presentation. Take time to talk to the person who invited you in the first place, to obtain a full and complete analysis of who will be in the room. 2. Start with a bang, not a whimper We live in an era of high entertainment, and when we sit people in a room to watch a presentation, we need our presentations to start with a bang. You can start with a compelling quote, a great story, a stunning statistic or even a provocative question. The key is to get people's attention. 3. Keep your slides consistent Whatever style you pick, you want to keep it consistent throughout the piece. Having one style for one slide and then a different style for a different slide can be jarring to the audience. 4. Make it visual Nothing makes peoples\u2019 eyes glaze over faster than a text-heavy slide, or slide after slide of just text. Use images, charts, graphs, videos or anything else visual to break up the monotony of words. It\u2019ll also add emotion to your presentation. 5. Less is more One of the cardinal sins of bad PowerPoints is cramming too many details and ideas on one slide, which makes it difficult for people to retain information. Leaving lots of \u201cwhite space\u201d on a slide helps people focus on your key points. 6. Keep the colors simple Stick to simple light and dark colors. Exceptionally bright text can cause eye fatigue, so use those colors sparingly. Dark text on a light background or light text on a dark background will work well. Also avoid intense gradients, which can make text hard to read. 7. Choose your fonts well Fonts communicate subtle messages in and of themselves, which is why you should choose fonts deliberately. Use the same font set throughout your entire slide presentation, and use no more than two complementary fonts (e.g., Arial and Arial Bold). 8. Involve the audience in the presentation Whether your goal is to inform or to persuade, the goal will be more likely met if the audience has a participative role in the presentation. People don\u2019t like to be talked to \u2013 they like to be talked with. ",

            "answer_text": "This have been always a messy task for me. I can tell you what i have learned till now about a successful presentation.  1. Don't overdo it. Some time i spent more than 30 hours on a single 40 slide presentation, and still lacking the audience interest. I always collected strong content and punched it in each corner of every slide. I was spreading shit in the name of content, because no matter how much you know about something but when it comes to presentations, you have to keep it short and feeble, if you really want someone to view it. You are giving a presentation to wake them cheer, not to make them sleep of boredom.  2. Meaningful content pulls attentionPretty much related to previous point. your content must be short and meaningful. Do it like, you have to tell them one important thing beside telling them three not valuing. Try to not to write more than 18 words in single slide.   3. Maintain its themeThis focuses on everything expect content. Content is not enough to gain attention. How you represent it, gives it the power to stand.First of all write down a frame of you presentation, create some points and then categorize them, put a slide containing heading of points in between each category. This sort out everything and makes it easy to understand. 3.1 ColorsSome people do good about content and theme, but kills the interest with nonsense colors. Its you presentation, not a Clown's hut. Colors put a huge impact on theme of presentation. Choose just 4 to 6 colors and assign them their role. one for Headings, second for main points, third for white space (White space is actually good if you don't want to use color) and so on. This will keep the presentation in good manner.You can get color suggestions from - a.) https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/b.) http://www.colourlovers.com/   does this looks like a good presentation? of course not. 3.2 FontsDon't blame anyone if you use that overused Comic Sans or Times New Roman for presentation, you presentation will definitely suck.Internet is full of beautiful fonts, freely available to all. Why stick to that 90's fonts ?Find some good fonts (Google \"beautiful fonts\"), which suits your theme. I mostly use 3 kind of fonts in a single presentation. one for headings, second for quotes and third for content. You can use less or more according to theme. But please avoid those bulky, rotten fonts. Please.Want some beautiful free fonts? here you go-a.) http://www.fontspace.com/category/beautifulb.) http://www.awwwards.com/100-greatest-free-fonts-collection.html   4. Pictures After spending 30 minutes and going through 60 slides, the only thing audience remembers is visuals. Without pictures, presentations looks like a government signed boring documentary. Can you read a 60 page book without a single photograph? I prefer not to give a  That's exactly what audience will do if you don't serve them some good graphics with text, even if they watch it, they are not going to remember it as soon as it ends.A good pictures tells more than a good text.  Free sources for stock photos - a.) https://pixabay.com/b.) http://www.freedigitalphotos.net/c.) http://freephotosbank.com/d.) http://www.imcreator.com/free  5. Try something different80% of people use power point to make presentations, its always been the best from past many years. But that really means that you must stick to it?Try - https://www.canva.com/ or https://www.haikudeck.com/ beside powerpoint, Canva is a great choice they also offers good stock photos for presentations.   6. No rulesYes, although the tips i've written here are based on my own experience, but these are not a line carved on a stone. Actually rules stops creativity. So go ahead squeeze every last drop of your very own creativity in your presentation and came up with something jaw dropping.  Let me make things easier with these examples - a.) You Suck At PowerPoint! by @jessedee (this one is my favorite) b.) Simplicityc.) A crime so monstrousd.) Feels Bad On The BackHave a look & good luck Image sources - ( just googled 'em) ",
