            "answer_text": "Q: Will the iPhone X support 5G? A: No, there are no phones that came out before the rollout of 5G that can connect with 5G because they don\u2019t have a 5G modem chip inside them. This is not an issue because although cell companies are starting to rollout 5G, there are extremely few towers that will have 5G until 2021There will be extremely few 5G towers that will deliver High Speed 5G until 2025Cell companies will be advertising their 5G coverage, without disclosing that there will not be 100% High Speed 5G to 100% of their subscribers until 2025 and maybe for may years beyond thatAll iPhones will continue keep working on all cell networks because all 5G towers will always support 4G, LTE, 3G, 2.5G, EDGE, 2G and 1G into the future.iPhones made in September of 2020 and onward will all have 5G modem chips inside them, so they will be well ahead of the 2025 target date for reasonable coverage of 5GThere is no rush to get 5G, it will be an extra cost on top of your existing bill",

            "answer_text": "No current iPhone supports 5G because they don\u2019t have the necessary hardware inside (5G radio module) and this means the current line will never be able to access 5G speeds as the hardware is not upgradeable. I would ask however, why would someone need 5G speed in a smartphone anyway? I can\u2019t think of any application on a smartphone which would require this kind of speed, at least for some years from now. Not to mention that as of now - end of 2019 - the spots with 5G coverage are as rare as a chicken\u2019s teeth and are used for experimental purposes, rather than for real life usage. Most probably next year\u2019s iPhones will support 5G but even so, if I am going to upgrade my trusty X it won\u2019t have anything to do with this. ",
