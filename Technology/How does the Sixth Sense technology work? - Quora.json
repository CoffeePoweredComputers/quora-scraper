            "answer_text": "Sixth sense technology converts the senses which we cannot perceive (eg. magnetic field, blood pressure) into a stimulus that we can perceive like touch, vibrations. The part of the body used is usually the back because we don't use the back for sensing in everyday life. The brain takes time to adapt to the new pattern of stimulus to perceive it as a new sense. Sensory agglutination is the use of a sense to perceive a sense which is lost for example using auditory stimulus in blinds to have vision. The idea here is the area of brain responsible for particular sensation is still intact we can exploit that area to recreate the sense using different stimulus ",
