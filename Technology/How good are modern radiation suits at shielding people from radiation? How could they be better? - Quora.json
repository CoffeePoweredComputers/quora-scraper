            "answer_text": "Generally, radiation suits don't stop the radiation, they keep radioactive contamination off the person. They do a good job at that. To improve it, you tape the cuffs, don a mask, etc. Not much room for improvement. To actually stop the radiation, the suits would have to be much heavier, to heavy to be very useful. Stopping the radiation requires lots of orbital electrons, which requires lots of mass. There isn\u2019t any way around that. ",
