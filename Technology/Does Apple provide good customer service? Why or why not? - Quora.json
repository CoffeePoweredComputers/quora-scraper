            "answer_text": "Have you ever had a great meal? Did you tell anybody about it? Have you ever had a rotten meal that you wish you never had the misfortune of eating? How many people did you tell about it? I've answered this before in a another question, excerpted here:I had a 2010 iMac 27\"  w/ AppleCare. Motherboard died in 2011. $1500 in  parts and labor covered. Had my machine back in less than a week. 2013,  monitor starts to go, took it in for repair, screen was flashing on and  off. Took it back, they were going to order close to $1800 in parts for  what might be wrong, manager noticed the problems I had with that iMac  over the 3 years and gave me a brand new 2013 27\" iMac with double the  RAM.  I am a Apple user for life based on these  experiences with Apple.   Now, this does not by any means mean that Apple has the best customer care for everyone.  In marketing, they say that everyone that has had outstanding customer service will tell 1 to 3 people and people who have had bad customer service will tell 7 to 10 people. So I try to go out of my way to tell others about my great customer service with Apple and any other companies or restaurants that have great customer service or products. Apple has been outstanding to me, but I have heard stories of people denied claims, cracked screens and most notably the case that went to court because the moisture sensors were tripped even though they had not been in contact with liquid. The moisture sensor apparently could be tripped by sweat or humidity moisture. I believe Apple settled last year and agreed to cover repairs of the eligible devices that had originally been denied. Before I got the iPhone 4, my wife, daughter and myself each had LG Envy phones. I alone had 3 that were replaced under warranty through Verizon, each replacement being a refurbished model. I used to have an LG refrigerator, and after several repairs to the water line and freezer shelves that would constantly collapse with little weight on them, needles to say, I now own a GE refrigerator. Because of these experiences, I will never buy or own another LG product. Now, I am sure there are people who have had a bad Apple experience like I've had with LG and will never buy an Apple product. And that is okay with me. I understand.  What I don't get is the people who just spout BS about iOS vs Android OS and vice versa, but that's not for this discussion. We all have different experiences with different products, people and places. Try to make it a point to tell people about the good things too. ",

            "answer_text": "Yep. I\u2019ve used their online support for the past 3 years and not once have they disappointed me, calling them, pretty much any issue can be resolved within <10 mins, chatting online is great if you\u2019re not in the mood to talk to someone, while still getting great support, and taking your device to an Apple store the staff are friendly and the personal effect is much higher than any other support system from any other company that I\u2019ve used. Yearly surveys back this up, every year companies like Laptop Mag: perform surveys on the customer support of tech companies, and surprise surprise, Apple wins ever year. This year in 2019, their online support solved 91/100 problems, in comparison Samsung solved 73/100 and Microsoft 64/100. Furthermore Apple support solved issues in just 6:40, their competitors took longer, one of whom almost took 30mins. ",

            "answer_text": "I am dissatisfied from the authorized Apple service center. On 1 may 2015, I purchased IPhone 5s and from the day one, I am complaining service center regarding battery drainage, network issue, heating issue. Also, I got a duplicate data cable and adapter. Within 2 months I visited 4 times service center. These people are not able to resolve the issue. I requested them for replacement but they are not replacing. On May 5, 2015 I went to the B2X service center in Chennai regarding network issue, battery drainage and heating issue while charging. Then they asked their technical team to check and they updated iOS then also they said charger was duplicate. I bought a new charger of cost Rs 3000 but still problem was there. I visited same service center in Delhi and they did the same thing but all in vain still problem was there. On 15 Jul 2015 a small pink color spot start appearing at left hand side bottom and then it slowly and gradually converting in back then it starts floating like liquid and become a big spot. As per your service center employee it is because of pressure. It\u2019s not because of pressure. The same day I visted 3 service centers all having different viewsAfter Visting the service center when i spoke to senior employee of Future World, New Delhi and told him the whole story and what he found charger was not duplicate.Now I am going to consume court for the same filing a case against Apple, Future World, and B2X. Also contacting media for the same.Because Applle and their service provider are just fooling customers in terms of brand. I was simply requesting you people for replacing the phone from the day one. I need a solution and I am not going to pay 21000 bucks for replacement. It\u2019s still under warranty.Please advise your service center stop harassing the customers. ",
