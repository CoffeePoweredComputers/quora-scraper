            "answer_text": "Future advances of autonomous technology could lead to hunter killer robots. But the modern day predator drone is nowhere near being an autonomous killer. A predator drone is not autonomous. It\u2019s remote controlled. The pilots sit in a control center the size of a shipping container in the desert of Nevada controlling its flight path and firing weapons. The drone makes no decisions on its own it just does what it\u2019s pilots tell it to do. ",
