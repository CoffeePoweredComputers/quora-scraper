            "answer_text": "Well it depends where you live. Huawei is no longer sold in the USA but you can still import it and use it here. You can probably get a flagship Huawei phone through eBay or Amazon from a 3rd party dealer. Also, very important.. Huawei phones will not be any ordinary Android phone anymore as there are no longer Google services on their phones (no Google Play App Store) so you will be using Huawei\u2019s own Ap Store. If you have an iPhone, you can go online on a PC and log into your iCloud account. Make sure your iCloud is already synced on your iPhone (just go to the settings). And then from the iCloud website on your web browser on your PC, you can extract and export your contacts into a vCard file (.VCF). This file can then be moved into your Huawei Android phone via PC USB transfer.. you can plug your Huawei Android phone into the PC using the USB cable and copy the vCard file into the phone. Then you can go to your Huawei phone\u2019s contacts page and select import contacts and there you have a duplicate copy of your iPhone contacts on your new Huawei Android phone. Regarding photos, with an iPhone you can easily plug in the iPhone to your PC and if you look at the disk drives, you will see the iPhone and the simply open it and copy the DCIM folder to the desktop first, or copy it directly to the Huawei Android phone inside the \u201cphotos\u201d folder. There you will have a copy of all your iPhone camera pictures copied directly to the phone. Luckily with iPhones, they give you direct access to the camera photos when you plug it in. Regarding apps, you cannot copy or import apps.. any paid apps will have to be purchased all over again. However, on Android phones, most apps are FREE anyways so you won\u2019t have any problems getting apps easily. As I mentioned above, there will be no Google services and therefore NO Google Play app store.. you will be using Huawei\u2019s app store which probably has a bunch of apps imported from the Google Play Store. So that\u2019s how you switch over from iPhone to Huawei\u2026 considering you live in the USA, you most likely will be buying a Huawei phone from a 3rd party online (most likely eBay or Amazon) as Huawei is not sold in any major USA online retailer or stores anymore due to the USA and China feud.. but it\u2019s still possible to use it here in the US.
