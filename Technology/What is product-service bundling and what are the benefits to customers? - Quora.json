            "answer_text": "In marketing, product bundling is offering several products or services for sale as one combined product or service package. It is a common feature in many imperfectly competitive product and service markets. Product or service Bundling is defined as combining two or more products/services with a reward benefit for the customer that takes up the combined product/service set. It sounds so simple to create product and service Bundles \u2013 combine some products into a package and give customers a discount for taking it up and the task is done. The result is higher revenue, lower operational costs and better profits, i.e. 1+1=3; the synergistic profitability impact. However, there are many unique issues in developing and implementing a bundling strategy that will ultimately drive success or failure. As bundling involves combining a range of products, it exacerbates the complexity and importance of resolving these issues and challenges in order to reap the potential profits from bundling. What appears to be a winning profit strategy could end up with disastrous results to a company\u2019s bottom line if not managed correctly. Business Benefits Bundling is attractive to consumers who benefit from a single, value-oriented purchase of complementary offerings. Bundling helps to increase efficiencies, thus reducing marketing and distribution cost. It allows the consumer to look at one single source that offers several solutions. ",
