            "answer_text": "The Redmi 6 is one of the only two Redmi phones -- Redmi 6A is another one -- in India with MediaTek processor. Powered by a MediaTek chip, Xiaomi does its software optimisation well to ensure performance is good. The Redmi 6, which comes with Helio P22 processor, is no different. It comes in two variants - the base model with 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage while the second variant comes with 3GB of RAM and 64GB storage which is expandable up to 256GB via microSD. The phone is most of the time very smooth. It shows no visible lags or stutters. Switching between apps happens in a blink of an eye, scrolling through Facebook and Twitter feeds is smooth on the Redmi 6. It is also pretty good at handling regular as well as graphics-heavy games. The Redmi 6 also works well even if you have some five or six or even 10 apps open in the background. In 8 months of use, I never found the phone slow. Run Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and several other apps together and the Redmi 6 still manages well. It's at times that opening of apps that it takes an extra second or two compared to a more expensive phone like the OnePlus 5, but this is never bothersome. Another good bit about the performance is that the phone doesn't heat up much even during extended gaming sessions or while watching a 3-hour long movie. Despite its low price, the Redmi 6 comes with AI-based face unlock feature and rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. Both of them work fairly quickly. ",
