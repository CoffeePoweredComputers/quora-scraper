            "answer_text": "Is Covid testing hidden microchiping? First, COVID-19 is a virus. It puts nothing into your body except itself. It tests nothing (except, maybe, our patience). This virus doesn\u2019t care about you, just your lung cells to have sex in and make millions of tiny virus babies. If you\u2019re referring to that hilarious plan to insert into each syringe of vaccine a microchip to Activate the virus and kill us,Render us all sterile, per evil Bill\u2019s nefarious plan of population control,Create an ultimate Big Brother, who follows everybody ALL of the time,Or any other reason, no matter how impossible or just plain crazy, just stop. For the love of all that\u2019s holy, give it up. Even asking these kinds of questions may make others believe that you\u2019ve gone round the bend. ",

            "answer_text": "I stopped awarding my Dumb Quora Question of the Day because there are so many dumb people out there. But this is truly a really dumb question. Really, if you are dumb enough to believe that people can be tracked by microchips, then I have some tin-foil hats for sale. The closest technology that exists are the microchips we put into our pets. If your pet gets lost, you can\u2019t just go on a website and say \u201cwhere\u2019s my dog?\u201d. The only way to read the chip is by passing a receiver over the chip, usually at a vet\u2019s office. The range of those things is an inch or less. The technology simply doesn\u2019t exist to track anyone who has been microchipped. (Except in the movies). ",
