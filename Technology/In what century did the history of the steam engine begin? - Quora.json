The Steam Engine was invented by a guy named \u201cHero,\u201d back in ~50 BC:  (Wikipedia) Typically, and as Hero described the device, the water is heated in a simple boiler which forms part of a stand for the rotating vessel. Where this is the case, the boiler is connected to the rotating chamber by a pair of pipes that also serve as the pivots for the chamber. Alternatively the rotating chamber may itself serve as the boiler, and this arrangement greatly simplifies the pivot/bearing arrangements, as they then do not need to pass steam. This can be seen in the illustration of a classroom model shown here. (Wikipedia)Hero developed his steam engine to demonstrate steam power, and win bar bets, but mostly mostly to win bar bets\u2026 ",
