            "answer_text": "Innovations in Construction Technology Green ConstructionThe green revolution has also some effects on this industry. Global movement of saving the natural environment has emerged the latest concept. It means while constructing buildings, natural environment should not be spoiled and materials used for building must be eco-friendly. This concept should be implemented to all types of construction including domestic as well as commercial construction. Green construction is actually an eco-friendly construction system that follows the regulations, which are created to save the environment of our planet. 2. LEED The latest approach in construction technology is LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design). It is also introduced to monitor the green construction level in the industry. It assures the quality and checks the eco-friendly mode of construction. It also works to search and introduce the materials for green construction. Moreover, it also pays attention to all related aspects and monitors it keenly to make all the process eco-friendly by keeping a balance in energy level of system. 3. Hercules Single Strand Tensioning System The construction industry is re-energized by technology, particularly for building infrastructure locations such as bridges, as it requires extra strength and durability. For attaining this purpose, new technologies are wonderful, as they are reducing time and used men power with increased strength and robustness. In early system, cables were drawn manually and then concrete was poured to enhance the sturdiness by using massive labor. In spite of all this quality maintenance was big issue. It also increases the cost of project that sometimes goes beyond the expectations. Hercules Single Strand Stressing System provides a suitable solution for many such problems in huge projects for the strength of infrastructure. Use of modern technology and machinery guarantees the quality assurance of the project. Pre-stress concrete tendons with steel cables ensure the quality. Along with Hercules Single Strand Stressing Systems, other improvements can also be seen such as utilization of low-pressure hydraulics with jacks and chucks that dispense the tension cables swifter and devoid of the shock gaps that can form through the manual pulling. 4. Styrofoam Panels This technology is being practiced for mainstream for the last decade. This technology provides good resistance to thermal convection that helps in creation of heat controlled homes. Styrofoam panels are actually EPS foam that is sealed between steel sheets for strength and this foam works as thermal resistor. It not only has heat resistance but also has capacity to endure the wind speed up to 140 mph. This makes it favorable in the areas targeted by hurricane. As it laminates the foam in steel sheets that make it safer from termites, as they can\u2019t invade steel sheets. The durability and strength of Styrofoam make buildings long lasting and cleaner than buildings constructed with other materials. Use of new technology in construction endows with comfortable buildings for housing and business. 5. Unbounded PT Slabs Unbonded PT slabs are being used in construction industry since long and have proven them beneficial. These are affordable for constructing modern buildings and are also considered reliable for their quality and strength. Their steel strands are greased well to resist rusting that increase their age. The unbonded PT slabs are light weight and flexible due to small thickness of its unbonded tendon. Due to this reason, unbonded PT slab patterns are able to make best use of complete strength of a concrete slab. These are successfully used at different places such as on roofs, pavements, and even in the round water tanks. One thing must be kept in mind while purchasing them that never compromise on their quality. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "In the current era, modern & sustainable construction and development are one of the most important trends in the construction industry, and this is becoming possible with technology. Take the example of Katerra Group of Developers; the way they have been making use of the modern techniques to create and manufacture the products in their workhouse easily is commendable. They conveniently and strategically plan every corner of the rooms at their workshop. They use the best quality products, including high-quality services, which ensures minimal & controlled installation. Once all the components are prepared, they are transported and assembled on the site scheduled as per their time. This leads to an easier, convenient, faster, and safer delivery of the project. Katerra Group, in the year 2019, managed to successfully develop a 124-meter living house on Saudi Arabian land, which will suit every requirement. Minimal and controlled installation integrated technology usage across design, manufacture, and assembly ensures time savings and superior product delivery. ",
