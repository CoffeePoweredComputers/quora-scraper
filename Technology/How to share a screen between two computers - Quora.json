            "answer_text": "There are two ways, one for simultaneously seeing windows from two computers, one for seeing one at a time. One at a time: Use a KVM switch. It will also let you share a keyboard and a mouse. Simultaneous: Use one computer, and on that use a VNC or RDP client to log in and open windows assosciated with the other computer. There must be an IP network between the computers and the 2nd computer must also be running matching software in order to communicate with the first. The KVM method is limited to computers physically close together. That is not a requirement for RDP or VNC. You may use the RDP/VNC method with a full screen window, so it seems to be one at a time.

Do you want something like a KVM solution, one keyboard / video / mouse switch between a number of computers? Do you have a laptop next to a desktop you want to use sorta like an extension of your desktop? ",
