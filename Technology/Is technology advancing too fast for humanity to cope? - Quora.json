            "answer_text": "You gotta love questions couched in the negative. It really should be: \u201cAre we going to fast\u2026?\u201d Better yet, \u201cAre we advancing technology too rapidly?\u201d I just have to ask. Forgive me. Were we going at the right speed in 1099AD? Maybe it was 1890 that saw us speed up too much. You see, compared to past eras of human technology, we are always going faster. Okay. Now that we have settled that, let\u2019s move forward. Did we go too fast in developing a smallpox vaccine or one for polio? If we go fast enough in finding cures (and preventions) for cancer to save millions of lives, will that be too fast? I am simply having a problem wrapping my mind around this question. I am sorry to say so. Perhaps, I am just too technologically progressive. A few decades, Bill Gates used his considerable fortune to build a \u201csmart house.\u201d Today, anyone who can afford a house can afford to make it somewhat smart. Is that too fast? Autonomous cars are coming. Are they coming too slowly? A new breakthrough in solar cells promises 70\u201380% efficiency compared to around 20% now. Is that too fast? Please point out technology advances that are too fast so that I may gauge my reactions better. I might guess that the atomic bomb was too fast in some ways, but what would the end of WW II have been like without it? To my mind, it\u2019s not the development of technology that is too fast. Too often, new technology is deployed in the wrong ways too quickly. There\u2019s where things are over-fast. At least we are holding back on editing human genes \u2014 for now. I see two extremes here. One is the Ray Kurzweil crowd. Good old Ray is dosing himself with all sorts of stuff, some intravenously, to keep himself alive until his vaunted \u201cSingularity\u201d \u2014 a bunch of poppycock if I ever saw it \u2014 around 2045. At the other end are staunch conservatives who would have us still riding about in horse-drawn carriages and have legions of street cleaners sweeping up horse dung in the smelly streets of our cities. Hey, if you were in the buggy-whip business, technology did come too quickly. No. Do not blame the advances of technology. Blame people who cannot adapt to it. We were educated in the past, most of us. We were taught to memorize rather than to think. If I had stayed with my education, I would be telling you about the 48 states and would know their capitals by heart. Instead, I worked to develop my thinking and learned to learn by myself. They call that person an autodidact, but I do not think that I deserve such a laudatory name. You do not have to use the new technologies. I signed up for Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, but I don\u2019t use the first two much. I haven\u2019t bothered with Instagram. Why should I? It certainly is much like the first two \u2014 dull and insipid. You don\u2019t have to have a smart lock on your home\u2019s door. You could have an inside bar and a latch string. How many people even know how that works? Of course, that\u2019s for families where someone is always in the house or neighborhoods where it\u2019s safe to leave your door unlocked during the day and where people are at home at night \u2014 and neighbors look out for each other. Anyway, we really are messed up with our education. These high-stakes tests have made it worse. They have turned good teachers into memory machines. Sad! STEM has turned good science classes into engineering project classes with no science at all. Sadder! We really must have smart science education so that our children learn to think for real and not by gut, by memory, or by obeisance to authority. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re asking the key question of the 21st century here. But it\u2019s not technology advancing too fast that is the whole dilemma. Rather than giving you the full-blown lecture, I\u2019ll boil it down. The story of mankind has been technological effect outpacing human institutional ability to adapt quickly enough. Whether that institution is governmental, religious, economic, military, or a combination thereof \u2014 societies, cultures and their institutions do not adapt as fast as technology creates change. Bad things usually result.  38,000,000 casualties in World War I, because of some old imperial treaties, a few anarchists and technologically advanced warfare. Students of history and anyone at a military academy learn this over and over. It\u2019s why the US pours so much money into military tech. So this little truth about humanity is not a secret. Not since the Mongols perfected archery on horseback. The problem we\u2019re running into is this: Rate of Change has been increasing, as the complexity and power of our technology has been increasing. You\u2019ve probably noticed. Atomic bombs. Petro-economics, politics and climate change. Robotics, IT and cultural norms about human employment. Now the other problem: Technology is helping humans live longer. Much longer. Used to be, we could count on the elders being replaced and thus allowing institutions to adapt *somewhat* fast enough to keep up with technology. You see where I\u2019m going here: Increasing Rate of Change (and scope of change, now that we\u2019re globally connected) is bumping right into cohorts of people who are living longer, thinking in the past, and exacerbating humanity\u2019s age-old dilemma. Some are even warning of the Rise of Gerontocracy. We do have a lot of smart people who are aware of this \u201cinstitutional lag\u201d problem. It\u2019s largely religious and political institutions that are the worst laggards, along with the cultural forces that underpin them. It might seem like we\u2019re having trouble coping today, but the previous five centuries were much, much worse. We just need to keep a handle on the climate change issue, not let the nuclear genie out of the bottle and make sure our growing population has enough fresh water and food. Easy, right? ",
