            "answer_text": "No component, GPU included, should exceed 90 \u00b0C at any time. As long you\u2019re below that \u2013 you\u2019re fine. That doesn\u2019t mean that if the temperature happens to go higher your hardware will get destroyed or damaged. If operation limits are exceeded, processing units reduce their performance by themselves in order to reduce the temperature. In extreme cases they will automatically shut down. ",

If you don\u2019t have graphic card like a Quadro or FireGL, which they are much more resilient aganist heat, then you should keep your GPU under 80 celsius. ",
