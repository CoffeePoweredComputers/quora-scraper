            "answer_text": "Volumetric efficiency of an engine essentially defines the breathing capacity. It plays a vital role in determining the amount of fuel an engine can burn completely and the peak rpm at which engine can work rationally.  Volumetric efficiency of an engine is depended on type and size of air filter, carburetor, throttle plate position, intake valve design and few other factors. Theoretically it is defined as the ratio of the volume of flow rate of air into intake system to the rate at which volume is displaced by the piston. Now,        Volumetric efficiency = 2 x Ma/ (p x V x N)        Where,                    Ma - mass of air inducted into cylinder per cycle.                    p    - inlet air density.                    V - volume of the cylinder.                    N - R.P.M of engine. One should note that the mass of air induced  depends on the rpm of the engine as other parameters generally don't vary significantly. It should be quite clear that the volumetric efficiency decreases at higher rpm  because the process of pushing the exhaust gases out and sucking the fresh charge inside cylinder gets lesser and lesser time. Hence, the the marginal increase in the mass of air induced decreases with increase in R.P.M. The increase of rpm helps in increasing the mass flow rate which is much higher than the drop caused by the decrease in volumetric efficiency. Hence, the decrease in volumetric efficiency affect the marginal increase in the amount of  mass induced inside the cylinder. The effect of increase in rpm offsets the effect of decrease in volumetric efficiency on mass flow rate. So, overall the mass flow rate increase but at a decreasing rate. For this reason automobile manufacturers employ turbochargers and  superchargers in engines which increases the mass flow rate by increasing the inlet air density and maintaining the volumetric efficiency of engine. Note-  This decreasing marginal increase in mass flow rate sets the upper bound for engine rpm. Note 2 - We have not considered several aspects of volumetric efficiency like ram effect, frictional losses, composition of fuel and air fuel ratio for simplicity purposes. Hope it helps! Thanks for asking.  ",

            "answer_text": "Volumetric efficiency is the ratio of actual amount of air and fuel mixture inducted into the cylinder to the swept volume of the cylinder. For any engine the volumetric efficiency is not constant throughout the operating range.(considering it is designed to operate in a range and not at a constant speed like gen-sets) The volumetric efficiency is maximum in a particular range of engine speed which depends on whole lot of engine design factors which are not a part of the question. Volumetric efficiency thus varies with engine speed and other factors. Mass of air increases because there are more number of cycles at higher speeds. Usually the volumetric efficiency of the engine is highest where it produces maximum torque. ",
