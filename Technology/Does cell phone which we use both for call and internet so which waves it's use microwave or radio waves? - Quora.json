            "answer_text": "Its all the same. Radio waves are part of the electromagnetic spectrum \u2013 ranging between frequencies of 3 Hz and 300 GHz corresponding to wavelengths of 100,000 kilometers and 1 mm. Microwaves are essentially radio waves and have wavelengths that range 1 mm to 1 meter. Different wavelengths or bands of microwaves are used for different applications. Mid-wavelength microwaves are used for satellite communication. Long wavelength microwaves are used in microwave ovens and so on. Cell phones use 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz bands. As for the Internet, quite recently the 25 to 39 GHz band was allotted to the 5G spectrum, and in future, 95 GHz to 3 THz range \u2014 a collection of frequencies that aren\u2019t currently being used in any consumer devices, but have wide bandwidth with vast potential for data streaming may be employed.
