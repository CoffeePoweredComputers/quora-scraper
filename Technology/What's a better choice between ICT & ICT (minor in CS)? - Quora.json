            "answer_text": "First thing , I want to make clear to you is that CS here , stands for Computational Science. In simple terms , it has to do something with simulation and modelling of big real world problems. So , ICT with CS will have some 1-2 extra subjects from 4th semester and you also have to maintain minimum CPI of 6.5 . So , ICT with minor in CS is better option. Don't worry if you get ICT only , you can get into ICT with CS after 3rd semester by scoring CPI above 7.5 . ",
