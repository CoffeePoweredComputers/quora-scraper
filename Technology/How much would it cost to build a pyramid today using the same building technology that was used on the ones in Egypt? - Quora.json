            "answer_text": "HOWDY! I am wondering whether you could change your question \u2018 the other way round - like - build a Pyramid with modern technology and modern materials \u2018 I am pretty sure that you will get a whole lot of good answers, trust me! Any building with \u2018old technology \u2018 belongs to thing of the past. Technology in 2560B.C was more labour intensive but hands-on and skilled craftsmanship of \u2018ancient method\u2019 makeshift stagings and scaffoldings - see below:- The Great Pyramid at Giza - 20 years to build to the completion. Noah \u2018s ark - 50 years to construct it (below) Credit: Watchtower ON LINE LIBARY Solomon\u2019s temple -7 and a half year to finish it. Credit: Watchtower ON LINE LIBARY Just a simple analysis, the Pyramid was built with 2.5 million gigantic blocks and took 20 years to build, any attempt to answer your question must include \u2018 20 years of labour cost of 2,000\u20134,000 workers and 200,000 mountains have to be blasted in order to get that amount of gigantic blocks- they will go bonkers!. For that matter, no one knows for sure how \u2018The Great Pyramid at Giza\u2019 was built as what you see and how it was built is different matters. Most architects and engineers have been trained to look on a bright side of the future while the past is for the inspiration they cherish and learn from it. As such, no one would want to be left behind so they move forward, this mindset is mutual across the world. I am pretty sure that the repair work of \u2018 Notre- Dame Cathedral in Paris \u2018 will be carried out following exactly what was constructed but with \u2018 modern technology \u2018 At least, you got some answer but may not be what you want.
