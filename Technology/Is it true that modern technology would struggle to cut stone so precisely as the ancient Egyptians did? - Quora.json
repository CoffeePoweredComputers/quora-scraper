            "answer_text": "Modern technology would not struggle to cut the stone with greater precision than that which is shown on the Pyramids. See SpeedCut 100 - epiroc for how this is done today. Or waterjet cut. I\u2019m not suggesting the Egyptians had either, they did NOT, nor does this mean they are needed to cut the stones!  Either method can deliver precision cuts to around 1mm tolerances (dimensionally), precision grinding and polishing to around 100 micron (0.1mm) flatness (largely due to the grain size of the sedimentary limestone). The tolerances on the pyramid for the main building blocks are very rough, about 1\u20132 cm, they are butt next to each other and mortar used to maintain a reasonably consistent course height. What is impressive is the so-called facing stones (shown below. base).  To manufacture just two blocks with a tolerance of .01 inch and place them together with a gap of no more than .02 inch is a remarkable feat. The Great Pyramid had at one time over 100,000 similar casing stones. Did the ancient Egyptians have advanced technology?Fragments of Casing Stone from the Great Pyramid fitted into a frame to show the angle of the face 51 degrees 51 minutes A History of the Great Pyramids at Giza; and, a Chronological catalog of descriptions and drawings from the Roman realm, including the Colossus known as The Sphinx I have not heard a plausible explanation for how the casing stones were produced with the tools known to exist at the time. Although there is some weathering on the very limited number of casing stones that remain, you cannot put a credit card between them or a sheet of paper for that matter. It is these that are produced to much higher tolerances (compared to the huge number of inner blocks that are much more inconsistent and mortar is used to make the block up to a more regular course height). The photo shows the large difference in tolerances.  I think it unlikely that the casing stones consistency could be achieved with copper chisels or mechanical pounding to delaminate layers (a method that was known to be used in quarries). This for me is a mystery. The only method that seems viable (to me) is Herodutus account which may allude to mechanically grinding the faces flat using the causeway canal, which I find an interesting idea and would seem viable. 124. \u2026Of this oppression there passed ten years while the causeway was made by which they drew the stones, which causeway they built, and it is a work not much less, as it appears to me, than the pyramid; for the length of it is five furlongs and the breadth ten fathoms and the height, where it is highest, eight fathoms, and it is made of stone smoothed and with figures carved upon it. For this, they said, the ten years were spent, and for the underground chambers on the hill upon which the pyramids stand, which he caused to be made as sepulchral chambers for himself in an island, having conducted thither a channel from the Nile. For the making of the pyramid itself there passed a period of twenty years; and the pyramid is square, each side measuring eight hundred feet, and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed and fitted together in the most perfect manner. The second book of the Histories. Excerpt relevant to the construction of the pyramids N.B. Herodotus is not an eye witness account or necessarily a good source but is closer to the time when some knowledge of the construction method used may have been passed down by oral tradition or now lost records, it is an obvious question every generation will have asked, \u2018how did they make that?\u2019. My own view is that this is a plausible method, but to be clear I\u2019m not an archaeologist but would value their views? A possible method of grinding the stones flat is to use a long barge with cutaway and wall in the central section of a barge to accommodate the rough cut block(s), ideally, pinned to the wall with dowels to maintain a standard course depth and simply drag the barge with rough stone along the causeway and grind the stone(s) suspended within flat. Or to use two staggered barges that are connected with timbers and a jig to accommodate the block. It would not require much labour, many stones could be ground at the same time and all could be produced within the suggested build window. I also note the causeway has a granite floor and it would be sand that did the grinding (limestone being sedimentary rock, it is more a process of delaminating the sand grains from the block being ground). I have done some research on this, it seems to be a viable method and I have not read an archaeological or scientific paper which suggests a viable method for how this was actually achieved with the tools and techniques the Egyptians did have available. I stand to be corrected if others know of a viable method? This is an interesting video by an experimental archaeologist on how the blocks were drilled and split for the rough blocks used on the inner of the Pyramid.  They would then be transported to site, graded into sizes and likely used stones to pound the rough internal blocks to the required size and or chiselled (but my own view is they would want to minimise the use of copper tools as they are expensive and would wear. If inexpensive granite pounding balls can be used, why not do that? Video on pounding balls used to make channels at queries and could be used to trim the internal blocks to the required shape and size. Video shows a pounding ball being used and other techniques used at the Quarry. It suppressing that the granite ball bounces back into the hands of the worker, but do. Something like a few inches depth can be achieved per hour with this method. There is also a clever use of natural faults in the quarry.  ",

            "answer_text": "True? No. It\u2019s that other one. What\u2019s that word? Oh, yeah: false. It\u2019s a persistent myth, but a myth nevertheless. First, the finishing on most of the stones of the pyramids is not particularly precise at all. Most of those stones are a little big, a little small, or just have rough sides, and there\u2019s a lot of mortar filling in the gaps. The really good stuff is saved for facings, like along the corridors or, presumably, on the outer casing, now sadly lost. Second, it\u2019s not actually that difficult to get closely fitting stones, not with ancient technology and certainly not with modern technology. The quality of the best masonry in the pyramids is no better than what the Greeks and Romans did (by hand; we know exactly what tools and techniques they used because they wrote about them). And it\u2019s not really better than what you can get with commonplace modern tools and techniques. Should you walk into a fancy office building, look to see if they\u2019ve got a marble floor. If they do, you may have to search for the lines between tiles. And the cheap (like, a buck or two per square foot) marble tiles I bought for my bathroom are cut to some surprisingly fine tolerances. So, then, no. There\u2019s nothing particularly exceptional about the precision of the masonry in the pyramids. ",
