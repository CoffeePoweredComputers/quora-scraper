            "answer_text": "These are the thought's I have on the drive to work. I wrote the following post for my blog in 2012 when we were celebrating the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812. What if they had the internet in 1812? As we celebrate the bicentennial of the war of 1812, we wonder how things would have been different if they had the internet in 1812. First the name itself, the war of 1812, is pretty boring. With television coverage and Facebook pages covering the war, there would have been a more colorful name. What would they call this second war of independence? How about the \"Revenge of the British?\" or perhaps at the very least \"The American Revolution Part II.\" A different National Anthem The Battle of Baltimore of 1814 inspired the lyrics of the United States national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and produced a sense of euphoria over a second victory by the United States over Britain. What if Francis Scott Key had looked to the glow from his smart phone rather than the bombs bursting in air? \"Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light\" would be replaced with, \"I've just received this tweet from my home boys down the street.\" Who knew the War was over Think about this, you are on a ship half around the world, and telecommunications as we know it today has not yet been invented. So how do you get the message that the war is over? The Treaty of Ghent was the peace treaty that ended the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain. Although the treaty was officially ratified by the United States Senate on February 16, 1815, both sides signed The Treaty of Ghent on December 24, 1814, in the city of Ghent, United Netherlands. The Battle of New Orleans took place on January 8, 1815. If the British ships had cell phones and satellite communications they would have celebrated The Treaty of Ghent and not have wasted their time attacking New Orleans on January 8, 1815. Who would be president Without Wikipedia or Google to promote his legacy, we wonder how Andrew Jackson rose to such fame after the war. But if Andrew Jackson were around in a world with modern media, he would not have made it to the presidency with his support of slavery and forced relocation of Native Americans. My personal spin Yea, these are the thought's I have on the drive to work, how things would have been different if they had the internet in 1812. Wow, how much the world has changed in the past two centuries. ",

            "answer_text": "They would have called it the telegraph, and it would have communicated using a primitive form of binary coding called \u201cMorse code\u201d. Okay, that\u2019s just what actually was used for telecommunications a hundred years before \u2018the internet\u2019 was invented. TCP/IP as we know it wasn\u2019t invented till you had computers needing to automatically control the sending of packets of information and routing them to a particular destination. Back in the day of the telegraph, transmission speeds were slow enough and automation difficult enough that you just had human operators telling each other to do things like connect lines and adjust receiver settings, or just relay messages by repeating them. You can think of it like how in old movies people would pick up the phone and ask the operator to connect them to someone, instead of having a dialing system. TCP/IP is pretty useless without computers capable of automatically interpreting and following the protocol, and a transmission rate which justifies the cost of using a computer for that then the \u2018last mile\u2019 of the message is hand-carried by a delivery boy anyway.

            "answer_text": "What would happen if the Internet was invented 100 years earlier? It would have had about as much impact as Babbage inventing the computer and Ada Lovelace inventing computer programming back in 1837 (and yes, that did in fact happen). In other words, exactly nothing unless all the other technology needed to make it work was *also* available a century earlier - Babbage and Lovelace had the concepts a century before Zuse and Turing and the rest of them, but didn\u2019t have access to the technology to make it realistic. And it\u2019s pretty much impossible to predict what history would have been like if all that technology happened a century earlier, because that would all rely on *other* technology and science being discovered earlier, and that all ripples outward with all sorts of effects.

            "answer_text": "It may have been used instead of the wired telegraph system, but not much else. That is because the Internet is just the carrier for the World Wide Web. The terminology has been massively been screwed up for several years. It is the Web that you use to do almost everything, from searching to communicating to seeing sites etc. So just the Internet would mean that that anyone wanting to use it would have to use a computer. The way it was used until 1989 when the WWW was invented, was just to transfer files back and forth and mostly by researchers. So not much would have been happening a hundred years ago. It\u2019s a little like making off road tires BEFORE cars were made. ",
