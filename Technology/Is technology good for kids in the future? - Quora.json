Technology will be so advanced in coming decade that life will be more of mechanical one. While writing this just reminds me of , \u201cI love this world because it is imperfect. It is imperfect, and that's why it is growing; if it was perfect it would have been dead. Growth is possible only if there is imperfection. I would like you to remember again and again, I am imperfect, the whole universe is imperfect, and to love this imperfection, to rejoice in this imperfection is my whole message.\u201d So where there will be perfection (as with growing technology) in lives for future generations there will be boredom.
