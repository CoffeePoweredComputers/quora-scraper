            "answer_text": "In terms of 5G network speed, I think the US will initially have a faster network for the first year or so, but then the 2 sides will be roughly equal. However, in terms of large-scale market adoption of 5G, the PRC will be faster than the US. 5G is a set of standards, & networks built to such a standard will have roughly comparable performance. That said, there are significant differences in speed based on spectrum allocation. The US will likely have a faster network during early phases of 5G because most of it uses mmWave spectrum, which sacrifices reliability & range for greater speed (see my answer here for more details: Hongda Jiang's answer to What is the difference in 5G between mmWave and sub 6GHz?). On the other hand, the PRC will initially deploy its 5G networks using Sub-6, which is widely considered the ideal bandwidth that balances range, reliability, & speed. That said, the PRC will not rely solely on Sub-6, & will allocate mmWave spectrum to its mobile operators by the end of 2019 (China to establish 5G millimeter wave spectrum use plan). Therefore, the likely result is that in earlier deployments, the US will likely have faster networks (assuming they install enough base stations to overcome reliability issues), in later phases, both sides\u2019 networks will have roughly comparable speed. That said, faster speed doesn\u2019t mean faster market adoption. 5G services adoption in the PRC are likely to be far cheaper & faster than that of the US, since the PRC is doing everything possible to drive down costs. For a detailed outline of why the PRC network will be cheaper, see my answer here: Hongda Jiang's answer to Who is winning the 5G race, the USA or the PRC?. For those who want a summary, here are some of the main reasons: Spectrum allocation: until the US allocates sufficient Sub-6 spectrum to its mobile carriers, large scale deployments will occur mostly on mmWave. Since mmWave\u2019s range is about half that of Sub-6, a carrier would need to install 4X the base stations, thus incurring 4X the upfront capital as well as longer term maintenance fees.Spectrum auctions: the US makes its mobile carriers bid for spectrum rationing, so mobile carriers must pay billions upfront to use their desired spectrum. The PRC makes its mobile carriers pay what is essentially an administrative fee for spectrum management, amounting to ~$10 million per carrier. The end result is that US MNOs must pass on far higher costs to 5G users.Vendor competition: the PRC allows all major 5G network equipment OEMs to compete in its market (namely - Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, ZTE), whereas the US has banned Huawei & ZTE for geopolitical reasons. This means the US 5G network market is a de facto duopoly between Ericsson & Nokia, so equipment prices will inevitably be higher & product choices more limited for the US MNOs.Shared networks: 2 of the big 3 PRC MNOs have decided to build a shared 5G network during their initial phases of 5G deployment. This reduces the amount of upfront capital costs required by the smaller MNOs, & allow them to better compete on price. For more details, see my post here: Hongda Jiang's post in China's Future. Whereas in the US, there is no indication so far that any of the big MNOs have plans for shared networks, so they must each build a very under-utilized 5G network unless something changes.Device availability: 5G smartphones are already widely available in the PRC today, & some models cost no more than today\u2019s 4G phones. In fact, one 5G model in the PRC sold more volume in a minute than the US is likely to sell for all of 2019. Inexpensive & widely available smartphone models, paired with the world\u2019s cheapest 5G plans, will allow PRC consumers to upgrade from 4G & legacy networks to 5G at minimal cost. It\u2019s no surprise that more than 10 million users have already pre-registered for 5G plans a month before network launch.To summarize: the US will likely have faster 5G speeds (assuming they can install enough base stations) during earlier deployment phases, but eventually the 2 sides will have comparable speeds. However, the PRC will have far faster 5G market adoption among consumers & enterprises due to lower cost. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no difference since 5G is a standard (or soon will be) so they all have to use the same standards and speeds within each country. Within the range of each cell tower, there can be vast difference between speeds, you can be in the crowded downtown area of a major city and get slow speeds and then when you go to a practically empty neighborhood in that same city you could get extremely fast speeds. This makes it very hard if not impossible to determine if any one country is faster than any other country. ",
