            "answer_text": "Well lets see. First up, rocks and sticks. Hands and teeth are far too ineffective for killing people. Bows! Atlatls! Now we can kill people from further than we can throw! The Wheel. Now we can carry things as we campaign, so we can actually fight in distant lands! Metalworking! Now we can make stronger, sharper weapons. Or if we\u2019re really smart make tools to make food easier! So now we have more, better equipped people! Shields and armor! Now we don\u2019t all die in one or two hits! Walls! Forts! Now we can muster and defend strategic locations with a huge advantage! Siege equipment! Now we can defeat people who\u2019ve fortified strategic locations! Boats! Now we can travel by river or sea. Trade increases, meaning more wealth, meaning more people! Naval combat is now a thing! Domestic warhorses! Those useless things can now carry us into battle! Whistles/Flags! Now we can signal people without being right infront of them yelling! Writing! Now we can pass down techniques to people we\u2019ll never meet, or send messages that won\u2019t be repeated wrong by the messenger! And I haven\u2019t even gotten to firearms and engines yet. Human society is built on technological advancement. It\u2019s no surprise that war is too. ",
