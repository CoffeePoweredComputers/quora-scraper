            "answer_text": "R2A Read this carefully: \"The effectiveness of stretching is usually reported as an increase in joint ROM (usually passive ROM); for example, knee or hip ROM is used to determine changes in hamstring length. Static stretching often results in increases in joint ROM. Interestingly, the increase in ROM may not be caused by increased length (decreased tension) of the muscle; rather, the subject may simply have an increased tolerance to stretching. Increases in muscle length are measured by \u201cextensibility\u201d, usually where a standardized load is placed on the limb and joint motion is measured. Increased tolerance to stretch is quantified by measuring the joint range of motion with a non-standardized load. This is an important question to consider when interpreting the results of studies: was the improvement based on actual muscle lengthening (ie, increased extensibility) or just an increase in tolerance to stretch?7  Chan and colleagues 8 showed that 8 weeks of static stretching increased muscle extensibility; however, most static stretching training studies show an increase in ROM due to an increase in stretch tolerance (ability to withstand more stretching force), not extensibility (increased muscle length).9\u201312 Static stretching is effective at increasing ROM. The greatest change in ROM with a static stretch occurs between 15 and 30 seconds; 13,14 most authors suggest that 10 to 30 seconds is sufficient for increasing flexibility. 14\u201317 In addition, no increase in muscle elongation occurs after 2 to 4 repetitions.18  Unfortunately, however, static stretching as part of a warm-up immediately prior to exercise has been shown detrimental to dynamometer-measured muscle strength 19\u201329 and performance in running and jumping. 30\u201339 The loss of strength resulting from acute static stretching has been termed, \u201cstretch-induced strength loss.\u201d 3 The specific causes for this type of stretch induced loss in strength is not clear; some suggest neural factors, 31,40 while others suggest mechanical factors.19,23 Furthermore, the strength loss may be related to the length of the muscle at the time of testing 23 or the duration of the stretch.25 Interestingly, a maximal contraction of the muscle being stretched before static stretching may decrease stretch-induced strength loss.41 \" Reference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3273886/  Ultimately, NO you CANNOT overstretch (to the point of tissue damage) simply because the effect was in any case due to increased 'stretch tolerance' not change of 'tissue length' All the best with your stretching.

            "answer_text": "I'm 45 and can nearly do the splits.  I started stretching at age 13 for football.  I re-developed a passion for stretching when I was 18 after a back injury, and I had to focus more on my hamstrings.  I began a renewed love affair with stretching in my 30's with and emphasis on yoga.  I really began to appreciate isometric stretching at age 42, especially when combined with drinking green smoothies.  In my long experience, there are no scientific studies on greens and stretching, so I'm pioneering here.  It works great together!  To answer your questions: how long?  In an isometric stretch, the science, and I tend to agree, about 6 seconds of flexing while stretched is more than enough to get the job done.  They say 3 times a week, but 1 time a week is more than enough, too, especially if you combine it with greens.  I have overstretched my hamstrings and adductors, years ago, which are in the inside of your legs, usually when trying to stretch daily.  If you pull a muscle from over stretching, it can take years to recover.  I know.  It's happened to me.  Don't do that.  Others say it's cold stretching.  I disagree.  I think it's from doing it daily, or having a bad diet.  I don't feel I could overstretch doing it once a week while eating greens, and I have not come close to injury from stretching in the last three years of doing that.  The tendons are like the bones, they have a poor blood supply.  They take 8 weeks to heal, and even longer to stretch out again if you pull one.  Regular stretching does not strengthen the muscles in the stretched out position, leaving them prone to injury.  Isometric stretching strengthens them in the stretched position, making them less injury prone.  Drinking greens helps both clean out the bad or toxic mineral deposits, as well as supplying needed minerals for the tendon/bone/joint areas.  Since I discovered greens and stretching for my life, I also discovered their only flaw just a month ago.  Greens like kale and spinach block iodine.  Adding iodine to my diet, and then stretching with iodine to get iodine into the joints again, added another layer of strength, comfort, and well being to my body.  I hope that helps.  (I used to suffer from arthritis, but I'm doing great these days!) ",
