            "answer_text": "GHZ is not that important, IPC is, does not matter if you have 2 times the clock if your instructions takes 2 times to execute. CPUS nowadays dont keep getting higher clocks like during pentium 4 era. What is important for a final user. Check geekbench or other benchmarks. Check how many cores/threads, this can have an impact on threads/core number, if you want games, less threads but higher clocks will help you as games dont use a lot of cores at the same time. Check how much cache. It is hard to know nowadays, before the clock would tell you how good was the CPU, there are websites like PassMark Software - CPU Benchmark Charts to check the cpu score. ",
