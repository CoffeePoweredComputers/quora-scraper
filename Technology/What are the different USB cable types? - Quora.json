            "answer_text": "As for the cables themselves, not the endings, you can get a variety of cable gauge labeled by their corresponding AWG rating. The lower, the thicker the cable. The thicker cables are normally capable of carrying more eletricity than the cheaper thinner cables. Generally this is one of the reasons some phones can\u2019t charge like they did with their original cables. AS for the actual connections (the interface endings)\u2026 First search on google: Insights from CableWholesale USB-A A type-A connector is one you\u2019ve probably used a fair amount. If you\u2019ve ever purchased these bulk USB cables, they\u2019re what you typically plug into a computer USB port when you transfer data, use an external keyboard for typing, or utilize a mouse for a PC. USB-B Type-B connectors are almost square in shape. You\u2019ve probably seen them when you plug in a printer cable or an external hard drive cable to a computer. But they aren\u2019t as common a sight as type-A these days. USB-C One of the newer USB cables on the scene is the type-C. Unlike other connectors, this one is actually reversible, meaning that it can be plugged in upside down if you want. It also offers data transfers of higher speeds and is generally thought to be more powerful. It\u2019s become the standard for many new laptops, tablets, and phones (and even by Apple). Mini-USB These connectors used to be the standard for mobile devices, cameras, and MP3 players. Like their name suggests, they\u2019re smaller than a regular USB port. That\u2019s why they\u2019re often used for smaller devices. They aren\u2019t used as often anymore, but you still may find some devices that have this compatibility. Micro-USB This is currently considered to be the standard connector for mobile devices and other gadgets \u2014 except the devices that Apple produces. The micro allows information to be read without help from a computer, meaning you can connect one device directly to a phone with help from one of these bulk USB cables. USB 3 USB 3 cables are what\u2019s known as \u201cbackward compatible,\u201d meaning they actually work with older USB ports and other bulk USB cables. But these cables have different shape pins so they can be used more frequently (and are often colored blue so you can tell them apart). However, it\u2019s important to note that all devices have to be USB 3 compatible to obtain those higher speeds. For example, if you have a USB 3.1 compliant device, you\u2019d be able to transfer data at 10 Gbps if you use these cables. But if you have an older device, you won\u2019t be able to achieve the same speedy data transfer rates.Depending on the number of devices you own and the way in which you use them, you\u2019ll probably have at least a few of these USB cables in your possession. But now, you\u2019ll be able to identify them \u2014 and understand the lingo if you need to replace them. ",

            "answer_text": "USB stands for \"Universal Serial Bus\". USB cable assemblies are most popular cable types available, used mostly to connect computers to peripheral devices such as cameras, camcorders, printers, scanners, and more. USB is supposedly universal, but there are so many different types of USB each serve different functions,compatibility and support new devices Here are the five most common types of USB cables and connectors: USB-A: Connectors, officially called Standard-A connectors, are flat and rectangular in shape and the mostly used connector. mostly computer use USB-A ports for connecting peripherals. You\u2019ll find them on game consoles, TVs, and other devices too. This cable only inserts in one way.USB-B: Type-B connectors are square in shape. used when you plug in a printer cable or an external hard drive cable to a computer. Type-B not that command now a days as most devices moved to small connectors.Mini-USB: Mini Universal Serial Bus which is a USB interface standard. It is a technology used for transferring data between PC and digital devices like mobile devices, cameras, and MP3 players.Micro-USB: Micro USB is also half the thickness of Mini USB and considered to be the standard connector for mobile devices and other gadgets except the Apple devices.USB 3: Known as backward compatible\u2014meaning it's designed to work with older USB versions including USB 2.0 and USB 1.1. However it\u2019s important to note that all devices have to be USB 3 compatible to obtain those higher speeds",
