            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as a 'free' Apple product, IMHO. Even an original iPhone will attract a $0.99 bid on eBay, eight years later with no carrier support. The only exception to this rule might be professional product reviewers like Walt Mossberg, who writes technology reviews for the Wall Street Journal. Are you a professional product reviewer? Probably not. Because if you were, you wouldn't be asking this question here. Here's a way to get a product discount.If you befriend an Apple employee (note there are 66,000 of them in the USA), they may (at their discretion) be able to share employee discounts with you, but it still involves $, and can be somewhat onerous for them. This is a limited program (something like one Mac/year at 15%, and as many as 10 Macs/year at 10%, quantities vary by product category). AND, it never includes new products. Only after the initial backlog of pent-up demand is fulfilled, usually several months, does the latest gizmo get into the Employee Purchase Program.  If you time it so your Massachusetts-based employee/friend buys the friend & family product during the Sales Tax Holiday (August 15/16 in 2015) on your behalf, you may be able to pick up the non-custom built product at a local Apple store, get a 10% discount and avoid the sales tax. But don't get your hopes up. The employee has to be in the store to order the product, and as you might expect, the Sales Tax Holiday weekend is crazy busy.  Some people I bought Macs for (when I was an employee) would have me enable their pickup of the product in a New Hampshire Apple store, which has no sales tax, so they didn't have to wait for the Holiday, but would have to drive an hour to avoid the sales tax.

            "answer_text": "Hardware: If you are a tech reviewer, and you\u2019re lucky enough for a company to send you some or give you the money to buy them. Usually it\u2019s not Apple themselves, however, some iPhone accessory makers, like Mous (iPhone case manufacturer) would send you an iPhone with their case to review and perhaps drop test, to test the durability of the case. Considering that Mous cases are very durable, the iPhone should survive after the drop test, making you have a free iPhone. Note, that, realistically, if you want to get these kind of sponsorships, you need a big following. Software: You can test public betas of future Apple software versions well before the shipping release. Normally, future software versions have a public beta, so you can download them for free directly from Apple. However, if you want to get the betas as soon as possible, you\u2019ll need a Developer membership $99/year. However, with betaprofiles.com, you can download the developer betas for free. Note that betas can be buggy, though, so only install them i'd you have a second device or can deal with bugs. ",
