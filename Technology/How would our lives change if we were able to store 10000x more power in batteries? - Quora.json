            "answer_text": "I think it is a lot more than what normal people would require. If this kind of batteries is available to the public, safety would become a great concern. I assume that, by more power, you mean more energy. Here are some possible results.  The battery can be a bomb, a powerful one. The energy density of current lithium battery is about 600 Wh/L, and the energy density of gasoline 9700 Wh/L. So if the energy density of lithium batteries increases by 10,000x, which is impossible by the way, it would become 6,000,000 Wh/L. This means, a battery with the size of a fist is equivalent to 6 tons of TNT.You can use it to power lethal weapons, such as the death-ray gun. You may escape a gunshot, but the new weapon will be more deadly.You may see a cellphone battery failure caused the demolition of an entire building in the news.You may continue to think in this line for all day. Well, there will be also benefits, but dare you use the battery?  ",

The environmental benefits would be monumental. Also, you could have a deadly laser pistol. And I think we all want that. ",
