            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. This can be a tricky issue. If you are using a laptop for its intended portability then it's quite likely to take its fair share of knocks, nicks, and scratches. I live in the sticks and rely on said portability. Both my laptops look like they just came out of the box despite being nearly 10 years old. I never use a \"standard\" laptop carry-bag because I think it's the best way to advertise that you have something worth stealing. Because I hate laptop keyboards, I always carry a decent quality keyboard and mouse with me. I went and found an \"ideal\" backpack that carries the laptop and allows for the extra length of a full-size keyboard. Obviously, there are extra pockets for the power supply, an external HDD and miscellaneous cables. Only in the last few months has one of the machines been damaged, and that was a thumb drive being stuck from side-on damaging that particular USB port -- yes, I can live without it or I can fix it myself.  When traveling, it is always carry-on luggage. On my most recent journey, I discovered a new Australian symptom of the global \"terror\" hoax -- I was told that a backpack had to go in the cargo bay under the bus. I countered with the question, \"There's $10,000 worth of computer and audio-visual gear in the bag as well as my medication. Will that be covered by insurance?\" I was allowed to carry it on. When it comes to batteries, I tend to keep them fully charged as, for the majority of the time, the unit remains connected to power through a dock. The battery therefore stands in as a cheap pseudo-UPS. Despite this \"abuse\" I still get about 2-hours of battery life during power fails (and they happen quite a bit). Although it occurs to me that, given the age of the machines, I should stock up on some \"spare\" batteries for the future.  When it comes to slowing down, both my machines are overloaded and the amount of free space left on my drives collectively would amount to less than 2GB across a total space of 500GB*. Like other answers, one assumes you are running Windows. * Yes, all that data must be accessible all the time. My machines are further slowed down because I run three layers of security, which includes regular cleaning of the Registry. Because of my limited space (yes, I'm migrating to newer, bigger machines in the next few weeks), I also do regular \"Disk Cleanups\" (accessible through Drive Properties) which gets rid of temporary files and other junk. If you are running an HDD with enough free space, consider going into Disk Management and performing a \"defrag\". This can improve your machine's behavior. Never run a defrag on an SSD -- it only wastes write cycles and achieves no improvement.  If you look after your machine, and make sure that you regularly clean out all ventilation slots of dust, it should serve you well. If you're unsure of opening the machine to get rid of all the dust, then consider taking it to a technician at least once a year for a thorough internal clean. ",

            "answer_text": "How do I make my laptop last for long years Maintenance.  Proper handling and maintenance.  Always open the lid from the center.  Plan on replacing the hard drive every few (3-5) years.  Plan on replacing the optical drive and the cooling fan with roughly the same frequency.  Why?  These are mechanical parts... and mechanical parts break down. Make regular backups of your important data, and be prepared to have to perform a factory recovery every 6 months to a year.  Sure... you can get away with not needing to reinstall Windows for years... however, if you accumulate a collection of software you can't replace, or data you haven't backed up because you aren't set up for that... then eventually you will lose software and data because you weren't prepared for the infection that required recovery... or you weren't prepared for the hard drive failure that required recovery. How do I make ... the battery last longer? Don't use it.  Charge it up, take it out of the laptop, and don't use it.  Don't microcharge it.  It is a \"battery\", made up of many smaller batteries.  It is not a permanent \"thing\".  If you use it as a battery, it will eventually cease to hold a charge.  Such is the nature of things.  Want it to last longer?  Don't use it. That, or just like everyone else, you should expect to replace it every few years. ",
