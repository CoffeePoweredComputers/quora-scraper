            "answer_text": "This is more complicated than a yes or no. The \u201cwhy\u201d part is simple and obvious. To sell more phones. If everyone needs a new phone every couple years, then the industry becomes way bigger. Now about that planned obsolescence; no not exactly. The hardware will be good to go for a long time; maybe just replace the battery every couple of years. I\u2019m still on a Galaxy Note 4 that\u2019s approaching 5 years now and it\u2019s fine, my Galaxy S3 would be tolerable too. I\u2019m not running the stock software though, I\u2019ve used Lineage OS (a custom build of Android not from Samsung or Verizon) for a few years on those phones, and so I\u2019m on the newest software on those phones! This goes to show; hardware can last a long time, though you might not be playing the latest games. I don\u2019t game on my phone anyway so I don\u2019t really care. So what goes bad? Well, the software. For starters, the phone stops getting OS updates after a couple years. Several reasons why this is terrible; main one being that you\u2019re no longer getting virus protection and hackers can find new exploits that are no longer being patched after a couple years. Second problem is that after Android has moved on to a new version, developers tend to spend a lot less time updating their apps to work smoothly with an old OS. How is this planned obsolescence? Well it\u2019s not exactly, that\u2019s why I said it\u2019s dodgy. Verizon (or your provider) stops updating a phone, and performance starts tanking immediately. Obviously, as I mentioned, we can load up a version of Android such as Lineage OS and get the newest version of Android with all the newest apps all running smoothly on really old phones! So it\u2019s the software that in essence just goes bad after a few years, or more specifically isn\u2019t usable with other more modern software. If you have the wherewithal to run a few commands in the terminal, you have all the skills you need to side-load an OS because people have already done all the work for you and posted the files in places like XDA developers.

            "answer_text": "Yes, for several reasons. Cost. It would be perfectly possible to engineer a phone where all the parts have been tested and are of the highest quality to ensure that it lasts for a long time. The problem is, this will cost more that one selected to the lowest common mean time to failure and this translates to lower profit per unit, or higher price per unit.Revenue. This is the obvious one. Manufacturers want to sell you multiple phones, but if you have one that lasts 10 years, then they cannot.Innovations. A difficult one, this. This is the reason that manufacturers give, they claim that to get their innovations to the public as quickly as possible, a 2-year cycle is fine, whilst releasing \u201cnew\u201d models each year.",

Just keep re-designing to incorporate the latest tech from the semiconductor industry and, if you are Apple or Samsung or Lenovo (and several others), technology you\u2019ve developed through R&D, like flexible screens and multiple cameras and OLED displays. The world will beat a path to your door to buy each annual generation. Go figure! And laugh derisively as I do when I see the queue at the Apple store each year. ",

            "answer_text": "The batteries have limited lives, and most new ones are designed for them to not be replaceable. This results in cleaner, more water-resistant packaging. Over time, the hardware capabilities of new phones get much better, and most vendors have very little interest in making new software compatible with old less capable phones. That\u2019s if they have any interest in updating phones after they are sold at all, even for security reasons. The upshot is that phones are best thought of as short-lived consumables, not as \u201cdurable goods\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Apparently some things phones were operating slower especially after a couple of years from new, and their batteries were not holding a charge as they were supposed to be. That is the beginning of obsolescence and it\u2019s very frustrating. It maybe that way so people believe they need to update their phones, even though the phones update regularly. Most young people like to be tech savvy and tend to want the latest phone, but a new battery and have the phone checked before spending a lot on a new one if the existing phone is fine. ",
