I have AirPods and yes they look like tooth brushes hanging out of your ear, but they click of the charging case and the convenience of 30 minute charging for 5 hours is nice. I\u2019ve heard beats are nice, but if I\u2019m not mistaken way more expensive. I personally like apples products, because they are always quality products. How they describe a product is how it is 95% of the time. It\u2019s up to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes Main reason behind superiority of Powerbeats Pro is it\u2019s design. It can fit most of people\u2019s ears unlike AirPods . I tries AirPods as soon as Apple launched it but can\u2019t able to hold it in my ears. With Powerbeats I\u2019ll be confident that it will stay in my ears. ",

            "answer_text": "Apple says that Powerbeats Pro offer up to 9 hours of battery life during playback and up to 6 hours of battery life during calls. On the other hand, AirPods Pro offer 5-hours of playback and 3.5 hours of talk time during calls. If you enable Active Noise Cancellation, the listening time drops to 4.5 hours. But the Powerbeats pros are cheaper, so i think they are much better performance wise and considering your budget. ",

There haven't been extensive testings, but from early impressions from reviewers, the Beats sound a lot better. They have better battery, also hey siri functionality, the same h1 chip, fully wireless, and water resistant. ",
