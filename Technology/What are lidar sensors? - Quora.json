            "answer_text": "The working principle of Light Detection and Ranging(LiDAR) system is simple. It works similar to RADAR systems. It uses laser light pulses unlike RADAR which uses radio waves. LiDAR sensor mounted on an aircraft or helicopter. It generates Laser pulse which sent to the surface and the time it takes to return to its source is measured. The actual calculation for measuring how far a returning light photon has traveled to and from an object is calculated by Distance = (Speed of Light x Time of Flight) / 2 A sensor on the instrument measures the amount of time it takes for each pulse to reflect back. Light moves at a known speed so the LiDAR instrument can calculate the distance between itself and the target with high accuracy. By repeating this in quick progression the instrument builds up a complex \u2018map\u2019 of the surface it is measuring. LiDAR VS RADAR LiDAR, as we know, is a surveying technology using laser light pulses, as opposed to the RADAR which uses radio waves. The precision provided by LiDAR sensors is hard to beat, thanks to the large amount of laser pulses forming so called point clouds. Large vehicles plowing a field or moving in a restricted construction site will not have to worry about pedestrians, racing drivers or traffic lights. For this area LIDAR would in most cases be a better option over RADAR, though the technology is still expensive to use on a larger scale. Why choose LiDAR over RADAR? Good at detecting small objects thanks to short wavelengthGreat precision, can build an exact 3D monochromatic image of an object.Why choose RADAR over LiDAR? Long operating distanceIt can operate in more varied conditions and environments. Since it is not as sensitive to for example dirt and it does not have any mechanical moving parts.",

            "answer_text": "LiDAR, or light detection and ranging, is a popular remote sensing method used for measuring the exact distance of an object on the earth\u2019s surface. Even though it was first in when laser scanners were mounted to aeroplanes, LiDAR didn\u2019t get the popularity it deserved until twenty years later. It was only during the 1980s after the introduction of GPS that it became a popular method for calculating accurate geospatial measurements. ",
