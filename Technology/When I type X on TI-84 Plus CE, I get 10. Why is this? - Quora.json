            "answer_text": "It depends. As the other people commenting have noted, X is a variable that you can store any number into. What I wanted to point out is that any time that you use the TRACE key, the TI-84 will AUTOMATICALLY store a value into the X variable. For example, if you graph and find the intersection of two lines. My example is 2x + 6 = 3x - 7. Enter the equation into the Y1 and Y2 variables.  To find the intersection, press 2nd, TRACE, and option 5: intersect and then press ENTER three times. Depending on the where the intersection occurs, you might have to adjust your window to see the intersection.  After you have found the intersection, the TI-84 will AUTOMATICALLY store the x coordinate into the X variable and the y coordinate into the Y variable. In my example, the intersection occurs at (13, 32).  Now if you go to the home screen and press the X variable or Y variable, you will see that the x coordinate and the y coordinate from the intersection have been stored into the X and Y variable respectively.  So the short of it is, somehow the number 10 got STORED into the X variable. How it got there only you can determine that but I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "X is a variable that has a value in the TI-84 PLUS CE Graphing Calculator. It might be equal to zero, it might be equal to 17, it might be equal to my birthday. it just depends on WHAT it was last used for. Let\u2019s look and see what X is equal to RIGHT NOW (without any pre-preparation) on my calculator.  I have no idea why the value is 1. It just is. Let\u2019s see if we can change it.  Now, my calculator thinks that X is equal to my date of birth. (Birthday cards optional.) What if we use X as a counter?  Each time I press ENTER, the value for X in increased and displayed. What if I wanted to use this method to display the squares and cubes of the counting numbers?  If I were to print X right now, I\u2019d see that it is now equal to 3. What if you do some graphing on your calculator?  What do you know. Surprise, surprise !!!!We figured out WHY your calculator thinks that X is equal to 10. When you do graphing on your calculator, the calculator uses the values X and Y to represent the points that are being graphed. Let\u2019s see what Y is equal to:  When the calculator evaluated the (Y1=) equation for X=10, it got a value of Y=125. If I were to extend the viewing window to Ymax=125, we\u2019d see that was the end point of our graph. The calculator actually tried to graph it, but it was outside our window. Let me redraw it:   What if we change our window limits again?  What is the weirdest number you can make your calculator think that X is equal to? Type 710.77345 \u2192 X (enter), then turn your calculator upside down and use your imagination to see what your calculator is saying to you. Do check what OS version is installed on your CE. If your Prgm environment does not yet have the Cut and Paste or Undo Clear option, you need to upgrade your CE. You can read more about the vast improvements that the CE has now made available that are not usable in the Silver Edition or in any older 84 \u2026 here: Why the TI-84-Plus-CE is better than all the other TI-84's ",
