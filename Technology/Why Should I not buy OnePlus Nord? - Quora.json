            "answer_text": "Alright, let\u2019s be objective about this: Pricing: the phone might be a bit overpriced, had it been 10% cheaper, less people could be talking against it nowadays. I\u2019m guessing in 2\u20133 months it\u2019ll get cheaper.Focus: it isn\u2019t an specialized phone, it\u2019s a jack of all trades. Does it have a good camera? Yes, is that camera better than flagship or similar priced phones? not neccesarily. Can you play games on it? yeah, Is it the best performing gaming phone? no. And so on.Raw specs: On paper, it doesn\u2019t have the strongest hardware. Obviously the 765G won\u2019t match up to a 865, but according to benchmarking, it does put up a fight against the 845.(Lack of a 3.5mm Jack it\u2019s more normal nowadays, so it\u2019s not unique to the Nord) Regarding the plastic frame, I mean, there are so many phones that are even full plastic, and can actually last for a good amount of time. My current phone is full plastic, and it\u2019s actually the software that\u2019s degrading/failing, not the build quality. And as far as I researched, Oneplus does a pretty good job in terms of software updates. Someone with a Oneplus 3T right now, has a more recent Android version than a phone that was released later (like mine). So if your budget is tight, go for something cheaper, or if you want a specialized phone for gaming or with the best camera, go for those. But overall with the Nord, you should be getting good performance, decent/good camera, long and good software updates to keep you going for sometime and not needing to switch phones soonish. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello There, There are many reason to not buy OnePlus Nord. The competition offers better specifications.It comes with Snapdragon 765G, while the competition offers Snapdragon 855+ and Kirin 980 chipsets, which are flagships. So, OnePlus Nord can't perform much better.It is Chinese. Though every flagship phone in this segment is Chinese, so, that should not be a much big concern.People will buy it only because of the name of OnePlus. Rather than OnePlus Nord, Realme X3, X3 Super Zoom, Redmi K20 Pro, Honor 20, Asus 6Z are the Flagships available in this range, which offers better performance than OnePlus Nord. While, if consider Non-Chinese, then, Samsung Galaxy A71, A70s and Asus 6Z are available in this range. So, OnePlus nord doesn't stand anywhere near to the competition, at least in terms of performance and camera. So, that's why, you should not buy OnePlus Nord at INR 25000 \u2014 INR 30000. More phones are yet to come in this price range with better specs than OnePlus Nord and Stock Android ones as well. Hope This Is Helpful. Edit \u2014 1. Speakers are very bad, they are barely audible. 2. The two additional cameras, the macro lens and the depth sensor are of no use, they don't click good photos, the photos clicked by primary camera gives better depth effect than the dedicated depth sensor and it also clicks better macros than the dedicated Macro lens. 3. It's not much durable, it's built quality is not good. Thanks Again. ",

            "answer_text": "Buying OnePlus Nord is not a good gain for customer. There are many alternatives with better specifications and durability. OnePlus marketed Nord as a flagship or a premium device. They created much hype about the phone by using marketing phrases like 'India's First Augmented Reality Phone'. Infact augmented reality can be achieved in any other Android phones using several apps available in the playstore, but the truth is that many people may not realise this fact and will get attracted to this marketing phrase. If you see JerryRigEverything's YouTube video, then you will understand the durability aspect of this phone. Unlike the usual OnePlus flagship phones, the body material used is very cheap. That is plastic frame and poor quality glasses. Also, the camera is not of good quality compared to some other phones of similar specs. Nord is only comparable to only some other phones (6GB, 128GB variants) priced at 16K Rupees. For example Samsung M21 have similar specs and body quality except for small differences in processor specifications. Hence, what can be said is that OnePlus is making more money by selling cheap body quality phone with slightly unsatisfying specs at higher price by marketing it as a flagship and by a slightly overhyping. There are plenty of good alternatives available in 19\u201325K price range which provides better build quality, camera and processor. Honor 20 is one such a phone which has aluminium frame, glass front and back, an extremely power saving high performance AI processor (Smaller 7 nm size) and a better camera. ",
