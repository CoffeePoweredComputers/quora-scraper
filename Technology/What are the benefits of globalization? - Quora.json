            "answer_text": "In my opinion \u2014 The essence of globalism is Economic Globalism, which means, the victory of capitalism worldwide. Nothing in capitalism has ever been beneficial to everyone all the time. Capitalism is based on competition \u2014 on new patented inventions that will take market share away from established companies by new Cost-cutting measures and new Labor-saving devices. These devices win in the Market because most people love saving money. Prices do go lower with all these new inventions. THE CONSUMER BENEFITS. HOWEVER \u2014 the downside is always the same \u2014 with every new company with their newest gizmo, another whole factory closes and all those workers are laid off. The chronic factor of Massive Unemployment has cursed Capitalism since the mid-1700\u2019s Industrial Revolution. There\u2019s no way around it, because Competition is its bread and butter. The working class always suffered under its paradigm. Now \u2014 in the US (and other nations) the US President FDR instituted a New Deal in which there was Social Security pensions and Unemployment Insurance for the working class. This was a major relief for millions of people. But it didn\u2019t solve the main problem of Technology. With every new improvement in Industrial Production and Distribution, the evolution of Technology kept growing and growing \u2014 and even the most dedicated workers who were willing to work 60 hours a week, failed to keep up with the Technology. One needed a college degree to keep up. Would the government also provide national Retraining programs for the working class? No way. Too expensive. The idea was to cut costs, not increase them. All that to get to the conclusion \u2014 Globalism has the same problems that Capitalism has \u2014 namely \u2014 that New Technology continues to displace the older technology, and that means that millions of workers worldwide will either have to afford their own Retraining, or get thrown onto the enormous Unemployment Heap. Governments must somehow learn to educate their citizens to cope with this \u2014 but as of today, no nation knows how to do this. There, briefly, is my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "Globalization has impacted nearly every aspect of modern life. While some U.S. citizens may not be able to locate Beijing, China on a map, they certainly purchase an overwhelming number of goods that were manufactured there. According to a 2010 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco report, approximately 35.6% of all clothing and shoes sold in the United States were actually manufactured in China, compared to just 3.4% made domestically. Below is a look beyond the everyday implications of globalization and towards the economic implications that impact international investors. Globalization Benefits World Economies Most economists agree that globalization provides a net benefit to individual economies around the world, by making markets more efficient, increasing competition, limiting military conflicts, and spreading wealth more equally around the world. However, the general public tends to assume that the costs associated with globalization outweigh the benefits, especially in the short-term, which has caused problems we\u2019ll explore in the next section on protectionism. The Milken Institute\u2019s Globalization of the World Economy report highlights many of the benefits associated with globalization while outlining some of the associated risks that governments and investors should consider. But, in aggregate, there is a consensus among economists that globalization provides a net benefit to nations around the world and therefore should be embraced on the whole by governments and individuals. Some of the benefits of globalization include: Foreign Direct Investment. Foreign direct investment (\u201cFDI\u201d) tends to increase at a much greater rate than the growth in world trade, helping boost technology transfer, industrial restructuring, and the growth of global companies.Technological Innovation. Increased competition from globalization helps stimulate new technology development, particularly with the growth in FDI, which helps improve economic output by making processes more efficient.Economies of Scale. Globalization enables large companies to realize economies of scale that reduce costs and prices, which in turn supports further economic growth, although this can hurt many small businesses attempting to compete domestically.Some of the risks of globalization include: Interdependence. Globalization leads to the interdependence between nations, which could cause regional or global instabilities if local economic fluctuations end up impacting a large number of countries relying on them.National Sovereignty. Some see the rise of nation-states, multinational or global firms and other international organizations as a threat to sovereignty. Ultimately, this could cause some leaders to become nationalistic or xenophobic.Equity Distribution. The benefits of globalization can be unfairly skewed towards rich nations or individuals, creating greater inequalities and leading to potential conflicts both nationally and internationally as a result.",
