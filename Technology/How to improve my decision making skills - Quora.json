            "answer_text": "There are two fundamental systems for making decisions: top-down and bottom-up.  Both of these lenses have great potential but also great downfalls. First, you need to understand both. Second, you need to improve at each one. And finally you need to learn how and when to switch between them. These two fundamental lenses dictate the way we process information and hence our decision-making. But before I jump into them, I need to tell you about an important difference between millionaires and billionaires. Millionaires execute on a single idea very well. Billionaires can execute on ideas that are in direct conflict with one another, simultaneously. Let that sink in. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of the direct conflicts that are so ubiquitous in common wisdom. \u201cYou would do better if you worked harder. Ignite your passion and dig into it.\u201d On the other hand, people say \u201cbalance is the key to life.\u201d So what exactly am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to throw myself into my passions? Or am I supposed to strive for balance and keep those passions in check? The answer is both. We need to switch lenses and with high frequency. This is how we, too, can learn to deal with conflicting ideas. Think of a football player preparing for battle.  This is an epitome of lens-switching. They need to blunt their fears and feelings. Channel their aggression and energy. Would they benefit from this lens when talking to their wife and kids? Absolutely not. But on the field, it\u2019s a gift to those who can do it best. Those are two different lenses. So what does the top-down lens look like? Try to identify your most important goals. This could be getting a certain job right now, fulfilling a certain purpose in your life, or mastering a hobby. Once you find them, simply ask yourself, \u201cwhat are the most immediate requirements for these goals?\u201d Here\u2019s an example from my younger brother\u2019s life. One of his goals was to get a sky-diving license. That sat at the top of his decision-making pyramid.  What\u2019s immediately required for the license is having done a certain number of jumps and a course. Those then occupy the second level of the pyramid below the license.  To make any jumps he realized he faced another issue. Getting to the site. These sites are, for good reason, far away from just about anything else. He doesn\u2019t own a car and didn\u2019t want to depend on hitching a ride every time he would go. So he had to make a decision. He decided that he would invest in a relatively inexpensive motorcycle. A motorcycle was cheaper than a car, uses less gas, and it\u2019s a lot of fun. So getting a motorcycle occupied his third tier of goals. What would he need to get a motorcycle? He needs a license. To get that license, he needs to do an exam and a course. So those now occupy his fourth tier. And on, and on. You get the point.  Starting from the highest goals in your hierarchy allows you to create a structured pyramid of priorities below them. Eventually at the base of these pyramids, you should have tangible, actionable items that you can start doing today. The power of this lens is that it allows you to construct paths that lead directly to your biggest goals and dreams. The better you are at paving these paths, the more likely you will be able to make it to your destination. I did the same thing once I realized I could afford to do a PhD at Harvard because of the stipends they offer students. That became the top of my priority pyramid, and everything beneath that unraveled itself. Maybe I\u2019ll write an answer about that another day. The problem with this lens is that it can be extremely overwhelming. Create a pyramid that is too big, and the burden can crush you. I know it was like that for me when I spent years building up to the PhD application for schools like Harvard. Notice that the goals higher up in the pyramid are also goals that are further from you in time. You have to figuratively climb your way up each tier of these pyramids to reach the higher goals. The taller the pyramid stands, the further and longer you have to climb. This can become a gruelling journey. In fact, the danger is so great that you could eventually string together all the goals in your entire life into one colossal, mountainous pyramid. Everything you ever do relates in some way, after all.  If you only ever equip this top-down lens, like I used to, you will inevitably become very unhappy. Don\u2019t get me wrong, this is by far the most powerful approach for achieving goals. But the first problem is that this approach tends to produce a never-ending infinity of goals. You never actually arrive at any destination. There is always the next mountain to climb. The other problem is that top-down thinking is rigid. Once you lock in the peak of your pyramid and commit to the items at the base, it is not as easy to switch around. My brother, for instance, now has a motorcycle sitting in the garage and a partially completed sky-diving license. It\u2019s never impossible. The items you\u2019ll work on while climbing towards higher goals will always overlap with alternative pathways you can hop onto. But there is still rigidity. The bottom-up approach is fundamentally different. You start with your simplest needs and interests: I like to do pushups.I like to write from time to time.I like to learn about new things.I like to spend time with friends.And from there, you create your pyramid by adding layers of abstraction on top of them. I like to do pushups, so I could abstract that into a pushup routine. I\u2019ll try to do twenty a day.  You can add another layer of abstraction to this. Twenty pushups a day will eventually be too easy. So the next layer can add an evolution component to the routine through time. Next week, I do 25 a day. Maybe I expand the pushup routine to include exercises for other muscles. I add an evolution component to those as well. This becomes an all-around fitness regimen.  Higher up in the pyramid, this regimen could intersect with a diet I follow, too. Eventually this could merge into the ultimate goal of being healthy.  Growing the pyramid upwards converts small tasks into large structures and systems. Systems we can live by. The advantage of the bottom-up approach is that you start by focusing on what you like. Let me repeat that in bold. Bottom-up: You start with what you like. In the top-down approach you focus on what you want. Let me also repeat that. Top-down: You start with what you want. This is why switching lenses becomes so important: What you want is not necessarily what you like. You might want to be rich. But does that mean you would like to work 85+ hours a week in finance after completing a fancy MBA that causes you to burn out? You might want to look like superman or wonder woman. But does that mean you would like to physically punish yourself 7 days a week, funnelling chicken breasts down your throat to the point of nausea? Often times, sadly, getting what we want does not guarantee bringing us to what we enjoy. Just to make things worse, the world is fairly polarized on this topic. Adages such as, \u201cdo what you like and forget the rest\u201d are everywhere. That\u2019s the bottom-up philosophy talking. Then there are the ruthless business-types that write books about how to achieve any goals you set. How to hack your motivation to go to the gym 7 days a week when you don\u2019t want to. How to generate happiness even when you are working 85+ hours a week and your marriage is suffering. But these two poles are fraught with issues. If you exclusively dedicate your focus to what you like, how are you going to guarantee that you can support yourself practically-speaking? Imagine a 14-year old kid who likes to draw. He gets good enough that people are following what he posts online. He sees potential here and asks you what he should do to grow. You could tell him \u201cadapt to the market.\u201d That\u2019s the top-down approach. Figure out what people like to see. Figure out what\u2019s hot right now, what sells. Start drawing that. You could also tell him \u201cignore the market.\u201d That\u2019s the bottom-up approach. Figure out what you like to see. Figure out what\u2019s hot for you right now, not what sells. Draw whatever you want. Forget the rest. The best advice is somewhere in between. Adapting to the market, like the 14-year old artist, is absolutely necessary if you want to have some guarantee of growth. Doing your own thing in no way promises that it will interest other people. While Galileo was a rebel, not all rebels are Galileo. But entirely morphing into the market is just as bad too. When you lock something at the peak of your pyramid whose base items aren\u2019t even ones that you enjoy, how on Earth are you going to generate interesting content from that? If you want to be a famous writer, but you don\u2019t enjoy the act of writing every day, how likely is that going to produce famous writing? Not very. So now I can finally answer your question. To become better at decision-making, you need to identify what you like as well as what you want. You need to find a way to merge these two bodies. Are there things that you want that you could also like? Try some for exercise. Take big ambitions you have, and break them down in a top-down manner. Construct that pyramid with a fixed peak. How do the base items look to you? What about the rest of the journey? Would you do those every day and find enjoyment doing so? A lot of the time, we can\u2019t know that in advance. But we can at least imagine. As another exercise, take smaller things that you enjoy fondly. How can you add layers of abstraction to them to create larger structures? Try to build pyramids from small building blocks like this. The better you become at constructing and deconstructing these pyramids, the sharper your decision-making will become. But the ultimate skill is finding that harmonious overlap between your wants and your likes. While doing so, I hope that you do find overlap between your biggest dreams and smallest pleasures. Only then do I think we can truly be happy. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to become a more effective decision maker, all you have to do is turn off your brain at times. I'll show you how to accomplish this, but first, let me discuss emotional versus rational decision making. Anytime we make a decision, we have two different angles to view the decision from.  Decisions can range from \"which flavor of ice cream should I buy\" all the way to \"which house should I buy\"? The two personas that you can use to make a decision are emotional and rational. When I make a decision, I always think of the image below occurring within my body. Is my decision making process going to be emotionally backed or rationally backed?   When using your rational decision making brain: you are likely to list out all the pros and cons of each potential optionyour brain runs heavy calculations of probability and potential risks or rewardsyou assign weights and numbers to each optionit takes a long time to make a decision due to these heavy calculationsyou assess how you will feel about the decision in the futureWhen using your emotionally based heart to make a decision: your decisions feel spontaneousyou have a gut feeling or a guiding light that is nudging you towards a certain option (have you ever flipped a coin for option-A versus option-B, and as soon as the coin was in the air, you started hoping the coin would land on heads? That's an example of this guiding light)you can't explain why you want a certain option, but your subconscious is telling you that this option is what it wantsyou feel excitement and energy whirling around the option that your heart is pushing you towardsyou assess how you will feel about the decision in the present==================================================== So, when should you use your emotional or rational decision making process? Let me first explain a bit about myself. I'm a VERY rational and logical person. I'm an engineer and mathematician, so my decisions making process tends to be very calculated.  I used to be like you. I was bogged down my pros and cons so much that, it affected my ability to make the best decisions.  How can that be? How can putting more thought and reason into a decision make it worse off for myself? It doesn't quite make sense....until I discovered emotional decision making.  ==================================================== Here is the way I think about it. When using your rational decision making process, you are trying to make the best decision for your FUTURE self. When using your emotional decision making process, you are making a decision for your PRESENT self. There are many books, including Stumbling on Happiness: Daniel Gilbert: 9781400077427: Amazon.com: Books that show that human beings are terrible at predicting their emotions in the future.  Once I started making more emotional decisions, I noticed my present self being better off. And I noticed that my future self was doing alright himself.  At the end of the day, you can only experience life in the present moment. So, if you only making decisions for your future self, you will never experience life. Emotions are everything. Emotions are the only way to experience life. ==================================================== Back to the question: when should you use emotional decision making and when should you use rational decision making? Well, it depends. In some situations, like when deciding which stock to buy, it probably makes more sense to use your rational brain. When deciding where to go eat, I've found that my emotions are a better indicator of my future happiness. You have to find a system that works for you.  Here is my system. I view the decision making process as a spectrum. If the effects of my decision will only last for today (i.e. \"where should I eat\"), I use 99% emotions and 1% rational thinking to make my decision. If the question is \"where do I want my career to be in 10 years\", I use 99% rational thinking and 1% emotions. If a decision is in somewhere in between the spectrum, such as \"which apartment complex should I move into\", then I use a balance of emotional and rational thinking. It's up to you to create your own system. Obviously, there are always exceptions. ==================================================== So, here's the kicker. Emotional decision making is a muscle that you must train. Based on your question, I can tell that you have a very strong rational muscle, but your emotional muscle may need some practice. It's just like lifting weights. If you haven't been to the gym in a few years, you might struggle to life 100lbs. If you lift weights for a few months straight (and drink plenty of protein shakes), then you will see yourself starting to lift 150lbs. Your emotional decision making process may not yield the best results today, but you have to start somewhere. There is only one way to get better...practice.
