            "answer_text": "I have tried a couple of ISPs in Gurgaon. Triple play and Iking being the two. I went in for Triple play initially and opted for a 100 Mbps connection. The installation was the only time I was not satisfied as I had to wait for a more than a week. I had to write mails to SP telecommunications, Haryana Police and the Consumer Forum as the company took the money and then started delaying the installation procedure by giving lame excuses and said the installation cannot be done before the next day. I wrote a mail to the customer care and got no reply. I had to then complain to the Consumer forum while keeping the company in loop. Got a response within 5 mins and a technician well past midnight. Other than that the service was very good with the company representatives calling later to confirm is everything okay or not. They requested me to take down the complaint if I was satisfied with the services which I did since I was getting a good service after that. I constantly got a speed of about 75\u201380 Mbps on wireless which is acceptable. I then moved to new place where Triple play did not provide their services. So I opted for Iking as this was one of the few options who were providing a 100 Mbps connection in my society. I have never got a speed according to the package. The most I have received is 32 Mbps. Every time I complained I got a silly reply that your router is not capable of handling that much of speed whereas I was using the same router for Triple play as well. I was able to get good uploads but no download speeds. I even got a reply that we don't know how to solve this if you could come and solve this for us we'll be greatful. The service is pathetic with speeds being constantly around 10\u201312 Mbps. Long story short go in for Triple play if they provide services in your area. ",

And that is \u201cYou broadband\u201d They'll lure you with initial lucrative offers and then all you'll do is keep chasing them to get the internet working as your money is stuck with them. I applied for the connection and the guys were there within an hour to collect the refundable advance security (You will never get this back!!), which they say you'll get back after disconnection and can be done from customer care number (Even that doesn't work!) and connection pack fee. Their blatant lies: You'll get WiFi router the next day (mine arrived after two months they have backlog and first they serve previously irritated customers and company doesn't have enough to clear out demand)We are getting our fibre cable in place (that's not happening for that you'll need permission from State Govt. as it involves digging up roads, they can't afford that believe me I was told It'll be done in a month)Our speed is constant in a range (speed fluctuates way more than you'd imagine, when the internet is working obviously and that's rare)For those who think I'm from some competitor company should note that I didn't name one you should go for just the one you shouldn't and I'm also appending one of my receipts. Don't go for \u201cYOU Broadband\u201d !!!!  I'm shifting to Triple play, have heard that they are good but haven't used on daily basis will write after a quarter of using their services! Have a nice day! ",
