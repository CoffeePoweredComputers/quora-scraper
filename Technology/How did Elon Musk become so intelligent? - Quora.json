            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a very interesting question for many reasons. Like, for example, what is it about Elon that you see that makes you conclude that he has \u201cbecome\u201d intelligent. The question infers that he was not and that at some stage, he became. Also, what do you mean by intelligent? Is it that he has become a billionaire? Is it that he created his first software at something like 12 years old? Is it that he works more or less around the clock? I ask these questions, not because I have an opinion. I ask because it intrigues me to know how people judge intelligence. I do agree that Elon is indeed very intelligent. I just believe that we are all born very intelligent. Then events in the world shape our ability to fully exploit that intelligence. Sometimes it is positive and sometimes negative experiences that make us walk-away from or build on our intelligence. It is how we react to given events in our early lives that shapes how we handle life and as a result be judged as intelligent or less so. So, indeed, it intrigues me to know what you see in Elon that convinces you that he is more intelligent than the rest. ",

            "answer_text": "He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s just lucky, rich, and bored. He helped found PayPal during the height of the dotcom boom. A lot of people got rich, even richer than he did. And since then he has shown a slightly above average skill in identifying gaps in markets. In reality Elon Musk is a man of high average or above average intellect who got rich at a time when anyone with a good idea for an internet business could get rich. His education is nothing special. The problem is American society usually makes the mistake of equating wealth with genius. Most rich people are no smarter than their middle and lower class employees; many like Trump are considerably less intelligent than average. ",
