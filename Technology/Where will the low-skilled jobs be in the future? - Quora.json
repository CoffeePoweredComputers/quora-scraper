            "answer_text": "There seems to be a trend where even the low skilled jobs requirement are going up. Such jobs are likely going to be the jobs which machines cannot do. For example, in making a T-shirt, a machine can harvest the cotton, and make it into filaments and tissues, without the requirement of a single worker. However, the job becomes more complicated when it comes to crop the tissues and making it into the actual T-shirt, thus machines can\u2019t do that job. This is a nice analogy for what are going to be future jobs for low skilled people. They are just going to do whatever the machines can\u2019t do, which, with the progress in AI and technology, less and less jobs will be left for unspecialised workers.  ",
