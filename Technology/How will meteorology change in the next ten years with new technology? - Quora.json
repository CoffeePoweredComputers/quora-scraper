            "answer_text": "Meterolological forecasting has come a long way in the last few decades largely due to the increase in computer power. There is also the internet which increases communication. Additionally the number of ground based automatic recording and observational bases on land and especially at sea has increased the amount of data instantly available enormously. This is quite a difference to when I was in the 'office' with its teleprinters and manual techniques and the sketchy data just given from the ocean by a few dedicated weather ships. There is no doubt the above trends will continue. In addition there are new programming and mathematical trends both in algorithms and in new maths such as chaos theory. I wouldn't  expect any vast increase in the accuracy of long range forecasting though. ",
