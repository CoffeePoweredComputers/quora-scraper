            "answer_text": "It's a muscle, and you relax it when you get his dick in you. It doesn't stretch out. If you're not actually damaging the muscle by forcing it over things that are obviously too big, too soon, it will always get back to its original, factory standard seal. What you can do is learn to relax it further. Sphincters are amazingly elastic , they can accommodate a huge range of sizes without damaging themselves, if you take the time to let them properly relax. ",
