            "answer_text": "This is actually NOT a crazy-ass question! LOL Good job! Yes, the NFS wants to buy and operate drones to start and monitor prescribed burns. It is substantially safer than sending people into the boonies with incendiaries, and have them hike in and out, and drones can provide excellent monitoring - arguably bots in the air are better than boots on the ground! (I couldn\u2019t help myself - sorry!) Not gonna happen, though. As you can imagine, these would be prone to injury, and you need replacement parts. The replacement parts are in China (where just about everything is manufactured) and Trump signed an Executive Order banning the US Government from buying from China! Yeah, Mr. \u201cRake the Forests\u201d. ",
