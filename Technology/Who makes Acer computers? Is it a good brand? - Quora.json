            "answer_text": "I'm not exactly sure who makes them anymore, as I believe Acer no longer makes their own hardware and subcontracts to god knows who. I've found Acer laptops to be affordable and reliable. You'll often find that Chinese and Taiwanese brands (Acer, ASUS, Lenovo, MSI, etc.) are much cheaper than their Western-manufactured counterparts, assuming most components are the same. That being said, I prefer ASUS the best, with Acer coming in second, then MSI followed by Lenovo. I have very little love for Dell, HP, Compaq and other Western brands as they tend to be overpriced where I'm from and seem to bog down pretty quickly.  I think the Taiwanese/Chinese brands are cheaper (at least where I'm from) because they have cheaper labor over there, and probably because they don't have to ship their products very far (me being from the Philippines), thus diminishing transport costs.

With that said, I have bought several of their products and found them to be of Moderate quality and medium power. One of their failings, is that they seem to cost reduce too often, and when you want to upgrade the product, you find that impossible, because the place were you would add something like extra ram, Is missing the required socket, because they failed to solder it in.
