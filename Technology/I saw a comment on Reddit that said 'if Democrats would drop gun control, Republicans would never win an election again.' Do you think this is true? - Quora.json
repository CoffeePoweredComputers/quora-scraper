            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure if this is are recent question or not. It seems like it must be pretty old, since gun control is not really an issue on the minds of voters right now. (May 2020). But, I think I should respond. I think the comment quoted in the question regarding Democrats dropping gun control is pretty na\u00efve, if not entirely irrelevant in 2020 politics. I don\u2019t think \u201cgun control\u201d is even close to being a Democratic issue. It is much more a Republican issue. It is something that they use as a political Boogeyman. They say, of every single Democratic candidate, that they will come to take our guns if you vote them in. Yet, they never ever do. Did Obama come for your guns? No, he did not. Did Hillary? No, of course not! Donald Trump, the biggest idiot ever to hold any public office, was the one who ignored the 2nd amendment, and he said he thought we should confiscate guns without a warrant, or a criminal violation or anything. It was kinda along the lines of \u201cShoot first. Ask questions later.\u201d (Except the \u201cshoot first\u201d part in this case means \u201ctake their guns first\u201d.) In Trump World, where Trump says and does crazy stupid (sometimes illegal) stuff several times every day, his responses to the Parkland shooting has been long buried in our collective memory beneath a mountain of other crises, crimes, killings and incompetences from the impeached imbecile. But he had the chance at that time to shake up the political will of the whole of Government and to do something positive to reduce the risk of us all from the threat of terrorism or lone wolf psychopath mass shooters. He brought in the students and the parents of victims from the Parkland mass shooting. He gave them a voice, and he had the opportunity to spotlight needs and concerns that we all have and to finally finally do something to solve this uniquely American crisis. It is an issue he could have and should have brought our nation together on, his opportunity to be an actual leader. He could have been \u201cpresidential.\u201d Instead, he went full-gun-nut crazy-person and advocated for arming teachers. But before that he was discussing \u201cred flag\u201d laws, and he told reporters that he thinks we should go take guns away before any crime took place. (I do recognize that in this case he was just thinking out loud, but it is also an example of all the stupid stupid things he thinks about. Things like the more recent out-loud thought he had about curing Covid-19 by injecting disinfectants or shining light inside the body.) So, \u201cgun control\u201d is not an issue for Democrats to drop to win elections. It is, actually, a GOP wedge issue used to fear-monger and to deceive voters into thinking Democrats want to take their guns (and their rights) away. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. There is some irony in people who apply evolutionary thinking to the world and all its inhabitants, yet when it comes to political parties think in terms of absolute (deontological?) principles. Personally, I\u2019d reverse that. I think political parties and other creations of human ambition are much more Darwinian than a world beyond human understanding. If the Democrats dropped gun control, Republicans would shift platforms until they achieved parity again. It\u2019s an evolutionary arms race, one that even has detent\u00e9 in areas where the status quo is more beneficial than change. (Like, for example, gun control.) We\u2019re in the middle of a shift in party electorates right now. Donald Trump\u2019s electorate is not the same as the traditional Republican electorate. It includes voters who were marginalized by the Democrats as a cost of increased globalization - trading workers in \u201cdead-end\u201d industries for the multicultural urban electorates of the future was seen as a good trade. It might still be a good trade. We don\u2019t yet know if Trump\u2019s coalition is stable enough to win more than one presidential election. Maybe his new 2016 voters will return to the Democratic fold in 2020. But you can see evidence for this arms race in the division of the country. In terms of electoral power, the parties are split nearly 50/50. This is a sign that both are competing almost optimally - taking every advantage given by the opposing party. It\u2019s a dynamic stalemate - also known as an evolutionary arms race. Take an advantage off the table, and the dynamics will change. After all, where is the powerful political opposition to gay marriage now? Even the previous President of the USA began his term opposed to it, and you could argue that Bush won the 2004 election in no small part by opposing it. But the Supreme Court made it the law of the land, the current Republican President doesn\u2019t care about it, and the issue has blown away in the wind\u2026 \u2026to maybe return in thirty years, the way Roe vs. Wade did. But that\u2019s a future possibility, not the reality of today. ",
