            "answer_text": "Assistive technology is defined as assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities or the elderly population. People with disabilities often have difficulties with performing activities of daily living independently or even with assistance. Assistive technology can be anything from a device that helps an older person or somebody who can\u2019t physically reach their feet to put on socks or shoes to a speech to text device (or the opposite) to something as simple as a molded pencil grip. For some people with auditory delays or processing issues, a speech to text device or software may be helpful in lectures for class. Some of the good ones that filter out background noise make it so the student could read what the professor is saying and get more information more efficiently that way.For others, perhaps they have issues with their coordination (or a comorbid disorder like dyspraxia). A simple piece of adaptive technology such as a molded pencil grip may help them with their handwriting.For some students with autism, an iPad might be helpful. Dictation software is on them, as well as other things, such as a text to speech app for students who may be nonverbal.For some students who may be nonverbal, they may find a chart, such as the one below, or an app that is similar, helpful. Bonus points: For somebody who is deaf/blind and has learned Braille or Morse code, there are phones and technology in existence that allows them to send and receive text messages via vibration.Assistive technology can literally mean anything.
