            "answer_text": "Technology (\"science of craft\", from Greek \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7, techne, \"art, skill, cunning of hand\"; and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, -logia [2] ) is the collection of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e. g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems. The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics. Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.

            "answer_text": "Technology is actually really hard to define, but here goes. Technology is: An artifact that enables a capability for a person or group acting in the world. Technological development is: The art and science of creating artifacts that enable a new capability for a person or group acting in the world. Art and science because the process of developing technology involves analysis (science) as well as synthesis (art). Artifact can be a physical tool (i.e. hammer), a method (risk assessment) or a technique (brain surgery). The artifact enables a capability i.e. hammering in a nail, assessing risk or performing brain surgery in a safe way. Technology is often narrowly thought of as physical tools i.e. a hammer or even a computer that enables a capability. But in Russia, for example, they speak of political technology which is a political method that enables a capability to achieve a political end i.e. getting elected. ",

Which is part of the holy trinity that is the foundation to human\u2019s rise of power in the food chain. Namely, math, science, and technology. Math is an abstract tool using logic to quantify reality. To simply put it, it is the branch between reality to abstract thoughts. Which is why it is often consider as the b!tch of science. Cause it does all the work while science reap the reward. Science is then the tool in which reality is define. To simply put it, it is what determines whether the mathematical model of a hypothesis is true or not through experimentation and proof. That is why there are thousands of hypothesis out there that are scientifically untrue despite being mathematically sound because they are unproven. Technology is the last and most important tool and the branch between theory and practice. It make use of the understand of reality with science to create tools that are practical and useful for humans. Which is why science is often consider as technology\u2019s bitch because science does all the work while technology reaps the reward. These three things are the foundation as to why humanity is the strongest species on Earth. With these three things, it is possible for us to reach the maximum potential that this universe has to offer. That is, if we can survive long enough to reach that potential. ",
