            "answer_text": "Zhang Yiming built a $US16.2 billion fortune after founding ByteDance, the Chinese software developer behind TikTok.Despite being the 13th-wealthiest person in China, Zhang is extremely private and little is known about his personal life.TikTok\u2019s growing influence in the US has raised questions from US regulators.The widespread popularity of TikTok has not just created a new generation of social media stars, it\u2019s also created a social media billionaire. Zhang Yiming, the 35-year-old software engineer who founded the app\u2019s parent company, now has a net worth of $US16.2 billion,Forbes estimates. Despite being the 13th-wealthiest person in China as ranked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Zhang is extremely private and little is known about his personal life. Zhang was born in 1983 in China\u2019s Fujian province, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Zhang\u2019s parents worked as civil servants,Bloomberg reported. His name is based on a Chinese proverb about \u201csurprising everyone with a first attempt,\u201d according to the South China Morning Post. Zhang graduated from Nankai University in 2005, where he started off studying microelectronics before switching his major to software engineering, the South China Morning Post reported. The couple does not have any children, according to the South China Morning Post. \u201cI was one of first employees. And I was an ordinary engineer at the beginning, but in the second year, I was in charge of about 40 to 50 people responsible for back-end technology and other tasks related to products,\u201d Zhang told ByteDance employees. Zhang credits that job for teaching him sales skills that he later used to grow ByteDance. \u201cI remember that at the end of 2007, I went to meet the client with the sales director,\u201d Zhang said, according to the Post. \u201cThis experience let me know what sales are good sales. When I established Toutiao and recruited staff, these examples helped me a lot.\u201dZhang also worked at Microsoft before founding ByteDance. The company is now worth $US75 billion, according to Pitchbook, making it the most valuable privately held company in the world. The company owns several social networking apps that operate within China, Business Insider previously reported. The company released a WeChat rival called FlipChat, and a video-messaging app called Duoshan in 2019. Zhang wanted to create a news platform whose results were powered by artificial intelligence, separate from China\u2019s search engine Baidu, Business Insider\u2019s Paige Leskin previously reported. \u201cWe push information, not by queries, by news recommendations,\u201d Zhang told Bloomberg in 2017. Despite its focus on news, Zhang told Bloomberg\u2019s Lulu Yilun Chen and Mark Bergen in 2017 that ByteDance does not have any journalists on its staff like many other social networks. \u201cThe most important thing is that we are not a news business,\u201d Zhang told Bloomberg. \u201cWe are more like a search business or a social media platform. We are doing very innovative work. We are not a copycat of a U.S. company, both in product and technology.\u201d TikTok is now the No. 1 non-gaming iOS app in the U.S, Business Insider reported in September. TikTok is one of the most popular social networks among American teens and has been downloaded more than 1 billion times. TikTok still goes by the name \u2018Douyin\u2019 in China, Business Insider previously reported. \u201cFor a very long time, I was merely watching TikTok videos without making any of them myself, because it\u2019s a product mainly for young people,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cBut later on we made it compulsory for all management team members to make their own TikTok videos, and they must win a certain number of \u2018likes\u2019. Otherwise, they have to do push-ups. It was a big step for me.\u201d Zhang\u2019s leadership style is \u201csoft-spoken yet charismatic, logical yet passionate, young yet wise,\u201d according to Time Magazine\u2019s Kai-Fu Lee. Zhang wants the app to continue to grow abroad, saying that he hopes his ByteDance will be \u201cas borderless as Google,\u201d according to the South China Morning Post. \u201cWe must work harder, we must also be more perfectionist,\u201d Zhang said, according to the Post. \u201cJust like there was an international division of labour in the industrial age, in today\u2019s information age there\u2019s also an international division of labour. Chinese entrepreneurs must also improve their own capabilities as they go global,\u201d he said. TikTok agreed in February to pay a $US5.7 million fine to the Federal Trade Commission over allegations the app illegally collected personal information from children under age 13 without parental consent, in violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, Business Insider previously reported.
