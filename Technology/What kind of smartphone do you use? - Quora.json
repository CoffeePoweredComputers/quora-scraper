            "answer_text": "I started out with a Nokia phone, then switched to blackberry.  Each one had different aspects that I enjoyed, mainly the tactile feel for both an older Nokia and the keyboard on a blackberry.  But I switched to the iPhone in 2009 and haven't looked back since!  I've written a side x side comparison Our List Of The Best Phones Of 2014 of the major smartphones on a tech blog and you can see why I chose the iPhone.   The benefits of an iPhone are numerous but I'll list some of my favorites now: The integrated technology between Apple devices. Solid phone construction with an eye on sleek design It works as promised and is very intuitive for useThe built-in suite of Apps like Pages, Numbers and KeywordOutstanding battery lifeIncredibly high-def camera featuresSecurity from hacking - now I know there have been a couple blips recently, but by building all major software products in-house, Apple helps to eliminate potential trojan horses/malware from infiltrating its technology.Biometric finger touch securityApple Pay - a game changing way to pay for things: http://tinyurl.com/psqt352As Paul Belshaw commented previously, my one issue is the cult of Apple and its control over all things.  But as I listed earlier in my comment, it also allows Apple to exert control over what goes into their iPhones, from hardware, software and Apps.  This helps make their iPhones much, much harder to hack and overall more secure.  Overall, I'm happy with my iPhone.  I've looked at switching over to Android and Google, but really like the size and shape of my iPhone 6.  It's thin, sleek design and large screen fits perfectly in my hand and is easily single-thumb navigational. It also is small enough to fit and rest comfortably in my pocket. Hope this helps, there are some great ones out there but I feel the iPhone is the best smartphone on the market right now. ",

            "answer_text": "I use multiple smartphones. The current ones in my pocket are - iPhoneNokia Pureview 808 iPhone has many apps, in particular, a lot of new apps are released first on this platform, so it makes sense to stay on top of app development by using an iPhone. Secondly, since I do play a lot of games, the iPhone is a good device for that. The Nokia Pureview 808 (Symbian). My SIM sits in this phone most of the time. This is because of the hardware. The 41MP camera with the pureview technology just blows away any other camera in a phone, plus I use the FM transmitter when in a car, and on top of that the offline maps have been ultra useful especially when in the countryside or when travelling to another country when I don't have data available. It's also convenient for watching videos as I don't like using iTunes, and just dropping video and music files onto the phone memory is quick and easy using USB mass storage rather than waiting for iTunes to convert. Another super useful feature is the AMOLED sleeping screen  that is always on, which means I can use it as a nighttime clock with notifications without having to worry about battery drain. (Android and iOS are not capable of this low power app yet.) I've just ordered a Samsung Galaxy S4, so I can stay abreast of the developments in the Android world, I used to own a Motorola XT720, but due to lack of updates, it was binned quickly. From my previous experience with Android, it is more similar to Symbian in terms of flexibility, and has more apps available, but the hardware features I'm used to are still not there yet. ",
