            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t do this via HDMI cable (unless your laptop has HDMI input, not output). However, Windows 10 allows you to project to a laptop. This is done via Miracast and can be used to stream video from Windows or Android device. For Android, you can only duplicate your phone\u2019s screen, for Windows (both Windows laptop and Windows Phone) you can extend your screen to get a secondary display. Before doing the following, ensure WiFi is enabled in both devices, preferably connecting both to same wireless network. While using same network is not required, this is to ensure issues like 2.4GHz vs 5GHz WiFi issues etc you may potentially run into. On the laptop you want to receive (the one to work as another \u201cmonitor\u201d), go to Settings -> System -> Projecting to this PC and enable it. On the laptop that you want to stream to (the one that will use another \u201cmonitor\u201d), press Windows+P and choose Connect, then find your other laptop. Once the connection is established, you can press Windows+P again to choose whether the screen is duplicated or extended. I have successfully paired my Surface Book with an Asus T100HA, using the Asus as an additional display and it has worked flawlessly for me. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. Unless you have an unusual situation and your laptop has an HDMI in port that is not possible. A capture card with HDMI in could be used as well. The best solution is to get monitor and connect it to the other laptop if the need is caused by a damaged or failing screen. If you need to interact with it a remote control application might be what is needed on it which would give you the ability to use and view the other laptop. For this you could enable Remote Desktop in Windows. You could use something like Remote Utilities or similar applications as well. It would just depend on what need you have for viewing and or interacting with the other laptop or computer. ",
