            "answer_text": "Google analytics is great for telling you what people are doing on your website but not who they are. To find out who:Under Visitors > Network Properties you can see some companies who have visited if they are big enough to have their own IP.This information is often mixed in with the ISPs the visitor was using and is annoying to extract. A tool like http://www.leadfeeder.com/ can connect to your analytics and pull it out in a much more readable format. Outside Google Anlytics:http://www.leadforensics.com/ looks at the visitors IP and can match it with their own contact data base and tell you what companies visited and additional information on that company. Hubspot have a great free tool http://www.leadin.com/ that once a person fills out a form on your site will let you know their source, what pages they visited and when. There is also a Linkedin hack where you can see the Linkedin profiles of the people who visit your site. http://audiencestack.com/static/blog-hack-linkedin-to-view-website-visitors.html ",
