Don't know about you but for me this is life saver as I always have more things to connect than ports. Here is the website-One USB port, unlimited plugs Edit 1- Some people decided to comment \u201cwell you can't really charge infinite devices\u201d. Well of course! It is just a fun device than can help you to add some more devices. The creators have the infinite name just to be catchy. Will it accept infinite connections? Of course not!!! ",

            "answer_text": "I personally like the ZEROi Hat!  These hats work on the principle of bone conduction technology. It actually allows you to take calls and listen to music without earphones while being aware of your surroundings. ZEROi is a hat with four built-in bone conduction speakers. The Hat is covered with a soft cloth that absorbs additional sounds which reduces the noise that leaks outside which otherwise could be heard by others. The Hat doesn\u2019t block the outside sound, so it can used in normal environment conditions. Did I say it is water resistant? There's this one touch button on the hat with which you can use the functions. ",
