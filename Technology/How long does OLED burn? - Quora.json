            "answer_text": "It depends on the type of content and how long it is powered on at a time. If you just watch TV programs at 75% brightness 3 hrs a day, an OLED TV will last 5 years or more (essentially predicted lifetime). If used as a computer monitor at 100% brightness 24/7 (not the intended task for most OLED TVs), taskbars and icons begin to persist on screen in as little as 1 week, and graduate to permanent burn-in after a month or so. Those are probably the two extremes. Figure out all others in between. ",
