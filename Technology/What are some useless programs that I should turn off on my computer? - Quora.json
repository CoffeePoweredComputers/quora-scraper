            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have a list of useless programs per se, but my standard is to keep all programs disabled in my startup menu unless I know for a fact that I will use it everyday with no exception. If I want to use it, I will open it manually. Second, if there is an app or feature that I didn\u2019t choose to install, was auto installed by another app, or came with Windows, it gets uninstalled. If I need it, it will notify me and I can choose to install it. It is not as important now, but back in the day this could take up a significant portion of your storage, or severely adversely affect your performance. I just never broke the habit. ",
