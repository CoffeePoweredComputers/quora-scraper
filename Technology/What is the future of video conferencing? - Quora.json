            "answer_text": "Andrew makes a good point. Companies are using the browser or web apps to integrate video conferencing natively without the need of a download etc. You only have to look as far as Drum - Free Instant Web Meetings - Drum or appear.in to see it in action. But this has been around for some time now. It just isn\u2019t widely accessible due to CPU and bandwidth issues. You will certainly see it becoming more of a thing over the years as online services and apps begin to integrate such services. But the future beyond that is the usage of AI in video. Understanding someones mood in a meeting, did they understand your point? Do they need more information? That\u2019s before anything has been mentioned. Taking second guessing from some ones facial expression out of the equation. Video conferencing will become much more immersive and be the standard for communication over the coming years. At present, the only hard adoption is in Generation Z. The future workforce. ",

            "answer_text": "Video conferencing has come a long way from the early days of telepresence suites and nascent desktop services. Now users can make video calls from anywhere -- the road, a boardroom or an ad hoc huddle space. But the future of video conferencing promises more than reliable, high-quality calls. While call quality is important and most vendors support high-definition video, video conferencing is more than just video. ",
