            "answer_text": "Your bound to get several wrong answers on this thread\u2026 Just because a phone is \u201cUnlocked\u201d doesn't mean it will work on any network. Unlocked doesn't mean Works on all carriers There are two types of networks. GSM and CDMA. Sprint and Verizon are CDMA based. T-Mobile and AT&T are GSM based. Only a few devices are Unlocked and capable of being used on any network. Google Nexus and Pixel devices are a couple. The Verizon or International iPhone 7 is also. Most Motorola devices have both kinds of radios as well. Many GSM only devices are sold as and called Unlocked and cannot work on Verizon. Most CDMA devices also have a GSM radio so it's likely an Unlocked CDMA devices will work anywhere. Your likely to run into this problem most if you try to take a phone from any GSM network to any CDMA network due to the nature of CDMA networks. Yes, this is a confusing topic and it shouldn't be. What makes it worse is that so many people spread misinformation about it, assuming they know what they are talking about. So people just get lucky, so they don't know that they are spreading false information also. Manufacturers should make all phones with both radio technologies but they still don't, or don't all the time, which created this problem. The Unlocked phone industry isn't clear about this either. Most sellers are more interested in selling you an unlock code or unlocked phone despite the fact it's not truelly compatible with all types of carriers. Please research the device your interested in first and ask questions and your likely to not run into this problem. XDA forums is a good resource for information, as is a Google search. Good luck to you ",

            "answer_text": "Locked phone usually means that it could be used only with one carrier/network it locked to. So you have to use SIM card from that carrier. The only exception is when you are using carrier that using the same network. For example in US Cricket Wireless, H2O are using AT&T network. So you can use AT&T phones with those companies. And SIM cards from them will work. If you want to use this (in our example AT&T ) phone with T-Mobile for example it needs to be unlocked. To unlock the phone you have to put not native/foreign SIM card into phone and enter the code it would ask you. Code is individual to the phone. Sometimes you can even get it for free from the company it is locked to. ",
