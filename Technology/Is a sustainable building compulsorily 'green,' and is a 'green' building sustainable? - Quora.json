            "answer_text": "I am afraid both terms are being used carelessly these days. This definition, sometimes given, has the broad meaning for sustainable - to conduct human activities in a way able to meet the needs of the current generation without limiting the (earth's) ability to meet the needs of succeeding generations. Green seems to have gotten run over by the rush to commercialize the term and apply it to every product that is even vaguely less environmentally damaging than its competitors and some that aren't. If we can set that aside, green can be usefully applied to individual products, buildings, vehicles, etc. that are designed to minimize their cradle to grave carbon foot print and impact on other resources, the waste stream and other impacts all of what we do has on the environment. So I would look at sustainability as the more general term and green as specifically applicable (or not) to identifiable things we make or do. ",

            "answer_text": "The concept of self sustainable building or zero water building is designed in many countries with the aim to reduce the consumption of fresh water and reutilizing the water. This is a two way process. At first the rainwater which is fresh and abundant is captured and stored for further use. Secondly, the wastewater at the site is treated for further use thus reducing the need of fresh water from the corporation to minimum and eliminating the wastage of water. The storage of rainwater under the ground also helps to stabilise the underground water table thus benefiting the environment. ",
