            "answer_text": "If you really want to use Machop, sure. Why not. Ability: No Guard Nature: Jolly/Adamant for set one, Impish/Careful Item: Choice Scarf for set one, Eviolite for set two EV\u2019s: 236 speed/196 attack/72 HP for set one, 252 HP/252 defense or special defense/4 speed or you can pour it into more defense. Set One If you really want to use offensive Machop, go for it I guess. A guaranteed-to-hit DynamicPunch is a strong STAB move with good power and the confusion is nice. For coverage, Knock Off and Poison Jab hit all fighting-resists quite well. Rock Slide rounds out the set to punish those irritating Flying-types. Other moves such as Earthquake for Poison-types, all elemental punches, or priority Bullet Punch can be used for coverage if you want. Jolly is extremely preferred for the extra speed, though maybe Adamant could work. This set is best reserved for Little Cup, where power level is lower. Set Two Support Machop is both the worst and best idea I have ever had. Eviolite to add to its bulk, max HP investment and defensive investment, plus either Impish or Careful nature, and hopefully you can get a bit of utility out of this thing. Knock Off, Encore for singles and Helping Hand for doubles (you can run both Encore and Helping Hand on a doubles set if you want), Protect (in singles, you can run Light Screen instead if you want), and if you have a free moveslot you can slap on DynamicPunch or Toxic for extra utility. Of course, all these movesets would be great if it wasn\u2019t Machop. Just use Machamp for offense since it\u2019s significantly stronger and bulkier. And if you want support, run Grimmsnarl/Clefable/Toxapex/Amoonguss in singles and Togekiss/Grimmsnarl/Amoonguss/Whimsicott. But if you\u2019re really determined to use Machop, go for it. Just, be careful because Machop really isn\u2019t good. Hope this helps! ",
