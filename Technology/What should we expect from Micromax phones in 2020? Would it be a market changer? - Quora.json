            "answer_text": "They can easily make a grand comeback but the problem is now other companies have the most of the market and due to many reasons people will not end up buying micromax when it will launch a good model because we all want to invest our money in reliable Options. The new smartphones that Micromax introduced were low quality and budget smartphones lowering their own value. This is my personal experience - People these days don't even consider Micromax as a good choice because it lost its value long ago. Personally i think they make smartphones that have very bad build quality and the performance for low price will be also low, Well what you expected then? Even nokia is struggling in the market , Nokia was like big truck in front of small cars in the market but even after such overwhelming reputation and quality, Xiaomi is still ahead of all companies and Micromax will need time and to again rise up in the market. But Xiaomi is one of the most innovative companies , They will not be replaced from India's Number 1 Selling smartphone brand anytime soon. ",
