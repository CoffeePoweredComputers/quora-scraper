            "answer_text": "Electromagnetic waves is the name given to all type of radiation arising from energy transitions at atomic/molecular level and from accelerated electric charges. Initially the name was given only to the latter type ( proposed on theoretical considerations by Maxwell, discovered by Hertz and experimented upon by JC Bose/Marconi /Tesla etc.) It was soon realised that these waves behave very similar to visible light and its neighbours ( UV & IR rays) as well as X rays. The quantum explanation by Einstein , given in explaining the photoelectric effect, showed that all them were examples of a large family of radiation differing only in their wavelengths/frequencies and thus the energy required to produce them. The energy range is from billions of eV for gamma rays,10000 eV for X rays, an eV for visible light,milli eV to microeV for radar and microwaves, to nano eV for AM band radio transmission. The wave length range for radio waves ( i.e. waves produced by oscillating currents in RC circuits as opposed to atomic or molecular energy transitions) is from 1 cm to 1000 m.The lower wave lengths are called microwaves and the 10m upwards are radio waves (as this was the range first used in radio broadcasts in 1920s and 30s. ) Typically microwaves propagate in straight lines while radio waves can follow the curvature of the Earth but today are all used in a variety of communcation devices.

            "answer_text": "You can call radio waves by different names, like microwaves, when they cover the wavelength range of 1 m to 1 cm or VHF, UHF or EHF depending on the frequency range or Tera Hz waves when you deal with wavelength less than Infrared but higher than 100\u2019s of GHz. All are radio waves and all are electromagnetic waves, discovered by Faraday and explained by Maxwell. Maxwell was an absolute genius and a `Guru/Icon\u2019 for Einstein!! ",
