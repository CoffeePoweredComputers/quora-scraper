But it could be beneficial to the people with small hands I have a friend who\u2019s 5\u20190 tall and she has really small hands so this phone could be beneficial to her. she\u2019s always wanted a smaller iPhone she doesn\u2019t like the se models either. so this would work for her she smiled and got excited when I showed her the revel so I see some upsides to the iPhone 12 mini. it might be to small for some and just right for others.

            "answer_text": "As someone who has been reluctant to upgrade from my 2016 first generation iPhone SE, my question is not if the iPhone 12 Mini is too small, but if it is too big. The dimensions of the iPhone 12 Mini are 5.18 in x 2.53 in x 0.29 in, with a 5.4 inch screen.Compare this to the 2016 iPhone SE\u2019s dimensions of 4.87 in x 2.31 in x 0.30 in, with a 4 inch screen. As someone still comfortable with the 4 inch iPhone series, the slightly larger (and slightly thinner) iPhone 12 Mini may be a great upgrade, and certainly not too small. I will need to see it out in the wild before making that decision. ",
