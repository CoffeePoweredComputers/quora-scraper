            "answer_text": "I just wrote another answer. The concepts there goes very well here as well. It is written to the other question. So, may be slightly different in wordings. But it answers, this question well. Not about America alone, but about world and humanity itself. Here it is\u2026.. How has the Covid situation changed your work for the long-term? ( Question was requested by Dan Trudeau.) Actually, no, it hasn't. In 2013, I left my previous career of biotechnology/ science. I decided to start a blog in 2017. New field- internet/ spirituality/ Vedic astrology/ Philosophy for life. Started writing. Then, in 2019, idea of a business in same area arised in my mind and my plan was an online business to start with. That, I started in April 2019. But put it into full form in June of 2020. My idea was an online business to start with. It was as if the Universe said a - \u201cGo ahead\u201d, by making the whole world sit at home. Instead of I, just doing an online business, the whole world became online. I am like what is this? Is it the Universe itself is aligning to bring in major paradigm shift? Whether humanity accepts it or not- we as a group has lost our heart. We have lost our heart to money, wealth, trends and tricks. I just went to do a few errands. The first news on the radio, two brothers (16 and 8 years) were shot dead in New Jersey inside their home. Come on, inside their home- the safest place for them in the whole world. Then, while returning a sign- \u201cVote as if your guns are on the line\u201d. Has guns become more important than human life? The gun law or second amendment was written in 1791- during very different times, 229 years ago. Now, it is 2020. Shouldn't the law reflect the current society? Just my thoughts. Can any person just go and kill anyone? The same trip, I heard two killings and saw the poster for gun as well. When would humans realize- All of us are in this together! To coexist with peace?? In 2019, I understood it is people who when feel very disempowered, take to drugs, alcohol, gangs or even gun violence. I have the gift of the word by Universal grace. Above that, the gift of checking horoscope/ charts as well for guidance. Why don't I keep blog/ Quora answers as a free service to humanity, while keep my chart/ horoscope analysis as business? That way I help myself, while I help a lot of people as well. Whether humans realize-it or not, Humanity has lost its heart! Remember-Treat thy neighbor as thyself! So, shouldn't we see the human underneath every difference? My business is an attempt to make people empowered so that they treat each other kindly. For that, I am using an internet/ technology platform that is all. Whether it is blog, Quora answers, FB page or even my FB profile- it is a tool towards my end of letting humanity know- Recapture your heart and find the love to treat the next one near you, who may look or live very different from you, but who happens to be your neighbor, as you desire to be treated! Just an attempt. Who knows where it proceeds. Let us, wait and watch. \ud83d\ude0a All the very best! Regards, Swaroopa. ",

            "answer_text": "I think so, sometimes. We come home to our homes and submerge ourselves into our own worlds of Man caves and other. Yet, there are times when people come together to raise funds for the community, ball games, faith gatherings. so, it really just depends on the situations a person encounters. If you feel there is a loss of community, find ways/places to volunteer and become part of the community. ",
