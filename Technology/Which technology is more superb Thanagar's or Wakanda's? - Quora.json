            "answer_text": "Neither. Both are incredible examples of science fiction technology The only real difference is that one is an example of alien super science that includes FLT travel, flight, and incredible inventions made possible generations of utilizing Nth metal. The other is an example of human super science that evolves on existing travel, energy, and incredible inventions made possible by a monopoly and generations of study of Vibranium. It is only the imagination of the writer that has used the one for an Earth utopian society vs an interstellar on. ",

            "answer_text": "Wakanda gets a slight edge because it has been depicted in a full-length movie, where as Thanagar\u2019s has only been depicted in part of an animated movie. Of course, if ever there is a Justice League movie about the Thanagarian War, then Thanagar\u2019s technology will get an upgrade. ",
