            "answer_text": "It\u2019s totally depends on usage. Initially I use jio 1.5 gb plan and it was sufficient for me. After I switched to idea which give me 4 gb/day and I thought this will be more than enough. But, I was wrong when I started using amazon prime video a movie consumes anywhere between 1.5 to 2 gb on HD quality. Just after watching 2 movies my data plan get exhausted. so it depends for what you are using for either for meetings app like zoom or google meet, basic streaming and downloading songs or streaming movies.
