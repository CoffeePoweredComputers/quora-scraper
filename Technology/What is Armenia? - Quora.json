            "answer_text": "(Pakistani here!) Foreign Ministry and Government of Pakistan does not recognize Armenia as a Sovereign state, which makes Pakistan the only Country that does not recognize Armenia. Therefore, today majority of Pakistanis do not know the historic relation Armenians have with South Asia, and especially with the part of land which today is Pakistan. While I do not know anything about Armenia of today but I do know about Armenians. Although there is no exact date of when Armenians came to what\u2019s Pakistan today but a few inscriptions were founded in Loralai, Baluchistan which date back to 1606 to 1608. A few sources suggest an Armenian colony flourished in Baluchistan, Pakistan. This colony goes back to 17th Century. A few historians and archaeologists suggest: \u201con their (Armenians) conversion to Islam, have become completely merged in the indigenous Baloch tribes. Armenians also settled in Lahore, Peshawar and Multan. They came here mostly as Merchants.  Under the Mughal emperor Akbar, the Armenians flourished here. They were allowed their religious practices, and also played a vital role in building Lahore irrigation canal system that runs even today.  The Bishops of a few churches in Pakistan were Armenians. Notably the Saint Mary Cathedral Church, located in Multan.  A quarter of Armenians existed in Lahore and Peshawar but sadly it was destroyed by Ahmad Shah Durani\u2019s invasion in 1757. With having no diplomatic ties, the Government of Pakistan has done absolutely nothing to restore such a historic gem.  Due to the historic presence of Armenians in this area, The official language of Pakistan, Urdu and the language of Armenians have a few common words. ZendanPehlevanMoombati (Urdu for Candle) Moom (Armenian for Candle)GombetBazaar (Urdu) Vazaar (Armenian)DarwazaShakarPanirAfsoos (Urdu) Apsoos (Armenian)TajAgah (Urdu) Akah (Armenian)JaanQismatHazar!DasSiaShagirtMohorAzadThe list might go on, since to date there is no program research programs conducted. The surprising similarities between Armenian and Urdu language - Daily Times To Armenians, As a Pakistani, I am sorry. Majority of Us do not even know about you and the historic connection we have together. I myself learned about our historic connection after reading a Blog of Pakistani woman who traveled to Armenia, and was warmly welcomed by Armenian people. She describes Armenians to be most welcoming, and generous people. I truly wish to learn more about of our connection, and to improve the diplomatic ties.  ",

            "answer_text": "What is Armenia? Armenia is: Historic Western Armenia (modern day Eastern Turkey.) Pictured is a 10th-century church on Akhtamar Island, Lake Sevan, Armenia.  Below is the statue on the island. The story is as follows:  An Armenian princess named Tamar lived on Akhtamar Island in Lake Van (in Historic Armenia). She was in love with a commoner. This boy would swim from the mainland to the island each night, his way lit by a light she lit for him. One day her father found out about this and was very upset. He went to her as she held the light, waiting for her love. He smashed her light, leaving the boy in the middle of the lake without an idea of which direction to swim. They say his dying cries ofAkh, tamar\u2026 (Oh, Tamar) can be heard to this day at night. This is where the name of the island comes from. This was one of the first things my ex-boyfriend told me about his country. It's still my favourite tale. Armenia is also Eastern Armenia (the modern day Republic of Armenia.) Here, they have fab modern architecture: Cascade Yerevan  The Visitor statue by David Breuer-Weil, Cascade Yerevan at the Cafesjian Museum of Art  The people have: A very rich history in the continent and beyond. For example, in Istanbul:  The famous drum accessories producer Zildjian has its roots in 17th cent.Istanbul, when an Armenian alchemist by the name of Avedis Zildjian accidentally created an alloy which would not shatter when struck. These noisy metal sheets were then used by the Ottoman army to frighten enemies. the surname Zildjian, given to him by the Sultan, comes from Zilciyan, which means cymbal-caster in Turkish. They started manufacturing cymbals for musical use in the 19th cent. and the modern company was founded in the US during the 1920s. The Ottoman Turkish writing, explained on the picture, is still used as a marking on their instruments. An Indo-European language pleasant to the ear, with their own unique alphabet:  Beautiful music and poetry which I can't seem to link videos to here. My personal favourite by Hamo Sahyan, 1961. Translation is below.  I was a turbid little stream,and you, a wandering brook\u2026I can\u2019t even remember whenor how we found each other. Crashing into a thousand rocksalong our winding path,We crumbled upon the rocks,and we crumbled each other. We reached the sea and foundwhat fate had waiting for us,But we didn\u2019t even realize thatwe had already lost each other. Armenia is also famous for its cognac, which, according to my ex, Winston Churchill used to import crates of to England. This post will not do justice to the country and its history, culture and traditions. That can only be achieved by visiting it. ",
