            "answer_text": "Uses up too much waterUses up too much landMany crops and especially meat production produces few calories per acreWater is much more necessary than food\u2026starvation is not that dangerous whereas dehydration is very dangerous. It takes like at least 3 weeks of starvation for anything bad to happen whereas dehydration can kill in days or even hours depending on the condition so a water crisis would be more serious than a food crisis. Land is needed for houses and many other things\u2026especially important in countries with high population densities. Meat production especially doesn\u2019t work well, doesn\u2019t produce many calories per acre, uses up lots of land and water.  The Shocking Truth Of Meat Consumption And Production. Everything You Need To Know Is Right Here!  The Ecological Consequences of Meat Consumption  It's STILL such a no-brainer. (Calories Per Acre.) Even very low-calorie green vegetables like celery produce more calories and use less far less water than producing beef. The negative effects of agriculture especially with meat production is important in developing countries that have high birth rates large population growth (more developed countries have low birth rates and slow population growth so everything is automatically very easy regardless of the method used to gain food/water). A proposed solution - eat insects like crickets instead  Cricket Nutrition Facts | Cricket vs. Beef Crickets use up far less land, water, and resources in general and have more protein than beef. I\u2019m not sure how crickets taste though but probably with seasoning and stuff it might taste good. ",

            "answer_text": "Agricultur has many advantage when it is kept on small scale but the bigger the scaled the more more problems appear. In other word mass production in agriculture have many disadvantages how? You might say well when a farmer use his land intensively some time they destroy their soil structure and when poultry houses rise enormously big numbers of poultry they cause huge problems. Here\u2019s why poultry houses are fast mass production all the Meat Chickens (broiler) grow completely in about 42 days so in this 42 days there is an intensive use of resources. 1-water 2-feed 3-antibiotic 4-probiotic 5-air 6-vaccines 7-pre mixes (a balanced mixture of amino acids vitamins and minerals) . That\u2019s just the basic needs for the poultry project There are by product of this production 1-dead birds within the 42 days are burned in most case which mean waste of resources and more CO2 2-the decomposing of poultry feces (poop) ha ha Will produce methane which is worst than CO2 It course eye burn and flammable at some point. 3-the intense use of antibiotics by uneducated farmers will produce a strain of bacteria that is antibiotic resist and the antibiotics residues in th bird body will be consumed by us humans one of the reasons that make our bodies not responding to antibiotics is we are eating it every day in this scenario. 4-the income of mass production is utilized mostly by a group of people the others just take wages as workers. 5-when a disease breaks out the control of it is heavily difficult because you have an intens density in small area so when they infected they say house number 2 for example is infected so they have to exterminate all the birds in that house. 6-commercials breeding doesn\u2019t give best product it is commercial it is main goal is profit. Thes measures and problems apply on cattle breeding and any type of husbandary. For crop farmers the measures are same because to much. Corps need intensive resources and have side effects as well.
