            "answer_text": "For surveillance (as opposed to reconnaissance), you don\u2019t want a drone, you want fixed position installations with overlapping fields of view; and with any cameras on the outer perimeter fully within another (preferably interior) camera\u2019s field of view. The main reason is that a drone cannot be available continuously. It will have a logistics tail that requires outages. Refuel/recharge being most common, but you\u2019ll also need motor/engine service maintenance, drive device (wheels for ground vehicles, propellers for air-based ones) will need to be kept in proper condition with periodic replacements, etc. But that first one, refueling/recharging, is where the biggest point will come into play. While you can pump gas into a tank at a faster-than-its-used rate, it is very rare that you\u2019re able to safely recharge a high-capacity battery faster than it is consumed, and especially if you want to maximize the battery\u2019s usable lifespan. You\u2019d need several flying platforms. Around 4 if your only consideration was charging the battery; but again, that discounts all the other continual upkeep and maintenance that an autonomous platform requires. Then, even if you had a half dozen drones that you were flying through a continual coverage transition pattern, you\u2019ve got the problem that you\u2019re only looking in one place at a time. That leaves you with a blindspot problem (unless you are only monitoring a close pass). If it doesn\u2019t leave you with blindspot issues (say you are looking at a close pass), then you\u2019re expending significant resources (the drones and their logistics tails) when a much cheaper & more reliable option (a fixed camera) exists. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m all about novel uses of technology to create solutions. I just don\u2019t believe in creating solutions in search of problems. But if you are really dead-set on using a series of UAVs for 24x7 surveillance, then you\u2019ll want at least 6 of them if you are very good at maintaining and repairing them yourself. If you need someone to handle the maintenance and repair of the electric motors for you, then you\u2019ll probably want at least 10 of the UAVs so you have enough stock to keep your 24x7 rotation active when the inevitable point comes that off-site repairs are necessary.

            "answer_text": "The current small UAS type drone is no good for anything like \u201924 hour surveillance\u2019. They\u2019re good for popping up and looking around, or finding a lost dog, or a crook hiding on the roof of a McDonald\u2019s they just robbed, or the hotspot in a fire, or a good path for a fire truck. But keeping a drone in the air for 24 hours is just not something that can be done. None of them fly for more than 20+ minutes on a battery, and a full charge on most of their controllers only lasts for three batteries. To fly for 24 hours would take lots of drones, batteries, and controllers and the crew would be very busy re-charging batteries and controllers. And, even the quietest of camera drones, like the Mavic 2, are in no way \u2018stealthy\u2019 and if they\u2019re close enough to see a face they\u2019ll be heard or seen. Our brains are wired to notice stuff and drones are very easy to notice. If the target gets into a car and drives away, or even walks away quickly, the drone can only follow for something like a mile before it\u2019s out of range of the controller. Drones are good for a lot of jobs, and the FAA\u2019s new Remote Id and drone traffic management tech and regulations will enable longer range, out of visual line of sight, limited by the drone\u2019s endurance. But, \u2018surveillance\u2019 is not something that our current drones are good at. If you\u2019ve got to watch somebody or place continuously, that\u2019s a job for cameras and guys hidden somewhere they can keep a steady watch. ",
