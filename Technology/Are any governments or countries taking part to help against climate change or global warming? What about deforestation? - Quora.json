            "answer_text": "There are all kinds of governments jumping in on this unproven, unestablished crisis. Europeans have gone back to windmills, and are now rejecting them. They encouraged people to use diesel, with \u2018discounts\u2019 on fuel taxes. (A mistake.) Canada has a carbon tax. I am sure there are other countries that in \u2018the west\u2019 that are attempting to alleviate the situation. Prob ably the US is the only one who is not. But is there a crisis at all? Is there any reason to believe that the current weather is moving out of its normal range? No there isn\u2019t. There\u2019s a lot of propaganda, but not much truth, because basically it allows the government to nationalize and tax the air. The hottest decade of the last century was the 1930ies, when there were monster droughts and the dust bowl. It\u2019s not hotter than that now. Is it even good policy? The real growth in CO2 emissions is in south-east Asia, which doesn\u2019t give a damn. Nothing we can do will be effective, in the off chance that the climate crisis isn\u2019t a hoax, as long as China and India aren\u2019t part of the agreement. But the odds are that it\u2019s the biggest scientific hoax ever. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, many countries in e.g. South-East Asia are battling it in earnest. China has put soldiers to plant massive amounts of trees, India is getting greener too, and IIRC some other country like Indonesia maybe was in the news too. https://www.carbonbrief.org/one-third-worlds-new-vegetation-in-china-and-india-satellite-data-shows China and India are \u201cleading the world\u201d in \u201cgreening\u201d the landscape, a study finds, with the two countries accounting for one-third of the new forests, croplands and other types of vegetation observed globally since 2000. The results, published in Nature Sustainability, also show that China alone accounts for a quarter of the human-caused greening observed since 2000 \u2013 despite containing only 6.3% of the world\u2019s landmass.
