Innovative and creative technologies and strategies make it easier for teachers to keep their students interested in the topic, distribute pre-class, in-class, and post-class study material, and gauge how much each student really understood the concept discussed in class. Digital learning tools are the pen and paper of our time. Digital technology is the lens through which we are experiencing the world now. Hence, we bring you some of the most popular and result-oriented classroom technologies that can help you improve the learning outcomes of your class: Zooniverse: This site contains meaningful research volunteered by citizen scientists around the world. Teachers may ask the students to access the site or download its app on their smartphones.

            "answer_text": "In more and more schools today, technology is recognized as an instructional tool, not as a subject of instruction. Still, many educators, less familiar and less comfortable with technology than their students, struggle to seamlessly integrate a growing list of technology tools into their regular curriculum. So, to help you make the best use of technology in your schools and classrooms this year, we asked the Education World Tech Team to share some of their favorite technology integration lessons, activities, and strategies with you. \"Using technology in the classroom is becoming easier for teachers,\" instructional technology consultant Jamye Swinford told Education World. \"Students are coming to class with more skills. Whether a teacher requires it or not, most students use technology for their projects.\" \"PowerPoint is another technology tool that's exceptionally easy to use in the classroom,\" . \"All kinds of research projects can be adapted to this application. \"If a teacher has experience,\" \"presentation skills also can be emphasized. Besides standard presentations, such as slide shows, projects may be presented in an interactive way, using a game show format, for example. A student I know created \"Millionaire Muslim Style,\" using a popular game show format to present facts about the Muslim religion. It was fun and everyone learned the information.\" \"Our students often used PowerPoint to accompany oral reports on curricular topics,\". \"Perhaps the best integrated project I participated in involved 8th graders looking at World War II posters on the Internet. Students analyzed the posters and related them to the history of that time. I modeled this using one poster, and then students picked two or three posters to focus on and used the Internet to research their posters. A couple of students assisted me (or did I assist them?) putting the posters into PowerPoint. In Social Studies class, groups of students who had focused on a particular poster discussed their thoughts. Then, each group presented its findings to the class, projecting the PowerPoint images up on the screen. The result was a lively and thoughtful discussion between the reporting groups and the rest of the class.\" \"Excel is another easily adaptable application,\". \"Charts and graphs are a natural with Excel. This application can be used to tally results for any kind of question. Elementary students can enter results, create graphs, and compare and contrast their results. \"The natural graph structure of Excel can be used by students to create game boards or patterns,\". \"Calendars or timelines also are easily created with Excel. Older students can create interactive lessons or activities. The database capabilities of Excel allow easy sorting and classifying of information.\" ",
