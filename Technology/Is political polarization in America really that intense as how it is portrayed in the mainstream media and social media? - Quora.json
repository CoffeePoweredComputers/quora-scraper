I call this response, my \"Monster Response\" as it stomps the living shit out of everything the Right claims about itself, Libertarians and some of the Democrats & Left as well. +++++ On Aug 26th, I issued a challenge to all of Quora & reddit to try to prove me wrong. \u2022 I bet my account they can't prove me wrong. \u25baIf I can't be proved wrong by a Republican, Christian, Libertarian, or any Conservative on the Right, doesn't that mean all they have are lies & propaganda?

We know from Trump\u2019s recent strut across the tear gas cleared street how much of a ironclad control the Christian Right has on Trump.

            "answer_text": "I dont know what it is exactly youre seeing. But i can tell you things that have actually happened. Both parties are hoaxing attacks on each other. The biggest one being jussie smollet. Were the actor paid two dudes to threaten him under the guise of being trump supporters. It was a massive scandal and some shady stuff has happened around the dropping of the charges Something more recent are the left of BLM stalking then killing trump supporters. Theres people with no known affiliation trying to run over kids with american flags on back of them. A kid was suspended from school for supporting fire fighters and police that rushed to the twin tower fiasco. One side generally only sees the protests of BLM. The other side only sees the months straight or rotting of BLM. Both sides generally make massive assumptions of the other side. It goes on and on. So i dont know what youre seeing but depending where you are in america its pretty bad. Im in a heavy conservative area. And we have some teachers at the state university who try and force guilt onto people for race issues. I can only say to that extent since ive experienced it. We have massive amount of research being thrown out if it doesnt confrom with a specific sides. Like a researcher at my school did actual research and had data to back it up and from what i read of it wasnt targeted just explanation and reasoning for starting it. A certain side decided since it was bad for LGBT. ( in the same sense research showimg having two parents often raises a more successful kid than a single parent kinda way). They tried having him removed from the school. I dont recall what happened to it. But it makes me very distrustful or even school based research. ",
