            "answer_text": "Following are the benefits or advantages of Routers:\u27a8It provides connection between different network architectures such as ethernet & token ring etc.\u27a8It can choose best path across the internetwork using dynamic routing algorithms.\u27a8It can reduce network traffic by creating collision domains and also by creating broadcast domains.\u27a8It provides sophisticated routing, flow control and traffic isolation.\u27a8They are configurable which allows network manager to make policy based on routing decisions. Following are the drawbacks or disadvantages of Routers:\u27a8They operate based on routable network protocols.\u27a8They are expensive compare to other network devices.\u27a8Dynamic router communications can cause additional network overhead. This results into less bandwidth for user data.\u27a8They are slower as they need to analyze data from layer-1 through layer-3.\u27a8They require considerable amount of initial configurations.\u27a8They are protocol dependent devices which must understand the protocol they are forwarding.
