            "answer_text": "The strengths of a CEO and the strengths of a psychopath are not very different. The \u201cFake It \u2019til You Make It\u201d ethic in Silicon Valley inspires all kinds of chicanery. IIRC an incident was reported in the book \u201cThe Soul of the New Machine\u201d wherein a computer company brought a great big computer to a trade show \u2014 big enough so that a small man with a small computer could hide inside and type out human responses to simulate what the big computer was represented as doing. Academics are famous for suffering imposter syndrome. The celebrated writer Joan Didion discussed it in one of her essays. I wish I could remember the language. Something about all the lucky breaks, and the mistakes no one noticed. Successful CEOs have the advantage over academics because they can point at the money they\u2019re bringing in. \u201cWall Street thinks I\u2019m real, and therefore I must be real,\u201d can be a powerful syllogism for a self-doubting CEO. In extreme cases, you get an Elizabeth Holmes who, after justifying her lies as part of a beautiful quest, perhaps even comes to believe them. I\u2019ve written quite a bit about the 9/11 Keymaster, who traveled the world appearing on TV and collecting money and getting photographed with movie stars and heads of state on the basis of a fabricated hero story. I\u2019ve seen him, but I never met him. I can\u2019t pretend to know his mind. But it\u2019s hard to escape the suspicion that when he told a hall full of cheering admirers that he was hero, he started to believe it himself. How could so many people be wrong? ",
