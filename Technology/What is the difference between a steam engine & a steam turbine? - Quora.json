            "answer_text": "A steam engine is a general term for a heat engine which relies on externally produced hot steam that expands under pressure to do work. The expansion is used to move mechanical parts, resulting in the rotary motion of a shaft which can then be put to various uses. A steam engine can be either reciprocating or a turbine: Reciprocating means the hot steam moves a piston up and down, which is connected to a crank-shaft to produce the rotary motion. There are different arrangements of pistons, depending on the type of engine and application. Historical marine engines had up to six pistons.Turbine means that instead of pistons, the steam pushes against the blades of a \"fan\", causing direct rotary motion. This \u201cfan\u201d is quite complex and has many sets of blades.At high speeds the turbine is more efficient than the reciprocating engine. It is also easier to maintain than a reciprocating engine. For these reasons the turbine is the only type of steam engine in use today. ",

            "answer_text": "Steam \tengines and steam turbines are steam expanders but differ in \tmechanical construction, working principle, capacitiesSteam \tengines started the first industrial revolution. Steam engines are \tpositive displacement reciprocating expander wherein the steam \texpansion takes place with the movement of piston inside a cylinder. \tPiston is connected to a crankshaft through linkages (slider & \tbar mechanism). Steam power is transferred to crankshaft from piston \tthrough these linkages. Mechanical power is available at the \tcrankshaft. Initially steam engines were employed for mechanical \twork like water pumping, crushing of sugarcane, rice / dal \tprocessing mills, etc. Initial days all the locomotive were powered \tby steam engines. Even today there are few engines powering toy \ttrains in India. All these engines were very big in size since they \twere operating all very low speeds up to 100 rpm and their \tcapacities were in kW range resulting in low efficiencies. With \tincrease in demand, steam engines with low power density and too \tmany moving components were found to be not capable of scaling up to \tMW rangeSteam \tturbines are rotary expander devices addressing these demand of MW \tlevel electricity generation with very high speeds (3000 to 30000 \trpm) and high efficiency resulting in high power density and lower \tcosts. Steam expansion takes place either in stationary blades \tcalled nozzles if it\u2019s single stage impulse turbine or in both \tnozzles and moving blades in reaction turbines. Nozzles reduces the \tpressure (i.e. enthalpy) and convert it in to velocity. High \tvelocity steam like a jet impacts on the blades mounted on a rotor \twhich starts rotating due to this. Rotor is mounted on a shaft which \tis connected to the electrical generator to convert the mechanical \tpower in to electricity. There are many configurations and types of \tsteam turbines used. In Rankine cycle thermal power plants \tmulti-stage condensing steam turbines (50 MWe and more) are used. In \tprocess industries for CHP application (in place of PRV) mostly \tsingle stage impulse back pressure steam turbines are employed which \tare in the range of 10 kWe to 1 MWe capacities.",
