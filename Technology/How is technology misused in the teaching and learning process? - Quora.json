            "answer_text": "The learning process is really a three part process of input- learning the information, output- or learner activity/practice, and finally assessment/feedback. So the misuse of technology in education often happens when technology is used in the input phase to show students what is to be learned, and then nothing else is done to create activities for students to do/practice or to assess their knowledge. It\u2019s sort of weird to short change the learning process like this, but too often that\u2019s the case. Some examples where we really see this is with older students and adult trainings. It\u2019s very easy to show adults a video, for all of them to assure you that they understood it, and then to just move on- but when that happens, their retention is typically very low. Adults and older students like to be sententary and hate activities too- which makes the desire to short change the learning process even greater. To avoid this, we must remember that technology can greatly assist the learning process, but it cannot replace the process. So as we integrate technology into our lessons, we must still make sure to cover the entire learning process. Now it is possible to use technology through the entire process- online universities have gotten very good (albeit repetitive) in going through the entire learning process through technology- but that\u2019s also much more involved than showing a YouTube video through a projector.

It\u2019s false-learning activity because it gives nothing to the student instead of use the Internet brousers. Teachers or parents sometimes use this method(?) to let themselves free from the students because they are busy, but it do nothing to the mind. ",
