I think my modern computer turns on fast enough that I am not worried about waiting for it to boot. The only time I leave my computer on is when I am downloading something huge or doing a big update.

That had a lot to do with the fact that chips were attached to PCBs. Having the temperature go up and down was bad for solder joints.
