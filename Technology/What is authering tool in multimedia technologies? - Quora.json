            "answer_text": "Authoring Tool: A few years ago, Flash was THE authoring tool. now it was replaced by a weird combination of tools that deals mostly with the main technologies that powers the web: HTML/CSS and mainly JS.Multimedia has gone from physical media (CD\u00b4s, DVD\u00b4s) , to the Cloud (the web). With improved bandwith for internet connection, there are several \u201capps\u201d that runs on the web, and that installs a minimal set on your computer to execute the harder tasks.MY question is: which set of tools are the \u201cnew flash\u201d now? As you may know, Flash, and its swf format will be no longer supported by any browser in 2020. So the decay (and death) of that format/media/and authoring tool has been announced years ago by Steve Jobs himself. Hello HTML 5 CSS3 JS\u2026 bye SWF + AS 3. But THE question remains: who will replace the fallen King (flash)? I couldn\u00b4t found any answer yet.Regards, M. ",
