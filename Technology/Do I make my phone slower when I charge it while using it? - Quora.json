            "answer_text": "Theoretically the phone is not slower when you use it while charging. However, if you use it while charging for a long period of time, like 2 hours for example, the temperature of most of the components (especially CPU) will rise significantly, which can lead to some termal throttling effects, which could feel like the phone is somewhat slower, or you'll simply get some lags, but they are barely noticeable. The phones with internal cooling are a different story, they don't have this \u201cproblem\u201d, or at least you're not expierencing it at all. ",
