            "answer_text": "It\u2019d be a weird country. It would unite parts of most of the countries on the west coast of South America, but not all of any of them.  At its greatest extent, the Inca controlled a coastal strip stretching from what\u2019s now central Chile up to a little bit into Columbia, extending inland to various extents but including some of western Bolivia. But that leaves out about half of Chile, most of Bolivia, about at third of inland Peru, and bits of Ecuador. It\u2019s not entirely clear what would happen to them in the event that the other bits of their respective countries broke away and united with one another. Still, it would encompass the most populated regions of most of those countries (southern Chile and inland Peru are pretty empty) and includes a number of port cities. It wouldn\u2019t be an economic powerhouse by any stretch of the imagination, but it\u2019d be a significant nation in South America. ",
