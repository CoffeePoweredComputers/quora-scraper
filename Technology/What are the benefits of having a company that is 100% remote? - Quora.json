            "answer_text": "Benefits of having a company that is 100% remote can be talked about from the perspectives of both employer and its employees. No need to rent the workplace and pay for it. It saves lots of money.Increase productivity from the perspectives of less distraction and less chitchat and water cooler for the employees. For some employees, those meaningless talking and waste of time in the workplace can be transformed into their helping to do more chores or other more meaningful tasks for their families. It that can help them to achieve a more work/life balance and thus, increasing the satisfaction with their work.Save money for subsidizing the commute fee for the employee. Some companies compensate for the expenses on the commute fee for their employees. Difilippantonio, general manager of Jobing's Houston office, commutes about 60 miles daily roundtrip. Gas costs between $250 and $300 monthly. He pays for it upfront and then submits all of the receipts with his monthly expenses. He said \"It's an amazing program,\" he says.\"It's like getting a $20,000 raise before taxes.\" (2)Save the cost of lending the company\u2019s car. Many employers furnish trusted employees a company-owned vehicle to use on and off the job. Many workers consider a \"free\" vehicle a valuable perk. They all cost company\u2019s money.Get talented workers from all over the world so as to improve the qualities of workforce.I believe that for some jobs, 100% remote work can save company\u2019s cost of operation and improve productivity. Of course, nothing is absolute. It depends on individual worker, the kinds of job that they do and the advancement of management for the company. If it is a company full of writers, developers or other kinds of jobs that need independence and creativity, 100% remote work is fine. If all the employees in the company are conscientious and can manage themselves and time, 100% remote work for a company is practical. Again it first depends on what job it is and whether it is suitable to be done at home and second, whether the employees are proper to stay alone at home to work based on their characters and personal qualities. As far as I know, people cannot endure one minute of staying alone and not contacting with people. 100% remote work is still an ideal dream for most of the jobs. We need the mixture of both remote work and workplace work in a single company. People say that: It allows us to find talent wherever they live, and this can open a company up to a lot of possibilities. As most technology companies know, finding and hiring talent is one of the biggest problems they face. It also allows for a truly flexible work environment. We don\u2019t have set office hours because we have people working in all time zones. People can work the hours that work best for them. (2) \u2026\u2026.. Thanks for reading.

            "answer_text": "I am working with a fully remote company for 10 years now. Same company that has now grown to around 100 people in 30 different countries. Here are some of the benefits: 1 - Cost Savings No office. No overhead costs. No regular day to day office expenses. The cost difference is drastic. 2 - Global Talent Your talent is not limited to people within your local area. You can find a talented developer, designer or whatever skill from anywhere in the world! This is actually really powerful once you take advantage of it. 3 - Work / Life Balance You are able to let your employees structure their work around their life and not the other way around (which is usually the case with office workers). That means a surfer may decide to work in Bali so he can work and do surfing, a mother may decide to stay at home temporarily to watch over the kids and adjust her work hours flexibly, etc. There are more benefits and downsides as well. But, if you just take advantage of the benefits and deal with all the challenges and problems accordingly, the remote setup could work well for you. It has worked well for us in the last 10 years \u2014 and we\u2019re still continuing to grow. ",
