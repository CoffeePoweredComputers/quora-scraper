            "answer_text": "Yes, obviously , why not !!! Fiori is the new UX design principle from SAP. To realise a Fiori app you need UI5, which is a UI development framework from SAP based on HTML5, javascript, jquery, and many other open sourced JavaScript libraries. It will be useful while learning ui5 if you have some prior HTML JavaScript css understanding.  But to become a Fiori consultant or UI5 developer, ABAP experience is never a pre requisite. Real life example is me.  May be you will hosting transactional Fiori app on Gateway server and getting your data from an ECC box, but that doesn't stop to learn Fiori or UI5. But to understand the complete picture transactional Fiori app, ABAP knowledge is required but not to develop the UI for transac\u1e6dional Fiori app.  All other types of Fiori apps like analytical etc are hosted on Hana cloud platform, where application logic can be written in Java and database should be Hana.  Even you don't have understanding of backend or database you can contribute as UI developer after learning UI5.   Happy learning !!!    ",
