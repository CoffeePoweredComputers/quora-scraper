            "answer_text": " I have to admit - my key industry is software development;) That's why I\u2019ll talk about outsourcing software projects (although I believe my thoughts are applicable to any field) So, guys, here are 5 good reasons for outsourcing: \u2116 1. You don\u2019t have time/nerves/money for the long recruitment process Yep, to find good specialists is quite a challenge. Most likely you will have to hire an experienced HR or independently look through hundreds of resumes of applicants in search of highly qualified specialists for your team. Collaborating with a professional software studio, you get highly qualified specialists in various fields of development. \u2116 2. You know how expensive it will be to constantly train your employees. You probably want savvy specialists to work on your projects. IT is a very fast-paced field that requires ongoing training. All responsibility for improving the professional skills of your employees will be entirely yours. Remember, the trends your development team can learn tomorrow, software studio specialists have already practiced yesterday. Due to their duty;) \u2116 3. You are not ready to make significant changes to the structure of your company and to manage changed workflows Management of the development department and its integration into the general structure of the company is not an easy task that will require time and nerves. In a specialized software development firm, all work processes are put on stream. \u2116 4. You are worried about data security and confidential information. I\u2019ve already mentioned how crucial cybersecurity is for any business here. Once again I will say that building a high-quality cybersecurity system is a serious issue that will require your attention, time and finances. Information leakage is always a stain on the reputation of the supplier. Professional development companies pay great attention to the protection of confidential data and always document everything. \u2116 5. You are limited in budget It often happens that maintaining/training/improvement of staff does not fit into the budget of your company (trust me, the amounts are pretty impressive) In the case of outsourcing, you pay the amount that is calculated from the hourly rate of the developer company and the scope of your project. If you want to choose the right development company, I suggest reading my answer on Quora. _____________________________________________________________________ I highly recommend to get more information from this article. _____________________________________________________________________ ",

            "answer_text": "Realistically speaking, there are still negative perceptions on outsourcing, despite the growing number of startups and businesses turning to outsourcing for their hiring needs. Nevertheless, outsourcing has benefited numerous startups and businesses over the years, especially in terms of providing reliable talent and decreasing expenses. My list may be a bit generalised, but here are some good reasons to outsource:  Cost reduction Especially for startups and small and medium enterprises operating on a tight budget, outsourcing helps a lot in reducing costs\u2014both in labor and overhead. Outsourcing companies help clients find the talent they need with significantly lower labor costs compared to hiring locally. Aside from that, reliable outsourcing companies also provide their workers with high-spec equipment, office space and support, and they also handle HR and other general administrative tasks, making your outsourcing venture a cost-effective one. Access to more talent Outsourcing is a smart option, especially for those businesses and firms in western countries like the UK, the US, and Australia, where talent shortage is especially felt. There\u2019s a bigger pool of equally talented workforce in other countries, so companies have more options. Aside from this, outsourcing also gives companies access to talent from different countries and different regions, especially if their business requires it. Flexibility One great advantage of working with outsourced workers is the flexibility that it offers. Outsourcing contracts heavily consider the duration of the project, and the team size that\u2019s required for it. Clients can conveniently (and quickly) scale with the help of reliable outsourcing companies, and they only hire the expertise they want right when they need them. Speedy hiring process Compared to hiring full-time workers, hiring with outsourced companies is significantly faster. In just a span of 1 to 2 weeks, clients can already find an outsourced worker or outsourced team who\u2019s ready to work with them and jump into the project right away. This saves companies a lot of time, especially those who are looking to develop a product following strict deadlines. Fresh perspectives Especially for setups wherein the outsourced workers are treated as collaborators rather than merely order-takers, outsourcing lets companies work with fresh perspective from different parts of the world. This gives companies a huge competitive advantage, as they have collaborators who have different backgrounds, consequently bringing in new ideas. Outsourcing isn\u2019t something to be scared of, and I hope I helped you feel that. All you have to do is be knowledgeable about the whole process\u2014read up on outsourcing and search for outsourcing service providers, according to your needs. Once you find a reliable and trustworthy outsourcing company that really delivers results, then I don\u2019t see any reason not to outsource.
