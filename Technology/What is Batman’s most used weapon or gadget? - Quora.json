Some are electrified, some are sonic, some are remote control, some are explosive. Batarangs first appeared in Detective Comics issue 31.   Despite being used often in comics, Batarangs are rarely referred to by name. ",

For gadgets, it\u2019s his grapple gun ( got to wonder how many dozens of times that get\u2019s used in a night), along with his cape glider ( depends on version whether this counts), and finally we get to the batterang. His smoke bombs, investigative tools, explosives, and the rest fall into an order somewhere after that. ",
