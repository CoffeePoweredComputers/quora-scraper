            "answer_text": "There are three different types of cartridges you should know about. They are all different in some ways, but whether you prefer the quality or not is entirely up to you. I\u2019ll provide as much information on each to help you decide. An OEM is the company that made the initial product, which in this case is your printer. For example, if you bought an HP, Brother, or Lexmark printer, those companies would be considered OEM. You can continue to purchase ink made by OEMs, but the prices are often very expensive. Generally, their business model is to sell printers cheaply while offering the replacement ink at high costs. Remanufactured and compatible printer cartridges on the other hand are sold for much less so you can save a bundle compared to OEM cartridges. A remanufactured ink cartridge is a refurbished cartridge, and is the right choice if you are interested in conserving environmental resources and saving money. Since this refurbished cartridge conserves the rubber, plastic, steel, and aluminum that would otherwise make a new cartridge, it prevents more non-biodegradable material in our landfills. Remanufactured cartridges are thoroughly checked for possible leakage and completely cleaned, including the printhead nozzles. Inspectors also replace worn components and test electrical circuitry. Compatible cartridges are made by someone other than the original manufactuer (OEMs). New compatible cartridges are assembled exactly like OEMs. As with remanufactured cartridges, compatible ones are fully inspected before stocking, will never void your printer\u2019s warranty, and function the same way as OEM cartridges. I hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have stated \u201ccheap\u201d may not be the best description. Inexpensive ink and toner is a better expression and even that is highly subjective. First and foremost check if your chosen supplier simply refills the existing cartridge with new ink/toner or if they re-manufacture the cartridge. At my store we do the latter. While refilling and empty cartridge with either ink or toner could work (and quite often will for at least the first few refills) eventually there are other parts of the cartridge that will wear. Instead make sure they are rebuilding toner cartridges, replacing all the various parts that can (and do) wear. Be sure new chips are installed (if required) to help ensure that your \u201cnew to you\u201d cartridge does not end up \u201cexpired\u201d or otherwise unusable. Several online sources will bet on the fact that they sold it so cheap that you will not bother to return that random item that fails to work properly. Always do your homework on the source of the cartridge and when you find a place that you have good success with, give them the benefit of your loyalty so they can continue to provide a good product.
