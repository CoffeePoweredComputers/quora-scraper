            "answer_text": "All things being equal, older furnaces are quieter. Back before the late 80s most furnaces had passive draft systems that made no noise. now with more restrictive heat exchangers a fan is required that makes some noise. Newer furnaces also generally operate at lower temperatures which requires more air flow. This can of course be mitigated by installing larger ducts which will lower the velocity which not many people actually do. These changes have all been mandated by energy efficiency standards. However with a good system design this extra noise can be largely mitigated. When the first of the new generation furnaces came out they were a bit noisier than today\u2019s furnaces in general but there are a lot of exceptions to this. Also in general if you buy a base model it will be noisier than a top of the line but not always. ",
