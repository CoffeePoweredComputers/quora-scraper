            "answer_text": "Going a little off-track on this question as this answer suggests which ISPs not to go with rather than the best one. I live in Chinchwad area and have used 2 ISPs so far: Tikona Broadband: a NIGHTMARE if a decent word is to be used. They didn\u2019t pay rent for their tower in my area and just removed it permanently. Customers like me from my area when complained for network outage, the customer service representative simply said the services have been stopped in your area as we don\u2019t have any tower in that area at all. They didn\u2019t even bother letting customers know about this beforehand. Forget about waiver in settlement amount. Even if you\u2019re unsubscribing to their service due to their inability to serve you, you will be harassed to pay the settlement amount. If you do not pay, they will send their lawyers to harass (extort) you. WORST SERVICE, never go with Tikona Broadband.Tata Telebroadband (formerly DOCOMO): I switched to Tata after being harassed by Tikona. I was Tata\u2019s happy customer since last 5 years till this month. This month I had horrible experience with Tata telebroadband as the service was (and is still) down for 10 days. Customer Care I have been interacting with so far is I think recruited under Rajiv Gandhi Rojgar Hami Yojana (no proper skillset to serve customers). They will share only two statements as sort of update on your complaint whenever you dial in:Sir, the service is still down (which we already know and is the reason we called customer care).Sir, the ETA has now been changed to XYZ date (Yes, they do change the ETAs to restore the service without letting you know and never restore within the promised ETA).I am currently looking for alternatives (will go with Airtel Broadband mostly). Will update this answer with the reviews of it once I start using. Update: I did not go with Airtel Broadband as they do not have infrastructure to serve in my area (and they boast themselves to be the one with largest coverage area in country\u2026). I then purchased a subscription of 220 GBs per month with speed of 50 Mbps at 699 Rs/month (paid in advance for a quarter year) from Hathway. It\u2019s been more than 2 months and so far no complains (a few outages have happened but bearable so far). And, there\u2019s an update on my Tata Docomo subscription - I had suspended the services in the month of June 19 itself and had paid the last bill (with waiver of course as the service was down for a week in last month of the subscription). However, Docomo is still harassing me by calling me and asking me to pay another bill (god knows for what reason). When I ask them to see my usage and past tickets I have raised with their technical support, they simply say we don\u2019t have that data with us. It\u2019s your problem bullshit Tata Docomo. Update on Hathway (as on 15th June 2020): I was happy with hathway till a couple of weeks ago. The service was consistent and hence never had to deal with their customer care. However, the service is on and off since last couple of weeks and I got an idea of how unprofessional a business can be. I have raised several complaints through app in last 2 weeks, tickets have been raised, which the service technician guys simply close from their end without even bothering to get in touch with you over phone or email. The service gets restored after 4\u20136 hours. As I\u2019m writing this update, the service is down since early morning today and it\u2019s been more than 11 hours, it\u2019s yet to be restored. There are a few contact numbers I have, which I tried and below is the respose I got: Customer Care: hardly got through (like twice or thrice in total ~10 attempts). When finally after the IVR bullshit talk, I was prompted to enter the account number followed by #, and I entered it (by looking at the same emails they had been sending me for bills) the answer I got is the account number is incorrect. In all 2\u20133 chances I got to interact with IVR, I got the same response, which means there is no tally between the account numbers and the database they\u2019re maintaining. 0 score on technical front.Sales representative: The phone was reachable in the morning, but nobody picked up. However later it was switched off, maybe after realizing that there are guys like me who do not give up. So did not get a chance to talk to sales representative at all, who sounded very sweet when he visited my house for the demonstration before I subscribed to their service.Technician (not sure what he does, but I had his number): This guy picked my calls in the morning 2 times. First, 2 hours after raising the service request when he told me that it will be restored very quickly (no mention of ETA). Second, 2 hours after the last time we spoke (maybe mistakenly he picked it up) and the guy told me that the people are working in the \u201cback end\u201d and it will be resolved soon \u201cautomatically\u201d and before I could speak he cut the phone and since then it\u2019s been more than 7 hours his phone is not reachable. So technically I cannot reach out to anyone from Hathway in this world for my concerns.So, as a bottom line, another shitty service I got acquainted with - Hathway. Guys, do not go with Hathway, the guys working there are unprofessional, unethical and hence the service you get after paying the hefty amount that they don\u2019t deserve is pathetic. We really need a good broadband ISPs in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, specially in this unprecedented time when we all are working from home. Meanwhile, I tried to reach out to Jio Fiber, Airtel Broadband, Tata Sky broadband and Vodafone/YOU broadband (which I think would possess some professional attitude being big brands), none of which serve in my area (Chinchwad).
