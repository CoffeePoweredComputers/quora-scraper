            "answer_text": "I respect that some items are expensive for anyone. I do not assume that any price is affordable to all. However, in general Google has priced their products quite inexpensively to try to let as many people as possible get them if they wish. Items like the Google Mini smart speaker at $39, often offered for $29 or even $19 or at times free with other purchases are quite inexpensive for what they do. The Google Chromecast at $39 and at times less is also quite inexpensive. The Pixel range of smartphones offers a wide range of features and performance for $300 or so. This is quite modest compared to other offers on the market. Now of course, there are even less expensive options, but many of them offer less performance or quality. These things are in the eye and wallet of the beholder of course. Items like the Nest Thermometer have come down in cost greatly, but this is NOT a high volume item and so is more expensive perhaps than some would pay. This may also be true of their various webcams, Google Glass, Pixel laptop and other items. Again, these items are not aimed at the mass market and like their very high performance Wi-Fi units may not be for everyone, but are very well priced for what they are. Google is not expensive, but may not be for any one person\u2019s needs or budget. ",
