            "answer_text": "You plug it in. If it works, it has acceptable quality. Yes, it\u2019s really that simple. HDMI is a fully digital signalling cable standard. If signal gets from one end to the other, then that\u2019s all there is to it; job done. If s HDMI cable doesn\u2019t work, or seems unreliable, then that is not a quality cable. Once you pass the threshold of a HDMI cable working - including those from the cheapest you can buy from places like Monoprice - anything more expensive is a complete waste of money. Of course, ahole companies like Moster Cables would like you to believe otherwise. They lie, and they prey on your ignorance of thinking that modern digital-signalling cables like HDMI have the same factors at play as old-fashioned analog cables, where quality does mattere a LOT more, and where it was worth paying a little more for a quality cable.

Poor cables actually can introduce visual snow into an HDMI signal- while it is a digital standard, there is no error correction whatsoever during the active video portion of each frame, and you can see this with excessive cable lengths or poor cables. About the best you can do via eyeball is to look for good construction, such as adequate strain relief where the cable meets the connector, quality of the plastic molding, and so forth. ",

Either it works or it doesn\u2019t. There is no need to spend big bucks on an HDMI cable. Don\u2019t be scammed. Very inexpensive ones can work just fine for regular HD resolutions. You do need what is called \u201chigh speed\u201d for higher resolutions and HDR. ",

            "answer_text": "Use it. The picture should be clear, grainy if your TV is adjusted to be, but not snowy or wavy. If it looks bad, swap it for another one you know is good. If it still looks bad, it\u2019s not the cable\u2019a fault. If you want to know which one to buy, I always get the cheapest one I can find, same as I would any cable. The job it must do is to send a high def image to your display, no matter the amount paid. If it can\u2019t do that, it gets returned for a full refund. Whatever you do, don\u2019t go to the TV department for it. Many stores will try to sell you a $50 gold-plated Monster cable. Nothing wrong with gold plating, but most of that money is for pretty packaging. Go to the aisle that has video cables and cable fabrication parts. In my local Fry\u2019s Electronics, thats over by the CPU department. ",
