            "answer_text": "It would probably work fine . Lithium-Ion batteries that are used in the smartphones these days are capable enough that they can remain in a similar state and not get totally depleted for a few months at least . So , if it is for a month or two , it should remain fine , but if it is like more than 3\u20134 months , then I can\u2019t say for sure , the battery probably dies since it had no charge for so long , or maybe it survives because it could keep the charge inside it going for long enough , this needs to be answered by a battery expert . My personal experience is that when I had my board exams a few years back , I didn\u2019t use my smartphone a lot and for general purposes used a keypad based feature phone for day to day usage , so it could be easily a month or two before I actually charged the device and powered it on , hence I can confirm it for that much of a time period that it still worked with no hassle . Hope this helps \u2026.. ",

It is not charged in between, and you have to charge it few hours before using. Similarly, if you keep phone off for few months , it will start working normally when you switch it on. ",

Some of the features are launches in new mobile and that's very useful and easy to operate year to year we got lot of the differences and new features. Ex: android started with 256mb ram then increased to 500mb then..1GB Now we have 6GB RAM smartphones in the market. Think yourself what's the differences,functions are changed. ",
