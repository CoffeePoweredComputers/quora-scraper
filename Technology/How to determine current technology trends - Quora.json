Apart from that I would suggest you to subscribe newsletters that will help you to understand what is happening in the industry. They provide a summary of all the relevant technology trends every week which will help you to update yourself with the current technologies. Most of the companies, websites and even freelancers provides their own newsletters which helps them to stay updated with their clients. Even Google has its own news letter \"Think with Google\"  Hope the answer was helpful. ",
