Your power settings are probably set for power saving when running on battery power. This is easy to change if you are on windows, just search for \u201cpower\u201d (I think, can\u2019t actually check right now) in the windows search bar and it should be among the first results. ",

            "answer_text": "Try checking your ram and or other components, electronics are sensitive to power fluctuations, I would get a surge protector to prevent any more damage in case it happens again. A power outage could potentially damage the PSU and Mother Board, It doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with you though. The Power Outage won\u2019t do a great deal in damage but the sudden surge could have affected your PC\u2019S ram and that might be why its slower then usual. ",
