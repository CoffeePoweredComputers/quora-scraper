            "answer_text": "Satellites orbit between 250 to 2000 miles above us . Geostationary and geosynchronous ones are much higher at 25,000 miles . They are seen usually when reflected by the Sun, so the lower satellites reflect up to three hours before sunrise or after sunset as they see the sun rise or set before or after we do. . Geo ones reflect the sun constantly as the sunlight pass over Earth easily to reach the highest ones but they are very tiny and very dim. They appear to be moving against the stars because of Earth rotation in synch to those geo high ones. when you are looking at the stars with a telescope, you will see those lower satellites zipping by and you can turn your telescope to follow them if you want to. They move pretty fast at around 5 to 8 or 9 kilometers a second! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The International Space Station is the easiest to see with unaided eye. The much smaller Chinese space station Tiangong-2 was also visible, before it was deorbited in July 2019. Iridium satellites where also famous for their \u201cflares\u201d when reflecting the Sun, but I don\u2019t know if there are any left. During 2019 SpaceX launched 60 Starlink satellites in a single launch on two occasions (Starlink is SpaceX\u2019s upcoming internet via satellite service). They were visible for at least a few days, while they were all together in a train like fashion. As they spread and gained altitude to reach their operating orbits, they stopped being visible to unaided eyes. Astronomers can still see them on their telescopes and have complained a lot. SpaceX is trying to make their next satellites less reflective. With a decent telescope, a lot more satellites can be easily seen. Including the geostationary ones, that appear more or less \u201cfixed\u201d in their positions. There are websites and phone apps that can tell you when the ISS or some other visible object is going to pass over you. I an app called ISS Detector on my phone. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. There are websites and apps for your computer that can help you find when dozens of satellites will be visible from your location when they pass overhead. I have seen from my city the International Space Station several times pass rapidly overhead (2 to six minutes, depending on how close to the zenith) exactly when predicted, using such software. Most other satellites are not as bright, but still visible if your patient and your sky is not light polluted. Before such computer helps, people would often see satellites when enjoying the dark sky with the naked eye, especially before dawn and after dusk, when the Sunlight would still be reflected off these objects high above the dark Earth below. Try it yourself and see! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Depending on the darkness of your night sky, you could see satellites every night. Recently, I was scanning the sky from fairly dark site and spotted with a pair of binoculars about a half dozen within a couple minutes. You can see brighter satellites with the naked eye, if you know when and where to look. The brightest would be the International Space Station. You may not think about it as a satellite but, technically, it is. A great site for satellite spotting is Heavens Above. There are also several satellite tracking apps. Heavens-Above ",

They are difficult or very hard to track or focus with telescopes because they move so fast. Telemetry is available here thanks to NOAA.

But yeah, space station aka ISS is visible. You can use a star locater app to track the position of station and see it with scope. But yeah, it revolves earth quite fast. So it's not gonna be easy to see it properly. Hope it helped! ",

It is most visible at dawn and dusk , provided you know where to look. It can be tracked conveniently by using ISS tracking apps available on Google playstore. Be warned however that sighting the ISS can become quite addictive. Smaller satellites can be observed through telescopes or binoculars. ",

One major difference between gazing a star and watching a satellite is that a satellite goes across the sky pretty quickly. More quickly than you would expect an aircraft going. ",
