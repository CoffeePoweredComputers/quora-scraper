            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re prepared to shop around, you can almost always save money on whatever you want to purchase. It\u2019s no different with electronics. If you want to find cheap tech, you should check out these eight sites. 1. TechBargains Sometimes, it\u2019s hard to know whether you\u2019re truly getting a good deal on something. There are just too many sites to check; you\u2019ll never know if you missed a lower price. If you\u2019re looking for the best deals on electronics, TechBargains is the answer. It scours hundreds of stores, discount outlets, and third-party retailers to offer you some of the cheapest deals you\u2019ll find. The computing section is extensive. The site offers laptops, desktops, printers, routers, and more. You will also find wearables, smart home gear, gaming consoles, and audio devices. Away from tech, the company does offer a few other smaller categories such as home and garden, but the deals aren\u2019t as eye-catching. For even better deals, sign up to the TechBargains\u2019 newsletter. 2. Slickdeals Slickdeals is a community-driven site. Although the site\u2019s homepage looks like any other online shop, all the deals you see have been submitted by members. To ensure quality, the rest of the community votes on the deals. Slickdeals also employs editors who curate specific lists of deals. Furthermore, to safeguard your security when shopping, Slickdeals will only show offers from sellers who have received positive feedback from previous buyers. The site\u2019s electronics products cover everything from video games and TVs to cameras and smartphones. Like TechBargains, there are also small sections dedicated to non-tech items such as clothes and cars. You\u2019ll see deals from several well-known retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Skyscanner, and Newegg. And if you end up buying from Amazon, remember that you can buy more than electronics. 3. Best Electronics Gadgets | Wholesale Store for Tech Gadgets Buy all type of wholesale electronic gadgets & accessories in UK from our online store eBigSale. Find cool, high tech electronic gadgets at cheap prices. 4. Newegg You can\u2019t write a list of the best sites for cheap electronics without discussing Newegg. The company has been in business for almost two decades. In that time, it has grown to become one of the web\u2019s top online shopping sites for saving money in any category. Its original focus was on computer hardware, but the site soon expanded into software and other electronics. Today, you can also buy power tools, sports equipment, and fashion items. Despite Newegg\u2019s expansion, it remains one of the best places to find cheap networking devices, computer components, and tech solutions for an office or workspace. Much like Amazon, Newegg sells products directly but also allows third-party sellers to distribute their wares via the marketplace. Newegg only protects purchases made in the marketplace up to a value of $1,000, so it might not be the place to make a large, big-ticket purchase. Newegg also offers a healthy dose of refurbished, opened, and discontinued items. They are available at even more significant discounts. 5. Micro Center Micro Center is the first cheap electronics website on the list stuck to its real purpose\u2014it only offers electronic items, nothing else. Of course, it also has physical stores around the United States. There are five broad categories on the site: Computers, Computer Parts, Networking, Software and Gaming, and Accessories. Each is packed with deals. Like Newegg, you can also use Micro Center to pick up great deals on refurbished devices and open box products. Almost every item on the site has a discount. Overnight shipping is available in the contiguous United States. Micro Center does not ship internationally. Note: You can save a lot of money by purchasing a refurbished iPhone. 6. Swappa Have you ever considered second-tech? If you\u2019re working on a tight budget, you can find big-ticket items like TVs, gaming consoles, and high-end smartphones for a lot less money if you\u2019re prepared to accept used devices. Swappa is home to some of the best second-hand deals. Like Micro Center, the site is exclusively focused on tech. You buy and sell directly with other users, cutting out the middleman. To ensure broken items aren\u2019t sold, Swappa has a robust listing approval process in place. Some of the deals on Swappa are unrivaled by the other sites on this list. You can pick up a Google Pixel 2 for less than $350, an Xbox One S for $200, and a 15-inch MacBook Pro for $450. Even used computer parts are very cheap. ",
