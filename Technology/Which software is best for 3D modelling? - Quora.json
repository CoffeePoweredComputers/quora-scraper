            "answer_text": "Many 3D modeling programs all have very similar tools, menus, and workflows. If you can model in one software package, then you can usually move those skills and ways of working to the other software packages. It really becomes an issue of learning each of the menus and where things are located in each software package. Each of them has different things that they do well, so it becomes an issue of what you need to create, then picking the right tool for the job. I have used 3DS Max, Cinema 4D, and Maya. I first learned in 3DS Max and have used that the most, but there are times when I used C4D and Maya depending on the task. For example, I like the texture tools in Cinema 4D, because it is easier to layer and add multiple materials to a single object, choosing where they go, how each one is mapped, etc. It just easier to manipulate. Also, I had a microphone that I needed to model for a project, and as much as I like 3DS Max, the object was easier to model in C4D because they had better tools for creating the wire mesh that is shaped around the outside of the mic. However, because of all the years of experience I had modeling in 3DS Max, I was able to move those skills over to C4D. If you want to know which one to learn, that is up to you. If you have a specific object that needs to be modeled, then perhaps I could make a recommendation based on that. Also, you will want to consider your overall workflow. What other software packages will be involved in finishing the project. Do you have a need to bring the 3D model into a compositing software to mix with other elements? 3DS Max works well with combustion, while After Effects supports importing the 3D model itself right from Cinema 4D. 3DS Max can import from Auto Cad since both are made by the same company, etc. Knowing more about the project will help me give you a better answer. I hope that is helpful. Let me know more about the project, and I will do my best to give you a more specific answer. ",

            "answer_text": "I prefer Solidworks the most because I can exactly control design parameters (i.e. dimensions) and I can build things in a parametric way. For example, lets say I have a 4 by 4 block and I want a hole right in the middle. The program will allow me to constrain the hole such that it will always be in the middle, even if I later change the size of the block. I also sometimes use Blender. Blender doesn\u2019t have this ability to add dimensions and constraints, but for what Blender is generally used for, this is ok. Blender is usually used for organic forms like characters. I mostly do engineering work and Solidworks is an engineering driven program. ",
