            "answer_text": "Wow, what a broad question! Maybe I\u2019ve been watching too much anime, but the way it\u2019s phrased makes me imagine Nook and Kindle as a pair of blushing Japanese schoolgirls competing furiously for the affection of senpai. When you get right down to it, Kindle and Nook are very similar formats with very similar capacities. They\u2019re both built on fairly early-generation ebook technologies\u2014the Kindle on Mobi, which Amazon bought, and Nook on the ePub format used by eReader and Fictionwise, which B&N bought. They\u2019re basically just bare-bones text with fancy headers and emphasis, and the ability to insert pictures here and there. You can even crack the DRM on both of them with equal ease, thanks to a certain plug-in for Calibre. (Not that I do that, because that would be illegal, but it\u2019s nice to know I could if I wanted to.) There\u2019s not a whole lot to prefer or not on the basis of the format itself. But overall, I prefer Kindle, for several reasons. First of all, look at the relative performance of the companies behind them. Amazon is an e-commerce powerhouse which has grown year over year, regardless of whether it was able to turn a profit or not. While prognosticating the future of powerhouses is always risky\u2014how many personal computers has IBM made lately?\u2014it doesn\u2019t seem likely that Amazon is in danger of going bankrupt any time soon. Barnes & Noble, on the other hand, has been hanging on by its fingernails for the last few years, and that\u2019s largely because of the Nook division dragging the rest of it down like an anchor. It\u2019s already started trimming the fat by backing out of the UK market altogether and outsourcing support duties to India. How much longer before the Nook fizzles out altogether, leaving customers unable to access the libraries they\u2019ve paid good money for? One consequence of this is there are a lot more devices that can read Kindle ebooks, including every e-ink reader Amazon\u2019s come out with for the last ten years, the Fire, and the applications for pretty much every OS platform. Nook has apps for multiple platforms, too, but not as well-supported, and it has a lot fewer devices. There\u2019s also the fact that Kindle ebooks have that Whispersync thing that lets them sync up with Audible audiobooks, which Amazon also owns. Not exactly one of the major reasons I prefer Amazon, but certainly a cherry on top of the sundae. Amazon has a lot better customer-service track record, too. So, all things considered, I\u2019ll buy my ebooks from there and give Barnes & Noble\u2019s Nook a miss. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely Nook, if we\u2019re talking about pure e-readers. (Disclaimer: I researched this like 4 years ago, so I\u2019m not sure how much it has changed since then. Also, I don\u2019t have a Kindle.) (Disclaimer 2: I\u2019m not affiliated with either Amazon or B&N. This is admittedly rather biased, but it\u2019s not advertising.) For me, it\u2019s kind of the same issue as iOS vs Android. Kindle is much more restrictive in every aspect, while Nook gives you a lot more freedom. Everything has to go through Amazon on Kindle, and the software is quite restricted. Sideloading is when you move ebooks from your computer to your device, rather than buying them from Amazon/Barnes and Noble. Project Gutenberg is a great resource with lots of public domain books. It looks like Kindle now supports sideloading, but they encourage you to buy from Amazon instead. Additionally, Kindle doesn\u2019t support .epub, my favorite ebook format. Nook supports many more formats, and you can just drag and drop (like any other device). This kind of issue comes up a lot: if you want to rely on Amazon for everything, Kindle is just fine. But if you want a bit more control, you\u2019ll want a Nook. Another big issue for me is software. Kindle is really restricted, while Nook is open. Nooks actually run a skinned version of Android (yes, even the e-readers). On the Nook Glowlight Plus, you can simply run a script to get full Android functionality. From there, you can install almost any apps you want (as .apk files). The old Nook Simple Touch attracted a strong developer community. They got the Google Play Store, \u201cfastmode\u201d (to optimize games for the e-reader screen), and even audio over USB working. One my new Nook, I just installed Moon Reader and Dropbox, then set it up to sync reading positions with my phone. It\u2019s been really nice to just read a few pages anywhere. You can easily use your Nook as a Nook. Barnes and Noble has an online ebook store as well. But I like playing around with things, and the Nook is what really got me started. None of this would ever be possible on the Kindle. They don\u2019t even let you change the screensaver! (It\u2019s drag and drop for the Nook.) So, again, it ultimately comes down to personal preference. If you plan on letting Amazon handle everything, you\u2019d be fine with the Kindle. But if you want more control of your device, you should go with Nook. ",

            "answer_text": "For a long time for me, it was a a bit of a toss-up. Kindle has access to more books, but I prefer the Nook hardware. I\u2019d read a book on either. It usually came down to the price of the book or which one I was already reading a series on. However, recently Nook upgraded their hardware to the Nook Glowlight 3. Now I find reading on the Nook to be superior. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the screen on my Paperwhite is excellent. However, I find myself reading much longer on the Nook when I have Night Node turned on than I do on my Paperwhite with just the white light. Night Mode is much easier on my eyes. The Nook Glowlight 3 also has a physical Home button and page turn buttons. None of the current line of Kindles has a physical home button. Only the top-of-the-line Oasis has page turn buttons. The Nook also supports more formats. With my Nook, I can also go to a Barnes & Noble store, get a cup of coffee or tea, and then spend up to an hour reading a book I don\u2019t own while relaxing. It is a great way to decide whether or not I want to buy the book. It\u2019s a wonderful perk. In terms of apps, it is Nook hands down. In the Kindle app you can no longer truly archive a book. All you can do is remove the contents of the book from your device (phone or tablet). The cover stays on the \u201cMy Library\u201d page. There is no getting rid of it, unless you complete delete it - which means if you want to read it again, you have to buy it again. Good luck scrolling through every Kindle book you have ever owned to find something you\u2019ve not read. The Nook app allows you to completely get rid of any trace of the book from your device. You don\u2019t have to keep scrolling past the cover of a book you\u2019ve long since read to get to one you haven\u2019t or click down a couple of levels because you don\u2019t remember if you took a break from a series at book 5 or at book 6. As I don\u2019t read much on my phone or tablet, this bothers me far more than it probably should. Having used both a Kindle Paperwhite and the Nook, for me it is now the Nook without a doubt. ",

I like the highlighting and notes and multiple shelves. I like Kindle Unlimited. I prefer to get everything from one supplier so as not to end up getting duplicates of my books. But more seriously I used to get ebooks from Fictionwise. They were taken over by B & N and immediately I started having problems. They sold me books they shouldn\u2019t have done because of territorial restrictions, and wouldn\u2019t refund my money. Eventually I had obviously complained too much and their customer services stopped even acknowledging my emails. Ever since then I have not trusted them. Now there is a lot of evidence that the company is in trouble and I have no confidence in its continued existence. Amazon is going nowhere but up, and I have always found their customer service to be excellent. ",
