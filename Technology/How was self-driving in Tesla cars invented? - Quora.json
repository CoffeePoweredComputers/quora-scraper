            "answer_text": "Much of the original technology was bought-in from Mobileye; the original Tesla autopilot was based on Mobileye EyeQ3 hardware. Tesla wrote software for it which was much more ambitious in terms of features offered and marketing language used than any other car manufacturer; other manufacturers also had adaptive cruise and lane-keeping assist, but they were less ambitious about what they tried to make it do and how they presented it. Tesla\u2019s autopilot was unique in being surrounded by marketing claims (and insinuations) that it allowed hands-free driving. As accidents started to happen, they rowed-back on their marketing claims and introduced safety features like attempting to detect that a hand is on the wheel at all times. They probably intended at one point to continue buying-in increasingly advanced Mobileye technology, but eventually fell out with Mobileye over risk appetite - ie selling as \u201cautopilot\u201d a technology Mobileye felt not yet safe or adequate for the task. They then started an in-house development of their own autopilot (\u201cAP2\u201d), which has continued to add features and capability. It still isn\u2019t \u201cself-driving\u201d, and despite Elon\u2019s claims is not likely to be in the near future. It\u2019s a basically a lane keep assist system with a lot of hyped-up marketing around it. ",

He may not have it working on all roads all over the world, but where I live California where these cars are abundant and tested most, I see It coming and see a lot of improvement from software update to software update.
