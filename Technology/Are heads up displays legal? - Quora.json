            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Are heads up displays legal? It depends on the type. If it\u2019s a physical unit that can obstruct other vision, usually only a dedicated GPS is permitted. If it\u2019s the projection type, which reflects back to you from the windshield (which usually only displays current speed and/or the occasional warning), it\u2019s very hard to police this type of unit, particularly if it\u2019s part of the car\u2019s design (meaning that it has passed all relevant rules for the area in which it is sold). As long as the information being presented is not potentially distracting (like full video), the objective of a HUD is to make it easier to access important information without having to take your eyes off the road. Some of these are also designed so that the focal point is further down the road rather than on the windscreen itself. Legal, or not, this is old technology that should have been in use as standard since the 1980s\u2014just like self-parking cars should have been on the market in the 1990s (moderately expensive at the time, but not impossible if spread across an entire range of vehicles). The problem often faced is that some of this tech is legal in one area, but not in another. A properly mounted projection HUD should be completely invisible to anyone outside the vehicle, just like a TV camera\u2019s autocue is invisible to the viewer. Because crossing a State line in any Country can change the rules dramatically, it is always wise to check local rules and those of any State through which you may be passing. In Australia, phones must be physically attached to the dash with a holder, and a driver is only allowed to press the answer button. Any further use (even as a GPS) requires moving out of traffic and initiating desired functions while completely parked. As far as I\u2019m aware, it\u2019s fairly uniform across all States of Australia. Although wide pillars and exceptionally flat mirrors make rear-view nearly impossible in my vehicle, I cannot have a reversing screen active while driving forward. Dash cam displays must not be active while driving. Making genuinely assistive tech illegal is just plain dumb, but that\u2019s idiocracy for you. ",

Most project data onto the windshield interior, so that the information is in the driver\u2019s line of sight as he or she looks through the windshield. A few cars have this a standard or optional equipment; there are some add-on devices that accomplish the same thing.  I could see that a HUD could obstruct a driver\u2019s view if the illumination was set too high, but all these displays I know about have adjustable brightness/dimness. ",

In the USA and the UK, for the most part, it\u2019s lawful until the law says different. The problem in the USA is that there are potentially 52 different jurisdictions to consider; in the UK, 31/2 (Scotland and Northern Ireland are different jurisdictions and Wales is on the way to becoming different). At the moment HUDs are lawful, although, if the police thought that a particular system was distracting, they could prosecute the driver for driving without due care and attention, hoping to set a precedent.
