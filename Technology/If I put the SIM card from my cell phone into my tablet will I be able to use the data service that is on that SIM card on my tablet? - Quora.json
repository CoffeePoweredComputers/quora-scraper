            "answer_text": "If it's an \"international\" tablet with a SIM slot, yes as the network carrier will think the tablet is a smartphone.. but for some idiotic and greedy reason, in the USA with network carriers like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc. the tablet will NOT work unless you pay extra for a tablet data plan add-on for tablets and you need to get a separate SIM card for it too. So it depends if it's a international model tablet (which also let's you make phonecalls.. the USA tablets does NOT have a phone calling feature and they removed).. if it's an international tablet then yes you can put your SIM card in and it'll work like a smartphone would. But if it's a USA tablet with a network carrier brand on it (like AT&T, T-Mobile, etc.) then it will not work and you'll see a message pop up saying you need a separate data plan for it. So I guess the cellphone carriers in the USA are more greedy and wants you we pay extra if you want to use a tablet on the go. If you can't insert your SIM on that tablet, a workaround is use mobile hotspot.. if your data plan has mobile hotspot, just enable hotspot on your phone so you could give WiFi access to that tablet.. I guess that's one easy solution. Next time if you get a tablet with a SIM slot, buy an international one which allows you to put your SIM in it and you can also make phonecalls on it.. the USA variant only works if you pay extra for the tablet data plan and you also need a separate SIM card for it. The USA cellphone carrier companies are greedy. ",

            "answer_text": "This depends on a few things: limitations placed on your plan by the carrier. Specifically, in the US, a lot of cell phone plans include limitations that they can only be used in a phone device (which keeps them from being used in a tablet or other data device)How the tablet reports itself to the network or how the default data configuration is on the tablet (this is less common on LTE networks though)The tablet being able to accept the SIM card (is it from another carrier, the wrong technology, or not compatible)if none of those limitations exist, or you have found a way around them, then it will work fine.
