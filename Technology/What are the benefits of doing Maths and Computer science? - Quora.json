            "answer_text": "If you mean financial benefit, not in my case.  I applied to work at SAS once.  They seemed quite underwhelmed by my double major.  But I have no regrets.  There is some commonality to the creaative problem solving involved in programming and writing proofs.  So perhaps it sharpened those skills in a general way.  The second major in Math(s) was more interesting to me than taking more electives to get a shallow knowledge of a variety of subjects.  I feel like one can easily achieve that by reading on one's own.  I graduated with 39 semester hours of Comp Sci, 36 of Math(s), 19 of Spanish out of a total of 124.  (30 is a major and 20 is a minor.)  Combining Comp Sci with Statistics, Genetics or Accounting might be more financially rewarding.  Also, I graduated in 1983, so my experience may no longer be very relevant. ",
