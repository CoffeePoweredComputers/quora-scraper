CNN BUSTED spreading huge Clinton lie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . MARCH 3, 2017 CNN\u2019s Don Lemon was just caught spreading another lie about failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton \u2014 and this whopper is TRULY unbelievable. Lemon \u2014 ranked in 2014 as one of the America\u2019s worst journalists by Columbia University \u2014 went on the attack against Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday evening. Lemon claimed Sessions needed to step aside immediately following the over-hyped media frenzy regarding two meetings Sessions had with a Russian ambassador while working as a senator. The controversial CNN anchor then incorrectly compared the situation to the investigation into Hillary\u2019s emails \u2014 and said that former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration handled things differently. \u201cLoretta Lynch recused herself from any decision regarding Hillary Clinton because of that meeting of Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch, who was attorney general at the time, on the tarmac,\u201d Lemon said during a discussion on Sessions. Lemon was referring to Bill Clinton\u2019s meeting, a secret discussion that caused a furious response from the right and demands for Lynch to resign. \u201cThe CNN panel, which included the network\u2019s chief political correspondent, Dana Bash, CNN executive editor Mark Preston and CNN contributor Margaret Hoover, nodded along at first, and they continued their discussion of the Sessions controversy,\u201d The Washington Examiner reported. But it wasn\u2019t true. Lynch refused to recuse herself from the investigation, either \u2013despite bipartisan pressure to do so. Lemon should know better\u2026 that was less than one year ago, in July 2016! You can see the exchange below \u2014 President Donald Trump had previously said that Lemon\u2019s nightly news show \u201cis almost exclusive anti-Trump\u201d and has repeatedly branded CNN as \u201cvery fake news.\u201d Eventually Bash did correct Lemon, who (predictably) failed to apologize or correct himself. But not before the damage was done, and more \u201cfake news\u201d was already spread. They just can\u2019t help themselves, can they? \u2014 The Horn editorial team  ",

            "answer_text": "I think you need to rephrase your question. You\u2019re not really taking about social media replacing main stream media. You\u2019re talking about social media acting as a distribution agent for main stream media. There is a big difference in scope between the two. That distribution switch could eventually happen and to an extent it already has. Just about every major media outlet has a Facebook and/or Twitter account and a web page. The web page is interactive for most of them. But a complete changeover will take a while because there are still a lot of people out there who can\u2019t afford an internet connection. There are also a lot of people who don\u2019t have smart phones, or tablets, or even desktops. And when it does happen I don\u2019t see any major media outlet giving complete control of access to someone else. They will keep their own web sites, etc. As far as replacing main stream media, the small paper I worked at had a daily circulation of about 50K with a Sunday circulation of about 85K and we had approximately 200 full time editors, reporters, photographers, and graphic artists in the newsroom. Then you had subscriptions to wire services and syndicated columns, etc. This is for one little local paper. Extrapolate the number of people you would need to cover the world like Facebook does. There is phenomenal overhead in a news gathering organization. I don\u2019t think that social media is quite ready for this challenge. ",
