            "answer_text": "Not yet. In my opinion, the best definition of the word \u201ccomputer\u201d is: A Machine for Following Rules.(And by \u201crules\u201d we mean: \u201cA computer program\u201d). Computers are far from \u201cintelligent\u201d - even software which we call \u201cAI\u201d (Artificial Intelligence) is not yet truly showing anything that we humans would call \u201cintelligence\u201d. No computer is as intelligent as a frog or a mouse\u2026certainly nowhere close to the intelligence of a dog or a cat. The present generation AI software is amazingly good at specialized tasks. You can \u201ctrain\u201d them to be far FAR better than a human at (say) playing the game of \u201cGo\u201d. But the computer that does that couldn\u2019t write a poem or hold a conversation with a human being. There has been a recent announcement of a computer \u201cAI\u201d that can hold a phone conversation with a human to book a table at a restaurant - but it\u2019s abilities would fall apart if the human at the other end of phone asked the computer whether Santa Claus is real or not. They are insanely good at small tasks - but truly awful at generalities. The idea of a \u201cGeneral Artificial Intelligence\u201d is still as far away as it was in the 1960\u2019s when researchers began thinking they could make that happen in 20 years. So, no - computers are not more \u201cgenerally\u201d intelligent than a mouse - possibly not even as intelligent as an insect. BUT if trained in some very narrow skill - they can be much more capable than a human - and that\u2019s the thing that should scare people. I could easily believe that a present-generation AI could be trained to become a lawyer - and be better at it than a human lawyer. I could easily believe that one could write songs that would be #1 hits. I could also believe that one could replace a Taxi driver and drive a taxi around a big city (this is already starting to happen). BUT I don\u2019t believe that the Taxi-driving robot will be able to tell you whether it\u2019s legal to buy and sell shares in a company for which you have insider knowledge - or to compose an opera for you as it drives. Will it ever happen that a computer is smarter than a human \u201cin general\u201d? I\u2019m not sure. The software technology is certainly heading that way - but the amount of computational power needed could be more than 100 large \u201cdata centers\u201d could provide - and the speed and size of computers are reaching the limits of physics. So I\u2019m not sure. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the problem with binary versus radial glial cells of most life forms. Sure you can program anything using if-then statements, aka binary machinery, but if you want to optimize and form a more graceful utility, then you could use our brain cells instead for more creative potential. Unfortunately they are not 100% accurate, far from it with a 20% error rate that varies with stress, sugar levels, water content, and a variety of other physiological factors. But of course if humans had a 100% efficiency, we\u2019d remember everything like re-living it, and be unable to focus on anything for long without getting trapped in our own perfect, flawless memory from an accuracy perspective. So there are unique reasons to have either. Every attribute provides a variety of factors that may be perceived as beneficial or detrimental depending on what your priorities are. Remember that. Now consider the many fluid forms of intelligence, from painting to social engineering to calculating to martial arts. Each of these require a unique form of intelligence, and these are only a few of virtually endless desirable traits. If you go for one, such as having higher attention to detail for social cue detection, you also might end up stressing them out in social situations because they are so attentive, giving them social anxiety as an unintended result. That is why many people who are looking for their own talents search the things that irk them, or really capture their attention. Likely it is being hijacked by other functions because it is such a powerful area, but has not been properly trained and focused to its full potential yet. Eventually, if you really wanted to, you could try and design any type of thinking system based on binary silicon, organic glial cells, or whatever you want. Neither last very long, with silicon chips easily losing their ability to function when exposed to water, a bit of static, or anything really. At least it\u2019s better than storing information on paper that disintegrates at the slightest hint of weather, drinks or daily life. As for your question, it\u2019s a bit fallacious to compare complex things as if they were static and measurable numbers, which they are quite not. But for most standard human cases, humans would be far \u201csmarter\u201d than a single device. But if we judge by comparing the internet to any human, obviously the internet is far more knowledgeable about any given topic. So to properly answer your question, how do you define intelligence? The most common definition is ability to learn, which is currently more well known as a human hobby. The prediction is this will instantaneously outpace human learning, but the idea is to make humans more intelligent using genetics, hopefully before this happens so we can grow in unison and become ever closer to omniscience together. As it currently stands, humans are surprisingly ignorant of anything related to editing biology, but will willingly carve entirely new constructs out of rock and metal and slowly train them into sentience over the next few decades without many qualms.

            "answer_text": "Q: How is it possible for a computer to be more intelligent than the human who made it?  A: Your question has been with us since the early days of adding machines. IN THEORY the answer is: The same way some machines that we humans have built can lift loads many orders of magnitude heavier than a single human ever could. The same way our machines travel orders of magnitude faster than a human could ever run. The same way our machines fly. Today they fly greater distances in hours than a human could walk or run in a year. Our \u201cthinking machines\u201d are already better at remembering things and comparing things and doing very very complex math. Our computers can make hours long moving pictures like the Toy Story series. IN PRACTICE: we are not ready to give computers final say in things like Judge, Jury, Chief Executive, Medical Doctor, \u2014 or Taxi Driver. We want them take those jobs very badly, so that day is surely coming. BECAUSE We humans already know we are very very bad at making decisions: Fashion, Elections, Legislation... Some people even root for The Cubs and buy Fiat/Chrysler products <grin>. BESIDES: making important decisions is REAL work. We are eager to give those \u201cintelligent\u201d jobs to computers. So eager that we already give life-or-death jobs to computers who are not close to ready. Think of the 737-MAX. Think of the fatalities when Tesla owners think they can take a nap at 85 mph while the car drives itself! Crunch. Tip of the iceberg. The day will soon come when our devices are truly smarter than we are in the write-a-book sense. That intelligence will grow according to Moore's Law, doubling about every two years. A better question to ask might be \u201cwhat then?\u201d  Yet another episode in The Terminator movie franchise hits theaters today. DVD in 90 - 120 days. You should see \u201cDark Fate\u201d for further insight into your own question. No you won\u2019t get answers, but if you pay attention you\u2019ll get a lot of new questions. At what point will an artificial intelligence decide that humans are an infestation on this planet and decide to cull the herd, or put our species into extinction? That\u2019s the premise of Terminator movies and countless others. We will continue to speculate. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s sort of a neutral question ; I mean it doesn\u2019t have a certain answer! One theory could be , Computers were made to change our life or at least making our life easier, but the question is BY WHO? Course by people, smart ones. assembling a computer undoubtedly is a very difficult process, what I mean is making a computer needs a very high level of intelligence. Apple wouldn't be apple without Wozniak & Jobs ; the creators. so in this theory we can conclude people has to be smart enough to identify our needs in order to make computers. But I\u2019m talking about 80s, in my opinion in those days, computers couldn't be smarter than the people who were the makers , how come? Pretend it\u2019s 1980, computers are not that pervasive! people are forced to do their daily tasks without any computer, accountants do their high level computation on their own, by writing down all the numbers in a piece of paper and calculate them. Computer makers are still thinking about some features that we( humans) can do, but computers can not! So in this level we are sort of a smarter. Time passes, technology is increasing and everyone feel they need a computer to do their obligations. Some, can not start their daily job without turning on their computers to compute the numbers, remind them what to do, \u2026 ( There are just some easy examples of our usage with computers nowadays) So each year computer makers add some fancy features that thinking about them is going to blow your mind! like calculate \u201c2929849284*2138302133 \u201c If we take a look at 70/80s, I\u2019m not aware of those years cuz I wasn't born but I am pretty sure, computers which could calculate these kinda phrases were too expensive or at least scarce, but now with just putting those numbers in your Laptop/Phone\u2019s Calculator, within a second it\u2019s gonna give you the right answer. So for this theory, I can say YES , computers are way much smarter than the ones who make them. ",

The rule on short term human memory allows you to remember only a pitiful 7 numbers, plus or minus 2. (5 to 9 numbers). Pretty much every computer ever built can beat you on this task. So can an even less intelligent device such as a pad of paper and a pencil or a clay tablet and a stick. Any such device can record the numbers without the fading problem that our memories have. And then there are tasks such as mathematical operations. Adding numbers isn\u2019t very difficult; we\u2019ve had devices to assist in adding for thousands of years, such as the Chinese Abacus. When we translated these operations into electric circuits, each improvement made them faster and more reliable, so once again, our ability to add and perform other mathematical operations is eclipsed by computers. Under normal circumstances, computers will always be faster and more reliable than our far slower biological brains for most tasks, so the only remaining question is what tasks can computers accomplish? And that list grows every day, because the cumulative effort of millions of people is poured into computer programs creating for instance Amazon\u2019s AI system Alexa. Millions of person hours of programming, and many millions of hours interacting with people, and instant electronic access to billions of pieces of information floating around on the internet make Alexa better able to answer most questions (in a wide variety of languages) than most humans, and that gap is increasing every day. It\u2019s simple math: If you\u2019re learning 10 things per day but forgetting 5, while Alexa is learning a million things per day, how could you ever expect to compare? ",

            "answer_text": "First, intelligence is vaguely defined term because we have limited understanding of it. So, we can't really build a more intelligent computer. Second, there are several aspects of intelligence. e.g. Logic, reasoning, learning, creativity, emotional understanding etc. In some aspects, computers beat the hell out of humans and in others, they are nowhere near humans. Examples: For those aspects of intelligence which require consciousness (Emotional Intelligence, Self-awareness, Some form of Reasoning etc), the computer is simply zero. IBM Watson can simulate Self-awareness, for example, but it can never really possess it. Even animals are better in this aspect.In case of Creativity (creating something new like idea, theory, invention, painting, joke etc) and Imagination (creating something random without input), computers aren't entirely zero (Google AI creates its own \u2018child\u2019 bot), but they are nowhere near close to humans.In case of Learning, Understanding, Planning, Ad-hoc Problem Solving, computers are catching up fast. Machines are learning now. Modern Artificial Intelligence systems now help big businesses in planning. And, you already know about Self-driving Cars. Yes, it's not that perfect, but it's catching up fast.In case of Logic, no-conscious Reasoning and generic Problem Solving, computers can crush humans by large margins. For example, no human has beaten a top computer in Chess since 2005 and anyone can lose calculation game with a smartphone calculator. It's classic. It doesn't require complex computational models. It just require fast hardware.",

If you measure intelligence by how fast a computer can do maths compared to me with a notepad, then our microwave is more intelligent than me. My mobile phone would be much, much smarter than I am - using that measure. But intelligence is generally far more complex than that, and includes aspects such as self-awareness, empathy, the ability to triangulate (imagine something from another person\u2019s perspective), kindness for no reason, impulsivity, mental flexibility, creativity, the ability to think outside the proverbial box, to adapt on the fly, to have a \u201cgut feeling\u201d or intuition about something or someone, and so on and so on\u2026 Although I\u2019m following the area of artificial intelligence with great interest, the thing is that it remains \u201cartificial\u201d.

Various models for AIs demonstrate that it is possible for a computer program to develop behaviors and methodologies they haven't explicitly been programmed for. Therefore, if we could devise a model to reproduce general intelligence within a computer (which we have every reason to believe it's practically achievable) we would expect that said intelligence would be able to exceed the capacity of its creator. Indeed, once you factor in the inherent advantages an AI would enjoy when it comes to processing speed, data access, and long term storage options it's pretty much a given that it would vastly exceed human norms almost immediately after achieving parity with us. That said this is all hypothetical. The knowledge we have concerning how to construct an AI is extremely basic, and major breakthroughs are few and far between. There's no way that the current models we're working with could be used to create an AGI on their own. And there isn't any kind of roadmap concerning what we'd need to develop to get there. ",
