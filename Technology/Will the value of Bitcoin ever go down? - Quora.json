            "answer_text": "Like with traditional markets, there are no guarantees when it comes to future price predictions for the Bitcoin market. Some have predicted that Bitcoin will break the $1 million mark, including John McAfee (McAfee Associates), CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer and Bobby Lee (CEO BTCC Exchange). Others are sticking to more modest, but still relevantly high price predictions, including ex-JP Morgan chief U.S. equity strategist and current managing partner at Fundstrat, Tom Lee, who predicted a price of $25,000 by the end of 2018 and $125,000 by 2022. Robert Sluymer, also from Fundstrat, put Bitcoin at not much higher than $7,000. Llew Claasen, executive director at Bitcoin Foundation, said Bitcoin will hit $40,000 during 2018. On the other side of the scale, you have partial to complete market collapse predictions. Boutique investment bank GP Bullhound predicts a 90 percent market crash within the year, while Harvard professor and ex-IMF chief Kenneth Rogoff predicted that Bitcoin will shrink to $100. Roy Sebag, CEO of GoldMoney Inc., said Bitcoin will be worth $0 in the future. It is quite clear that cryptocurrency price predictions should be taken with a grain of salt, but there are factors to look out for that will almost certainly have a bearing on the future price of Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market. This includes: The level and nature of regulations imposed in dominating cryptocurrency marketsThe level of cryptocurrency adoption in the coming year and beyondThe level of growth in the cryptocurrency futures marketThe utility of tokens and the ability of the underlying technology to solve real-world problemsI personally think that Bitcoin will further go down the slide this year as it is quite clear that people around the world are reluctant to invest in it due to lack of utility. For this matter, there have been introduction of hybrid coins in the past as an upgrade of cryptocurrency, which are aimed at solving the issue of utility as well as stability. One such coin is SGC (Secured Gold Coin) which is backed by 60 percent gold and 40 percent utility. The gold backing makes SGC stable and more of an everyday use card since it's also integrated in the MasterCard. From a usability point of view, I would rather choose hybrid coins over coins like Bitcoin because the past year and even this year has not been a good story for these coins, specifically Bitcoin. ",

            "answer_text": "Bitcoin is up and down all the time, so yeah It\u2019s inevitable. I personally don\u2019t think it will go below $500 ever again, unless in some tragic event which harms or kills the bitcoin network. Possible causes for a price decline in Bitcoin: Bitcoin gets left abandoned by developers. This isn't as much of a risk as it was in the early days.One entity contributes a majority hashrate (AKA, a 51% attack). This is almost unfeasable today, not only that but it would be unprofitable to even try. However if achieved would give the attacker an opportunity to double spend their Bitcoins. Possibly causing many people to lose trust in the network. GHash.IO Bitcoin Mining (A mining consortium) came close to 50% but since has promised to cap it at 40%.The percentage of people who use Bitcoin for illegal purposes drops, as newer, more private cryptos are adopted (Monero, ZCash etc). I'm not sure on the current percentage so it\u2019s hard to tell how significant the effect of this would be.Sudden increase or decrease in hashrate freezes the network until the next difficulty retarget (2 weeks), probably causing many people to jump to better coins.Reasons for price to increase: There\u2019s a huge amount of mainstream investment market to tap into, Precious metal investors, stock traders, etc. Who don\u2019t yet understand the intrinstic value of bitcoin.The block reward will halve in 2020, as it did last year, this means Bitcoin miners get half the reward they did before, naturally this pushes the price up.Bitcoin is the grandfather of all crypto currencies, so it's hard for me to believe it will ever die. Imagine if bitcoin took just 10% of the market cap of gold. If gold has a market cap of $7 Trillion, 10% would be $700 billion. 700 bln / 21 mln total supply = $33,333 per BTC.The supply of BTC is capped at 21 Million, so it will get more and more scarce as people start using it.",
