            "answer_text": "What is BitMex? BitMex is a crypto trading platform, where investors from all over the globe post orders based on long/short positions. The company called HDR Global Trading Limited, registered in the Republic of Seychelles, owns the web exchange. The three co-founders are coming from US soil, thus many might put questions about why the company opened its operations outside of the North American continent. The answer is obvious, as income taxes and anti-laundry laws are a lot more flexible in Seychelles. Does it mean that exchange is a scam-in-waiting? Up to this point, definitely not but one should never let his guard down in the end. Thus, the company does not follow KYC/AML laws nor does it hold any sort of certifications. Verification could be required upon the request from the support unit of the business but in most cases, users do not need to verify their identity details. The exchange is available on the web only, while mobile platforms are not available as of yet. The service is globally available as the crypto trading tools and accepts BTCs as the only currency of trade. http://www.cryptocoinzone.com/trading-bitcoin/ ",

Crypto products and trade have not been regulated, so this market is extremely volatility. Prices can be raised or drowned in a very sudden way. Therefore, it contains a very high risk! While creating a contract, I recommend keeping the leverage between x6 and x10 maximum. During this time, please do not forget to check the liquidation price.Do not forget to setup stop-loss on your contracts. If you do not setup the stop-loss, If the price will reach to liquidation price, you will lost all the your money.Those who want to join a new one, definitely start with BitMex Testnet.If you still don't have a Bitmex account, you can register.
