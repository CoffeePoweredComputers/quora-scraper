            "answer_text": "I would suggest the following -   look at @Arduino - Home to start with. Have a look at some sample projects created with Arduino (@Arduino Playground - ArduinoUsers). It would give an idea on how such boards like Arduino, sensors and actuators be integrated to make real things.Get your hands on one of these boards, bread board, some connectors and any sensors you may find. You get decent starter kits these days with well explained starting projects. See @Arduino - ArduinoStarterKitStart from the easy stuff and try out a few things. I am sure you can take it from there.",
