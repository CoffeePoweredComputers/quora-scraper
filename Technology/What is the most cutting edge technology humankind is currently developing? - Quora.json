            "answer_text": "National Ignition Facility The National Ignition Facility, or NIF, is a large, laser-based inertial confinement fusion (ICF) research device located at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, USA. NIF uses powerful lasers to heat and compress a small amount of hydrogen fuel to the point where nuclear fusion reactions take place. NIF is the largest and most energetic ICF device built to date, achieving a record 1.875 million joule pulse of ultraviolet laser light to the target chamber on March 15, 2012. This record shot is an important milestone in NIF\u2019s mission to reach the long-sought goal of fusion ignition, the point at which a nuclear fusion reaction becomes self-sustaining.  Another amazing technology we currently use worldwide is a PET-CT. Positron emission tomography - computed tomography (better known by its acronym PET-CT or PET/CT) is a medical imaging technique using a device which combines in a single gantry system both a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and an x-ray Computed Tomography, so that images acquired from both devices can be taken sequentially, in the same session from the patient and combined into a single superposed (co-registered) image. Thus, functional imaging obtained by PET, which depicts the spatial distribution of metabolic or biochemical activity in the body can be more precisely aligned or correlated with anatomic imaging obtained by CT scanning. Two- and three-dimensional image reconstruction may be rendered as a function of a common software and control system. Although this has been around for a decade it still seems like science fiction to think we are literally using Antimatter (positrons) to help diagnose and treat conditions. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll go with personalized medicine, especially molecularly determined prescriptions.  The idea is to construct an array of diagnostic molecules (DNA fragments, peptides, ...) on a chip, then wash some extract of your blood (or tissue from a disease site) over the chip.  Different diagnostic molecules on the chip will later be illuminated by a laser scan, depending on the details of your DNA, your disease, etc.  The results can be used to determine your personal treatment. This is already a pretty well-developed fieldhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_chipMy favorite application was in identifying how strongly a patient would respond to a particular cancer drug, instead of experimenting with different levels, some of which might do too little and some of which might have unnecessarily severe side effects. I'm not in the field but I think the biggest need is for cheaper production of the array chips.  I know that new technologies are being explored.  I represented an academic group's grant application about this time last year. ",
