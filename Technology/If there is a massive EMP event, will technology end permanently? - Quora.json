            "answer_text": "Question: If there is a massive EMP event, will technology end permanently? No, technology will not \u201cend\u201d due to either a manmade EMP event or a coronal mass ejection (A giant solar flare). Why? The ability to generate electricity will still be possible after an EMP - EMPs will do nothing to prevent batteries from working, many systems are electromechanical which mean that they have mechanical components which will still function after the event and many electrical and electronic components will remain unaffected which means that they can be brought online quickly.Mankind\u2019s ability to channel electricity for use is mature technology - Man has been able to harness electricity for use since the early 19th century. During the 20th, mankind developed the technology to point where he could light cities, run factories and even transmit electrical power over hundreds or thousands of miles. An EMP would do nothing to change that fact and it would only be a relatively short period of time before power was restored.There are MILLIONS of people in the United States alone who have enough knowledge of electricity and how it functions to make it relatively easy to restart the power grid - There electricians, electrical engineers, electronic technicians, even maintenance mechanics and handymen who work with electricity daily and would be ready and willing to get the power grid as soon as possible. Throughput the world there are tens of millions more with the same abilities or greater.There are vast libraries of material on how electricity works, how to harness it and how to troubleshoot problems with it - An EMP is going to do nothing to change that and those libraries are still going to have their materials available. With hours to days, people will obtain those materials and use them to restart the power grid.So no, questioner, technology will not end permanently. In most cases, the power grids in major nations will \u201conly\u201d be down for days or weeks, not forever. ",

            "answer_text": "This car is EMP proof:  No, it has nothing special. It was just a simple normal civilian run-off-the-mill Toyota Hilux N30 made between 1978 and 1983. The only reason it's EMP proof is because it has no critical electronics to be disabled and fried by an EMP. This is true to many other technology that is not reliant on electronics as well. Like this one:  Or this:  See, electronics are recent inventions, and while they are so ubiquitous now, it wasn\u2019t so 30\u201340 years ago. Any technologies back then with no electronics can survive EMP just fine. Even recent technologies can survive EMP with appropriate shielding such as hardened military electronics or underground bunkers containing them. So while EMP can be devastating to infrastructure and economy, even destroying large amount of scientific data, it won\u2019t knock us back to stone age. Be prepared though, because no matter what kind of technology they have, human are inventive, sometimes destructively so. ",
