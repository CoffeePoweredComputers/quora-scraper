            "answer_text": "The Greatest Battle That (N)ever Was! The Cosmic Forces of the DC Universe vs the Marvel Universe's Abstract Entities.  My standard disclaimer: Comparing characters from different universe in ridiculous battles to see who is more powerful is both unfulfilling and juvenile. Neither company would allow theirs to be defeated (unless it enriched their bottom line in some fashion.) With that said: THE TALE OF THE TAPE In this corner: The DC Universe  \u200bCharacters who are the stuff of legends, superheroes whose existence forever DEFINED what superheroes were supposed to look like: Legendary beings who have over the course of their Universe's written existence, threatened it almost as often as they saved it,The home of the most complexly-woven collection of stories, with the greatest number of participants, writers, artists, and editors;Composed of legions of superheroes, from various companies, over numerous decades, bound together from the Golden Age of Comics forwardto be ever assembled in the written history of the world, until today, these are the legendary, the incomparable, the Gods, Monsters and Guardians of the DC Universe!In this corner: The Marvel Universe  \u200bFrom superheroes who were men granted the power of gods, men with feet of clay and whose heroes weren't much better at least half the time, Created by the House of Ideas in the sixties, spearheaded by two legendary mad geniuses, to the House of Mouse, a titan of cinematic industry in the 2000s to whom these heroes can claim a part of,A collection of mysterious entities who underlie the very fabric of their Universe, each master of their particular domain but always willing to do the unthinkable to gain new cosmic real estate,The Wielders of the Power Cosmic, masters of the fundamental forces, lords of all they surveyed at every level of the universe known to their uncanny perceptions, let's welcome the Cosmic and Conceptual Entities of the Marvel Universe!Gonna set some ground rules here: There will be few known superheroes in this particular struggle. Why? Because they are simply too small to matter when you are talking about including EVERY cosmic power from both groups.I am not going to bring EVERY cosmic entity ever printed in either group. Instead, I am bringing the biggest of the big, the heaviest of the heavy.If an entity made this list, they are considered one of the most powerful entities to have ever existed in comic literature.We included the Presence (DC) and the One-Above-All (Marvel) only for completenessWe are also going to assume that each Universe's, completely omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent self is indeed the same entity and they shall both sit out this rumble, drinking Gin and Tonics watch the multi-dimensional, trans-temporal, celestial-membrane occluding fireworks show.THE DC LINE-UP  \u200bThe Presence: Yes, the main Man/Dog/Woman/Noodlely-appendaged One, the ultimate arbiter of the DC Universe has never truly been explained, dealt with or even fully acknowledged. Sometimes its equated as just another deity (especially where the Greek and other Earth deities are concerned) but other times it is expressed as the Ultimate Power in the Multi-Omniverse... The Presence in the DC Universe has taken numerous forms throughout history, including: The Voice - The disembodied Voice of God that spoke to and empowered Jim Corrigan as the Spectre. This is the most \"active\" version of God seen, to the point that it even answers the Spectre's prayers by resurrecting the murdered Justice Society. When The Voice uttered the first word, it created The Word, and it was already being traced by Destiny in his book.The Hand - The appearance of a hand coming out of a nebula was sighted at the moment of universal creation. This is the presence that the rogue Guardian Krona saw when he went back to the beginning of time. The hand was seen again by Swamp Thing, Deadman, and the Phantom Stranger when Heaven was threatened by a Great Darkness.The Source - The universal spirit venerated by the New Gods, which resides beyond the Source Wall. It is thought of as the intelligence aspect of the Presence's infinite scope. (See more below...)The Presence - The unseen entity who commands the allegiance of the host of angels, including Zauriel.Omnipotent, Omnipresent, Omniscient, it/they already know the outcome of this battle and are simply enjoying a drink with itself... THE BIG GUNS The Archangels of the Celestial Host  Representing the Prime Creator of the Universe/Multiverse: who won't participate because s/he doesn't need to. The Demiugic Archangels: Gabriel Hornblower, Lucifer Morningstar, Michael Demiurgos, with the Spectre coming in a distant FOURTH. There are other archangels but they get limited play in most of the written works of the DC Universe. Besides, these three are all that are needed. They are the most powerful angels in the Heavenly Host by a wide margin.For them, reality is whatever they deem it to be. As agents of the Presence in the DC Universe, very little is beyond their ability: shattering reality, making new dimensions, creating parallel realms and destroying them just as easily. In most mythologies they would be considered gods themselves. These beings are cosmic forces of nature wearing the appearance of people.Their weapons are also incredibly powerful capable of altering reality itself. Michael's Sword for example, can cut literally anything, including otherwise intangible objects and people, other energies and forces, even dimensional fabric of space time between two locations.Their greatest limitation is the need for direction from the Presence or God who seems to take very little direct interest or interaction in the DC Universe. As such, they don't tend to do much any more. Lucifer appears to be the most motivated of the lot.The Monitors: Perfect Example of Big Government  \u200bThe Monitors: Cosmic guardians of the Multiverse, the Monitors have/will/did protect all of the OverVoid, the backdrop of the Multiverse, where reality is nothing more than a story being told to itself. They are based on The Monitor, a character created by comic book writer Marv Wolfmanand comic artist George P\u00e9rez as one of the main characters of DC Comics' Crisis on Infinite Earths limited series. \u200bThey are a group that watches all aspects of the Multiverse, past and present. Most importantly, they seek to prevent crossovers between the universes, as was common before \"The Crisis.\" The Monitors first appeared in Brave New World.A rogue Monitor called the Anti-Monitor brought about the end of the DC Multiverse back in 1986 and was the first appearance of the cosmic entities. Just one of the creatures fought against multiple superheroes from all of the realities and was barely able to be defeated, but not before he had collapsed all of reality into a single Universe, altering the DC continuity, forever. \u200bGrant Morrison tried to explain what the Monitors were to the DC reality and they appear to be meta-conceptual beings capable of seeing the DC Multiverse from THE OUTSIDE, looking in. What happens if the page is a bit pissed off at the story that's drawn on it? So I thought of the page as God. The idea being that the Overvoid \u2013 as we called it in Final Crisis - of the white page as a space is sort of God. And it's condensing stories out of itself because it finds inside its own gigantic white space, self-absorbed pristine consciousness, it finds this little stain or mark, this DC Multiverse somebody has 'drawn'. And it starts investigating, and it's just shocked with what it sees, with all the crazy activity and signifying going on in there. It then tries to protect itself from the seething contact with 'story' and imagines a race of beings, 'angels' or 'monitors' (another word for angel, of course) to function as an interface between its own giant eternal magnificence and this tiny, weird crawling anthill of life and significance that is the DC Multiverse. \u2014 Grant Morrison, Interviewed on IGN.[5] Superguardian to the Multiverse: Cosmic Armored Superman  \u200b\u200bCosmic Armored Superman was designed to protect the Overvoid, the Omniverse outside the Multiverse, from any of the pesky stories escaping and rendering havoc beyond the Overvoid (is that even possible?) Cosmic Armored Superman: The guardian robot of the Omniverse is a being unlike any other. Meta-meta-conceptually aware of the DC Universe, Cosmic Armored Superman is: A being whose powers are so great he is able to protect the Overvoid, the Omniverse outside of the Multiverse from threats which could potentially erase the Multiverse or sub-universes within it.From where he sits, the Multiverse is nothing but a story being told that he is able to edit at will.At his command are powers similar to the 5th Dimensional Imps with the added omniscience needed to see EVERYTHING, EVERYWHERE, as needed and then correct any difficulties by whatever means necessary. Completely rewriting of a universe existence is possible.It is presumed he has the power to correct even the alterations made by the 5th Dimensional Imps since his power sits outside of the Overvoid, where all things exist including them and his power would presumably be able to correct any major foul up created by them but only when necessary.Most of the manipulations made by the Imps tend to revert on their own, possibly a safeguard to prevent having visitations from Cosmic Armored Superman... \u200bCosmic Armored Superman was supposedly destroyed but since it was in the Overvoid, it means this conceptual being is technically still available because he too, is nothing more than a concept capable of being revived if someone deemed it the need great enough. He is the embodiment of good in the Universe, the ultimate retcon until the Overvoid is satisfied with the ending. The Overvoid demands a happy ending.THE STRANGE The Endless: A dysfunctional family living under your universe  \u200b\u200bThe Endless (Destiny, Death, Dream, Destruction, Despair, Desire and Delirium) are a group of beings who embody powerful forces or aspects of the universe in the DC comic book series The Sandman, by Neil Gaiman. They have existed since the dawn of time and are thought to be among the most powerful beings in the universe. They are distinct from and supposedly more powerful than most gods. Dream is the main protagonist of the series, but all of the Endless play major roles They cannot be created or destroyed, though Destiny indicates when all is said and done, he would close the door on the Universe. For the most part, the Endless don't have to DO anything, they are the warp and weft of the Universe itself.If there are people anywhere, they are part of the Endless, like it or not. Destiny, Death, Destruction, Delight/Delirium, Despair, Dream, Desire. Think Infinity Gems with personality.If they ARE able to be killed, they simply reform with a new body and resume their previous role in the Universe at large.\"The Endless are merely patterns. The Endless are ideas. The Endless are wave functions. The Endless are repeating motifs. The Endless are echoes of darkness, and nothing more... And even our existences are brief and bounded. None of us will last longer than this version of the Universe.\" Doctor Manhattan: Fractured Psyche, Cosmic Aware-Ness  \u200b\u200bDoctor Manhattan: Dr. Jonathan \"Jon\" Osterman is a physicist who was transformed into a blue-skinned, radiated powerful being after he was disintegrated in an Intrinsic Field Subtractor in 1959. He had returned to the chamber to retrieve his girlfriend's watch (which he had repaired), and was accidentally locked inside when the Subtractor started automatically.Jon was blown into atoms, with nothing left of his body. Within a few months, his disembodied consciousness managed to reconstruct a physical body for itself, after several hideous partial reconstructions.Following his reanimation, he is immediately pressed into service by the United States government, which gives him the name Doctor Manhattan, after the Manhattan Project.He is shown to be immensely powerful and seemingly invulnerable to all harm; even when his body is disintegrated, he can reconstruct it from atoms (in less than a minute the second time this happened).Jon has complete awareness of and control over atomic and subatomic particles. He can alter his body's size, coloration, density, and strength. He does not need food, water, or air, and is, for all intents and purposes, immortal. He can teleport himself and others over great (even interplanetary and perhaps interstellar) distances.In addition to these powers: Jon is able to phase any part of his body through solid objects without damaging them,produce multiple copies of himself which function independently of each other,project destructive energy, disintegrate people (possibly by removing their intrinsic fields, which causes the target to come apart explosively), create force fields, transmute and create matter, move objects without physically touching them (telekinesis), and reverse entropy, he can create life and walk on the surface of the sun.Due to his non-linear perception of time, he sees the past, present and future simultaneously, although he doesn't claim omniscience.The Lords of Order and Chaos: The First Cosmic Meddlers  \u200b\u200bLords of Order and Chaos: The most famous and powerful operative of the Lords of Order is the being known as Dr. Fate. Dr. Fate's origins begin over 10 billion years ago. Here, not long after the formation of the universe were born two elemental forces \u2014 the Lords of Order and Lords of Chaos, came into being at the beginning of the universe's struggle for supremacy.On the world called Cilia, the Lords of Order manifested themselves as the first sentient race in the universe, a race of incorporeal magical beings. After millennia, circa 3500 BCE, one of the Lords of Order, descended to Earth from Cilia and became Nabu the Wise, an adviser to the pharaohs of ancient Egypt.The Lords of Order and Chaos are some of the first beings of the Universe and their power is almost without equal. Their greatest weakness is the personal squabbles between them keeping the Universe from either of their agendas.THE ANNOYING and INEXHAUSTIBLE 5th Dimensional Imps: Like an STD, no one admits to having one.  \u200bThe 5th Dimensional Imps: menaces to all of normal space-time, their powers are beyond description because they can alter reality from outside of it. They are not bound by any rules or energies from the 3rd Dimension, thus they are the most frightening members of our Cosmic Lineup. For them reality is nothing more than a piece of paper to be wadded up and thrown away, if that is their whim. They limit their powers to allow others to feel as if they matter. They interact with people because it gives them something to do. They were generally meddlesome and being all powerful was boring to them, so they usually handicapped the interaction in some way to make it more interesting to them.In Mr. Mxyztplk's case, he would torment Superman until the Man of Steel could make him say his name backward. Then he would retreat back to the 5th Dimension for 90 days.Bat-Mite's admiration for Batman was so great, he would come to follow his idol on missions, often getting in the way with his admiration by increasing the threat level on missions forcing Batman to be more inventive to escape. Trust crafty Batman to turn the little menace to his use from time to time.Yz the Thunderbolt actually worked for the good guys as a partial member of the Justice Society. His handicap? He could only do what he was told. Literally. His first handler Johnny Thunder wasn't the brightest light in the box but he meant well. Later handlers put him to better use but his literalness meant he could be as much a hazard as a help.The Source: Power-plant to the Multiverse  \u200b\u200bThe Source: The primal, underlying power of the DC Universe, it has never been personified, likely because it is the superstructure of the Universe. Housed and imprisoned within the Source Wall are the Promethean Giants. Massive beings who existed before the rise of the New Gods. In their hubris, they sought to breach the Source wall and become one with the Source.For their transgressions, they were imprisoned by the Source in the Promethean galaxy, chained to massive celestial bodies, which served as their own machines for breaching the Source.These creatures must defend the Source from attack and their powers dwarf even the incredible cosmic might of the New Gods. They may be some of the mightiest beings in the DC Universe.It is hinted that all metahuman abilities are derived from an interaction at some fundamental level with The Source.Through the Source, all things are possible. The only active, known manipulators of the Source are the New Gods - Highfather is the primary representative of the Source.The New Gods derive their powers from the Source using the Mother Box and the cosmic entities Takion and Superman Prime are the only other certified direct wielders of it.It is hinted all of the Color entities (like Ion) who powers the batteries of the Green Lanterns and the like are all somehow related to the energy of the Source. If it is true, then the Green Lantern Corp and all the other Lightsmiths are truly accessing the most powerful forces in the DC Universe. \u200bInexhaustible, infinite, mysterious and very territorial, the Source is the boundary to the DC Multiverse and if anyone tries to penetrate that boundary, they are embedded into the Source Wall as a guardian, forever.The Guardians of Oa: \u2018Control freaks\u2019 doesn't do them justice.  \u200b\u200bLast but certainly not least, the Guardians of Oa: The Guardians evolved on the planet Maltus, and were among the first intelligent life forms in the universe. At this time they were tall greyish blue humanoids with black hair, who roughly resembled humans except for their skin color. They became scientists and thinkers, experimenting on the worlds around them. One experiment led to the creation of a new species, the Psions. In a pivotal moment, billions of years ago, a Maltusian named Krona used time-bending technology to observe the beginning of the Universe.However, this experiment, and later attempts to stop it, unleashed disaster upon all existence. Originally, the experiment splintered the Universe into the Multiverse and created the evil Anti-Matter Universe of Qward. Following the retroactive destruction of the Multiverse, it was revealed that Krona flooded the beginning of the Universe with entropy causing it \"to be born old\". \u200b\u200bFeeling responsible for this, the evolved Maltusians relocated to the planet Oa (at \"the center of the Universe\") and became the Guardians. Their goal was simple: combat evil and create an orderly universe. They acted quickly on that goal.During this period they slowly evolved into their current appearance, losing about half of their height and having their skulls grow larger. They now act as the leaders of the Green Lantern Corps, an interstellar police force which patrols the universe.Functionally immortal, Guardians resemble short (approximately 4 feet [120 cm] tall), large-headed, white-haired pale blue humans wearing red robes with their emblem, the Green Lantern symbol, on the chest.They possess vast knowledge, durability, awareness, flight, and psionic powers manifested through green plasma energy drawn from the most stable color of the emotional spectrum, green (willpower).Although, since it has been said that they chose the most stable color of the spectrum, it is possible that the Guardians may have limited access to all colors. In Green Lantern: Rebirth, Kyle Rayner is recorded saying that Ganthet could crack a planet in half with a thought and have been shown able to stagger Superman-Prime and the Anti-Monitor.The Guardians display the power of time travel as they send a time-lost Kyle Rayner back to his present timeline.Each Guardian has all the powers of a Green Lantern without the worry of running out of power, exhausting themselves or any psychological limitations placed on their ability to use the Green Power. Each Guardian is capable of destroying solar systems, traveling through time, and altering reality on a local level. It is only their oath to not interfere with lesser races directly which prevents them having their way with anyone they aren't particularly fond of.See Also: Which is more powerful, Thor's hammer, Mjolnir or Green Lantern's power ring? for a complete list of all of the powers of a Green Lantern's ring (It's mind-boggling array of powers would drive Ron Popeil into a coma!)  \u200bThe Guardian, Ganthet, doesn't resort to making Kryptonite radiation using his knowledge of Superman's weakness, he beats the Man of Steel down old school, with nothing but the Green Power and brute force. Each Guardian is a god-like entity to be reckoned with.  The Marvel Lineup: Unlike DC, Marvel has a vast and barely comprehensible collection of cosmic beings capable of creating or manipulating entire universes, who desire worship and are almost immune to attack. It would seem whenever Marvel needs a universe-threatening menace, they create a new one to add to their already existing cosmic pantheon. One-Above-All: The most powerful of Marvel's supreme beings uses an appellation that has been applied to two entities. To distinguish them, the Supreme Being is dubbed the One-Above-All (with hyphens).  \u200bThe One-Above-All (not to be confused with the Celestial with the name, The One Above All) claims to be the first and most powerful entity in the Marvel Omniverse. The One-Above-All has another potential identity as The Fulcrum. The Fulcrum is also the Bartender who runs The Vestibule, a swinging bar where Eternals go before they either return to a newly regenerated body or head off to Lacuna (The Afterlife). Said to be \"all-powerful\" and \"all-knowing\", the Fulcrum is likely an aspect, manifestation, or alternate name of the One-Above-All.He is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. He is the most powerful being in the Marvel Omniverse. His power is unlimited, incalculable and immeasurable.Undoubtedly the most mysterious character within the Marvel Omniverse. The One-Above-All has only appeared and been mentioned a few times. He is not to be confused with One Above All, the leader of the Celestials, or any religious figures. The One-Above-All was first mentioned by the Living Tribunal when Doctor Strange first encountered the entity.The One Above All is often unofficially cited as the Marvel Universe's creator. ~ComicVineAs mentioned earlier, he and the DC Presence will be sitting in the perfect lounge chairs sipping the Ultimate Gin and Tonic while their proxies make fireworks in the cosmic firmament. THE FINAL WORD The Ultimate Supreme Court: The Living Tribunal  \u200bThe Living Tribunal: is considered to be the right hand to the One-Above-All, he is the cosmic arbiter of what is right in the Multiverse and is capable of dispensing justice as he sees fit. He is so powerful that even Thanos, armed with the Infinity Gauntlet making him stronger than the entire Marvel Universe combined, did not dare to engage The Living Tribunal in combat.The living tribunal is the supreme authority in the Marvel Universe save The-One-Above-All. His power is absolutely limitless. There is no point in listing his powers because he can do ANYTHING he wants to save destroy the Multiverse itself. (he might be able to do that, if The-One-Above-All deemed it necessary.)The Beyonder: As much as it pains me to do this I must include the entry of The Beyonder. Despite his hokey and completely contrived origin for the Secret Wars Sagas, he has by virtue of materials written about him after the Secret Wars, the second most powerful being in the Marvel Multiverse after the Living Tribunal. I will keep it brief: The Beyonder was originally from an infinite realm beyond the Marvel Multiverse, called the Beyond-realm, and was the sum of everything outside the multiverse (our multiverse was a drop in the sea compared to the Beyond-realm). It became self aware and formed a being of immeasurable power. (He was originally described as millions of times more powerful than the entire multiverse.) ~ComicvineThe Beyonder was, at one point in his history more powerful than all the conceptual beings in the Marvel Universe and even manages to kill Death itself. \u200b\u200bThis picture shows The One Above All (Celestial), The Stranger, The Living Tribunal, Master Order and Lord Chaos, Eternity, The Watcher (lower left) The In-Betweener (in black and white) The Beyonder (in the orange jumpsuit), Mephisto (in red) and Death. The Beyonder was vain, arrogant, annoying, petty and capricious. But there was no denying his powers. At his peak he would have certainly been considered omnipotent, his raw power having the ability to do anything he wanted, but he lacked a clear understanding of the Universe so he is not omniscient (unless he wanted to be) and not omnipresent (unless he thought about it).One final note: The Beyonder has been retconned MANY TIMES. His origins are no longer clear to anyone and his recent appearances claimed he might be a mutant or he might not. Don't think too hard on it. If you're lucky, you'll never see him again.One other note: The Molecule Man who depending on when you ask, derived his powers from the Beyonder or the Beyonderverse as well, so he would also be in the same class as the Beyonder, capable of creating entire universes if he so desired. He's currently dead, but since he has resurrected himself in the past, his death is \"relative\" and likely not permanent. So if we needed a stand-in for the Beyonder, The Molecule Man would suffice.WIELDERS OF THE POWER COSMIC The Cosmic Compass: If you find any of them, you are way lost  The Cosmic Compass : The five oldest beings/forces in the Marvel Universe. They are the First and arguably the most potent forces to exist in the MU. They view each other as siblings. Galactus, The Devourer: As Galan, Galactus is the only survivor of the universe that existed before the Big Bang. He was actually born billions of years ago on the planet Taa.Galactus was the sole survivor of the previous universe and whose presence and absorption of worlds was learned to hold back the destructive capacity of the fourth conceptual being named Abraxas, the embodiment of Universal Destruction.A primal force of incredible power, a survivor of a previous Universe, he ranks among the Marvel Universe's most powerful beings to have EVER existed.Death or Mistress Death was the first power to exist after Galactus. Death is one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe. She often appears as a skeletal figure in a purple cloak but can appear as whatever she wishes.Mysterious, she almost never speaks and rarely makes personal appearances. For a time, the mad Titan Thanos, sought to kill half the Universe, using the Infinity Gauntlet to win her favor. Her power is beyond description and nothing can escape her. She is the ultimate arbiter in the Marvel Universe.Eternity and Infinity: Cosmic entities capable of shaping reality as they see fit, since it comprises their very being. Almost nothing is beyond the capacities of these two beings, but they rarely interfere in the day to day operations of the Universe-at-large, recruiting agents such as Doctor Strange to do what must be done, since if they do it, they have the potential to disrupt wide swaths of their own internal reality. The equivalent of using a nuke to kill an insect.Oblivion: is the personification of entropy which is the collapse or death of the universe. He is the male counterpart of Mistress Death. He has created many avatars or agents including Malestrom, Mirage and Deathurge. He is devoid of matter and energy and only seeks to return the Universe to the nothing that it was spawned from. Not invited to many parties.Held in check by the actions of Galactus is the threat of: Abraxas: The embodiment of universal destruction, a being whose powers rival the other three and is capable of envisioning and completing the destruction of an entire universe using the Ultimate Nullifier. This is an incredible feat because he has to be able to envision the universe in its entirety before using the device. He is also able to resist being destroyed after using the device.While these beings can take on humanoid forms, they are NOT even remotely human. Their power is so great, even seeing them in their raw form can drive mortal lifeforms crazy. The Conceptual Entities: WHAT are they standing on?  \u200bWhen the Living Tribunal holds court, the Universe's most powerful entities attend and listen quietly as they are given their marching orders... Abstract or Conceptual Entities: These are the beings which form the underpinnings of the Universe and help to bring order out of the cosmic chaos. Some are ancient species, old when the Universe was young, such as the Celestials, others are chaotic or maleficent forces/entities such as Mephisto, the Octessance or the Vashanti. Some are aberrant creatures such as the Stranger, or embody forms of cosmic consciousness such as Eon and Epoch. (almost all of these terrifying beings are in the image above...) The Phoenix Force as the Embodiment of Life is considered to be Death's antithesis. Her powers of creation and destruction are without peer and she (while wearing the form of Rachel Grey) fought Galactus to a standstill. Her powers have been used to restart a small universe. \u200bMaster Order and Lord Chaos: These two are the living embodiment of Order and Chaos in the Universe. Lord Chaos and Master Order always exist together in the cosmos. They are often seen playing devil's advocate with the Living Tribunal.Lord Chaos asks Master Order questions and Master Order attempts to answer them to Lord Chaos' satisfaction.COSMIC WEAPONS In-Betweener: If there's fine print, you can't lay a hand on him  \u200bThe In-Betweener is the primary agent of Master Order and Lord Chaos. He deals with mortal beings who have brought the Universe out of balance and is sent out to correct said imbalance. His power is the ability to be between all conflicting concepts at the same time. If it's possible you could miss, you will, if the possibility of something not affecting him is possible, it won't; thus he is immune to almost any form of harm by most mortal beings in the Marvel Universe. Did I say most mortal beings? Galactus reminds the In-betweener that Galactus has no counterpoint, no place where he isn't always Galactus. Master Order and Lord Chaos: are not above recruiting other lesser beings if their agent, the In-betweener isn't up to the task of restoring Order (or Chaos) to the universe. These beings include such luminaries as Spider-Man or the Master of the Mystic Arts, Doctor Strange. The In-betweener and Doctor Strange mix it up as only beings capable of seeing the underlying aspects of the Universe can: conceptually. There are others entities who embody other cosmic concepts such as Master Hate and Mistress Love. These are not lifeforms, they are conceptual beings who play some part in the maintenance of the functions of the Universe.Many-Angled Ones: Groped dimensions; never invited to parties  \u200bIn the case of Shuma-Gorath and the Many Angled Ones, (above) they are part of some underlying fabric of the Universe formed after its creation. They are remnants of the formation of the Universe become sentient. And angry because it wasn't loved and nurtured like the rest of the Universe. So its angry, hostile and prone to destroying worlds to make itself feel better.Incredibly powerful Shuma Gorath and his kin are capable of consuming entire dimensions, taking their magic, energy and lifeforces as fuel for further conquest.Absolutely the last conceptual entities anyone wants to see on the guest list.There are also at least two artifacts capable of similar universe-altering transformations. Both were believed to be artifacts created by the One-Above-All.  \u200bThe Heart of the Universe: The Heart of the Universe is an object of infinite proportions. It's possession makes the user the supreme being of the Marvel Universe capable of shaping reality as they saw fit. The Heart of the Universe was presumably created by Marvel\u2019s Supreme Being to correct an imbalance in the fundamental architecture of the Marvel Universe. \u200bThe Infinity Gems: The Infinity Gems are six precious stones of cosmic origin that give the possessor mastery over a certain power. Collecting and using all six gems will give the wielder complete control over the universe. Only the Living Tribunal, judge of the Multiverse, is immune to the wishes of the wielder of the Infinity Gems. THE BATTLE ROYALEThe Battle Royale sports-casters: The Voice in his favorite Terrier form (of DC Universe fame - think of Benedict Cumberbatch's voice when you read his lines.)The One-Above-All (in his guise as kindly, Jack Kirby or Stan Lee).The Voice: When was the last time you saw so many conceptual beings in one place at one time. Their majesty abounds. One-Above All: Well there was one time when Thanos had taken the Infinity Gems from the Elders of the Universe... The Voice: (interrupts having heard this story way too many times) How's your gin and tonic, One-Above-All? One-Above-All: Please, no need to be formal, call me, Jack. The Voice: Propriety and decorum are everything, One-Above-All. On-Above All: I prefer the soft approach, a helping hand, friendly bartender, supportive priest kind of thing. The Voice: Looks like this is going to be a slow one folks. The Conceptual Beings are just standing about, massaging the parallel dimensions, checking to see if anything is approaching them at other layers of reality. One-Above-All: That's a good point, Marvel's Conceptual Beings often have to monitor layers of reality because of incursions like Shuma-Gorath and the Many-Angled Ones.  \u200bThe Voice: Unnecessary posturing. Speaking of the Tentacled Horrors from Beyond the Stars, I think they're the first ones on the Marvel Side to move. One-Above-All: I always thought of it a kind of cool the way you could see into Eternity, all those worlds, stars, comets, always flashing by. Besides, I don't think of it like posturing. Think of it like those samurai iajitsu masters. They stand very still, watching each other and in an instant, something passes between the two and swords flash and return to the sheath a split second later and someone is dead. The Voice: Does he get cable? I had satellite in my building and never seemed to keep a decent signal. One-Above-All: Oy, what is it with you? It's all about you isn't it? Let's get back in the game, why doncha? What's your team doing. I see a lot of machines, heads-up displays and other techno-what's-its. What are they doing, opening an Apple store? The Voice: Looks like the Guardians are going to be the first to move from my side. As Shuma Gorath reappears from a shadow dimension right in their midst, the Green Power flares from the Guardians as they are enveloped in the terrible tentacles. All of the Guardians are enveloped except one. One-Above-All: That was awful, Shuma Gorath always complains about not getting invited anywhere without a lengthy summons. The reason it takes a long time to summon him is because he's just too needy. First thing he does when he comes through the dimensional veil is invading peoples personal space and hugging someone. Nobody likes that. Whose that youngster who escaped? The Voice: Ganthet, of course. He always escapes. It usually goes something like this: Ganthet tells the Guardians something bad's going to happen. The Guardians ignore him. It happens. The Guardians, because they're over-confident, get their heads handed to them and only Ganthet survives. This looks like he was right again.  One-Above-All: Sounds like he's going places. He might want the Big Chair one day. The Voice: And he could have it. None of my other boys seem to really have the knack for taking over for me. One is a sycophant, the other is a bully, and my most enterprising is a self-centered narcissist. One-Above-All: Is that the trio down there in the middle? One with a sword, one with a business suit and one with a glass of Chardonnay? The Voice: Yes, that's them. Disappointing aren't they? Micheal's buff, but the others are just suit-wearing paper pushers. None of the drive it takes to be a Supreme Being. One-Above-All: Not everyone is cut out to be God. I mean, look at Thanos. He's tried at least three times to become the Ultimate Enchilada. Every time he gets there, he looks around with his Omniscience and Blinks. Just can't handle it. The Voice: At least yours is willing to try. Wup, looks like Nabu and the Lords of Order and Chaos have made up their mind and are entering fray against Shuma-Gorath. The Quintessence is joining in to counter Nabu and the Lords of Order and Chaos. Makes sense because Shuma-Gorath is chaos personified. He exudes it, Nabu can't help himself. One-Above-All: Shuma-Gorath is multi-dimensional, your guy isn't going to be able to just blast him out of existence. That's why your bald fellows aren't just making him go away by staring green stuff at him.  \u200bThe Voice: That's not just stuff. That's THE Green Power. They have enough energy output to snuff a small sun. Shuma's hurting. Looks like the Quintessence and the Lords of Order and Chaos are too evenly matched. I can't see through the light, we'll just have to come back when their finished glowing across the multi-dimensional firmament. The Voice: Isn't that one of your all-stars?  One-Above-All: Thanos? Yeah. He wants to be. He just hasn't learned to be content with what he can do. I think he's going to tackle the Source-Wall. He's got the Heart of the Universe and the Infinity Gems. I guess he's decided only he can handle the threat of the Source. Removing the power plant of the DC Universe seemed like a Thanos grandiose-type of plan. Could you pass me some more of that gin? The Voice: Certainly. Looks like Thanos is trying to hack the Source Wall. He's trying to use the Infinity Gems and the Heart of the Universe to figure out how to circumvent the Source giving its powers to all of the DC Universe. One-Above-All: I designed that, you know. The Source Wall. Thanos doesn't have a chance in ach-ee-double hockey sticks, of decoding it. The Voice: Isn't he on your side? Shouldn't you be rooting for him TO penetrate the Source Wall? One-Above-All: No. Why should I be happy if some third-rate, under-ambitious hack supervillain who has thrown away God-hood more times than anyone sane would have should suddenly penetrate one of my greatest and most enduring legacies of the DC Universe. Screw that. The Voice: Okay. If you're happy with that... One-Above-All: Look, your Boys are in action. Bet its about to get lively in here. The Spectre and the In-Betweener are mixing it up. Their probably going to conundrum each other to death. Micheal is surging into the Compass with Gabriel right behind him. They are attacking a major power-block. The Voice: Your Conceptuals don't look that surprised. Knowing Lucifer they were attacking on several dimensional fronts before they even started showing up here. Galactus is putting in a great showing against Micheal. With support from Infinity and Eternity, Micheal is having to disrupt multiple layers of Universal constants. The two of them are simply too adept at supporting each other. Galactus is keeping the martial pressure up and his Power Cosmic does more than sting Michael Demiurgos. One-Above-All: Did you see that? Oblivion and Death starting tag-teaming Gabriel only to find themselves in a full-fledged dimensional inversion started by the Morningstar, protecting his younger Archangel. All without spilling any of his wine, no less. Morningstar's got class.  \u200bThe Voice: Gabriel isn't out of the woods yet. Oblivion and Death have managed to get their claws in deep. I can hear his Song changing, an undercurrent of Fear. One-Above-All: Michael is swinging his sword through all five of them! One-Above-All: Oh, no. I see two of the 5th Dimensional Imps disappearing. Batmite and Yz. The Endless are also entering the game. Two of the biggest players. The Beyonder and the Imps appear above the Living Tribunal's head. The Endless surrounding his cosmic throne. Wait. They're gone. The Imps, the Beyonder, the Endless, the Living Tribunal just vanished. The Voice: No, wait the Beyonder is back. Destiny reappears as well, he's tearing a page out of his Book. Now another, and another. The Beyonder's ragged, looks like ten miles of bad road. The Living Tribunal didn't reappear. neither did two of the Imps. I can't feel them anywhen, nowhere in time or space. No lower dimensions, no Underverse, either, just gone. One-Above-All: Uh-Oh, I think the Beyonder's pissed. He just opened the door to the Beyonderverse. I think there is a countermove on from the Monitors. Cosmic Armored Superman is in play. He's searching through the metaverse. He's interacting with the Metaverse finding all the Beyonders within the sheaf of all stories. Oh. my. He's deleting Jim Shooter.  \u200bThe Voice: It's mutual annihilation. The Cosmic Armored Superman and the Beyonderverse have destroyed each other, sealing the Monitors away from the remainder of the battle. They're just Watchers now. One-Above-All: Hey, I heard that. Gotta a copyright, remember? They should'a been here. They thought they were too good to engage in a cosmic kerfuffle. Something about not using their powers for blah, blah, blah. The Voice: That sounds like pain I'm hearing. Do you want to talk about it? One-Above-All: You know I don't. How about we don't mention them again? The Voice: Fair enough. Whose left? Shuma-Gorath managed to get Nabu and the Lords of Order and Chaos before going down. All the Guardians except for Ganthet are gone. Holy cow, Michael is down. Death and Oblivion have managed to deal him a moral wound. One-Above-All: You meant a mortal wound. A fatal injury. The Voice: I meant what I said. They struck a moral blow. They asked how he could have failed to stop so many of the Morningstar's plans. Perhaps he wanted them to succeed so that he could do what the Morningstar had the balls to do. Start his own Universe. When faced with the truth of that statement, that undermining of his personal confidence caused him to take a moral injury; harmed in the only way he truly could be: to his pride. One-Above All: Doesn't matter. Oblivion and Death fell from injuries due to Michael's sword and from a blast of Gabriel's Horn, shattered across the firmament. Gabriel gave the last of himself to the effort and expired moment's afterward, chastising the Morningstar for the former's usual lackluster efforts to improve until the last. The Voice: Galactus is down leaking radioactive fuels, most likely. Infinity and Eternity look worse for the wear and the Morningstar remains squared off with them. No one is trying to get in the middle of that fight.  One-Above-All: Looks like the Celestials are getting off the bench. Their headed toward the Source Wall. They're shooting at it. No, look at it. They aren't shooting randomly. They are shooting an area designed by the Mad Titan. They are coordinating their attack. The Voice: The Source Wall is glowing brightly. Beams of light shoot from the eyes of the giants trapped in its surface. Now, something unprecedented is happening. The Promethean Giants, two thousand feet tall and billions of years old are being released.  One-Above-All: Can you believe it folks? The Promethean Giants are leaving the Source Wall and engaging a single Celestial in a battle across Space-Time. The Voice: Celestial and Promethean flickering across the battlefield, battling in the pre-Cambrian era, and again as the Universe flickers into its last darkness. The Source Wall cools and darkens as the Celestials leave the battlefield. One-Above-All: I think this battle is almost over, folks. Let's recap: Shuma-Gorath opened the battle by impatiently attacking the Guardians of Oa who were surprised by his multi-dimensionality and overwhelmed.Nabu and the Lords of Order and Chaos helped attack the monstrosity but was attacked in turn by the Quintessence. All were killed in the ensuing orgy of tentacles and force beams.The Quintessence and the Lords of Chaos mutually destroyed each other. The Lords of Order stand dazed without the counterbalancing force of their opposite number before exploding due to the imbalance.Gabriel, Michael are down having faced off against the Compass, the core of the Marvel Lineup. Galactus, Oblivion, Death have fallen.The Morningstar stands off against Infinity and Eternity, whom were both badly wounded fighting Michael. The Morning Star hasn't managed to spill his Chardonnay.The Monitors are locked out in the Overvoid and Cosmic Armored Superman is destroyed thanks to the Beyonder's surprise move of reaching into the Beyonderverse for more help.Two of the 5th Dimensional Imps, Yz and Batmite and the Living Tribunal are off the field.The Celestials and the Source Wall's Promethean Giants have countered each other vanishing into the quantum foam of space-time.Only the Phoenix and Doctor Manhattan have not moved against the other side.The Voice: I think you're right: The Morningstar has gripped the hilt of Michael's Sword and thrown it INTO Eternity. He grasps Infinity's hand and the three of them become a swirling nebula of irrestible energy. One-Above All: I've seen that before. It's been awhile. The Voice: You senile old fool. He's trying to make a new universe out of the remnants of Infinity and Eternity. Even now, he's not thinking about the mission at hand, he's just trying to find a way of making his own playground where he can be God. One-Above-All: Your kids have real issues. But you have to give it to your boy, he's taken two heavyweights off the field. The Voice: And removed himself in the process. Underachiever. I stand by it. One-Above-All: What are these two waiting for? Wait, Ganthet is still around as well. And Darkseid. The Voice: You meant, Thanos, right? Thanos, Darkseid, we know they're the same character. Whose kidding whom? Last time I checked Thanos was decoding the Source Wall. Ohhhhhhh. Never mind.  One-Above-All: Bummer, I was sure if anyone was going to avoid ending up on the Source Wall it would have been him. He probably thought right as the lock was picked: \"I'm not worthy\" and bang! Source Wall bas relief art. He looks good up there you know that? The Voice: Ganthet, Doctor Manhattan and Phoenix approach each other. Should we listen in? They are the last ones. One-Above-All: No listening, I want to be surprised. The Voice: Oh the Bluemanity! Blue on Blue crime. Doctor Manhattan cruelly turns on his fellow, reducing him to his intrinsic fields before he could react. Now Doctor Manhattan is reaching out and taking the Phoenix's hand. They both turn and look at Destiny. He opens his book and begins writing. They both turn away apparently satisfied and enter the portal. One-Above-All: They're made for each other. The Infinite Man and the Unquenchable Woman. They're walking into the rupture made by the Morningstar. The Voice: Makes sense. Why create a universe when you have a ready-made, already furnished one, right here. One-Above-All: Well folks there you have it. The only rational player on the field decided to make a play for the hottest woman in the opposing universe, betrayed an annoying comrade surely to offer more advice than wanted. The Voice: They left through a rupture into a new Universe made by the ever-ambitious Lucifer Morningstar, worried more about his personal aggrandizement than what I wanted. One-Above-All: That sounds like pain. Wanna talk about it? The Voice: No. Not one bit. I want a definitive winner. Wanna set it up again? One-Above-All: You betcha. You set up the pieces and I'll get the drinks.  \u200bEPILOGUE Flames cover the battlefield and the ruins of Cosmic entities disappear, returned to their respective universes, unaware any time had past. All is as it was before. The Endless are having one of their parties celebrating whatever passes for a holiday among them. Destiny looked up from his book. Only his mouth is showing. A smile peers out from under his hood. A smile teasing you with a single question: You didn't think it was going to be that easy, did you?  Who won? You did. And there you have it folks, a battle so stupendous, so mind-boggling, we have shattered all of time and space with a patented shraka-kraka-doom. Both Universes filled with beings so powerful even the quantum foam of the Universe is their plaything. There was no way such a battle could end in anything other than Mutually assured, multi-dimensional, fractally-integrated, omniversal armageddon. Or with the lonely scientist getting the most amazing woman in the Universe, immortal just like him, with an enthusiasm for Life he would surely lose without her. Two better progenitor gods for a new universe, I can scarcely imagine. Lucifer got his wish too, to be around at the beginning of a New Universe where he was fundamental in getting it started.

            "answer_text": "According to my perceptions a battle between two legendary realms, Marvel and DC will be an ultimate epic. The reason here we go : Superman and Hulk are the powerhouses of DC and Marvel. The question who would win between these two is controversial. Strongest version of Superman is Superman Prime ( One Million ). Strongest version of hulk is world breaker Hulk. Both possess equal strength however , more angrier Hulk gets the stronger he becomes. Hulk can't be killed by mere means and Superman has been killed by Doomsday ( succumbing to his injuries ). Superman can hover in the air shoot down laser beams Arctic breath and stuff moreover I saw in a video he has telepathic powers. The verdict if Superman has his morals off I think Superman will win. Batman vs Ironman the battle of geniuses. Batman has prepared for all the battles. He is the master of all forms of combat styles. Both these characters have fought gods. Ironman has fought with Thor and Batman with Darkseid. Technology wise Stark has the edge. But using real wits in battle and outsmarting the others I give Bats the edge. However Ironman can withstand missiles and has more durability in comparison to Batman. So Iron man wins this. Thor takes on Wonder Woman. This is the battle of Gods. One has the strength of Hera and the other is the son of Odin. But guys without any argument or reason I give the edge to Thor. He is stronger than WW, more resilient, has too much of stamina ( he fought with an army or something for 9 months continuously.) Flash and Quicksilver. Dude it's been proven Flash is the fastest man alive. He owns against Quicksilver. Even the Marvel consider Flash as the fastest ( I read somewhere that there was a race and a guy named buried alien won.. Get it Barry Allen.) Aquaman vs Namor. Aquaman wins this he has magic abilities has the power which equals up a bit to Superman. Remaining characters left : DC - Superman,Flash and Aquaman Marvel - Ironman, Thor Now let's see it in this way Stark being a complete ass takes up Superman and Thor fights Flash and Aquaman.  Iron man vs Superman - Superman wins come on he just fought the crazy Hulk you guys think Iron Man has a chance. Unless, he figures out Superman's weakness Kryptonite. Hmm... But Kryptonite isn't available at any retail store. It's a very rare specimen possessed by Batman. Now Iron Man just took down Batman didn't kill him but knocked him out. He surely won't do things like check his utility belt or something. So no weakness on Superman's side. Superman wins. Thor vs Flash and Aquaman. Aquaman takes to the seas and Flash faces the God of Thunder. Now what happens Flash can beat Thor as much he wants because Thor is pretty much slow. Flash does a bit of a blunder gets down. Now it's Aquaman's turn. Thor one shots him. Come on water and electricity = Aquaman electrocuted and dead. Flash and Thor fight. Thor goes into outer space cancels any speed advantage for Flash and sends his Mjolnir out to take Flash. Verdict - Thor wins Final. Thor vs Superman. Superman wins barely in front of Thor. This has been done earlier on Quora. Superman is surely worthy of lifting up the Mjolnir. And even if Thor knocks out Superman into the Sun he would come back more powerful. Here is a pic which says it all.  And another pic, in which Superman says he won against Thor but barely.  Verdict DC wins !!!! I might be wrong but this is all my perception. I love Marvel especially Thor and Iron Man :) ",
