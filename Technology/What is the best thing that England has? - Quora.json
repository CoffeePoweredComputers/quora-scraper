            "answer_text": "Weather. Well climate if you want to be pedantic about it. Essentially everything flows from a climate that, while it can be unpredictable, is very rarely extreme. The hottest summer\u2019s day will not be much beyond 30, the coldest winter\u2019s day rarely below -10. Long periods of rain are rare, long period of drought are rare. So you get a very green and attractive countryside with long growing seasons which means it can support quite a large population. It\u2019s almost a perfect climate for human beings. Basically the climate in England is not going to kill you, 99 days out of 100, but will feed you, three seasons out of four. And finally it always gives you something to talk about. Everyone in the UK is a weather expert, everyone will always be happy to talk about it. ",
