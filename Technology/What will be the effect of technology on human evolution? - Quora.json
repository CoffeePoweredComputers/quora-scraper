            "answer_text": "Think about the most common activities that humans do due to the creation of technology....... Shoveling sand! Axing wood!  Reading!  Listening to music!  It's no question that 90% of the world's population does these activities at some point in their life and possibly for a lot of their life.  Can you think of a reason why NOT being able to do it well, would result in you being left behind in society, or even killed or left for dead?  Shoveling... When shovels were invented, the people who could shovel the best to build homes would have survived, while the ones that couldn't physically cope with shoveling lived less ideal lives and/or died off. Humans would have gradually evolved to have better backs and arms for the purpose of shoveling because the humans with shoveling abilities prospered while those with less ability diminished.  Same as cutting wood...  Reading... Since human started writing books, knowledge has been mainly passed down by books. The knowledge of how to survive in a certain area, or how to care for your health, or how to eat healthier and exercise, would have beneficial to living, and the lack of this knowledge would make you more susceptible to disease, danger, death. Therefore, over the last however many thousand years that we've been writing, those who had the ability to learn how to read with ease prospered, while those who lacked this ability lived lesser ideal lives and/or died off.  Music... There are tribes that used dancing as courting, therefore the men or women who could dance well got to reproduce. This meant evolution created people who were good at dancing. African Americans \"seem\" to be better dancers than the White Americans on average, is this because the colour black makes you dance better, or did the Africans come from a culture where thousands of years of natural selection in dancing ability evolved them to have better coordination and hearing for rhythms? There's thousands of ways we've evolved because of technology and there's going to be plenty more. One of the most alarming ones is the invention of cleanliness, which means new born babies are kept inside and away from the impurities of nature, causing their immune system to not evolve as they grow up. When they are old enough to go outside and play in the dirt they'll catch a disease and die.....Here is a lack of evolution due to technology, where technology is the many inventions that maintain our hygiene standards.

            "answer_text": "Humans have come a long way by evolving into a Sapien from a forager. But if you think the evolution has stopped then you might be wrong indeed. The evolution is continuously happening and we are still evolving into something which can completely change us in coming years. After millions of years of genetic mutation, we have reached where we are today. Technology has grown on to be our bodily extension which we cannot live without. As much good it is doing to the globe, it is also laying its footprint on us. You may never know what arsenal of weapon you are carrying along unless its effect begins to turn evident. So keeping this in mind, elucidating the effect of technology on human evolution, check out the following points of what you can expect the future human to look like. Reduced ImmunityMan is no more energetic as he was in yesteryears. This is probably because of his sedentary lifestyle and reduced activities. With technological advances, man is almost turning into cyborgs. Methods are discovered to make man immortal. Combining this with the dependence on medications and other prophylactic methods to gain prolonged good health will probably reduce our immunity to a great extent in the coming years. Reduced capacity of BrainsBooks are already replaced by online applications. Man is no more inclined towards reading nor remembering this. He is dependent on technology for almost everything. As most of the information is at the tip of the fingers, the need for the brain to retain information and store it is almost gone. And we are not unaware of our diminished memory which is probably worse than our parents with us expecting it to worsen more in case of the coming generation. Unnatural SelectionWell, this can be treated like a pro as well as a con wherein we can but in coming years, there might actually exist remedy for each and every disease. Man would be able to survive any kind of genetic mutation with humans with no diseases or defects in the body. And if all goes well with genetic engineering and biotechnology, humans would probably in the future be able to select every single element for their child, from their colour of skin, hair, bone structure to musculature. Muscular AtrophyLegend has it that mountains in ancient days had wings and used to fly. But it was soon cut off considering the misuse and havoc they created. Well, the same may happen in the coming years considering the sedentary lifestyle humans are accustomed to. The human body is known to adapt itself according to the surrounding. If we continue to equip ourselves with much sedentary lifestyle, this would probably turn us into weaker bodies, and extreme crippling of body. Be slaves to AIThroughout history, humans have been ruled and enslaved by many people. But the future might be much worse, consider the advent of AI. The most possible end for a civilization might be with AI taking over the most intelligent species on the planet. Be this may all get reversed if know how much to use AI and how much to keep them at bay. Entrusting too much of power in the hands of AI may turn it thinking itself to be smarter and no more needs humans on the planet. Scary Right?... So let's wait and watch! ",

            "answer_text": "Pardon me, but my guess is that you don't quite understand how evolution works. If you do, then, I beg your forgiveness. See, evolution (in this specific case) can ONLY have an effect on a species when it provides a given individual with an advantage BEFORE procreation. Normally that advantage helps with nutrition, defense and/or attracting a mate. Sometimes it helps the individual survive a bit more until procreation, but typically it has something to do with nutrition (better ability to find food, better ability to consume food, ability to go without food for a period of time or the ability to go without a type of food or nutrient), defense or mate attraction. So, in this sense, now that you understand what evolutionary advantages entail, what technological advancement have you seen or could foresee that would give its holder an advantage in any of these ways? The honest to God answer is: none. In fact, many evolutionists like myself believe that we've stopped evolving altogether. Sure, sure, there are numerous beneficial mutations that occur every year all over the world, but when technology obscures that mutation, it ceases to grant a procreative advantage.  Such a mutation may be passed on to the holder's young (let's say: a 50/50 chance), but unless it increases fertility, then it won't help. Want a better advantage?  Let's say a male, Caucasian British boy, in London (\"Jonny\") is born with a natural immunity to Salmonella enterica (cause of, well Salmonella poisoning, Typhoid fever, etc.).  Let's say that Johnny survived until he married and produced children. Two scenarios:   If Johnny lived 400 years ago and had 10 children (8 of whom survived passed infancy into adulthood, that's 4 children with the immunity), half of whom possessed the immunity, they would all be born into a time where Typhoid killed thousands of people every year.  Various infections caused by Salmonella killed infants in massive numbers.  Adults died during particularly terrible Typhoid outbreaks.  So, I know I don't need to do that math to show you how powerful a breading advantage this immunity would be.  Greater survival of a powerful pestilence means that more children would survive into breeding age and so on and so on.If Johnny lived right now in London and had 2 kids (all of whom survived passed infancy into adulthood), 1 of whom possessed the immunity, they would all be born into a time where Typhoid (and other Salmonella outbreaks) do relatively nothing to our society.  Sure, sure, there's the occasional outbreak.  And, of course, when outbreaks happen, we have powerful medicines to save lives.  In fact, your odds of dieing from Salmonella even after being infected are really, REALLY small.  So, in modern times, this immunity wouldn't really do much.And here's the deal.  Even if scenario (2) did happen, Johnny's kids wouldn't out-breed any other kids.  Sure, the immunity might be passed on, but there's a good chance that that one kid might never pass the immunity on or might pass it on for just one generation. To be certain, there are a LOT of people still having babies in areas where diseases still happen, but evolution happens over many, many millennia.  How much longer will people be having massive numbers of babies in disease infected areas?  Probably not much longer than the next 100 years.  After that, we will either have population growth under control and most diseases will be treatable, or we will probably not exist at all. Now, as to \"technology and evolution\", I think that the two are inseparable.  We will begin to actually incorporate technology into our bodies.  We haven't finished evolving, but we've certainly finished the greater leaps of evolution by natural selection.  With the advent of nano technology and genetic manipulation, it's inconceivable that we won't take our evolution into our own hands and make whatever changes we see fit.   None of this addresses the wisdom of such manipulations, but denying that such things will take place is more nostalgia than rational thinking.  These things will happen and they will happen within most of our lifetimes. ",

            "answer_text": "Collin's answer has a key point. I've read recent articles that point out that the very size of our brains, which is really what makes us what we are, are only possible due to having cooked meat available due to their high energy consumption. Cooked meat (and cooked vegetables most likely) makes much more of the nutrition value of the food readily available since it is effectively pre-digesting the food and breaking down bonds our body would otherwise have to expend energy doing itself. Effectively that allowed humankind to evolve into its current state of culture and sapience, so you can't really ever take technology out of the human evolutionary equation. It will be interesting to see what society decides is an acceptable level of genetic modification, especially stem-line cells. We are definitely allowing to breed those that 'nature' would have darwined off originally. People like me with a variety of childhood ills would most likely died before breeding. Do we 'fix' people like me via genetic manipulation, or continue to treat the unwanted symptoms/manifestations of the genes? Most interesting to me is that high achievers in contemporary human culture are likely to have the smallest number of offspring. That inversion of natural selection is more concerning to me than the allowance of previously unfit breeders to propagate. ",

            "answer_text": "If we're talking on the scale of tens or hundreds of thousands of years (a reasonably short time scale to talk about evolution), we likely won't be evolving new \"skills.\"  Rather, changes to our gene pool will probably be far more mundane.  Here are two plausible examples of traits that could be positively selected for:  Ability to better regulate one's sleep cycle in the absence of exposure to sunlight.  Ubiquitous artificial light has drastically reduced our exposure to sunlight, which is an important ingredient in the regulation of our circadian rhythm.  Disruptions to one's circadian rhythm can cause insomnia, which can impact the immune system, increase the incidence of auto and other accidents, and generally make you a less attractive date.  People who better regulate their sleep cycle in the absence of sunlight would avoid these negative impacts, leading to positive selective pressure on the trait.Resistance to cancer.  Technology \u2014 from antibiotics to improved nutrition \u2014 has greatly increased our average lifespan.  This has made us more susceptible to cancer, a disease that more commonly strikes in old age.  Cancer is highly resistant to medical intervention since harmful cancerous cells are nearly identical to non-cancerous cells (as opposed to, say, a bacterium that differs in many important ways from human cells).  There are myriad mutations that would reduce our susceptibility to cancer \u2014 more active and redundant mutation detection and correction genes like BRCA1 and BRCA2 , for example.  A person who has these mutations is less likely to develop cancer, leading to positive selective pressure on the trait. [A special note on this one: while cancer typically strikes after child-bearing age, with fertility treatments this is increasingly less the case.  Also, even if you die after child-bearing age you can negatively impact your progeny who are still bearing children, leading to selective pressure on the gene copies you passed down.]Either of these could be obviated by technology that helps us cope with the respective negative impacts.  But that would have to happen before selection has a chance to have a material impact. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: How does Technology affect Human Evolution? Article  https://medium.com/@manuj.aggarwal/technological-advances-and-its-effects-on-human-evolution-5329718639e7 Technology is progressing rapidly, and it is changing the way we live, work and play. New inventions are happening, and new paradigms are born almost every day. Conventional concepts we are used to as a human race for decades or even centuries are being disrupted by cutting edge technology. Just half a century ago, computers were only surfacing and were used for particular scientific or research work, but today they are found all around us. We see, and experience computing power around us in all shapes, sizes, and types. There are small and portable ones like in smartphones. There are big ones like desktops and mainframes. And lately, with innovative devices like Google Glass or Snap Spectacles\u200a\u2014\u200athis computing power has also invaded our wearable devices. Whether we like this technological revolution or not\u200a\u2014\u200awe can clearly see how it is affecting our daily lives. But an interesting question arises\u200a\u2014\u200awhat are long-term effects of this revolution? I am not talking a decade or a century from now\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead what are the implications on a human evolutionary timeline\u200a\u2014\u200awhich could span millennia. Technology is changing the patterns of our life. There was a time when we were very physically active, but now we rely on devices to do most of our work. The changes in our behavioral patterns and adaptations that are caused by these technological advances could prove to be the primary driving forces behind the next stage of evolution for our species. Charles Darwin  proposed that evolution is the change in the characteristics of a species over several generations\u200a\u2014\u200awhich could happen over eons or within few centuries. This process of evolution relies on the process of natural selection. Charles\u2019 theory of evolution is based on the idea that all species gradually change over time. The complex process of evolution relies on there being a genetic variation in a population which affects the physical characteristics of an organism. Some of these characteristics may give the individual an advantage over other members of the same species which they can then pass on to their offspring. This process of continuously adopting advantageous characteristics by subsequent generations is called \u201cnatural selection.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 . Instead, the evolution is occurring in two other ways Efficiency\u2014Based \u2014 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 . the human mind is the organ that is being used most extensively in the current world. From complex computations in the workplace to the rapid decision making we need to execute on a daily basis.Transhumanism \u2014 Transhumanism is a futurist concept which is analogous to artificial evolutionary process. It involves the studying of internal software of human body and tinkering with it for better results.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 . In the end, we can say that human evolutionary cycles will definitely be affected by this rapid growth in technological advancements. These technologies have already significantly changed the patterns of life thus making the standard evolution considerably fast. People of all physical strengths and capabilities can live healthy and fruitful lives; making it possible for their mental genes to mutate and create a better result. Additionally, artificial evolution is also not too far off in the future, and soon people might be able to select the different characteristics of their offspring like mental capabilities, physique, and energy levels.

Something very cool is the fact that humanity on an individual level has the capability to evolve further and faster than it's counterparts. Humans are a technology in themselves.

In the past two decades alone, life expectancy has risen on average seven years for both males and females in the UK - though the rate is higher for females \u2013 with a recent claim declaring that around 1 in 5 UK citizens alive today will live past 100 years of age. In terms of life expectancy, technology is increasing human evolution, insofar that it is prolonging human life.  In terms of whether this advancement is limiting human evolution lends itself to the moral dilemma on whether technology should be allowed to extend human life. In terms of manipulating an individual\u2019s genetics the verdict is still out morally, but in regards to us progressing because of technological advancements, it is widely accepted in Western society that we are allowed to evolve as a race in this manner. However, as any Anthropologist knows, it is imperative to be aware of moral relativism and not make epistemological claims based upon personal upbringing and values \u2013 a Western take is not an absolute, or indeed, a universal take.  We have progressed from Durkheim\u2019s industrialisation age where technological improvements reduced output needed by humans and, in turn, improved living conditions and life quality, to Castell\u2019s \u201cinformation age\u201d in which a more-accessible knowledge-based economy is also allowing conditions to be improved through the ease of knowledge, or content-sharing that has arisen from the rise of the digital world.  Technology isn\u2019t limiting human evolution; rather it\u2019s raising the question of what it is to be human. As we transcend national borders and the constraints of current knowledge, it is our notion of human evolution, therefore, that must change. ",

Eventually a species will no matter how advanced come against a challenge that is very difficult to surpass. Due to the fact that genes rarely affect just one tiny part of the body but whole groupings of seemingly random metabolic functions, some genetic disease may be a boon. For example one kids inability to properly process glucose may in fact also allow him to survive a virus that might kill much of the rest of us. There's just no way to know. I also agree with Mark that we need to end up using genetics and engineered cures to help save us from the truly dead end genetic mutations that are almost universally bad for our society as a whole. In short the more people with the more diverse genes equals greater survivability. Developing and expanding your species while increasing survivability is at the very heart of Evolution. ",

I do not think humans will be able to cheat genes, unless you ethically problematic use CRISP/Cas technology to multiply alleles or genes outside of sexual reproduction. Because individual changes will mostly drown within all other variation that selection acts on. On top of that you have sexual selection that will act to purify against most visible changes. For example if someone changes the genome, including the germ line [why?], to develop eyes in the back of the head it will likely not take hold while getting a permanent Mohawk may work. ",

According to Meredith Small (1), professor at Cornell, \"evolution is defined as change in gene frequencies over time, which means that over generations, there will be changes in the gene pool, and humans experience those changes as much as any other organism\". Therefore, evolution is not a path that takes humans to perfection - fitness, resistance to illness, and so on. But a process of constant change driven by the environment. Therefore, evolution has not stopped, and will never stop, but will change us because of the influence of our current environment. For instance, as populations become more developed (in the sense of richer, and more educated), they tend to reproduce less. At the same time, developed nations are a minority in sheer number. As a consequence, in the future, humans will have much more genetic influence from current \"poor\" populations (Latin America, Africa, some parts of Asia) than from developed populations (North America, Europe, Japan). This is evolution. Not necessarily for the better. (1) Scientific American article, October 1999.. ",

            "answer_text": "To be crass, our health system is limiting natural human evolution. Since people who would not survive in a harsh environment with wild animals and other threats do survive today thanks to our great medical technology. People with genetic disabilities, etc. These people have children, and thus these genetic disabilities are part of our natural evolution. However, at the same time, our technological evolution is mitigating these disabilities. So in the end, the technology overcomes the problems, making us more evolved than before. But... If we were to lose all our technology along with our medicinal knowledge, I believe we would be worse off than before we started using it. It's an interesting food for thought. :) ",

While the development of technology is a sign of our own evolutionary advancement, the converse effect is that technology and its ability to connect humans on global and lessen our reliance on remembering things will lead to the advancement of emotional intelligence and perhaps even diminish xenophobia. The extended explanation of this theory is provided by Rob Desalle, a curator at the American Museum in Natural History.

Human genetic diversity is increasing because selection pressures are being reduced. People born with genetic conditions a couple of hundred years ago now survive to adulthood. So our genome is becoming more diverse. The increased genetic diversity will result in faster evolution because there are more chances for beneficial mutations to occur and for the person with that nutation to survive until adulthood. ",

What is less obvious is that human genetic evolution is not necessarily stopping. With more people, there is more opportunity for mutations, and these mutations can be adaptive or maladaptive in today's life. What we don't see yet is favorable new mutations becoming predominant in populations, but this is simply because it will take many generations. ",
