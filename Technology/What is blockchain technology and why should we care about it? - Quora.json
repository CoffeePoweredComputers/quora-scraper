            "answer_text": "What is a Blockchain?  In the simplest terms, Blockchain can be described as a data structure that holds transactional records and while ensuring security, transparency, and decentralization. You can also think of it as a chain or records stored in the forms of blocks which are controlled by no single authority. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that is completely open to any and everyone on the network. Once an information is stored on a blockchain, it is extremely difficult to change or alter it. Each transaction on a blockchain is secured with a digital signature that proves its authenticity. Due to the use of encryption and digital signatures, the data stored on the blockchain is tamper-proof and cannot be changed. Blockchain technology allows all the network participants to reach an agreement, commonly known as consensus. All the data stored on a blockchain is recorded digitally and has a common history which is available for all the network participants. This way, the chances of any fraudulent activity or duplication of transactions is eliminated without the need of a third-party. In order to understand blockchain better, consider an example where you are looking for an option to send some money to your friend who lives in a different location. A general option that you can normally use can be a bank or via a payment transfer application like PayPal or Paytm. This option involves third parties in order to process the transaction due to which an extra amount of your money is deducted as transferring fee. Moreover, in cases like these, you cannot ensure the security of your money as it is highly possible that a hacker might disrupt the network and steal your money. In both the cases, it is the customer who suffers. This is where Blockchain comes in. Instead of using a bank for transferring money, if we use a blockchain in such cases, the process becomes much easier and secure. There is no extra fee involved as the funds are directly processed by you thus, eliminating the need for a third party. Moreover, the blockchain database is decentralized and is not limited to any single location meaning that all the information and records kept on the blockchain are public and decentralized. Since the information is not stored in a single place, there\u2019s no chance of corruption of the information by any hacker. How Does a Blockchain Work?  Source: Fuat \u015eanl\u0131 (Dribbble) A blockchain is a chain of blocks that contain data or information. Despite being discovered earlier, the first successful and popular application of the Blockchain technology came into being in the year 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. He created the first digital cryptocurrency called Bitcoin through the use of Blockchain technology. Let\u2019s understand how a blockchain actually works. Each block in a blockchain network stores some information along with the hash of its previous block. A hash is a unique mathematical code which belongs to a specific block. If the information inside the block is modified, the hash of the block will be subject to modification too. The connection of blocks through unique hash keys is what makes blockchain secure. While transactions take place on a blockchain, there are nodes on the network that validate these transactions. In Bitcoin blockchain, these nodes are called as miners and they use the concept of proof-of-work in order to process and validate transactions on the network. In order for a transaction to be valid, each block must refer to the hash of its preceding block. The transaction will take place only and only if the hash is correct. If a hacker tries to attack the network and change information of any specific block, the hash attached to the block will also get modified. The breach will be detected as the modified hash will not match with the original one. This ensures that the blockchain is unalterable as if any change which is made to the chain of blocks will be reflected throughout the entire network and will be detected easily.

            "answer_text": "Blockchain isn\u2019t new word trust me its not new at all. thousands of archives with different Questions that sparks internet \u201cWhat is blockchain ?\u201d right ?. so what exactly it is. is it some kind of programming language or database or server ?. My answer to all these questions are NO. In my opinion Blockchain is a Coup d\u2019\u00e9tat to traditional insecure software development pattern and i am sure i am not wrong aren\u2019t i ? Well let me prove my innocence Wikipedia says \u201cA blockchain, originally block chain,is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, hash \u201c Then What exactly is Blockchain and why Blockchain ? Blockchain technology breaks the database into a million tiny pieces, which are then spread across thousands of computers. its something like a robbery scene Instead of breaking into a house, you have to break into every single house. Blockchain is Decentralized meaning it is not controlled by one central authority. Blockchain was built with Decentralized as its core purpose to ensure security & integrity of common. Wow! that\u2019s wonderful. thanks to Wikipedia uncle but its still not clear. WHY SHOULD I TRUST BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY ?  Blockchain : All you need to know about Blockchain Technologies First thing that comes in mind is security and Blockchain can\u2019t be tampered why ?. let me explain.Each block that is added onto the chain carries a hard, cryptographic reference to the previous block in form of Hash. That reference is part of the mathematical problem that needs to be solved in order to bring the following block into the network and the chain.Part of solving the puzzle involves working out random number called the nonce.The nonce, combined with the other data such as the transaction size, creates a digital fingerprint called a hash. This is encrypted, thus making it secure. Each hash is unique and must meet certain cryptographic conditions. Once this happens a block is completed and added to the chain. In order to tamper with this, each earlier block, of which there are over half a million, would require the cryptographic puzzles to be re-mined, which is impossible.
