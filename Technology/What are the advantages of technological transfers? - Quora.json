            "answer_text": "The term technology transfer refers to the processes by which scientific research and discoveries are developed into practical and commercially relevant products and services. The term can also mean the transfer of technology from one geopolitical location to another, typically from advanced to poor countries.  Processes Involved In Technology Transfer Technology transfer activities may include among others, processing and evaluating invention disclosures, filing for patents, licensing, protecting and safeguarding intellectual property, technology marketing, and using technology to create new businesses or improve upon the existing ones. Many companies, business organizations, educational institutions, and governmental agencies now set up a separate cell to figure out the commercial implications of new scientific research. The next processes of commercial exploitation may involve licensing agreements between the research agency and the commercial agency, sharing of risks and rewards, etc. If an agency is unable to fund its own research, then venture capital may be raised in order to fund research. This practice is typical in the USA. From the 1980s, technology transfer has become increasingly common with an increasing number of legislations relating to patenting and trademark coming into operation. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology transfer, also known as transfer of technology, is the technological dissemination from its origination to global markets (Grosse, 1996). Technological dissemination may arise via market transactions: firms could exchange a product, knowledge, process or skill to yield innovation and meet the demands of both businesses and consumers. Strategic alliances between firms can be an entry point for technology transfer to ignite, which may present itself as a cross- licensing agreement or joint venture (Behrman et al., 1976). The degree of knowledge transfer is somewhat determined by mechanisms of intra-firm technology transfer in the organization among corporate technical functions such as R&D, engineering, and manufacturing, and non- technical functions such as marketing and sales (Ockwell et al., 2008). Notable cross-border interrelationship and recipient endeavours involved in technology transfer mechanisms may create enhancement in learning opportunities (Lema and Lema, 2016). For instance, in a case study of India\u2019s wind power industry (Daisuke, 2018), wind turbine manufacturers pursued various technology transfer mechanisms including licensing, joint ventures, and international R&D centres. The creation of a performance-oriented market enhances firms\u2019 financial resources and encourages knowledge acquisition and capability development. ",
