            "answer_text": "You'd first have to figure out whether school classrooms are effective in the first place, and if so, why.  A large lecture course is so impersonal that it may as well be projected remotely, but even in a moderately large class there's the possibility that some students will influence the instruction through their questions.  If the online \"classroom\" is a one-way video stream of a live lecture, or a series of individually prepared video clips, there is no actual response to the audience in the lesson, and I see no difference between this and the transcript of said lecture distributed as a textbook. In a smaller course, naturally, it's possible to be creative with the group learning structure that make students less oblivious to each other.  Discussions, group work, presentations, and so on all improve the learning environment.  This is actually much easier to imagine replicating online: even a massive online course could be automatically divided into small groups that communicate among themselves via videoconferencing.  It would still be difficult to do anything that treats the students as individuals on a classwide scale, though. Lastly, personal interaction with the professor or at least with teaching assistants is a big part of what makes a college course more than its textbook.  In an online course of any size you can't have the former, and with sufficient size, not even the latter.  This means that large online classes are inherently limited to being a kind of certification that students have undertaken the process of studying the material, but can't really provide the intellectual depth of real learning.  A small online course of a few dozen (i.e. the size of a section of a normal course) could probably be done the same as an in-person class, as long as it is live. ",

            "answer_text": "Not if you have and value the interaction between the lecturer and the students, if the lecture was a one way street it wouldn't matter. Our daughter when attending med school selectively didn't attend those lectures where it wasn't better than looking over the notes, kindly provided by the lecturer, online (University of Groningen, The Netherlands, around 2005), she felt she could by working by herself be more effective than spending all that time attending the lecture in person. When I was a freshman at med school in the sixties, we had around 300 students attending class, no interactions possible.Still, if the lecturer was able to make the lecture interesting, even memorable, it would be worthwhile to attend.  This is very hard to do teaching basic preclinical stuff which almost nobody can relate to. So taking these classes online would be just as good as live, maybe better because one can take a pause in between. Interesting interactions started when classes in the 4th and 5th (clinical) years at another University had shrunk to \u00b180 students, and a few inspiring Professors would ask random students what they thought about the problems a patient who attended these lectures presented themselves with (by giving their history).  It taught us the thought process a doctor needs, not just memorizing a list of symptoms caused by a disease, but making a synthesis of the facts you have learned to come to a short list of possible diagnosis and how to look further what it could be (= differential diagnosis).  Some Professors only asked the interns who had to attend these lectures, other would first ask for a respond, and if there was none would ask a random student often sitting in the back, hoping (s)he wouldn't get noticed.  For some a bit stressful, but very instructive and enjoyable lectures.  The most popular of these lectures was on Saturday morning (!!) starting at 8:30 am to 1 pm with just a 30 minutes coffee break in between.  This Professor of Internal Medicine inspired me to become an internist myself. EDIT: just listened to a radio program among others on opportunities in the PRC:   A Dutch Professor who was invited to lecture Chinese students asked how he should do it, he was told to just do it \"the Dutch way\", which he didn't understand.  Anyway, he saw how Chinese Professors lectured, reading from their notes for 3 hours without any interaction with the students, after a pause again 3 hours;  so when he gave his lecture after around 10 minutes he asked the students on their reaction to something he had said, they were very much surprised, but later on thawed and were glad he did.  This Dutch Professor then thought about how students participation in The Netherlands is encouraged from Kindergarten level on: all children sitting in a circle telling the class about their small insignificant experiences of the day before, when his child had to do this he didn't think much of it, but after the Chinese experience learned that this early encouragement to participate in class was so valuable.
