            "answer_text": "The novel coronavirus pandemic has gripped the world with a deadly disease spreading like wildfire, affecting thousands of people. In India, the number of positive cases has crossed the 100 mark and the death toll has touched three people. In a scenario where panic is as contagious as the virus, rumours take no time to become viral. Some stories of uncanny predictions are also doing the rounds. Here's a list: A book from 1981 The Eyes of Darkness, a novel written by Dean Koontz and published in 1981, allegedly predicted the outbreak of a coronavirus. There is a passage in the book that alludes to the creation of a deadly virus known as Wuhan-400, which is named after the place where it originated. Netizens are going gaga over the strange similarity and many are saying that the author was one person who foresaw the occurrence of COVID-19. A prediction in The Simpsons More often than not, The Simpsons is credited with predicting that Donald Trump would become the President of United States. \"The Simpsons predicted it\u201d is a common phrase on the internet. A 1993 episode of the animated sitcom titled Marge in Chains dealt with the outbreak of a mysterious virus that originated in the Far East. The episode focuses on an illness called 'Osaka flu' that spreads through Springfield after residents order juicers from Japan. Nostradamus predicted this? Nostradamus, the 16th-century French astrologer, physician and reputed seer is famous for his predictions. From the end of the world to natural calamities, his predictions are dynamic and mind-boggling. And according to one Twitter user, Nostradamus also predicted the coronavirus. The authenticity of the user's claim is debatable.  'The war of Armageddon' Jeane Dixon was an American psychic who reportedly predicted the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. Dixon also predicted that the world would end in 2020 when a 'war of Armageddon' would wipe out the planet. According to netizens, the Armageddon that she was referring to was the coronavirus. End of Days Pictures of a page from a book titled End of Days, written by late Sylvia Brown, has gone viral on social media. Certain lines in the book make it seem like the author had predicted that a coronavirus-like epidemic would attack the world in 2020. Here's an excerpt: \"In around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments. Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again ten years later, and then disappear completely.\" All of these predictions may just be shots in the dark. For now, people need to keep themselves safe by following the guidelines shared by governments, medical experts and the World Health Organization.

But any Native American can tell you otherwise. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 [I\u2019m not an expert. I\u2019m synthesizing information so that I can make the best decisions for my business in the next 12\u201336 months. Take what I say with a grain of salt. If you have better information please add it with a comment and link to the source.] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Two years ago I posted on Facebook that viruses were the largest threat to Native Americans. A little bit of xenophobia would have been good for them. My friends were none too kind with their responses:  Pathogens have decimated populations probably since the dawn of time. And they will continue to do so. Lindy Effect The Lindy Effect says that something will be relevant in the future for about as long as it was relevant in the past. The bible has been relevant for 2,000 years. Shakespeare has been relevant for 500 years. Twitter has been relevant for 15 years. You get the idea. Epidemics have been relevant since\u2026 forever. How this compares to Coronavirus What\u2019s notable in this example (Source: Acuna-Soto, et al 2002) from Mexico is that 21 out of 22 million native people in Mexico died from pathogens, around 95% of the population. Compare this to the Diamond Princess where 0.2% of people died. The Native Americans had no immunity to the new viruses, Smallpox \u201cimported\u201d from Europe and Cocoliztli possibly native. But the people on the Diamond Princess seem to have had some immunity \u2014 only 19% were infected despite the close quarters. Perhaps there is some natural immunity among humans to COVID-19. This gives me hope in our current situation that we won\u2019t end up like the unlucky natives 500 years ago. However, decimated populations are Lindy. If it\u2019s been relevant since the dawn of time, it could happen again. In fact it will. Let\u2019s look at what happened back then to see what we can do now to protect ourselves. Why were Native Americans so susceptible? The new world wasn\u2019t colonized by guns; it was colonized by chickens. That probably sounds strange. We were taught that the brutal colonizers killed a lot of people. And they did. But guns didn\u2019t cause the majority of deaths. You see, in the New World people had very few domesticated animals \u2014 only dogs and llamas. You\u2019ve heard of avian flu and you\u2019ve heard of swine flu but you probably never heard of llama flu or dog flu. Because those animals generally don\u2019t pass on viruses to humans. They\u2019re just not similar enough. Europeans living in close proximity to domesticated animals like pigs and chickens built up immunity over time. Then they brought these viruses to the new world which wiped out the native people. The native people didn\u2019t have domesticated chickens to help them build up immunity. This helps explain how we make vaccines. The most common way is with chicken eggs. We inject a virus into a fertilized chicken egg, the virus multiplies and then we extract the virus. We then purify the antigen, a molecule from the virus that our antibodies need to be exposed to. We then inject that antigen into humans who can now get the exposure to the antigen without being exposed to the virus.  Source. A Tangent on Wheels. The reason Native Americans never invented the wheel, supposedly, was because they didn\u2019t have domesticated animals. They didn\u2019t have beasts of burden like oxen or horses. Thus, there was not much use in having a wheel because there was no animal to pull a wheeled cart. But wheelbarrows don\u2019t require beasts of burden. Thus, it\u2019s still a mystery why they never invented wheels. At the very least you can see the utility of the wheel was substantially less for people who didn\u2019t have horses or oxen. Back to the original story\u2026 How can we see it coming next time? This is the hard and the simple question to answer. Simply, anything that happens rarely but repeatedly will happen again and surprise us: Economic crashesWorld warsParadigm shifts in science (Heliocentrism, Newton\u2019s laws of motion, Relativity, etc.)Change of super powers, no super power has lasted more than 1,000 yearsMeteorites hitting the earthNew ReligionsAlien invasions (ok, just kidding about this one)The hard answer is I don\u2019t know how to predict these things. Do you know? Let me know in the comments. I\u2019m very curious. ",
