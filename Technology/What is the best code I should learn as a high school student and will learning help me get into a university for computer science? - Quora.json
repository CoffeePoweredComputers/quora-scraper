            "answer_text": "Computer science is a wide area. If you want to do programming, at first, you should learn SQL - Structured Query Language, because every language interacts with DB. Then you have to learn about OOP and data structures. Find some online courses to get superficial knowledge about any language to understand if you like it or not. After you can choose any object-oriented language you want: Java, Ruby, C++, Python, etc. If you know one programming language, you can learn another easily. ",
