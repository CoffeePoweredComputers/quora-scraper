            "answer_text": " Cell towers are not centralized, they\u2019re distributed. Your phone transmits to the tower near you that gets the best reception. If you\u2019re travelling, you hand off from tower to tower. The degree of just how distributed the network is \u2014 how many towers \u2014 depends on where you are. Cellular networks count on frequency reuse. Every user is sharing the same relatively small set of channels, and as the number of users increases, more towers are added and the power for each one is set lower. Your phone is instructed by the tower how loud to transmit, you have no control over it. So if you\u2019re thinking, maybe, you want a walkie-talkie, direct phone-to-phone connection or something, forget it. There\u2019s not enough bandwidth, and the radios in phones are power enough to reach your neighborhood cell tower, not you buddy across town\u2026 or across the world. Each tower joins the larger network via a \u201cbackhaul\u201d network. That used to be established telephony standards like T1 or T3 connections. But in modern networks, it\u2019s probably something like Ethernet over Fiber. Very remote towers may use high-speed point to point microwave links. And of course, many phones today are network-flexible. My phone uses VoLTE (VoIP) for most calling, so it\u2019s in LTE mode most of the time when on the air, but if I\u2019m on a WiFi network, it jumps there instead, which saves on battery power.  And as we move from LTE/4G to 5G, there will be increasingly more towers. One reason is basic physics: the first 5G deployments will be in the millimeter radio band, much higher frequency than the UHF frequencies used by today\u2019s cellular radio. As you go up in frequency, the free-space path loss goes up. Your signal has a shorter range given the same power. So the larger towers will, initially, be replaced by microtowers on street lights and other regularly occuring structures. Eventually, 5G will move to the lower frequencies used by 3G today, but it won\u2019t be substantially faster than LTE at those narrower bandwidths. Just as most companies are planning to move to all LTE/4G, some by the end of the year, the ultimate plan is that 5G technologies eventually replace all 4G as well. But they do need overlap, particularly because the 5G technologies will have their own share of bugs, and a need to move from \u201cnew\u201d to \u201cmature\u201d technology before they can replace 4G.

Indeed, they are distributed for exactly the purpose that allows the phones to transmit at lower power (reducing the need for electrical energy from a battery) to reach the nearby tower that they can communicate with. Given that our smartphones are battery powered, and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future, that transmission can thus reach a few miles to a tower. Much more than that, the cellular system (with \u201ccells\u201d to allow frequency re-use) would \u201cbreak\u201d its design intent. ",

Mobile phones only communicate a short distance, which is why the batteries last so long. The hard work of distance communications is done by optic fibre cables or point to point microwave links. In Rural areas towers are always going to be a feature, unless something radical happens like solar powered drones or very cheap satellites. In cities, to cope with the density of mobiles, smaller cells that do not need or want antennas in high places will become more common. The cell phone network is layered in cities with long distance cells called Macro-Cells with smaller cells micro-cells and even smaller pico-cells. Pico cells are just a small box on a wall. ",

Normally, cells will overlap with other nearby cells so that phones can be in several cells at the same time and will normally be using the towers in multiple cells at the same time. Towers create cells, and cells are the basis of cellular networks. Without cellular networks there are no cell phones. Without cellular technology, there simply will not be enough radio bandwidth for the world population of mobile phones to work. WiFi networks and DECT phones also operate using a form of cellular technology. They have to have limited range to allow other networks or phone systems to work nearby. ",
