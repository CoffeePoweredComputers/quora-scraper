Central Electronic Health Records (EHR) that can act as a single source of medical data for Practitioners and other healthcare providers - pharmacies, labs - as well as end-consumers 3. Business-to-Business E-Commerce platform for the pharmaceutical trade to enhance efficiency and to interface with customers - Practitioners as well as end-consumers - to procure orders 4. Communication and collaboration platform for the healthcare community - Practitioners, pharmacies, labs - to exchange information among themselves faster, so that the end-consumer benefits by reduced cost and increased speed of delivery. 5. Standardization of diseases and procedures - adoption of standards such as ICD 10 so that the entire healthcare community speaks the same language and reduces ambiguity in communication 6. Virtual Clinics/Hospitals - Facility to exchange information instantly with healthcare providers across geographies to increase speed and efficiency 7.

            "answer_text": "By \u2018technology\u2019 I mean Inventions & discoveries made by scientific research process\u2026 ok? It may be appreciated that \u2018biology\u2019 and its sub-branches have studied various aspects of living beings - anatomy & physiology, details of internal & external organs, nest/home making, reproduction, etc. etc. After this, for the last around 50 years or so, there is NO ADVANCEMENT in the biology. What we see as scientific advancement in healthcare now are efforts to superimpose scientific inventions & discoveries made by Chemistry and Physics and associated sub-branches. The science of biology can develop further so as to \u201ccontribute to better healthcare\u201d only if biology can be differentiated from chemistry & physics. For this, one has to understand that \u2018healthcare\u2019 is NOT \u2018medical care\u2019\u2026 cleanliness is NOT anti-septic sterility, etc. And each individual has to take the control of health care requirements in one\u2019s own hands. This is certainly possible with technology developed in biology, but the \u2018commercialized\u2019 medical world WOULD NOT ALLOW people to do so, and they would continue to terrify and drug the people, burn &/or remove organs & body parts - many of which are more horrible than the original disease itself.
