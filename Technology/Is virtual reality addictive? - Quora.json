            "answer_text": "I think the key here is the \u2018could\u2019 component of your question, and because of that I would absolutely answer YES. Let\u2019s start with the definition to ensure we are all on the same page: \u201cAddiction is a medical condition that is characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli, despite adverse consequences. It can be thought of as a disease or biological process leading to such behaviors.\u201d As VR content and capabilities expands, the potential to customize it to your particular feelings, moods, and desires also expands.  This gets to a point where potentially the virtual world you \u2018play\u2019 in is customized and thus more utopian than the real world.  When you have the chance of \u2018living\u2019 in a perfect world, or \u2018living\u2019 in the doldrums of the real world\u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to see the possibilities of the virtual environment becoming addictive. Whether you want to be a part of a Star Wars shoot em-up, live on Mars, or sit beside a doctor as he performs surgery\u2026 all of these are possible with virtual reality.  What\u2019s more, you could do all of these in the same evening from the comfort of your home. I am no doctor and I don\u2019t consider myself to have an addictive nature, but I know for sure that I love VR and the concept of virtual experiences far exceeds anything a simple 2d screen game can offer.

            "answer_text": "Not any more than video games in general. In the end, it\u2019s only a different mode of display and input devices. It\u2019s awesome and way better than desktop gaming, but the addictiveness depends on the game you play, not the tech itself. There are games that are cool to play\u2026 for ten minutes, then they become repetitive, or obviously flawed, or just not fun. And there are games where you can spend hours and not even notice. For example, Skyrim is an addictive game on desktop. There\u2019s so much you can do, explore, quest. It\u2019s the exact same in VR with the added benefit of it being a pretty good workout. Slaughtering hundreds of enemies swinging your arms around is tiresome. Especially with wrist weights. And there\u2019s Robo Recall, for example, which is an awesome game to demo the Rift with, but it gets old fast. Really fast. It has three small levels with three missions each, and you can finish it in an hour. No matter how immersive it is, how good its VR implementation, how good game mechanics it has, it\u2019s the same thing over and over with absolutely no variation. So\u2026 gaming is addictive, not the type of display and input device you use. ",
