            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been using Spotify, then switched to Apple Music and now is switching back to Spotify. I also tried Amazon Music (don\u2019t even think about it) and few other semi-free services like AccuRadio and Soundcloud (they are good actually, if you need a carefully selected music stream (not specific tracks) and can live with a little ads here an there). Back to Spotify vs. Apple Music They both have same prices for single and family subscriptions now, have pretty similar music catalogues, works both on mobile and desktop and still quite different in their approach. Apple Music Pros: Curated Human Playlists from Beats team \u2014 they are great and very diverse. Spotify has none to compete (or it\u2019s very hard to find - e.g. Resident Advisor has own playlists on Spotify \u2014 good luck to try to locate them)Beats 1 radio - it\u2019s good. Too much focused on hip hop and still good. Mostly British DJs (way better than American)TV shows (Carpool karaoke, Planet of the Apps and others)Tight integration with iOS and tvOS ( and HomePod if you are crazy enough to buy this overpriced plastic speaker)Cons: Android app is awful (both interface and stability). and I use AndroidAlgorithmic playlists are subpar quality vs. SpotifyPlaylists are too short \u2014 about 1hr that is not enough usuallyEverything is too focused on hip hop. It may be okay if you listen to hip hop only, otherwise it will bother you soon.TV shows are weird quality (Carpool karaoke is utter joke w/o James Corden; Planet of the Apps is underperforming)Spotify Pros: Superb algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly, New Releases5\u20136 different (and good) algorithmic playlists tailored specifically for you \u2014 one day you want Post Punk, another day Nu Disco \u2014 no problem!Good Android AppHi-Res audio quality option for premium subscribersCons: No human editorial curated playlists (and it\u2019s a BIG minus). User playlists can't compete with professional curated selection.No TV shows or any other \u201cown\u201d content - they really have to start producing own content (like Netflix started few years ago)iOS integration is not smoothDon\u2019t forget that you can listen to Spotify for free (with ads and limitations) and have no this option with Apple Music. I recommend to subscribe for a free Apple Music trial for 3 months and try free Spotify simultaneously \u2014 three moths is more than enough to decide what do you want. ",

            "answer_text": "Now that it\u2019s nearly three years later, it\u2019s worth another look at this question. Apple Music has thrived and become the #2 streaming service, but Spotify is still #1. Some people have found Apple is better for them; others prefer Spotify. Reasons that you might like Apple Music: 1 with a bullet: You\u2019re all-in on Apple. You own an iPhone, an iPad, a Mac, an Apple TV, a HomePod, and an Apple Watch. Apple has always been all about integration of its devices and services, so you\u2019ll get the best experience if you\u2019re heavily into that environment. 2: You like the Beats 1 radio station. 3: You\u2019re a fan of one or more artists that are exclusive to Apple. 4: You like Apple\u2019s curated play lists. Reasons to proceed with caution: 1: Your primary desktop platform is Windows. iTunes works well on a Mac, but the Windows version has always been a poor relation. There is no web client, so iTunes is your only option. 2: Your mobile platform is Android. There is an Apple Music app for Android but it is buggier than the iOS version. Apple\u2019s support of other computing platforms has always been suspect; see the comments on iTunes. 3: You\u2019re an Xbox One user. Again, there is an app, and again Apple\u2019s long term commitment to it is questionable. Red flags: 1: You use desktop platforms other than Mac and Windows. Apple Music doesn\u2019t work at all on Linux, and it only works on Chromebooks that can install Android apps from Google Play. 2. You have smart speakers that aren\u2019t HomePods. Apple Music isn\u2019t supported on Amazon and Google speakers. 3. You use a TV streaming box that isn\u2019t Apple TV. Apple Music won\u2019t work on Roku, Fire TV, or Chromecast. Reasons you might prefer Spotify: 1: You use Linux, or a Chromebook that can\u2019t install Android apps. The Spotify web player will work on those. 2. You have a streaming box that Spotify supports but Apple Music doesn\u2019t, such as Fire TV and Chromecast. Roku, alas, is not currently supported; there was a Roku app in the past but it has been withdrawn and has not been replaced. 3. You have Amazon or Google smart home speakers. Full Spotify support is available, including voice control. 4. You like Spotify\u2019s exclusive content: artists that aren\u2019t on Apple Music, interviews with musicians, Spotify Studio recordings. 5. You like Spotify\u2019s playlists, which include personalized ones based on your listening history. 6. You have lots of friends on Spotify who share playlists with you. 7. You like to use other people\u2019s computers to listen. Spotify\u2019s web support lets you do that without installing any software. That\u2019s handy for library computers (don\u2019t forget headphones!), office computers that don\u2019t let you install applications, and computers at your friends\u2019 houses. ",
