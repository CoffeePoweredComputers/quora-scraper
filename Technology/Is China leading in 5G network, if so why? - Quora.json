            "answer_text": "Just like Andrew Curry I think I want to take this question from a different perspective. Most of the answers have already covered just how far ahead Huawei and China are in 5G compared to everybody else in the world anyway. Earlier today US President Trump demanded that American tech companies invent 6G and build it for America. Donald Trump wants 6G in America, presumably because it's one more than 5G While the western internet took a collective sigh and shook their heads at what looks like Trump saying another silly thing - Trump asks 'Global Waming' to come back. - what he meant was that he wanted America to get started on researching 6G. But the real story isn\u2019t how silly of him to hope America could get a leg up on the competition by starting 6G R&D. The story is actually this quote from Huawei\u2019s Founder. In a recent interview founder Ren Zhengfei said Now we are rolling out 5G and soon we'll welcome 6G. And it was after hearing him say that that Trump made his tweet. So knowing that Huawei is about one year ahead of its competitors in 5G and is virtually the only one capable of providing 5G equipment right now how soon do they expect to welcome 6G? It turns out not only is Trump a little late in demanding 6G research start but he might be too late to catch up too. China\u2019s been researching 6G as early as 2017 and have already made plenty of progress. And it isn\u2019t planning on going all the way alone either. If we look on the map at countries banning or partially banning Huawei from setting up 5G we might notice a few major countries missing.  As of today the UK and Germany have suggested that they aren\u2019t planning to block Huawei at all. But countries like Italy and Austria haven\u2019t said anything at all. That\u2019s because China\u2019s 6G development extended to these countries over the last few years created a new system to go a step further than 5G. We know that 5G is going to connect the world like never before. Massive machine communication and the smart city are two things that are under way once 5G has been deployed. Just like with 5G itself these benefits of 5G were already started a long time ago by China too and China is much further ahead in smart home and smart city development than anybody else. But IoT and things like self driving cars are weak to network hacks. Chinese IoT and what they call AIoT have gone a long way to making hacks very difficult to pull on their devices. 6G aims to make that impossible. Bottom line is that not only is China ahead in 5G but it is also already ahead in 6G before anybody else has even started looking into it. ",

            "answer_text": "This answer focuses primarily on comparisons between the US & PRC, since I know very little about 5G deployments elsewhere. The PRC leads in term of speed & cost-effectiveness of 5G network deployment relative to the US, & the two are roughly equal in terms of technological sophistication. As mentioned in previous answers, 5G is a set of tech standards, & any telecom network built within those standards will have comparable performance. Both countries have access to the relevant standards & technologies, so neither is \u201cmore advanced\u201d than the other. That said, there are multiple factors across the 5G value chain that make 5G deployment far less expensive in the PRC than in the US (& probably relative to most other countries too). I discussed 2 factors in another answer, but here is a more complete outline of differences: Spectrum allocation: As elaborated in the other answer, the US is deploying 5G mostly on mmWave spectrum, whereas the PRC is starting with Sub-6 spectrum then moving on to mmWave by the end of 2019. Due to the shorter range of mmWave frequencies, US MNOs must install ~4X the amount of equipment for the same area of coverage (see visual below). Although mmWave is faster than Sub-6 (assuming no signal interference), I would argue that the extra speed is not worth the extra cost in the early stages of 5G deployment. Moreover, there are major cost implications beyond required equipment quantity, including:Labor: tasks such as assembling 5G base stations, laying down electrical wires, installing equipment upgrades on existing towers, etc. are work that currently cannot be easily automated or completed by unskilled labor. Having to install 3\u20134X the amount of equipment means 3\u20134X the amount of man-hours. US skilled labor is still more expensive than that of the PRC despite the latter\u2019s rapid wage increases, & they\u2019ll need more man-hours for 5G network building, so total upfront labor costs will be far higher in the US than in the PRC.Real estate: ~4X more cell towers also means ~4X the amount of land required, & therefore ~4X the amount of land leasing/purchasing costs. This cost increase becomes more significant in dense urban areas, where real estate is more expensive, but also where towers are needed the most to serve a larger number of people & use cases.Future opex: installing more towers correspondingly means higher electricity & ongoing maintenance expenses. Auction costs: in both countries, radio frequency spectrum is owned by the government, & they take different approaches to distribute spectrum to MNOs. The US government seeks to profit from spectrum allocation by auctioning it to the highest bidder, whereas the PRC charges its MNOs only a fee to offset spectrum management admin costs. This means that US MNOs must spend billions of USD upfront to purchase spectrum, whereas PRC MNOs spent less than 100 million RMB. These costs will ultimately be passed on to users.Vendor competition: there are 4 major companies in the world capable of producing a complete set of equipment for an end-to-end 5G network - Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, & ZTE. The US banned Huawei & ZTE for geopolitical reasons, so the US 5G network market is basically a de facto Ericsson-Nokia duopoly. Meanwhile, the PRC allows all OEMs to compete, including Ericsson & Nokia. This means China\u2019s MNOs have more product choices & lower prices.Network sharing: like every technology, 5G will take time before gaining widespread adoption among consumer & enterprise users. In order to avoid building huge networks upfront just to serve a few customers, 2 of the PRC\u2019s 3 major MNOs - Unicom & Telecom - will implement a \u201cnetwork sharing\u201d agreement. During the earlier phases of 5G deployment, the 2 MNOs will use the same set of physical infrastructure, & thus avoid spending more money upfront than is justified by early-stage user demand. So far, US MNOs have no network sharing arrangements.4G infrastructure: in the early phases of 5G, many MNOs will opt for \u201cnon-standalone\u201d (NSA) networks, meaning that existing 4G infrastructure will be upgraded to 5G standards, so as to minimize time to market and deployment costs. The PRC deploys more 4G base stations than the US, & therefore will have more infrastructure available for upgrade. Device availability: relative to the US, the PRC market has more 5G smartphones already available & are sold at lower prices. China\u2019s 5G smartphone prices already reached the same level as those of 4G models (~$400\u2013600), & smartphone OEMs such as Xiaomi are planning to launch even lower priced models next year. Meanwhile, 5G models available in the US are priced near or above $1000. It\u2019s no surprise that a single 5G model in China sold more volume than all US 5G phone sales forecasted for 2019. This means that 5G consumer adoption will likely be faster & on a bigger scale in the PRC relative to the US, & therefore will attract more enterprises to offer new 5G-based services & use cases in China. Granted 5G will primarily benefit enterprises & governments in use cases such as smart cities, ADAS, smart retail, etc., but consumer-generated data from smartphones will inform companies which services are most sought after.All these factors accumulates to a substantial cost & deployment speed advantage for China's 5G network & ecosystem. Predictably, PRC MNOs already offer the cheapest 5G plans currently available worldwide. ",
