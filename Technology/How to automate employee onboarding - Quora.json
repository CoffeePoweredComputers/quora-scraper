            "answer_text": "Document the current process as it is. Include everything from the moment you\u2019re ready to make an offer. Is there an offer letter template? Who sends it? Where is the signed letter saved and who needs to know it\u2019s been accepted?What information is needed from the employee (I9, Benefits, Direct Deposit, NDA, etc.) What forms will be needed?What will the employee need on their first day and their first week (Security badge, PC, phone, desk, cube, etc.)? Who needs to supply it?Who will be training them and what is the training process? How will you track their progress?There\u2019s likely a lot more you\u2019ll need to document, but that gives you a general idea of what questions to ask. Once you have that all sorted out, run it by a few people who are part of the process and validate it. Once it\u2019s all validated, you\u2019re ready to automate. Find a workflow management system that fits your needs and budget. These systems allow you to create workflows that include all the tasks that need to be performed and assign them to the people who need to perform them. Processes can run in parallel or sequentially. For instance, someone may be setting up their security badge at the same time someone else is requisitioning a chair. You\u2019ll be able to set up reminders and alerts to make sure that everyone is doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing. As tasks are completed, they are checked off as completed by the task owner and the process moves to the next step. Meanwhile, the entire process is visible to all stakeholders so there is never a question about who needs to do what next. Also, the time from beginning to end can be tracked to find bottlenecks in the process. Before launching the automated process it, get feedback from all stakeholders, which could include HR, Payroll, Purchasing, Finance, Operations, IT, Security, etc. If they have a part to play they need to provide feedback. There may be information they need that\u2019s not already on any forms you\u2019ve created. I put together a guide that walks you through the process of automating employee onboarding that has a lot more detail than I can include in this response. ",

            "answer_text": "CrowdSync is perfect for this! (Disclaimer: I\u2019m one of the founders) CrowdSync lets you build out processes, like employee onboarding, made up of steps that people will go through automatically. You simply put together your workflow, then add people to it to shuttle them through the process automatically (we even remind them to complete steps that they\u2019ve forgotten about, and report back to you daily about how people are progressing through your workflow). Some of the things you can automate: Sending out online forms for people to completeUploading and requesting documents from peopleHaving people schedule time on your calendarHaving people submit payments to youSending out emails automatically throughout the processWe also let you put in \u201cwait\u201d steps, to hold people during a process until you want to manually move them ahead. Onboarding is one of the most popular use cases for CrowdSync, by far, and people absolutely love how much time it saves compared to doing this kind of work manually. Check it out it here, and if you have any questions, let me know! ",
