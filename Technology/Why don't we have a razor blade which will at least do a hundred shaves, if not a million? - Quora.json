            "answer_text": "My lord, if men can\u2019t get a blade clean for a week, what is he going to do with a million-year blade. Imagine if you accidentally nicked the edge of the blade only 235,386 years into use?? So, yeah, technically, it could be done out of some advanced chromium coated plate. But the thing is, we would be cleaning the blade all the time. Our whiskers combine with shaving cream or soap to make pretty hard grime to remove. Even if we had your blades, I think we would still have problems with the idea. Now, if guys washed the blade on their razors and patted it dry before putting it away, they would last about three times longer.  Merkur makes about the best around and are reasonable. 10 blades for US$6.50. Sixty-five cents a blade.[1] But, if you are like me, want the absolute best shave for the least cost, I go to the made-in-Japan Feather blades are known in the industry as the sharpest available, so it\u2019s no surprise that they were the most recommended of all, with seven experts singing their praises. Feather is the sharpest on the market, period,\u201d says Howard, echoing what we heard from the other barbers who praised the brand. Still, while the pros love a sharp blade after spending years perfecting their technique, it\u2019s important to note that what works best for them might not work best for a nonprofessional shaving at home. As many experts caution, the sharpness of these blades can be irritating to sensitive skin, and sharper blades, of course, carry an increased risk of nicks and cuts.[2] But if you want a close shave, the experts say you can\u2019t do better than Feather. How much? When you buy them in packs of 100, they are US$38.00,[3] for almost two years of shaves. Thanks for asking the question. Please keep \u2019em coming!

            "answer_text": "We can and we did. The question is why don\u2019t we still. Search for straight razors on eBay. You\u2019ll find thousands upon thousands available. Well kept straight razors from over 100 years ago are still perfectly capable of shaving your face for the rest of your life. It\u2019s just that you have to carefully sharpen them, and keep them clean, and dry, and oil them to prevent rust. And you have to strop them fairly often. Nowadays, materials and manufacturing are so cheap that you can get a razor that requires none of that. It works until it doesn\u2019t then you throw it away. This is less work and less money (at least at first). It leaves you more time to screw around on your smartphone and not get anything done- and somehow be stressed and short on time anyway. But, hey, people prefer it. I think a permanent razor would have some other problems. Razors are basically devices made to maximize pressure in a very small area. This makes them easily damaged- especially at the low bevel angles used on razors.Crud build up on a blade makes it perform like it\u2019s dull even if the steel is still sharp. This is common in butcher shops where fat builds up on the surface of the edge.So a zero maintenance permanent blade isn\u2019t really viable. We\u2019ve chosen a zero maintenance disposable over a high maintenance permanent blade . ",
