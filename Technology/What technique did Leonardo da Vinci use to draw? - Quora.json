            "answer_text": "He used the Leonardo da Vinci drawing technique, because he invented drawing. well okay, he did not really invent drawing but i hope i have made my point. His work as a draftsman is what we have been trying to emulate for 500 years by figuring out various techniques which serve as a means of finding a way to draw as he did. my best advice is to simply understand what it is that he did, and study his drawing from one to the other, Also look at Albert Durer, and Michaelangelo and Raphael and Andrea del Sarto. Verrocchio before them and Polloiollo and Andrea Mantengna who did lay the groundwork, and you are right, lots of circles, contitute an important part of an under drawing, and try to figure out why. I suggest that you get a leg up on it, with the book Drawing Lessons from the Great Masters by Robert Beverly Hale, and Anatomy Lessons etc. also same author He will give you the grounding in the circles ovals and underpinning of drawing as we came to know it over the centuries and once again da Vinci is the method and the message and that is the point. Leonardo invented drawing, and the science of the figure, as we know it, everything comes from him\u2026and if you can't figure it out you are welcome to ask me for help. Seriously . Because you have come to the right guy for drawing, and by that I mean da Vinci of course. Have at it ",

            "answer_text": "He used a lot of pen and ink, but very little or no crosshatching. Rather, his style of shading was almost always using parallel lines. Since he was left handed, he would shade from bottom left to top right. Chalk was a big favorite with him and he frequently used red chalk on brown prepared paper. He would then heighten his drawings with white paint. He's also used black, or blue chalks in some instances. A few of his sketches are also made using Silverpoint. ",

            "answer_text": "He studied gestures and drawing anatomy from simple forms like many of his contemporaries did. He studied proportions like crazy. If you are interested in studying something which might come close to how he drew check out Michael Hampton\u2019s anatomy classes and books. The art style is a bit different from Leonardo\u2019s, but I believe the approach and understanding are very similar . ",

            "answer_text": "Trouble is that, since I am an instinctive artist, I have a certain degree of difficulty in applying the words necessary to describe what artists actually do. As far as I\u2019m concerned, getting a rhythm going is most important. Study of the old masters like Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo. Modern masters of line work like the late Moebius. Robert Beverly Hale compiled very good books on anatomy of the great masters of which I have a couple. If you study long enough and, vitally, draw enough, you should get to soak it in. No real short cuts unfortunately, to developing any art style. Just the usual slog at it until you feel you are getting it enough for it to become second nature. Leonardos note books are also available in book form in three volumes, and many others showcasing his work which I\u2019m sure you already know. ",
