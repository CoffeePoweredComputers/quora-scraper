            "answer_text": "Without a doubt Swiss Gear makes amazing tech backpacks and such for school or traveling - and the price tag often reflects this.   Honestly, if you don't want to blow your budget on a (pretty great) brand, simply buy what appeals to you.  A few things to look for would be the correct size sleeve/compartment for your laptop.  If you have a 17\" laptop, don't try to squeeze it in a space meant for a 15\" laptop.  At the same time if you have a 12\" laptop, you don't need a compartment for a 17\" laptop.  It's just going to bounce and slide around in the excess space Strong stitching as well as padding under the laptop compartment are two must-haves for any carrying case/bag.  In addition, well made padded straps.  You're going to be lugging this around, you want something comfortable.  Also look for an additional mid-section style strap.  Make sure this is well built and robust.  Also you want some water-resistance in the bag.   Some look for ventilation, honestly it's something I don't stress over much, but this is because for the most part I'm only totting my bag from my car to the office or classroom.  I'm not walking home with it on my back.  But if you're going to be doing a lot of walking, ventilation is a factor.   Features and additional accessories such as Removable sleeves are nice to keep dust and dirt that may collect in your bag away from your laptop, but of course if your bag doesn't come with one, a Neopreme sleeve is pretty cheap and easy to come by.   Ultimately, your maint points are a sturdy and protected design, that give you comfort, and appeals to you as the owner/wearer.   I've purchased high end and off-brand laptop backpacks.  Truth be told, when I spent a pretty penny on a high end backpack, I purchased with peace of mind.  When I spent a rusty penny on a Chinese product, I was surprised with it's sturdiness, but always questioned it because of what I spent for it.   ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to your question depends on the type of bag you want to carry. Many college students have migrated from backpack style bag that they maybe have used in high school to a messenger style bag that is worn over one shoulder.  Both are valid ways of transporting your stuff to class everyday, it just depends on which form factor your prefer.  As a student, I would imagine that you are going to be looking for the best value in a bag, whether it's a backpack or a messenger bag. You want something to transport and protect all the items you listed and then some, but you still need it not to cost a semesters tuition.  With all the options out there, how do you choose the best bag to meet you needs?  You mentioned that you have a MacBook Air and an iPad. In trying to choose the best bag to meet your needs, would it make sense to choose a company that specializes and only makes bags for Apple portables? These bags would be custom designed to fit your specific Air and iPad vs. a generic bag made for a generic size laptop and tablet.  A generic bag that needs to be all things to all users might have your hardware rattling around when running to class trying not to be late because you've overslept due to all night gaming binge. Apple products are way to expensive for that.  So not knowing whether you prefer a backpack or a messenger style, I'll propose one of each. The feature list is long for each and the prices are below what many bags with the same features are selling for. If you have a 13\" Air, each one is available with a custom designed Sleeve that offers additional protection. Each is worth a look.  Good luck in your search!
