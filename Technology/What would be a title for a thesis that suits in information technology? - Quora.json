Maybe cover the story of how it was accidentally discovered. The Awan brothers hacking the DNC from the inside and how the insider threat is the biggest threat, and you can parallel it to Wikileaks and Mr. Manning. You can also discuss solutions like the tools being implemented to try to prevent data leaks. Cloud computing moving from software as a service to infrastructure as a service and beyond. The technological development for the developing world like Youtube for India that runs on 2G networks and low grade \u201csmart\u201d phones. The Singularity as a religion, that there is no God but they want to invent an all knowing, all seeing, all powerful artificial intelligence to tell us all what to do and let us upload our minds to a digital paradise and gain immortality. And these are the biggest minds behind AI. The problems with putting our faith in computer models, whether financial models behind the 2008 economic collapse that said housing prices on average could not go down (read \u201cThe Big Short\u201d) and climate models that say we can only go up in temperature and every variable multiples the effect though it doesn\u2019t take a number of factors into account. The model is built based on the opinions of the creators and backed by various political agendas - but we assume since it is a computer generated model, it must be neutral. ",

            "answer_text": "why not something like \"Programming via mash-up and intercommunicating portlets\"? Let me explain: I think that inter-portlet communication can enable ICT people to build simple portlets dockable in a portlet container UI. These portlet can map one DB entity each, and include a pattern collection manageable by portlet configuration. a possible collection of these patterns can be: - form/table presentation and editability- separated communication channels for input and output- outputs automatically fed by getting focus on a specific record- read only/editable- business process portlets (wrapping a good business process engine to orchestrate the application behaviour) Of course I don't have to detail everything, what I say is just that building a set of separate portlets can allow to build \"on the fly\" all the user experience, and that could boost the productuvity and keep maintenance, analysis and design costs always under control. Refer to JSR-286 standard for reference of inter portlet communication ",
