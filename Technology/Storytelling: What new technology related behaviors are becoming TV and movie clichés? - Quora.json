            "answer_text": "For near-future science fiction movies or action films with heroes who use a lot of technology: smartphones with nigh-magical powers. Action heroes these days seem to have phones that can do anything-- from Batman's sonar-mapping phone to Tony Stark's phone that can crack into a projector at a Senate hearing. It's like we're so thrilled by our real-world smartphones, we're imagining our heroes with phones even more awesome than ours. ",

            "answer_text": "TV cliche: Advertisements that pretend that your TV is a tablet, using a hand overlay doing smartphone/tablet swipe gestures to spin a car around or zoom on their products.   This will likely become outmoded fairly quickly because all of our television and advertising will actually be consumed on tablets or touch interfaces and non-interactive television programming will become less and less relevant.
