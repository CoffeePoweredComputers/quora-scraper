            "answer_text": "The short answer? A lot. On Amazon, there are around 27 departments. Each of those categories is filled with subcategories. For example, a toothbrush falls under the \u201cBeauty and Personal Care\u201d department, but can also be found in the \u201cOral Care Products\u201d subcategory, as well as many others. The exact number of products is changing every day. If you\u2019re a seller looking to find your next big product to sell, I\u2019d recommend vetting your ideas through a product research tool like Algopix. Algopix is great because it shows you a lot of actionable data about the products you are interested in selling. You can use it to see things like: - Demand and competition levels - Estimated profit and expenses - Average monthly sales - Seller ratings and reviews - Relevant Google Adwords data With so many products for sale, you need this kind of information to be competitive. That way you don\u2019t get lost in the sea of 300+ million items. ",
