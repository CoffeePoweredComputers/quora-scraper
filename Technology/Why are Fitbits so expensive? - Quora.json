            "answer_text": "The price of any item in a free market system (i.e., capitalism based political economy) reflects the highest price the market will bear. Companies conduct market analyses to determine what consumers are willing to pay for a given product and then adjust prices as a function of competition, cost of input resources (e.g., metal, plastic, etc.), labor, etc. An example of a price that is on the higher end of consumer acceptance is the Apple iPhone X, which has disappointing sales primarily due to the high price (> $1000). Fitbit devices currently dominate the health tracker market, but as competition increases their prices will either come down or they will add additional features to their trackers to maintain the perceived value, and hence the price point.

            "answer_text": "Its just popular technology, eventually, years down the road they will drop a little. You may find a good deal on one during a black Friday sale or maybe even a good used one on eBay or Facebook. There are other brands out there that are not as expensive. The lowest level Fitbit may not be that expensive but you will pay a premium price for the top of the line one. ",
