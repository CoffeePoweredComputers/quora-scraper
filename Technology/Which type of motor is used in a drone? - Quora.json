            "answer_text": "Hi there! In general, there are two types of motors used in multirotors (drones). Brushed: (aka: DC, coreless) This motor is commonly found in practically all toy-grade multirotors, such as the Syma X5, Blade Nano QX, UDI 818A, etc. Even the Parrot AR Drone uses coreless motors. Smaller versions of the coreless motor look like tall shiny silver spraypaint cans. If your multirotor is bigger than your palm, and it uses gears to transfer motor power to the propellers, its probably got coreless motors. Pros: Coreless motors are cheap to manufacture, simple to wire, compact, and lightweight. Cons: Coreless motors have a short lifespan, depending on its size. (The larger the motor, the longer it usually lasts.) The ones used in toy quads generally have between 0 - 6 hours of total run-time before they burn out. Coreless motors are also not as powerful as the brushless motors mentioned below. (Though this makes coreless motors safer around kids, pets, walls, etc.) Tips: Coreless motors will last longer if they\u2019re first \u201cburnt in\u201d by running them on low throttle for their first few flights. Also since heat is the archenemy of coreless motors, I would recommend to not run your coreless motors for more than 6 minutes non-stop, as the heat generated beyond this time will reduce the lifespan of your motors. If you\u2019re planning to buy a toy-grade multirotor, try to look for ones that have plug-in wires for their motors, so that it\u2019ll be easier for you to replace them (Some quads that have this are the Syma X8, Tarantula X6, and Blade Inductrix.) The AR Drone has these fancier plug-in type motors, but they are rather expensive. Next up: 2. Outrunner Brushless:  These motors are the ones you\u2019ll usually find on photography multirotors like the DJI Phantom series, 3DR Solo, Yuneec Q500 series, Traxxas Aton, and in racing multirotors like the 250mm kit quadcopters. The appearance of brushless motors vary from manufacturer, but generally they are short and stout. Multirotors that use brushless motors pretty much always mount their propellers directly to the motor shafts. Pros: Brushless motors are very powerful, have excellent torque without needing to use gears, and have a very long lifespan if treated properly. Brushless motors can run non-stop for a much longer time than their coreless counterparts, without sufferig from heat damage (the heat may temporarily reduce the performance of brushless motors, to a degree, but once they cool down, their performance should revert to normal.) Cons: Brushless motors are more expensive than coreless motors, and require additional electronic components like ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers) to function. Due to the power of brushless motors, they are more dangerous to surrounding objects (like fingers). Tips: Brushless motors can last for years as long as their shafts do not become misaligned (such as in a crash. In cheaper brushless motors, this misalignment can result from poor manufacturing.) There are also lubricants that you can use to lube the motors, and make them last longer as well. Also be sure to keep sand, dirt, dust, and other foreign particles (besides air) from entering the motors, as this can severely damage the motors. Well, I hoped this answered your question! If any fellow Quorans would like to add, or correct me, please let me know! ",

            "answer_text": "This is like asking what type of motor is in road vehicle all types and names. You have gasoline internal combustion, electric, diesel, pedal power, steam, even jet. Same with drones. If it can be used to create propulsion, you can find it in a drone. But first, you need to know what a drone is. In the commercial \u201ddrone\u201d industry, they are not referred to as drones for the most part. Drones are not meant to be recovered. (Target drones used for missile testing, cruise missles, satellites, deep space probes, etc\u2026) What we call those things that every ones calls a drone is, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or less often Autonomous vehicles. They have the capability to fly, with an auto pilot, with out human control. You can fly them manually, but you can also program the to fly on thier own. They can be any configuration from fixed wing aircraft, standard helicopter setup, multi rotor, blimp, whatever, as long as it flys. They can be big or small, from pocket sized to airliner sized. Thus, the motors used in drones are different on the specific UAV. You can even have the same basic aircraft with two different motor configurations, ie.. electric or gas depending on needs. So what motors are used on \u201cdrones\u201d? Turbine jet engines, internal combustion gas engines, brushless electric motors, articulating flapping wings\u2026\u2026. UAVs           ",
