            "answer_text": "It's generally believed amongst majority (?) of academics that Leonardo was probably gay or at least bi-sexual. And here's some of the \"for\" and \"against\" arguments on this issue: For: He never got married.The way he draw men in his artworks is very feminine. He had kept an apprentice Salai whom he treated with much affection despite being a less talented artist. Salai had remained in Leonardo's household for many years.Leonardo had taken another student, a nobleman, later in his life. Francesco Melzi who has been described as \"Italian gentleman living with master Leonardo\".He was accused of sodomy in 1467, the charge was dismissed and no further charges against him were filed.Florence (and Italy in general) during early and high Renaissance were somewhat open to homosexual activities. Yes you can get prosecuted for sodomy and yes it is considered sin in Catholic church, but there are many records of people (noblemen, even clergies, even Popes) engaging in homosexual activities, keeping male lovers and such and the general consensus seemed to be OK with it as long as you don't go over the top with it. Marsilio Ficino, the great neo-Platonic scholar whom Da Vinci, no doubt, had met in Lorenzo il Magnifico's circle, was a gay man and a priest who wrote love letters to his student. His platonic homosexual relationship with his live in student wasn't a secret, although he was never prosecuted probably because of Medici protection as well as his own pristine reputation. I imagine Da Vinci, being a handsome young man in his youth, living in Florence, might have at least experimented with homosexual activities and maybe even have a few relationships.Against: A lot of other artists never married. It doesn't mean they were gay. Botticelli was never married (but he's also rumored to be gay).Yes he draw rather feminine looking male characters, but personal art style doesn't mean anything in sexual orientation.His indulgence of Salai and taking other students could very well be affections from a father/big brother figure to a son/little brother. There probably nothing sexual happening between them.Sodomy was frequently used as a \"go-to\" accusation if you want to smear someone. A lot of people were being accused of sodomy at the time and not all of them were true.Florence was relatively open to homosexuality at the time, doesn't mean Leonardo himself actually did anything.So, there are evidence to support both side, and like other history mysteries, you'll just have to make up your own mind. This is what I think: Leonardo was gay. His male characters pretty much screams \"gay!!!\" to me. He and Michelangelo were both gay, or at least bi-sexual. He had a relationship with Salai, and Salai took advantage of him. He later probably had another relationship with Melzi. He was accused of Sodomy because he probably end up exploring his sexuality in one of those backstreet orgies and got reported with his other young friends. Note: So I don't really have any data to back up my claim of \"majority of academics\". But from what I read, and when I was studying art history, it seems majority of the professors I talked to, majority of the books I've read all accept the possibility that Leonardo might very well be gay. So the attitude is \"yeah, he might be... but we don't know for sure... there's strong implication, but we don't know for sure... if you want to believe he's not, be my guest, but I think he probably is\" that kind of conversation.

            "answer_text": "Fefei Wang has pretty much said most of what I think. I personally think the evidence for his homosexuality is too overwhelming. Please remember he lived in a time when it was not ok to be openly gay & it was a serious offence (carrying the death penalty). Under such circumstances any person would have gone to great lengths to hide their sexuality, especially if one experiences a traumatic inquiry about it at an young age. It is surprising that we find any accounts of this issue at all since it was considered a social taboo & stigmatised issue, so any evidence saying so can't be taken lightly. 1. The Sodomy Charge: The most overt evidence we know today is the sodomy charge. Leonardo along with 3 three other friends was accused of sodomising Jacopo Salteralli (a known male prostitute) by an anonymous denunciation. One of his other friends accused was Leonardo Tornabuoni from the aristocratic house of Tornabuoni, a family close to the Medici's. The charge can't be taken lightly since both the Leonardo's were of reputed families & considerable power, whoever made the charge knew the risks if they were to be caught. Further Lorenzo il Magnifico may have intervened in having the charges dismissed.2. Celibacy: Many known artists of the Renaissance were unmarried but very few were 'celebit'. It is pausible that this childhood trial had a lasting trauma on Leonardo, coercing him to be more discreet. Leonardo never married, his only known written  account about carnal relations is saying that (in a loose sense) it is disgusting & if it wasn't so pleasurable the human species would have gone extinct.3. Salai:  Leonardo's student Salai (meaning little devil) lived with him for 30 years. This is despite the fact that Leonardo writing that he was a \"a thief, a liar, stubborn & a glutton\" within one year of taking him under his tutelage. Salai is known to have ran away on five separate occasions, after stealing from da Vinci. His only positive attribute seems to have been his good looks. 4. Psychiatry: Many psychiatrists on detailed examination of his charecter agree that he was most likely homosexual. Including the famous psychiatrist of the 20th century Dr Sigmond Freud. ",
