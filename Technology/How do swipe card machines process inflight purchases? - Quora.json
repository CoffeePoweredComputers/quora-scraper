            "answer_text": "It depends on the flight and airline. Airlines which have in-flight internet like Gogo likely authorize the transaction in flight using that internet connection, but planes which do not have in-flight internet do not piggy back any other data via existing radio-based communications. They simply store-and-forward the transaction until the plane lands and they can get a live authorization. But what about declines? They simply take the risk that on a low ticket transaction of an in-flight purchase it will clear. Passengers don't know it's not authorizing in realtime, so they generally won't hand over a card that they know would decline. ",

Adding credit card processing data onto that stream would barely register. What protocol is used in sending that data is a good question. It could be via radio, internet, etc.  There are a few different options, though I'm not sure of the most commonly used one. ",
