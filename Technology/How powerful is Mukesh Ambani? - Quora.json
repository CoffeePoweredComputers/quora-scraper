            "answer_text": "Well how powerful is Mukesh Ambani? In the picture his reaction is also like \u201cYou are asking how powerful I am?, well it's beyond imagination of common folks like you\u201d  Controls a large chunk of India's economy:- India is one of the largest economies in the world and his conglomerate RIL controls 2.8% of India's economy , it may look neglible but it's huge in reality, he also provides employment to a large number of workforce directly and indirectly which also gives him a lot of political leverage.  Recent example of his political leverage is removal of RBI governer Urjit Patel because according to some sources he refused to give loans to RIL due to economic reasons.  His contacts and friendships :- Well we all know that daughter of Mukesh Ambani recently got married to Anand Piramal, the guest list just shows how powerful he is, some insights are Hilary Clinton  The former first lady of USA is known to attend very less personal family functions of other people but still she attended wedding of Isha Ambani and that too with full enthusiasm, which just shows how powerful and influential Mukesh Ambani is, if a person can have cold and professional former first lady of USA as guest for his daughter's wedding you definitely can count him as one of the most powerful person in the world. Bollywood celebrities  Well these celebrites are treated as demi gods by Indians and are hugely revered across the world, they also attended his daughter's wedding, not only that they also served food to the guests  The person who can make the very own Mahanayak and Badshah serve food in his daughter's wedding is definitely a powerful guy. The symbols of his wealth and power :- Well Mukesh Ambani is one of the richest person in the world and in modern day Wealth = Power, His wealth needs no introduction but still some insights into his humongous wealth :- His Residence i.e Antilia :- Second Most expensive private residence next only to Buckingham palace, worth $2 billion  His Transportation toys :- You would never see him in First class of best airlines let alone other classes as he has private jet collection worth around $200 million or 1500 crore ruppes     He won't travel in some common Audi or BMW, he will travel in the most luxurious and safest car this world can provide    When he feels to get into sea you won't see him in a small compact yacht he likes to sail in this big toy  Conclusion The power and Influence of Mukesh Ambani is beyond our imagination, he is one the richest and most powerful persons in the world , he has the ability to influence governments, Causing economic crashes, making or ruining lives, Making this world a better or worst place , he may not be as powerful as Trump, Putin or Modi but definitely powerful enough to have the ability to influence their decisions to some extent because of the stake he holds in national and international economy and scenario. Thank you and Namaste  ",

            "answer_text": "Mukesh ambani is a business wizard holding his position as the 5th richest person in the world with a $76.3B wealth in his pockets, just positioned after mark zuckerberg!!  The Asia's richest person gets richer by $31,202 every minute [1]and is 5 times richer than the second richest person- Radhakishan Damani!!  The person who holds around 50% of the stakes of India's first company, which has a m-cap of around 10 lakh crore, must be considered one of the most influential persons in the world..  The person, who could bring technology giants of US such as Intel, Qualcomm, Facebook and Google under it's business cloud along with more investment ventures, by just selling around 30% stakes of its flagship subsidiary(Jio platforms), should be considered a damn powerful person!!  Reliance industries accounts for a large chunk of revenue created for the GOI through taxes. It is the largest taxpayer, with around 2.5 lakh crore ($45B) paid to the GOI in the past 10 years. Just imagine, how strong the person would be, who could alter the plans of any central government!! RIL exported products worth Rs 16.8 lakh crore ($262 billion) over the last 10 years, while Reliance Foundation is India\u2019s single largest CSR spender. Just think, how strong foothold he is having in the hearts of this nation's economy!! [2] The person, who could reside in its own tower- Antilla, tagged as the world's expensive residential tower($1\u20132B), must be thought how powerful he could be\u2026  How much you can afford to give to your wife, a makeup set, a nice furniture, a car, a flat, a villa on her b'day- right?? But can you ever think of gifting your wife a full fledged commercial Airbus?? Never. Mukesh ambani did so. He has gifted A319 luxurious jet valued at 400 crores to his wife..[3]  Just see the badshah and chocolate boy grooving on the occasion of Mukesh ambani's daughter's wedding\u2026  Mukesh ambani owns the biggest footballing league- ISL being organised in this country, you could evaluate his wealth by this also!!  Ambani's wealth is greater than the entire GDP of Tanzania. In fact, his net worth is greater than the GDPs of Latvia, Botswana, and Niger \u2014 combined. Just think how wealthy he is!! And we all know that wealth is power\u2026[4]  Ambani owns around 168 cars of almost every known brand and 2 choppers which can land on his own tower's top, because of the helipads made over there!!  I always admire Mukesh ambani as the perfect and most clever business minds india has ever produced!! Just think the man, who could bring the technology behemoths under it's business clouds, the man who could create leaps and bounds through his Jio platforms, the man who could have Hilary Clinton, the former first lady of US and of Democrat party, as his guest in his daughter's wedding, the man who could make 22 important and strategic acquisitions for laying out it's Jiomart for full strength in just 3\u20134 weeks, the man who could allure US president and republican party member donald trump with his talks, then he can do anything!!!  This picture doesn't require a word!! Never underestimate the power of Mukesh Ambani, because if he wants something, he will have that anyhow!!!\ud83d\ude0e For pictures, source:- Google For content, source:- various sources!!
