            "answer_text": "Yes, in many cases it can be. By understanding exactly what you were dealing with, how it happened, and how you ended up being chosen for the role of intimate partner primary source is fundamental to the process. The IPPS is an empath. Either one from each of the 3 groups: 1 the codependent empath. This group is particularly hit hard by the narcissist, who knows how much abuse they will take, which is an incredible amount. Through fear of loss, it continues until he/she finally breaks. The escape will be due to outside influences, if accessible, or in extreme cases hospitalization. There will then be a respite period to allow the codependent to recuperate. Then, if the narcissist thinks it will be successful, they will ensnare again. And so it continues. Strong support/intervention by others is so necessary regarding these individuals. Sadly, this scenario could result in death. 2 the empath. This group is the bread and butter type individual for the narcissist. Not codependent, but plenty of love and energy supply for them to feed on in any case. They might have a magnetic quality about them, or be so determined to heal and take care of the narcissist. Believing with time, patience and support, everything will come good. Which of course, it doesn't. Hoovering may be relatively easy following escape or discard, if the empath hasn't completely let go. Its a different dynamic to the codependent. This group are loving souls because they just want to love. 3 the super empath. This group will love, be patient and care for the narcissist. Nothing is too much trouble. Until they run out of patience. They unleash their own narcissistic traits, and really will put themselves first. They will challenge the narcissist and this will be very hard for he/she to accept. They might even enjoy this challenge, as it will be seen as an opportunity to acquire more energy supply. A taste of their own medicine will be dished out, and the narc will feel the anger that was so well hidden up to this point. The super empath's empathic traits far outweigh their narcissistic traits, but when they are unleashed, they really are unleashed. It's a shock to the narc, who will find it hard to accept their choice of victim was wrong. Depending on if there is more mileage left in their entanglement or not will be the deciding factor, if the super empath goes back for another round. Once they've decided it's done, then it's done. So, depending on which group the survivor belongs to will have great impact on their recovery. The roots go deeper in the sense that many empaths, not all, were raised in narcissistic environments. The narc parent noticed their child was an empath, therefore would absorb the abuse coming their way. Myself personally, have been a codependent empath in the past due to an abusive upbringing. Healing is a lifelong project, and can only be done in manageable chunks. I'm just embarking on my next therapy course. This time it's something different I've not tried before, so feel positive. I'm now a super empath and it's great to be in control. In control of me! ",

            "answer_text": "Can you know the value of Light without the Dark? Can you understand what empowerment feels like without first feeling helpless? Can you feel happiness without knowing what despair feels like? Can you look into another human being\u2019s tear filled eyes and truly grasp their pain without going through your own first? The narcissist was the catalyst for your healing, for your advancement as a powerful healer and creator of Love and Light. We just didn\u2019t know it. Stop and look around you. Everything in your life has been perfectly designed for me to write this to you and for you to be reading it at this moment. There are no accidents. And the narcissist was not an accident either, but was instead a way for you to learn how to transmute, to take an enormous, mind altering amount of pain, unlike anything you\u2019d ever experienced in your life and turn it into good. A pain so shattering and confusing that still, we really don\u2019t have a way to convey it to those who haven\u2019t experienced it yet, as our lexicon doesn\u2019t have the words to explain it. How is it that there are thousands of us on Quora talking about the same thing that our world doesn\u2019t really \u201cget\u201d yet but we all get it for each other at a heart level of understanding? I see you. I know what you have suffered and I know that you see me as well. That is human growth. That is an advancement of our human species to understand, reflect and reach out to one another to facilitate and process healing for ourselves and other\u2019s suffering. And it was all done over a little narcissist. So yes, I fully believe that not only is the mental damage caused by a narcissist fully repairable, I\u2019ll add that it\u2019s actually added another dimension of human love, of compassion of resiliency to our planet. Do not let your interaction with them go to waste, as they would want you to do by sitting in victimhood, by pining for them, by trying to get them to understand what they have done. Cut them off at the knees and dedicate yourself to creating beauty where there is ugliness. Transmute: \u201cTo change in form, nature or substance.\u201d Every time you feel the sting of a horrible action they did to you go do something kind for someone else. Transmuted. Every time you feel those intense pains that come up from the trauma and abuse, SIT with them, feel them and go through them (something they\u2019re incapable of doing themselves), and GROW through that pain. Transmuted. Every time you want to argue with them, even energetically, to make them understand the impact of what they\u2019ve done to you, themselves and others. To get them to see the destruction they\u2019ve caused, go instead to that person who\u2019s reaching out to connect with you, to ask for your help or to get together with you. Connect. Transmuted. When you feel that boiling rage, that despair in your mind, that vitriol for revenge, go inside and pray for them, wish them well. Light a candle and watch the wick burn as you let that burning become the catalyst for you to heal. Transmuted. I will never give narcissists credit for any of this uplevelling, and I also will tell you that none of this was your fault. It\u2019s not fair what happened to you at all, but it is your responsibility to fix it. This is the only way I know of to heal. Every other way leaves the responsibility in the hands of a person who deserves zero energy from me, so I am the one that consciously takes that energy away and uses that energy on this planet for the complete antithesis of what that person is about. I hold the power.  ",
