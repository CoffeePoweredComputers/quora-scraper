            "answer_text": "Yes I do - primarily because I live in Europe Switzerland). The key Benefit of FSD is Navigate on Autopilot. In many European countries regulations make the NOA experience poor and not worth the money. E.g. Mandated delays in initiating lane change, mandated user confirmation with blinker, max g-force in turns, etc. A recurring mishap is traffic entering the highway you are driving on. The car is not allowed to shift lane on its own to give romm to merging cars - and the mandated delay in initiating lane change often makes it too late. The car then take a conservative approach and brakes hard! I would imagine this is a Europe specific problem. Unfurtunately, it is a regulatory issue and hence Tesla cannot fix it. ",

I think it was about $5K or something like that. Now I wish I had kept it in place. It will cost me about $10K to add AP and FSD after the fact. ",
