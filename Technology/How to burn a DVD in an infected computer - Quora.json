            "answer_text": "You burn it the same way you\u2019d do in a healthy computer, unless the virus is preventing you from doing it. But once I don\u2019t know what kind of viruses you\u2019ve got there, i suggest you, first of all, to scan your computer with a good antivirus and also an antimalware, in order to try to remove it, at least, from the majority of your files (assuming they are all infected, which is very unlikely). Then, you burn them into a DVD. Do not copy files with these extensions (assuming we\u2019re talking about a Windows PC): *.exe, *.dat, *.com, *.ini, *.bat, *.src, *.pif, *.lnk, *.vbs and some others. They usually will be back when you reinstall your OS and other softwares in a healthy way after formatting your PC. ",
