            "answer_text": "Verizon prepaid \u201cbudget\u201d phones are locked, they do not want people to buy cheap Verizon phones and then use it on some other carrier or resell them and make money. There still is a way to unlock it, you must contact Verizon customer service (see link below). I think you need to be using their Verizon service for at least 90 days in order to qualify. Another way to get it unlock is paying a 3rd party company to unlock it.. you'll have to search online or on eBay if they have the unlock codes for your particular phone model\u2026 basically, it's just someone who works at Verizon who has access to unlocking the phone and they're doing this to get extra money on the side. Verizon flagship phones for postpaid accounts should all already be unlocked.. Verizon says they do not lock their phones (except cheap budget phones like I mentioned). So you don't have to unlock your phone. But the thing is, if the phone has not been paid off and then you left Verizon, they will end up black listing the phone and it may not work (plus you will have a bad credit score since they have your credit information).. so you may not even be able to use or sell the phone. So just pay off the phone.. next time, don't buy things on credit if you can't pay it back or don't want to pay it back.. if your credit is bad, next time, you cannot sign up for a credit card or buy a phone through financing.

            "answer_text": "Verizon phones are not carrier locked. There is no unlock process to use them on different carriers; they already can. Verizon does however reserve the right to blacklist phones that are not paid for which may result in the phone being unable to be used at all anywhere until the debt is resolved. I wouldn't recommend going that direction. ",
