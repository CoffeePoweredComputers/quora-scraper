            "answer_text": "For launching a product or service or really any initiative it\u2019s imperative that you focus on building up a strong audience and Fanbase months before your lunch initiates. Too many companies and entrepreneurs focus on getting everything right with their unveiling that they forget to start and cultivate a community around the solution that this product or service offers. And that\u2019s my advice, start reaching out to your perfect persona months before I get started. And this can easily be achieved by sending a direct message to a new person that fits your persona once a day. Oh yes not everyone that you sent a direct message she will respond but that\u2019s OK, based on the law of averages about one in ten more respond. This will come in handy on product launch day, when you can send a message to each one of those people sounded interested to let them know about your launch. ",
