            "answer_text": "Having libraries full stop is a benefit that some schools still sadly don't have. I believe the benefits are: Access to a place to study some: children find it's a quiet place to do homework rather than a noisy home.Encourages a love of reading just by being there gives children access to books. Many school libraries also have reading groups and reading schemes for the children.It teaches children the Dewey system and how to carry out research. Many students do not know how to research using written material which makes university hard. Many school librarians teach children how to research.Teaches responsibility: you always have library helpers or prefects that help look after the library.It can be a great place to make friends out of the playground. Quieter students have a safe place to go.It shows the schools dedication to literacy. A good library shows they wish to promote reading.It has other resources for students to try. It can acquire from it's local schools library service items to help sen students such as audio books, large print and dyslexia orientated books to name a few.It encourages interests as children have easy access to books on hobbies etc.Everything in the library is age appropriate for the students at the school. So they have books allowing them to progress in their reading levels. A good school librarian should be able to guide them allowing them to progress naturally.",

            "answer_text": "Your school library encourages curiosity, innovation and problem-solving. It is integral to the cultural and social life of the school. The school library is a central point for all kinds of reading, cultural activities, access to information, knowledge building, deep thinking and lively discussion. Research shows the significant difference well-resourced libraries can make to student learning outcomes. School libraries impact studies \u2014 studies conducted by the Library Research Service of Colorado State Library and other researchers. Your library\u2019s collections, services and environment are all designed to help your school meet its targets and goals for raising student achievement. Record your vision and principles for managing your library in your school's library guiding documents. Library guiding documents \"We hope that libraries will always exist as places for learners to find information, resources, services, and instruction. But formats, technologies, learning needs, and our schools are evolving. And so are students themselves. Our entire information and communication landscapes have shifted \u2014 and this shift will only continue.\" Enriching teaching and learning programme The school library is uniquely positioned to take a school- and curriculum-wide view of resourcing and technology for learning. Library staff are valuable members of curriculum planning and instruction teams within the school. They have a broad knowledge of inquiry models, information texts and tools, and literature to suit students at all levels. They also work with individual staff and students to understand their particular information or reading needs, then help them access the materials they need. Supporting inquiry learning \"The school library provides information and ideas that are fundamental to functioning successfully in today's information and knowledge-based society. The school library equips students with lifelong learning skills and develops the imagination, enabling them to live as responsible citizens.\" Supporting literacy and reading School libraries are places for learning and thinking. They play a key role in supporting and developing literacy and the enjoyment of reading. As Joy Cowley writes, 'A sanctuary, a mine of treasure, a house of maps to secret lives in secret worlds \u2026 \u2013 the library became my other home.' Reading engagement \u2014 contains strategies and ideas for creating a reader-friendly library. Valuing your unique school community The library is an integral part of the cultural and social life of your school. It can be a central point for people to read, join in cultural activities, and access information. Your library team understands what makes your school community unique. Library staff develop collections and services, and create a place that reflects and welcomes the diverse readers and learners within your school community. ",
