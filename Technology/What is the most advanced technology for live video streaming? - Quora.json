            "answer_text": "Anything that\u2019s \u201cMost Advanced\u201d today will be obsolete tomorrow, so technically the answers over here will never be accurate :) The current trend is P2P live streaming using server less CDN, sites and platforms like Facebook / Twitter Periscope / Twitch etc are experimenting with this as they deal with an massive amounts of simultaneous live streams starting and ending at any given time, considering that it\u2019s an end-user driven live streaming model. Traditionally games draw a massive amount of live streaming viewers but here the technology is in control as there is only 1 broadcast point and millions of viewer point. However for P2P it\u2019s multi-point streaming so it needs a different architecture setup and a network that can scale and handle this. Removing \u201cserver\u201d from the \u201cCDN\u201d and relying on Peer Points gives the technology to be flexible at any given location even if there are no CDN nodes present over there, and that\u2019s something these companies are looking to solve.
