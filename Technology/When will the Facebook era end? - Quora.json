            "answer_text": "In a sense, it\u2019s already dead (and resurrected!) Facebook 2017 has nothing to do with Facebook 2003. Facebook 2003 was a companion website to your Ivy league college experience. Now in 2017 Facebook is an ecosystem of apps. The turning point was somewhere in late 2013 when Zuckerberg decided to \u201cunbundle the big blue app\u201d. Facebook was no longer going to try to be the one single place where you\u2019d interact with your friends, the alpha and the omega. That\u2019s effectively when king Facebook died. Messenger took off on its own and reached a billion users. Instagram went from 200m to 700m. 2016 saw unexpected developments and raised questions as to how people consume information? what\u2019s the role of the newsfeed? How should Facebook interface with media? politicians? I\u2019m no longer at Facebook, so I don\u2019t know their answers to those questions, but my intuition is that it\u2019s going to be deeply transformative - the Facebook experience is going to be completely overhauled within the next two or three years. And reinvent itself. As one thing, but most likely, as many. Concepts like the newsfeed, the timeline which seem so deeply intertwined with the nature of Facebook are not eternal; they are both old (2006, 2011) and transient. Nothing is sacred at Facebook really, not the colors, the iconography, the fonts, the vocabulary\u2026 every part of the experience will change. So the days of the Facebook service we\u2019re familiar with are numbered, it\u2019s not going to die overnight but features are going to be gradually replaced and in a few years it will be almost entirely different. It won\u2019t die because people will stop using it but because Facebook (the company) will replace it by something else. As to, will people eventually stop using products made by Facebook, my personal guess is that it\u2019s unlikely in the next decades. It would take a major technological shift that the company would completely miss. Failing that it is really well equipped (and most importantly well funded) to face the future. ",

            "answer_text": "Facebook has spread like an infectious disease but we are slowly becoming immune to its attractions, and the platform will be largely abandoned by 2017, say researchers at Princeton University (pdf).The forecast of Facebook's impending doom was made by comparing the growth curve of epidemics to those of online social networks. Scientists argue that, like bubonic plague, Facebook will eventually die out.The social network, which celebrates its 10th birthday on 4 February, has survived longer than rivals such as Myspace and Bebo, but the Princeton forecast says it will lose 80% of its peak user base within the next three years.John Cannarella and Joshua Spechler, from the US university's mechanical and aerospace engineering department, have based their prediction on the number of times Facebook is typed into Google as a search term. The charts produced by theGoogle Trends service show Facebook searches peaked in December 2012 and have since begun to trail off.\"Ideas, like diseases, have been shown to spread infectiously between people before eventually dying out, and have been successfully described with epidemiological models,\" the authors claim in a paper entitled Epidemiological modelling of online social network dynamics.\"Ideas are spread through communicative contact between different people who share ideas with each other. Idea manifesters ultimately lose interest with the idea and no longer manifest the idea, which can be thought of as the gain of 'immunity' to the idea.\"Facebook reported nearly 1.2 billion monthly active users in October, and is due to update investors on its traffic numbers at the end of the month. While desktop traffic to its websites has indeed been falling, this is at least in part due to the fact that many people now only access the network via their mobile phones.For their study, Cannarella and Spechler used what is known as the SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) model of disease, which creates equations to map the spread and recovery of epidemics.They tested various equations against the lifespan of Myspace, before applying them to Facebook. Myspace was founded in 2003 and reached its peak in 2007 with 300 million registered users, before falling out of use by 2011. Purchased by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp for $580m, Myspace signed a $900m deal with Google in 2006 to sell its advertising space and was at one point valued at $12bn. It was eventually sold by News Corp for just $35m.The 870 million people using Facebook via their smartphones each month could explain the drop in Google searches \u2013 those looking to log on are no longer doing so by typing the word Facebook into Google.But Facebook's chief financial officer David Ebersman admitted on an earnings call with analysts that during the previous three months: \"We did see a decrease in daily users, specifically among younger teens.\"Investors do not appear to be heading for the exit just yet. Facebook's share price reached record highs this month, valuing founder Mark Zuckerberg's company at $142bn. ",
