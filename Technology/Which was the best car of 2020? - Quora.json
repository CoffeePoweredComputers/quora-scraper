As a \u201cRight to Work\u201d state, we have attracted these companies here. The new $1.6 Billion Toyota plant will hire up to 4,500 workers, and built up to 350,000 SUV\u2019s a year. FIAT builds it\u2019s Chrysler products in Brampton, Ontario and Saltillo, Mexico. Ford will only be building Mustangs this year. UAW Motors, was GM, is now owned by the United Auto Workers, so I won\u2019t buy those. Maybe we can get Tesla to move here also? California only has one auto manufacturer left, Tesla. Michigan only builds Jeeps and Ram trucks according to Google? Who\u2019d have thought Alabama would build more vehicles that Michigan? More accomplishments by the Democrats? ",

I love my Cadillac Escalade ESV, it will do many things that a Veyron can\u2019t, nowhere close, but it isn\u2019t going to show up on very many people\u2019s list of Best Cars. Then one must consider such factors as reliability, longevity, freedom from routine maintenance demands, and cost of ownership. ",
