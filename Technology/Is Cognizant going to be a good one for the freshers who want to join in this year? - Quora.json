            "answer_text": "Cognizant or any other IT service mass recruiter like Tech Mahindra, Infosys, TCS & Wipro are good for you as a fresher if you want to live with following for the first 1-2 years of your career- Flat Learning curve: These companies will give you so called trainings for months which is limited to the set of services needed by their clients. So after a couple of months you realize that you don\u2019t learn anything new whereas the first couple of years of your career should be inclined towards learning as much as possible on the job.Sit on the bench: Most of these IT service companies hire massively college freshers to showcase bench strength to their foreign clients. So it is quite possible that you might be sitting on the side fence & waiting to start real industry work for many monthsLow CTC: Most of these companies would pay you between 2.5\u20133 LPA to begin with which is the standard because of surplus labor supply available as millions of freshers come out each year. If you look at starting salaries 10 years ago, you will be suprised to know they are still at the same level +-10%. So with inflation & fall in money value, you still earn the same which in turn means you can afford lot less today.Dream for a US Onsite: With Mr. Trump passing orders restricting H1B visas, the honeymoon of Indian IT engineers who join these mass recruiters with dreams to work in US someday, is kinda over. The odds are heavily stacked against you.Slow career growth- The rule of thumb is that it takes 2\u20135 years to enter into the next level after promotion. There can be exceptions based on your excellency in performance.Instead had i been in your place, i would learn some coding which is sufficient to get me hired in a product based startup & live with the following- Steep Learning curve- With a small team & tons of problems to crack, i will get higher responsibilty & learning which cannot be matched by a big organization. The speed of decision making & flexibility will lead to enhanced rates of know-how acquisition & applicationRoller coaster career- It is quite possible that the startup you join scales up, raises funding & you get promoted in like 6 months. It is also equally possible that your startup shuts down in 6 months. In any case, the skills you acquire with such a steep learning curve will give you lot of lessons to learn even if the outcome is failure. This will help you find the next role. You can afford high risk high return roller coaster in initial 1\u20132 yrs of your career when responsibilities are low.CTC+ESOPs- Many startups will pay you better than most of the mass recruiters, but some will pay you at an equal rate & offer ESOPs to compensate for the rest. Here you can learn how to analyze a product or business along with the team running the show. If you think the idea & execution will scale up, always go for ESOPs as they can be worth decades of you salary in couple of yearsOne thing which i can tell you for sure based on my experience is that there are much better alternatives available in terms of technologies & roles you can spend initial years of your career in & i have built a platform to help you find one at edWisor | Get Skilled Get Hired. Wish you luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, at this point, the outlook doesn\u2019t look like it, but from personal experience, I\u2019d suggest you join them, if an offer is made. The IT industry as a whole is undergoing a major technology shift and Cognizant is in the midst of it. It has been able to predict the future of where the technology is heading and has already put it in place. They have a vision of Digital 2020, where in all their offerings are going to go the digital way, and that\u2019s being practiced with clients as well as the staff. Additionally, they also have good emerging technologies that they are working on, and you could get a chance to work on them as well. At this juncture, in the IT industry, Cognizant is the best performer, followed by TCS and Infosys. This is even though they have a significant exposure in the Banking, Finance and Insurance sector, which was terribly hit after Brexit and the American elections. ",
