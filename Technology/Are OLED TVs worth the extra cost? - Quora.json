            "answer_text": "Yes and no. It all depends upon what you normally watch. Before I answer, let me explain. Pepe Vera Campello has explained it amply (full on/full off vs. backlit pixel) but perhaps failed to explain how it affects the viewing. As Pepe explained, the OLED panel has organic LEDs that are individually lit. They can be turned ON to show the full colour or fully OFF to show black. On the other hand the LED TV is not really an LED TV - it is an LCD TV backlit by LED - back light is usually from the side. The LED back light (white) is always ON and this causes the LCDs to leak some light even when a particular pixel should not show any colour. So the entire panel is deep greyish but never fully black. On the other hand OLED (and previous generation Plasma panels) can be fully black (near black as perfect black is not possible). So how does this affect viewing? Not many people realise or know this but black is THE MOST IMPORTANT colour in video. If black is not black but a deep shade of grey then all other colours are WASHED OUT by the same degree. All traditional LED TVs suffer from a degree of wash out. They compensate this by vivid colour mode (enhancing R-G-B). Video, especially cinema, has a lot of blacks, shadows, etc. When black is not black, the video is washed out, the details in the shadows are washed out, etc. So OLED is REALLY worth if you watch a lot of cinema - either streamed or Blu Ray. Movies contain a lot of black - one does not realise this when immersed in the movie. You wish to watch the Dark Knight series or Harry Potter (movie 5 onwards), Sherlock Holmes (2009 movie and its sequel) then OLED will enhance your experience. Then again, not all movies are shot in darkness. For those, OLED does not matter. Soap Operas, TV programs, News, etc., are not a concern because they are shot in brilliantly lit studios or sets. If you are watching the typical daytime soap operas, The Big Bang Theory, re-runs of Seinfeld, Friends, etc., then OLED does not matter, although you will still get a better experience. Pepe also mentioned alternatives like Samsung QLED. The Quantum Dot technology is an alternative to OLED and what it does mainly is using direct backlit LED with local dimming. This enhances viewing and because of local dimming, sections of the entire LCD panel can be turned off, etc. But QLED is almost the same price (just a little lower) than OLED TV of the same size. So decide what is your primary source of TV video and then buy accordingly. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWorth\u201d is a value proposition, and every buyer has to answer that for himself. Is a Bugatti Chiron worth $3M? Ask anyone who bought one and I\u2019m sure the answer is yes. Is a Gulfstream G-650 worth $70M or more? Again, everyone who owns one will tell you it is. These are extreme examples, and a real-world example in the home theater world would probably be a high end digital projector such as Sony\u2019s flagship VPL-VW995ES ($35K) or maybe a very esoteric system consisting of a stack of high-end, vintage CRT projectors, meticulously calibrated and aligned, in a perfectly light controlled room \u2014 but my point is this- OLED TVs are the pinnacle of display technology at the consumer level. Picture quality doesn\u2019t get any better. Properly calibrated, with well-produced 4K content and a proper screen size to viewing distance ratio, an OLED TV is second to none. It is mesmerizingly spectacular. Having said that, would I buy an OLED TV? Not as my primary display. The largest OLED TV is currently 77\u201d. The optimal viewing distance for a 77\u201d (1.78:1 aspect ratio) screen is a little over 6 feet. (Home Theater Calculator/Optimizer) No way the wife is going to go for the necessary furniture placement to make that happen in our living room, but if you\u2019re willing to take a (small) extra/guest bedroom and turn it into a dedicated theater room, it could work. When the price comes down to about 1/4 of current levels, I might be able to justify replacing the 65\u201d plasma that serves as my secondary display (the one my 120\u201d screen drops down in front of for serious viewing) \u2014 but for a display that is only used for casual viewing with relatively high levels of ambient light, it\u2019s hard to justify spending $6K or more. Bottom line, if you have the budget and your primary focus is picture quality, OLED is the way to go. But if your primary focus is on an immersive home theater experience \u2014 as it absolutely should be \u2014 then your viewing distance will probably dictate a front projection system and good light control.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say no. There must be a clear statement about OLED here: an OLED panel can show true blacks for the simple reason that the pixel that is meant to remain black is not lit, thus rendering a truly black feeling out of it. It is seen as very black because it is not lit. An LCD panel that is backlit (it is not OLED) is always lit, so blacks are also lit and are seen as black, but somehow greyish. This said, an OLED panel is always better in that sense of depth and color definition because of its blacks and the impression of strong saturation, but the cost demand today is too much moved by hype. Still you will get each year some new nicety, some new something, that will render today\u2019s TV much cheaper even being OLEDs themselves. So if you want to but a very good TV today, there\u2019s plenty of very good options that are not OLED, like Samsung QLED (those are backlit as well) or some other options. If you want to go for OLED, just buy next year this year\u2019s model. It will be a very good OLED (as you perceive it today) and you will save money. Or if you do not care money, just buy the best you can: it will likely be an OLED panel. To me, and for a domestic TV for a living room, the difference is not proportional to the added cost: there are too many good LCD panels today. ",

            "answer_text": "In my mind they are substantially better than the best LCD TV that I have seen, and I see more than the average number of TVs in my line of work. I purchased my LG OLED B7V not because I wanted a 4K TV but because I wanted the most beautiful image I could afford. So, is it worth the extra cost? That depends on how much you value money and quality. Personally I think I paid a bit too much, I didn't buy it at peak price but still not cheaply and although I used a windfall of money to buy it, it still hurt to pay that much. Do regret it? No, but I would have been delighted to pay substantially less. OLED TVs are getting a little cheaper all the time, not dramatically so, but incrementally as volumes increase. But as with anything technology, there is always another sale down the road so the best time to buy is when you want it enough and can afford it without sacrifice. ",

You have to choose for yourself if the cost difference is worth it to you. Part of the equation is the size of the monitor you\u2019re purchasing. The larger the screen size, the more noticeable the picture improvement between LCD and OLED. So if you are buying a 40\u2033 TV, you\u2019re much less likely to notice a difference with OLED than if you are considering a 60\u2033 or larger monitor. As a home theater aficionado, I often upgrade to new technologies that will satisfy my desire for perfection. Very few people share my obsession or appreciate some of the improvements I make. Nonetheless, it\u2019s worth it to me. ",

If you wan\u2019t to save a little money and don\u2019t care about owning the very newest set, wait a few months and look for one new in box on model year closeout.

First and foremost, if you are living paycheck to paycheck and dont have thousands of dollars to cover bills for 2\u20133 months then you should not be dropping $2k+ on a TV. If you watch a lot of news channels or anything with a stagnant information bar on the screen then this will cause burn-in, and you should not get an OLED TV. If you watch mostly sports or cable/satallite TV shows then an OLED TV wont give you a significant improvement in picture quality over a medium end TV. It is if you watch a lot of 4k movies with HDR (preferably 10 bit) where the OLED will really make a difference. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely better than the regular LED or LCD panels. The colors are punchier with deeper blacks. Power consumption is lower due to the ability of turning off individual pixels. If you are someone who appreciates good picture clarity a good 4K OLED TV is a sure visual treat. Wait for a good bargain when you buy one since prices are drastically reducing. ",

            "answer_text": "OLED technology provides the best color quality and contrast out of all the types, so there is some value in the money that you spend on them. They are also much harder to manufacture with lower batch yields, making them more expensive than other technologies. OLED\u2019s worth is dependent on your budget and how much you are willing to part with. Practicality is, of course, another story. ",

            "answer_text": "The excellent processing technologies make OLED TV worth extra money in some cases although LG is really putting forth the effort in processing capability in 2018/2019. While OLED TVs are still more expensive than good 4K LED TVs, the gap has narrowed. Check and compare OLED TV price in Nepal. ",

If price is no consideration at all, buy an OLED TV. Just plan on replacing the OLED TV every couple of years since the OLED screen will have images permanently burned into the LEDs. ",
