            "answer_text": "Worth is completely subjective. In motorcycles, it\u2019s doubly subjective. Motorcycles are rarely calculated, rational decisions, especially in the West, where cars are cheap and common. People buy what they buy based on emotions. So, they may be worth it to you. You might have enough money that the extra expense is not a big deal. That also likely means you aren\u2019t buying a used bike, and probably that you aren\u2019t going to keep a bike around for a decade. You only use your bike for commuting. You are a tech head after latest and greatest. You like the \u201cgreen\u201d aspect. You want an electric bike, and that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s a valid rationale for getting one. To me, they are not. At least not yet. Comparing electric and gas motorcycles head to head, purely in terms of cost and utility, dino burners win. You can see a fairly detailed comparison I made here: Mike Shurkin's answer to What kind of range and performance do electric motorcycles have, and how do they compare to similar sized internal combustion engine powered bikes? The summary of that is that e-motorbikes cost anywhere from 1.5 to 3 times of a comparable gas bike and almost universally have shorter range. Yes, electricity is cheaper than gas in dollars per mile, but the difference in purchase price will keep you fueled for more thousands of miles than most people ever ride a single bike. E-motos also come with specific drawbacks of long charge times and huge difference in range between high and low speed. Gas bikes also last a long time, requiring relatively cheap repairs to put even a decades old one back on the road. An old electric bike is low maintenance or a while, but once the main battery goes, it\u2019s nothing but a liability, with parts either unavailable, or costing on par with a whole new bike. Being an enthusiast of old broken bikes, I am keeping track of the beater e-motos I come across. You can see some details here: Cheap Electromotion ",

            "answer_text": "As an owner of an electric motorcycle: Yes. I also have a gas bike. That said, I tend to ride the electric motorcycle more. There are several reasons: Maintenance. The only two \u201cintervals\u201d for the bike is a new drive belt at 50,000 miles, and changing the tires/brakes as needed.Instant on. No need to warm up. No need to winterize it. No need for a battery tender, because you plug it up anyways.Can go on short trips without worrying about the increased wear of the startup period of a gas bike.Don\u2019t have to stop for gas. For 99% of my riding the bike has twice the range I need.No clutch so no stalling the bike is always at peak power in turns.Easier to ride in slow traffic.Does not overheat in slow traffic.Has a frunk in place of the gas take that can hold 4 20-ounce drinks, a healthy choice meal, small tools, etc.Center of gravity is extremely low.Electric is all about convenience. Sometimes I crave the experience of a gas bike, but more often I crave the experience of my electric bike. And the electric bike is still fun to ride. It is just a different kind of fun. Edit: In June 2019, a month after I posted this, my bike stopped working. Something electrical. Took it four months to get it fixed. Thankfully it was covered under warranty. My views have shifted somewhat. I still think electrical motorcycles are worth it, as long as they don\u2019t break. If they break, not so much. Gas motorcycles have an advantage in that respect. The technology is more mature, and if something does fail there are more dealerships that can fix it \u2014 in much less time \u2014 or you could fix it yourself. Most riders are not qualified to wrench on the electronics of an e-motorcycle. ",

            "answer_text": "Electric motorcycles, like electric cars can have both pros and cons. Pros- (as compared to conventional motorcycles) You may be able to get a EV rebate depending on the state you are living in.Quicker response and higher speeds because there are no gears like the conventional motorcycles do.Relatively lower emissionsLower maintenance costs because of a lower number of wearing parts.High cool factor that kinda makes the motorcycle special.Cons - Sound - For most of the motorcycle purists (myself included) this is a major con. We love loud pipes.Safety - also related to sound. People in cars might not be able to hear you and idiot drivers may run you over. Loud pipes save lives.Battery - does the company making the electric motorcycles offer something like the Tesla supercharger network? How long does it take to fully charge? How much money per KWH? How many miles can you get out of one full charge and how many days can you keep your motorcycle parked without losing the battery charge.Service intervals - This still appears to be somewhat debatable in the motorcycling world. Because electric motorcycles are relatively new and so there is no widely accepted set period for service intervals.Higher insurance rates - electric vehicles tend to have a little bit higher insurance rates.To conclude - to each their own! Some may feel they are worth it and others may not. This may change once the electric motorcycle tech gets better as we go. For now, IMHO not worth it. ",

            "answer_text": "I own a Zero DS. If you are a serious biker adopting electric now, you will be a disappointed. What do I mean by serious biker? You use your motorcycle anytime you can, you prefer it to other things, you will use it to commute and you also use it for fun, you will also take long trips with it. The best electric bikes on the market are produced by Zero, a small independent manufacturer hailing out of NorCal. Their recent bike is called the Zero SRF, it costs around $20K  It is a pretty bike, but its design is not revolutionary or cutting edge, in-fact it is looks like a ER6N and a Ducati Monster. This is a let down for something that is supposed to represent the future. Picture a Tesla looking like a Camry. It can get up to 160 miles on a charge, it can charge in 80 minutes and it can reach 124mph. These numbers are all from Zero, which I believe will be difficult to replicate by a consumer. I have not reached anywhere near claimed numbers. Another thing to note is despite not having real statistics on Zero\u2019s reliability, a read through of Zero owner\u2019s facebook page is practical picture of Zero\u2019s reliability, from a series of small annoying problems to complete malfunctions. My out of pocket fixes post warranty has been around $1500 and the bike has also lost a lot of its range since I first bought mine in 2015. A casual rider or weekend warrior will not be disappointed by an electric bike unless it breaks down. A serious rider with loads of experience will inevitably be disappointed; from waiting during charges, being unable to maintain constant highway speed, always having to charge after highway rides and most of all disappointed that $20k will get you a BMW 1200 GS, a machine that will get you across continents without Having to charge. So are they worth it? Yes! If you are a casual rider with money or a serious rider as a second bike. ",

Is it worth seeing a first-run Marvel movie instead of a Bugs Bunny re-run, when they\u2019ll both keep you entertained ? Is it worth buying a $3M house when a $200K one will keep the rain off your head just as well ? A Louis Vuitton backpack over a generic from Costco ? Motorcycles are worth what we pay for them, and then we\u2019ll justify the expense to ourselves on emotional grounds to preserve our self-esteem. Currently I can justify a motorcycle over a car on utility - it\u2019s saving me $100/week in ferry fares, and more importantly, time - I don\u2019t have to wait in line, last week for 3 hours. I can also take it on my sailboat and get places I could not possibly have gone without. Justifying my electric bike over a secondhand gas one is harder. I happen to think it\u2019s a good thing to be emissions-free (hydroelectric here). I also think it\u2019s fun to ride and looks kind of cool, and it cost no more than some other bikes with similar low-speed performance that also look kind of cool. A fair number of people ask me about it and think so too, although it would be kind of awkward to start a conversation with \u201cGosh that\u2019s butt-ugly. How fast does it go ?\u201d The only drawbacks are range and recharge time. Recharge time is irrelevant if it\u2019s charged by morning. Range is entirely adequate for me to get to work and back twice, or across to the island on the ferry. I only took my gas DR200 on one long trip in ten years, which killed it - that\u2019s not justification for me to buy a tourer. ",

If you are happy using your Electric motorcycle as City Vehicle, or only do tours that work with the range, it could be nice. If you use it alot and safe on fuel Costs, it may even be worth it economically, though i kinda doubt it. Features wise, they are 3\u20136k more expensive than very comparable motorcycles , that may have a bit less power given the instant torque Thing. So im not gonna say they have an equally strong engine, just hp number. Thing is, These Electric motorcycles are rather heavy(230\u2013300kg for 100hp), and you would expect lighter from an expensive naked or sportsbike. The big Problem is range. 100\u2013200km. In the very heavy(300kg) energica, probably 120\u2013150km moved sporty. at least 100 is what i heard. That would suck with fuel already. Not a vacation bike. not an Exploration bike,always Keep the charging Station in mind. The roads and places i like to visit are so far away it would last me to get there,turn around, drive back, that is it. Charging takes too Long. No tours with others. So. Yeah. Range is the big Problem, making it worth it only for some People. Paying next to Nothing for the riding itself, if you charge at home, could be very enjoyable and if i had plenty Money, i might do that. But. It is a second motorcycle, because i want to ride a bit longer and not worry. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe if you have a driveway to charge it overnight and use it to work, i.e. as a deliveroo rider or short commutes. But in that case you need to spend \u00a310K in a bike that can easily reach 50 mph, so you're better off buying a cbf125 for a third of the price (400 miles with a tank). Otherwise no chance. You spend 3K on a 4 cylinder bike and can cruise at 70 mph using about 60% of the engine's capability. It takes 5 minutes to fill up the tank without getting off the bike. Most of us buy motorcycles because of their engines. Some like V Twins, such as the Suzuki SV650, some like 4 cylinders, some like single cylinders and some like electric engines. It's about the sound, the performance, the subtle differences between them. I personally think that the sound of the Kawasaki ZX14R is a symphony played by a cello orchestra. Finally, if you care about the environment, the planet, the oceans and the global warming then best to stay away from electric vehicles. Internal combustion engine is the future of motorisation, and if governments keep building heavy regulation against them we will need to unite and fight back. ",

            "answer_text": "They seem rather pointless too me. If it were not for the really expensive batteries they\u2019d be great for delivery drivers, short urban commutes and such. However the cost of ownership will be insane for these things. The battery is most of the cost of the bike and it\u2019ll die 3\u20135 years in. 1,000 charges or there abouts. Then you are basically buying a whole new bike. For a couple thousand more you might as well buy a new bike. Disposable bikes like that are hard on the environment, way too costly for the people who might find them useful and will be an utter nightmare to repair, requiring very expensive special tools and advanced mechanical and diagnostic skills. As such electric bikes are a toy for the rich and not much more. Until they cost $4k or less brand new and $500 or used, they are utterly pointless. When that battery dies you are most likely selling it for scrap and you might get $50 of scrap value out of one. So why buy one? You can get a gas powered bike for less, work on it yourself, it\u2019ll run for years and years if you maintain it. You don\u2019t have such a severe range limit, or if you get a good one such severe cargo/passenger limitations. ",

When the battery is drained, you have to charge it, and that takes time and a charging station. If you live in an apartment, you\u2019ll have to route an extension cord - perhaps several extension cords - to get power to the motorcycle. Gas powered motorcycles can fuel up almost anywhere in about five minutes, and they can carry spare fuel as needed. Electric vehicles in general, won\u2019t really take off until you can stop at any gas station and swap a spent battery for a charged battery in about five minutes. Even then, something has to be done about the range. ",
