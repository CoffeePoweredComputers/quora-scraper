            "answer_text": "It is speculated that Apple will launch 4 devices on Oct 13, 2020 via their online event called \u201cHi Speed\u201d. The smallest one will be available with a 5.4\u2033 display and the largest one will be available with a 6.7\u2033 display. All 4 devices should come with OLED display screens, but the 6.1\u2033 Pro and 6.7\u2033 Pro Max should also have Super Retina displays. Both high end devices are likely to come with 512GB storage and both the low end devices should start from 64GB going up to 256GB. The 2 low end devices are likely to have multiple color options but the 2 high-end devices may not have as many color options. Except the date of the event, everything else is speculative and we will know only after launch. ",
