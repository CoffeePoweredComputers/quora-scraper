            "answer_text": "There are three Cloud technologies which are Software as a Service (SaaS)Platform as a Service (PaaS)Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)1. Software as a Service  It is a variant of the cloud computing platform which houses the software over a network connection via a third-party vendor. It is closely linked to the models for the delivery of application services. This reduces the need for organizations to mount the software in their on-site data centers. The service provider supplies customers with a single copy of an application based on customer-specific network access generated for that user. Types of SaaS include basic business systems such as Email, Customer Relation Management CRM, Management of Human Resource, Billing, etc. A number of IT specialists and C-level entities use SaaS. 2. Platform as a Service  PaaS is a type of cloud computing system in which a third-party vendor delivers hardware and software needed to develop an applications. User can house the applications in their own network, granting the user independence from downloading. For the delivery of sophisticated business applications, a business relies on PaaS. The cloud services will provide an application-optimized platform for the users to deploy ready-to-use applications. Leading PaaS providers are Google App engine and Red Hat OpenShift. 3. Infrastructure as a System  Infrastructure as a system is a concept implemented by outsourcing to provide enterprise-level systems that are more stable and centrally managed. It offers computing and other services including hardware, databases, data centers and storage. In some instances a program may be included as an extension. IaaS is a full network system that runs, deploys and maintains the hardware it delivers to the user. The consumer pays on a pay-per-use basis or subscription based services used on a monthly basis. It provides Automated Tasks through Centrally Orchestrated PlatformsPlatform Virtualization through creation of a Virtual Machine and provides a Virtual Operating SystemDynamic Scaling depending upon varying customers\u2019 requirements.

            "answer_text": "Cloud technology can be divided into three categories, namely, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)This service is provided by virtualizing the infrastructure hardware and creating virtual machines (VMs) to host the data. The service provider is responsible for building and maintenance of the underlying hardware such as, networking, data centers, storage, servers etc. 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS) PaaS is built on top of IaaS. In this service, cloud vendors are responsible for creating and managing the Infrastructure till the operating system (OS) and other middlewares. Customers can directly build and test applications and functions without having to manage the VMs. Software as a Service (SaaS)Customers get to use the softwares directly without having to build anything. Few examples are email software, Salesforce etc. These can be deployed using different cloud service models depending on the type of requirements customer has: Public Cloud: A common hypervisor with multiple VMsPrivate Cloud: Dedicated VM with hypervisor or hardwareHybrid Cloud: mix of private and public cloud-on prem and cloud",
