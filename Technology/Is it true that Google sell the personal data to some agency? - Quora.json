            "answer_text": "Google does really collect data and they do sell it, but probably not in the terms of what you\u2019re thinking. There are a lot of companies out there that get the emails of top journalists or whatever and they sell emails, names, addresses, phone numbers, etc. for a good buck (a lot of bucks actually). This is NOT the way Google operates. Google sells your information in the form of advertising to advertisers. So they have all this information about you: your likes, the types of websites you visit, and they even scan keywords in your email to see what type of \u201cbusiness\u201d you conduct. The common misconception is that there is someone sitting there reading your email. Not at all. Google is scanning emails for \u201ckeywords\u201d (words). There are BILLIONS of users of Google, thus: for someone at Google to log in and \u201cview\u201d your information directly about you directly is not exactly feasible. Someone would have to be paid to do that\u2026 and that\u2019s not what Google really cares about at all. The FBI and the CIA and the NSA might.. but Google is more about monetizing your data. How it works then is that the advertiser purchases their ad space on Google Adwords. Google gives them data on keywords being searched for and they purchase that. They can then narrow it down further. For example, adult diapers. Your money is wasted if you showed adult diapers to children, teenagers, or others who have never even searched for diapers. Now if you have searched for adult diapers, Google has a record of your history. So now I want to advertise to: anyone who has searched for \u201cadult diapers\u201danyone who is over the age of 50 who might have searched \u201cbladder problems\u201dand the gender can be both men and womenmust live in the United States or CanadaSo that\u2019s my filter and criteria. Google then says, \u201cOk we are charging $0.25 per 1,000 people that view it or we\u2019ll charge you $1 per 10 clicks.\u201d Google gets some money out of it. The advertiser hopefully gets some new customers out of it or at least gets people to view it and know that they are an option. And that\u2019s how Google is a major advertisement platform for corporations to advertise on\u2014 it\u2019s good business and the fact that Google is worth about $1 trillion says a lot. Now this doesn\u2019t mean Google hasn\u2019t violated some privacy issues, but for the most part, they do try to legally operate and protect your information. Companies cannot see my name or your name personally. They only know that I might be over 50, that I\u2019ve searched for \u201cbladder problems\u201d or \u201cadult diapers\u201d in the past, and that I live in the US or Canada. That is how they \u201csell information.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is yes. The real answer is, it\u2019s not that simple.  Google operates a vast data collection infrastructure that\u2019s deeply integrated into most of its products, especially the Android operating system and the Chrome browser. For the most part, that data is collected in order to facilitate advertising, and for the most part it's anonymized before it's released or used to develop reports. So in that sense the answer to your question is no. But as with most things in life, it's not quite that simple. There's still serious risk despite the fact that Google does not specifically sell personal information. The first problem is that often such data can be partially or fully de-anonymized using various statistical analysis techniques. The effectiveness of this depends on having a large amount of data from a variety of sources, but the result can often be breathtaking in how specifically it identifies actual people. The second problem is structural. Whenever anyone (including Google) populates a large warehouse of personal data, they become a target for hackers. Although Google does anonymize data before releasing it, internally they store it in a fully identified form. What a juicy target! Hackers are thinking, \"yummy yummy\". Before you respond by saying, \"Naw, nothing as powerful and capable as Google could ever be hacked\", just ask any of the 143 million consumers whose sensitive personal information was exposed in a data breach at Equifax what they now think. The next thing that turns \"no\" back into \"maybe\" is the fact that pursuant to various types of court orders, under law Google must supply data to authorized parties, at which point the question becomes, how good are the protective measures of the agencies and organizations that receive such sensitive data? I mean, if one of the cornerstones of the entire banking and credit system can lose personal information of 143 million people, what chance does your local police department or some state agency have? The next issue is subtle, but insidious. Google supplies data to and facilitates the placement of ads for advertisers. Those ads appear in applications and on websites. In turn, those apps often request and are granted by the user some stunningly intrusive rights to send personal data back to the makers of the app, where it can easily be correlated with other data, some of it supplied by Google and some from other sources. (Pok\u00e9mon Go is an instructive example of this). When the data Google supplies is then added to it, a detailed picture can often be drawn of that person's interests, purchases and much else. Likewise with browsers, using techniques known as browser fingerprinting and something called WebRTC, which can reveal a person's true IP address even if they are connected to a VPN. Armed with that information and a gob of data from Google (whether anonymized or not), it's possible to draw a remarkably detailed picture of the user, just as with the apps. As if all this weren't concern enough, Google (and many others) also possesses a treasure-trove of geolocation data about people (i.e. their minute-to-minute GPS location as they move through life) . This data has almost no legal protection whatever, and can be used to paint a detailed picture of where someone goes, and by correlating it with other tracks, who they are with. So, is \u201cGoogle selling our privacy\u201d? Does 2+2+2 equal 6? ",
