            "answer_text": "I flew my first drone into a waterfall \u2014 it was never to be found again. It was a Phantom 4 and I thought that I could skilfully navigate up and around several cliffs, rocks, and splashing water using only my iPad screen as navigation. Unfortunately, the Phantom 4 does not have sensors at the top of the drone so it got caught in a wire overhead. You may ask what the hell a wire is doing around a waterfall \u2014 good question. I really don\u2019t know. I searched and searched for my Phantom to no avail. I concluded that it was perhaps sandwiched in between some unreachable crevice of rocks or fell into the abyss of the lower pool of the waterfall\u2026Fortunately I was able to salvage the footage as a lower quality version of my videos automatically save on the DJI Go app. This provided some needed closure for my loss. I learned my lesson after that\u2026kind of. Since then, I\u2019ve crashed my drone twice (DJI Mavic). Both times I was trying out new features and wasn\u2019t in a totally open space, which was fault. Multiple lessons learned there but fortunately the damage was not fatal, and I was able to repair my drone. To answer your question more directly, there are a couple of strategies I see used to address the problem and likelihood of crashing if you\u2019re using it frequently: Insurance: DJI for example has one year warranties on their drones. There is also an extra insurance package you can purchase separately that reimburses you on the total cost of your repairs for that year. DJI also has several training centers setup globally that allow you to learn and practice flying drones, so they\u2019re working hard to provide a safe environment for people. Sensors: Every drone that DJI releases is getting better and better with upgraded sensor and safety technology. Currently you have to purchase something like the DJI Inspire to get truly awesome sensors, but the price is out of range for most people and it\u2019s more of a professional tool. Even then, there is yet to be a true 360 degree sensor for a drone\u2026one that\u2019s affordable, anyways. I think the next step is integrating this into future drone releases \u2014 pretty much making the skill of being a drone \u201cpilot\u201d virtually risk-free (and easy).  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been flying drones for several years now. Cheap (under $100) drones would crash all the time, but I never had any damage because they were very light weight. When I moved on to more expensive drones like the Phantom 2, Phantom 3 and now Mavic I have a much more reliable vehicle. True, with the extra weight and more expensive hardware, they are subject to damage in a crash. BUT in the last 3 years, I\u2019ve had a total of one crash, and that was putting a Phantom into a tree (no damage other than pine needle stains on my blades). Simply put, these vehicles don\u2019t crash unless you are pushing the limits of the vehicle (example, racing a drone). None the less, the industry is trying to address the issue. For example, DJI, the maker of the Phantom and Mavic have an insurance plan for crashed vehicles. Personally, I think it is not worth the money (i.e. cost vs probability of using the insurance), but I think that is going to vary with the individual. ",

They\u2019ve all had crashes, trees and hard landings, or flips at low altitude, silly things indoors and after hundreds of flights, my total damage is one prop on the smallest. They\u2019re easy to fly, and unlike planes can be stabilised quickly by \u201chands off\u201d. Learning to control altitude gently is the most essential skill. A few dozen indoor test flights, with control within floor and ceiling, or outdoors using a football or rugby goal as a reference, is all you need. 1 to 3 hours, and you\u2019ll recover from anything. My background from park flyer planes helps a little with input control, but drones are way easier to fly. ",

Shell, props, prop guards, landing gears etc., or complete \u201ccrash kits\u201d. If you manage to break the camera gimbal, that\u2019s more expensive. The electronics and the motors are very hard to damage. There are fragile and very durable quadcopters too. Flying into a concrete building with 80..100 km/h is fatal for almost all of them. Small accidents happen, but a chipped prop is not a big deal. ",
