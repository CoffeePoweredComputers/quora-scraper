            "answer_text": "Is it possible? Yes. However, that doesn't mean that all mini PCs can play all PC games. It depends on what game and PC you have. For example, an Intel NUC (and other variants) is very small and could play many PC games. However, it relies on integrated Intel HD graphics, so modern AAA titles are probably not going to run. Note: newer models[1]have discrete graphics and are more capable gaming machines[2], but they sacrifice size to some extent. Another example, which is larger but still small, would be a mini ITX form factor desktop. These can be smaller in volume than an Xbox/PS4. You can see a build of one such PC here:  Footnotes[1] Intel\u00ae NUC Kit NUC8i7HVK[2] Intel's Coolest CPU EVER... Thanks to AMD!",

            "answer_text": "If you found a nice toaster, and stuck two RAM sticks into one toast-slot, and a GPU into another, you could probably play something on it if you wired it all right. Not actually, but PCs are don\u2019t have to be a certain shape and size or anything. Some guy made this build out of a tire, and it could probably run Call of Duty 4.  And here\u2019s a build that\u2019s literally a toaster.  So, whatever you mean by \u201cmini\u201d, the answer is likely yes. Depending, of course, on which game you\u2019re even trying to run on this mystery machine. ",
