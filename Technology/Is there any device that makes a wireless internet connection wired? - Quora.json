I\u2019ve used this one in the past, and it works exactly like you\u2019d expect. Most router/access point combo units have this functionality built-in. ",

            "answer_text": "As Alex Manchester stated: The device is called a wireless bridge.You configure it to connect to the wifi ssid then plug an ethernet cable into it. A travel router will have this functionality built in, many routers off the shelf have this ability (like nearly any model made by asus). Any router can be converted to a wireless bridge if you can install openwrt, dd-wrt or tomato to it. ",
