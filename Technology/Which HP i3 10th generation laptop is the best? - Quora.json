            "answer_text": "Lenovo Ideapad Slim 3i 10th GenHP 14 10th Gen Intel Core i3 ProcessorLenovo Ideapad Slim 3i Intel Core i5 10th GenThis is for all-rounder activity. For now, these are the best laptop which has core i3 10 gen processor. HP recently is not producing many laptops of core i3 10 Gen. So best of luck from choosing among them. And I would prefer the AMD processor for now as Ryzen 3 and 5 are offering better performance than the intel processor is giving now. But if the 11th gen processor will offer more than an AMD processor then I will change my preferred. So until then you should probably wait or go with the AMD processor now. I hope you understood the problem. Have a nice day. ",
