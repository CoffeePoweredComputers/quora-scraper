            "answer_text": "When your computer runs out of Ram Memory it starts to use your hard disk or SSD drive instead for what is known as a paging file or virtual Disk. Ram Memory is much faster so you really want to limit the use of your disk for this whenever possible. What actually happens when you run out of ram is also dictated by your virtual memory settings and how much disk space you have allocated to the page file. Usually when you run out of Ram you will notice a big slowdown in performance due to the slower speed of the disk. ",

            "answer_text": "The PC will start to use SWAP to unload parts of the ram and allocate it to new processses,If all processes are active this will have an impact on speed since mass storage is a lot slower than RAM. Once SWAP is full too, you will experience more serious issues like programs refusing to launch, or closing unexpectedly, even slower response time, system unstability \u2026 This should NOT happen unless there is a memory leak somewhere.
