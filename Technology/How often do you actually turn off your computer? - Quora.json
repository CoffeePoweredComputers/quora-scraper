            "answer_text": "In the 10 years that I\u2019ve owned my present computer, it\u2019s been turned off maybe 20 times. Those times were when I opened it to change parts or clean the dust out, when I wanted to reset the system PRAM, when I was away from it for more than a few days, or to move it from one place to another. The rest of the time it just sits in sleep mode when I\u2019m not using it. The fans are off, the hard drives are still (these are the most wear-prone parts), and apart from the minimal electric current required to let it wake up without rebooting, the power supply is dormant. It\u2019s attached to a UPS which filters voltage spikes and does a safe shutdown under battery power when there\u2019s a power outage that lasts longer than a few minutes. That\u2019s happened a couple of times. The computer is still working like new. ",

The only exceptions are when I\u2019m doing a full system backup or memory test, and even then I turn the system off as soon as possible after the commands have run. I\u2019m sure the energy savings are minimal, but maybe the motherboard and hard drive last a year or two longer. ",
