            "answer_text": "The Moebius project focusses on providing a 'bare bones' solution for the Raspberry Pi. It's based-on Raspbian packages and only includes the bare minimal OS features and a package manager that makes it easy to extend the basic system when required. Such a system runs all scripts that can be interpreted by the Linux shell and you can compile your own code to run. The firmware is closed-source proprietary code programmed into the SoC (System on a Chip) processor, which cannot be modified. Upon power-up the firmware will initiate a bootloader on the SD card. I do not believe that any other services are provided through the SoC firmware, so it is not really a \"BIOS\" (Basic Input/Output System) per se. After this point everything else comes from the SD card. ",
