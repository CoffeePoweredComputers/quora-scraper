            "answer_text": "While Big Organization, most of the disadvantage from IT usage is IT Paradox including Culture, Leadership, Structure, etc. In Small or Medium Company, I don\u2019t know how you define the scope of company. However, lets say most of the problem is IT Payoff. What is IT payoff? The amount of money will be returned after IT Investment. We can call ROI of IT Investment. (ROI = Return Of Investment) Why IT payoff becomes the big problem of small/medium business? First, Well, most of the IT Investment will not see any impacts in the short term investment. While Small/Medium Businesses have limited budget to invest on IT and they are seeking, or hurry to see the payoff. Second, IT Payoff measurement problem. Most of the tractional method that we use to measure the ROI of IT investment is based on the labor cost, equipments, etc. However, in the next 5 or 10 years, the amount of money will not guarantee to payoff. Why IT payoff is never going to happen why big organizations keep investing in IT? Most of the problems are because of miss measurement. We can not measure the benefits of IT based on the amount of money we invest. ROI of IT is on customer satisfaction, cultural improvement, etc. which are intangible. And these values are hard to measure. While tradition measurement can measure exactly ROI just simply because of their input. However, the input of IT is not the money, land, gold. It\u2019s information. We need another better measurement. Solution? IT alone will become fashionista. Leadership without IT also become conservative. IT and Leadership should go other if you expect to see IT payoff. ",

            "answer_text": "Below could be some disadvantages to using technology with smaller businesses expesive and usually consistent annual cost. For example a basic CRM with a couple users is going to be a few thousand a year, this could be money spent on the actual product and can be significant for a small business.Rigid processes implemented with technology. Once you go with a system you are then bound by the way that system does things. For a lot of small businesses this can be difficult because it does not allow you to be as agile when markets shift which can happen a lot.Adoption, lots of people like working for small businesses because they don\u2019t have as many strict system policies, sometimes it can be difficult to get you employees to adopt new technology.With the above said, technology can help a business grow much faster so the best advice is to step back and see how big the holes are you are trying to fill and if they are significant technology can be a great filler.
