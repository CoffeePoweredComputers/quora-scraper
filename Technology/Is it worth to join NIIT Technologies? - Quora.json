            "answer_text": "Thanks for the answer request. Well having worked with NIIT Technologies as a fresher, i would narrate my feelings which i had before joining the mentioned company. Back then,after pursuing a degree in Btech in Computer science, the job market was in a very bad shape that some one suggested me to enroll for a course in any programming language in any of the prominent institutes who has tie ups with the recruiting team of many IT companies. Since i loved Java , i enrolled for a Java course and got placed in NIIT Technologies. Well, having had my hands on on java, i was put into work for the mainframe technologies with a three year bond. Reckoning the market trend then , i signed for the offer and joined NIIT Technologies. I was perplexed with the technology i was put in and i had the same question in my mind \u201cis it worth working here\u201d? if you ask me now, i feel it was worth joining NIIT back then.I got a chance to learn a lot from the team and the company as well. The reason where i am now , i would undoubtedly give the credit to all the fellow folks whom i got a chance to interact and work with during my fresher days. However,i have one request for you.See if you can join without signing for any bonds. Hope this answer helps and wish you good luck :) ",
