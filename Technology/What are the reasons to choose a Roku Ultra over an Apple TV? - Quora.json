            "answer_text": "The two that come to mind would be platform and cost. Roku is more of an open, non-biased platform. While it\u2019s true you\u2019re going to find the \u201cbig\u201d services on both (Netflix, Hulu, and now even Amazon Prime Video) Apple has a vested interest in the way Apple TV works. While I\u2019d not anticipate anything happening anytime in the near future to \u201cthreaten\u201d a relationship with Apple, Roku is more platform agnostic. You don\u2019t really hear about disagreements between Roku and Amazon like you do Apple and Amazon. Heck, it\u2019s only been in the last week or so that Apple FINALLY got the Prime Video app. Then there\u2019s cost. Right now, you can get a Roku Ultra on Amazon for about half the cost of an Apple TV. ",
