            "answer_text": "A perspective of global sustainability: A view from the general instead than from particulars. Certain stars under certain conditions transform some types of elements into carbon. Helium burns into carbon, and carbon combines with helium to make oxygen. The core of the star becomes rich in carbon and oxygen nuclei, and the star's surface temperature goes up to become a horizontal branch star. When the temperature in the core reaches about 100 million degrees, the helium will begin to fuse into carbon by a reaction known as the triple-alpha process, because it converts three helium nuclei into one carbon atom. This generates a great deal of heat. ... In short, the centre of the helium core explodes. All stars die, and eventually \u2014 in about 5 billion years \u2014 our sun will, too. Once its supply of hydrogen is exhausted, the final, dramatic stages of its life will unfold, as our host star expands to become a red giant and then tears its body to pieces to condense into a white dwarf. In the meantime what have been available is that some side effects of carbon processes are the bases for inanimate matter transition into simple life forms into plants and other living forms including humankind. Plants and light through photosynthesis convert the abundance of carbon derivatives to produce sugars, which are the bases for the food chain production, and in accordance with some estimates could very well feed not inly 8 but up to 24 billion people. According to some studies, the Earth started out as a barren and inhospitable environment, but the processes described above enabled it to bloom into what it is now, in just four to five billion years. How will the Earth be in 5 billion years more? With hindsight, and in accordance with experience, it will probably be an Earth with more forests and with increased forest output, beyond that it is unforeseen. In this light, planet Earth would be the largest known forest in the infinite cosmos. Then, very probably, the Earth would be the proto-habitat for human dynamic complexity, continuing in its constant blossoming. Perhaps even connecting with the proto-agonistic capacity to effect action which in the actualized context is just human individual actions devoid of antagonism. Could all of this be an accepted probability in response to the sustainability issue? I don\u2019t think so. It is a complex and not a complicated issue. The difference being that when dealing with a complicated issue a control tower full of capable people it is required. By arguing the way throughout eventually finding the probability with the highest ratio for success. In contrast when looking for solution to a complex issue a control tower hinders results. From the start to the end of the process consensual languages builds/binds solutions. Draw own conclusions. ",
