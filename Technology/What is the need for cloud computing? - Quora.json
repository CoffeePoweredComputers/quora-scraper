            "answer_text": "1. Scalable Usage: Cloud computing offers scalable resources through various subscription models. This means that you will only need to pay for the computing resources you use. This helps in managing spikes in demands without the need to permanently invest in computer hardware. Netflix, for instance, leverages this potential of cloud computing to its advantage. Due to its on-demand streaming service, it faces large surges in server load at peak times. The move to migrate from in-house data centres to cloud allowed the company to significantly expand its customer base without having to invest in setup and maintenance of costly infrastructure. 2. Chatbots:  The expanded computing power and capacity of the cloud enables us to store information about user preferences. This can be used to provide customized solutions, messages and products based on the behaviour and preferences of users. Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant - all are cloud-based natural-language intelligent bots. These chatbots leverage the computing capabilities of the cloud to provide personalized context-relevant customer experiences. The next time you say, \u201cHey Siri!\u201d remember that there is a cloud-based AI solution behind it. 3. Communication: The cloud allows users to enjoy network-based access to communication tools like emails and calendars. Most of the messaging and calling apps like Skype and WhatsApp are also based on cloud infrastructure. All your messages and information are stored on the service provider\u2019s hardware rather than on your personal device. This allows you access your information from anywhere via the internet. 4. Productivity: Office tools like Microsoft Office 365 and Google Docs use cloud computing, allowing you to use your most-productive tools over the internet. You can work on your documents, presentations and spreadsheets - from anywhere, at any time. With your data stored in the cloud, you don\u2019t need to bother about data loss in case your device is stolen, lost or damaged. Cloud also helps in sharing of documents and enables different individuals to work on the same document at the same time. 5. Business Process: Many business management applications like customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) are also based on a cloud service provider. Software as a Service (SAAS) has become a popular method for deploying enterprise level software. Salesforce, Hubspot, Marketo etc. are popular examples of this model. This method is cost-effective and efficient for both the service provider and customers. It ensures hassle free management, maintenance and security of your organization\u2019s critical business resources and allows you to access these applications conveniently via a web browser. 6. Backup and recovery: When you choose cloud for data storage the responsibility of your information also lies with your service provider. This saves you from the capital outlay for building infrastructure and maintenance. Your cloud service provider is responsible for securing data and meeting legal and compliance requirements. The cloud also provides more flexibility in the sense that you can enjoy large storage and on-demand backups. Recovery is also performed faster in the cloud because the data is stored over a network of physical servers rather than at one on-site data centre. Dropbox, Google Drive and Amazon S3 are popular examples of cloud backup solutions. 7. Application development:  Whether you are develop an application for web or mobile or even games, cloud platforms prove to be a reliable solution. Using cloud, you can easily create scalable cross-platform experiences for your users. These platforms include many pre-coded tools and libraries \u2014 like directory services, search and security. This can speed up and simplify the development process. Amazon Lumberyard is a popular mobile game development skills used in the cloud. 8. Test and development: The cloud can provide an environment to cut expenses and launch your apps in the market faster. Rather than setting up physical environments developers can use the cloud to set up and dismantle test and development environments. This saves the technical team from securing budgets and spending critical project time and resources. These dev-test environments can also be scaled up or down based on requirements. LoadStorm and BlazeMeter are popular testing tools. 9. Big data analytics:  Cloud computing enables data scientists to tap into any organizational data to analyze it for patterns and insights, find correlations make predictions, forecast future crisis and help in data backed decision making. Cloud services make mining massive amounts of data possible by providing higher processing power and sophisticated tools. There are many open source big data tools that are based on the cloud for instance Hadoop, Cassandra, HPCC etc. Without the cloud, it won\u2019t be very difficult to collect and analyze data in real time, especially for small companies. 10. Social Networking: Social Media is the most popular and often overlooked application of cloud computing. Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Twitter, and many other social networking sites use cloud computing. Social networking sites are designed to find people you already know or would like to know. In course of finding people, we end up sharing a lot of personal information. Of course, if you're sharing information on social media then you are not only sharing it with friends but also with the makers of the platform. This means that the platform will require a powerful hosting solution to manage and store data in real-time - making use of cloud critical. Cloud has provided sophisticated solutions to companies as well as individuals. If you are looking for a service provider to help you leverage cloud then NewGenApps can be a partner of choice. We have worked on many popular cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP. Contact us today for a consultation or project. ",

            "answer_text": "Cloud computing is important because cloud computing increases efficiency, helps improve cash flow and offers many more benefits\u2026Check out ten of the best below. 1. Flexibility Cloud-based services are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. If your needs increase it\u2019s easy to scale up your cloud capacity, drawing on the service\u2019s remote servers. Likewise, if you need to scale down again, the flexibility is baked into the service. This level of agility can give businesses using cloud computing a real advantage over competitors \u2013 it\u2019s not surprising that CIOs and IT Directors rank \u2018operational agility\u2019 as a top driver for cloud adoption. 2. Disaster recovery Businesses of all sizes should be investing in robust disaster recovery, but for smaller businesses that lack the required cash and expertise, this is often more an ideal than the reality. Cloud is now helping more organisations buck that trend. According to Aberdeen Group, small businesses are twice as likely as larger companies to have implemented cloud-based backup and recovery solutions that save time, avoid large up-front investment and roll up third-party expertise as part of the deal. 3. Automatic software updates The beauty of cloud computing is that the servers are off-premise, out of sight and out of your hair. Suppliers take care of them for you and roll out regular software updates \u2013 including security updates \u2013 so you don\u2019t have to worry about wasting time maintaining the system yourself. Leaving you free to focus on the things that matter, like growing your business. 4. Capital-expenditure Free Cloud computing cuts out the high cost of hardware. You simply pay as you go and enjoy a subscription-based model that\u2019s kind to your cash flow. Add to that the ease of setup and management and suddenly your scary, hairy IT project looks at lot friendlier. It\u2019s never been easier to take the first step to cloud adoption. 5. Increased collaboration When your teams can access, edit and share documents anytime, from anywhere, they\u2019re able to do more together, and do it better. Cloud-based workflow and file sharing apps help them make updates in real time and gives them full visibility of their collaborations. 6. Work from anywhere With cloud computing, if you\u2019ve got an internet connection you can be at work. And with most serious cloud services offering mobile apps, you\u2019re not restricted by which device you\u2019ve got to hand. The result? Businesses can offer more flexible working perks to employees so they can enjoy the work-life balance that suits them \u2013 without productivity taking a hit. One study reported that 42% of workers would swap a portion of their pay for the ability to telecommute. On average they\u2019d be willing to take a 6% pay cut. 7. Document control The more employees and partners collaborate on documents, the greater the need for watertight document control. Before the cloud, workers had to send files back and forth as email attachments to be worked on by one user at a time. Sooner or later \u2013 usually sooner \u2013 you end up with a mess of conflicting file content, formats and titles. And as even the smallest companies become more global, the scope for complication rises. According to one study, \"73% of knowledge workers collaborate with people in different time zones and regions at least monthly\". When you make the move to cloud computing, all files are stored centrally and everyone sees one version of the truth. Greater visibility means improved collaboration, which ultimately means better work and a healthier bottom line. If you\u2019re still relying on the old way, it could be time to try something a little more streamlined. 8. Security Lost laptops are a billion dollar business problem. And potentially greater than the loss of an expensive piece of kit is the loss of the sensitive data inside it. Cloud computing gives you greater security when this happens. Because your data is stored in the cloud, you can access it no matter what happens to your machine. And you can even remotely wipe data from lost laptops so it doesn\u2019t get into the wrong hands. 9. Competitiveness Wish there was a simple step you could take to become more competitive? Moving to the cloud gives access to enterprise-class technology, for everyone. It also allows smaller businesses to act faster than big, established competitors. Pay-as-you-go service and cloud business applications mean small outfits can run with the big boys, and disrupt the market, while remaining lean and nimble. David now packs a Goliath-sized punch. 10. Environmentally friendly While the above points spell out the benefits of cloud computing for your business, moving to the cloud isn\u2019t an entirely selfish act. The environment gets a little love too. When your cloud needs fluctuate, your server capacity scales up and down to fit. So you only use the energy you need and you don\u2019t leave oversized carbon footprints. This is something close to our hearts at Salesforce, where we try our best to create sustainable solutions with minimal environmental impact. ",
