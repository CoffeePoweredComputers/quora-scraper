            "answer_text": "I\u2019m guessing around $500. Most rumors speculate between $450 and $550. History: PS1 (1994) - $300PS2 (2000) - $300PS3 (2006) - $500(20GB), $600(60GB)PS4 (2013) - $400But, remember economic times change. So: $300 from 1994 is $520 today$300 from 2000 is $450 today$500 from 2006 is $630 today$600 from 2006 is $720 todayand most relevant:$400 from 2013 is around $450 todaySo then, let\u2019s try to guess the price: $400 - seems incredibly low, unless Sony gets some incredible deals for sourcing the components and manufacturing; or they are willing to loose money on each console, hoping to make up with game sales$450 - maybe. certainly not impossible, but again probably only if the above apply.. Sony would be making very little profit per each console, or even taking a loss.$500 - seems like the standard price most rumors are expecting$550 - a bit pricey and would probably turn away many potential customers.$600 - I believe Sony already learned their lesson after the PS3 launch so $600 is very unlikely. Unless they do 2 versions right from the launch.. like a PS5 at say $450 and a PS5 Pro at say $600. (but then what would they do in 2023.. launch a PS5 Pro-Pro ?)I\u2019m expecting around $500 and that\u2019s how much I\u2019m starting saving. ",

            "answer_text": "With Sony's recent publishing of their website for that PS5, and their comment saying it is a difficult decision to talk about the price, knowing the chipset it is easy to assume this thing is going to be about five hundred, if they want to break even on the system. They may take a loss and try to make it up with game royalties or they might double down and come out with a second SKU, a \u201c pro \u201c version right out of the gate like some rumors suggest, which would be six or seven hundred it's just not a hard known thing at this time.
