            "answer_text": "Sitting in a Viennese restaurant after WW1, psychologist Bluma Zeigernik noticed that the waiters remembered the unpaid orders better than the paid ones. She realized there was something and studied it, leading eventually to a 1927 paper titled \u201cOn Finished and Unfinished Tasks\u201d. Her experiment was to assign subjects tasks and interrupt half of the subjects before finishing, allowing the others to finish. An hour later she asked the subjects to describe what they\u2019d been doing. She found that the ones who\u2019d been interrupted were twice as likely to remember what they\u2019d been doing than the ones who\u2019d been allowed to finish. Since then many versions and extensions of this experiment have been done, both by her and others. More on this here. ",
