            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t look at not cutting pulp trees as saving them. They are only standing because somebody planted them for the paper industry. My guess is that if we stop using paper we would eventually end up with fewer trees. To get to your question I would guess the amount of paper would be less than expected. We don\u2019t send letters like we would because of email, but we generate a lot of files that are not digital and still print a lot of paper. I don\u2019t know this for a fact, but I think I buy more reams of paper because of the internet than I did before. It is not just because of the internet, but because of fast printers and the ease with which we can obtain a printed copy. ",
