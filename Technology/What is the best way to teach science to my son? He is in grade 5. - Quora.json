            "answer_text": "Experiments, and observation. Science is not about LEARNING the conclusion. It is about arriving at a conclusion. There are loads of websites that offer you hands-on science experiments you can work with. Some of my favourites are Arvind Gupta Toys Royal Institution of Science TED-Ed And as he grows up, you can use Khan Academy for more rigour. But experiments create mess. Please encourage it. Do not regiment it otherwise it will be of no use. As for the observation part, practice more mindfulness. Observing different kinds of plants or shades of a color in a picture or thickness of wood in the furniture all can used to create more observant behaviour. Hope this helps. ",
