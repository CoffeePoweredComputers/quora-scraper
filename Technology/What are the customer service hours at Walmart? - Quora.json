[1] Walmart's Contact Information[2] Walmart customer service It depends on the service you're looking for. The desk itself is normally open store hours if store closes at night. For 24/7 they tend to be early morning 7/8am to 10/11p. Some services can only be done when the desk is open. Ie Moneygram, RugDoctor rental, etc. However returns can be done at anytime at any register. A manager or CSM will be required since a return at a non-CS desk register requires a key flick to enter return mode. These may vary during the holiday season, but most service desks are open from 7 am to 10 pm. Expect long lines and be patient if you go to the service desk between Dec. 24 and Jan. 1.
