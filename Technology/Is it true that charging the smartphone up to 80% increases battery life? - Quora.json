            "answer_text": "No. There is no substantial gain in the charging times and fractions. Consumer goods are designed with convenience and economy over considerations of life. Most devices are simply used until they die, and recharged without attention on a simple charger design. There are simple limits set in the device, and seldom in the charger, to turn of the battery before it reaches zero, and limit incoming charge when the battery (or even the cell group) reaches a spec potential. That\u2019s enough for a practical optimum battery design with consumer goods. Phones and laptops have benefited greatly with advances in engineering, manufacture and use. Not only do the batteries last longer, they maintain their times of use longer as well. There are battery aspects that speak to higher efficiency and longer effective life. But they are only available with much tighter control of design, of manufacture, of installation, of use, and of maintenance. The best battery engineering technology is found in the partnership of Panasonic and Tesla at their megafactory. Here the biggest factory in the world makes the best batteries in the world. Tesla cars have achieved a battery system that runs at maximum efficiencies of use and load and temperature, and most astoundingly, lasts (for most) the decade plus of a car\u2019s life cycle, with only a 5% drop in energy storage! But boy, is it complicated! Getting this greater performance and life in consumer goods would not be cost effective. The present blend of development and production requirements seems nearly optimum.

            "answer_text": "Not under realistic conditions. For example, say you use 40% of your battery life in the average day. If you charge the phone to 80%, you\u2019ll be discharging it to 40%. If you charge your phone to 100%, you\u2019ll be discharging it to 60%. To sensibly compare charging to 100% to charging to 80% under these circumstances, you also have to compare discharging to 60% to discharging to 40%. The effect of charge level on battery life (for batteries not in storage) is very small. The effect of discharge level on battery life is enormous. So this is completely the wrong question to ask. People who advise you to charge your batteries to 80% and then stop charging are focusing on a very, very small effect while ignore a very, very large effect. It\u2019s much more important that you avoid deep discharges. ",
