            "answer_text": "There's an old saying: \"Necessity is the mother of invention\" Ideas come from trying to solve a problem or improving the current state of affairs. If you're short for ideas, then look around you. Observe what people are doing. What are the problems they have? What do people need? What things do you see that you think could be improved? With youth comes inexperience. Inexperience in the sense that you just haven't had the same number of opportunities to experience things. You can address this by actively taking part in things. Do what you enjoy but with the mindset of improving it. Listen to others and hear their problems. Use your intellect to try and improve the situation. As you observe and experience the world around you with the mindset of trying to better it, ideas will come pouring out. Some of them will be just wild crazy and others more mundane. Don't be so quick to get rid of the wild crazy ideas, do spend them the time to think it through on how you would actually make it happen. Eventually you will find your idea. The one that gets you excited. The one that gets others excited. Then just go ahead and do it. Sitting along in a room, disconnected from the world is the hardest place to come up with ideas. So get out, smell the dog poo and see what you can invent to change things for the better. Here's a piece on how the idea of twitter was born: How Twitter Was Born Good luck. ",

The best inventions you'll ever come up with will be in things you've done all your life or do every day for a long amount of time. The best concepts for new ventures will be a reflection of yourself as a person because you will have a problem that needs to be solved.  Example: when I was young and I had to wash dishes, the rudimentary metal filter placed over the sink still let water and sometimes bits of food underneath the sides of it, which ended up clogging the drainage pipe. I came up with the concept to magnetize the edges of these bendable sink filters in order to ensure that all water and food must go through the filter, keeping that food from clogging the sink. I never pursued this venture, as it never seemed intriguing enough to me, but that is a great example of how the easiest way to come up with ideas is from your own problems, not from sitting around and thinking of things to solve.
