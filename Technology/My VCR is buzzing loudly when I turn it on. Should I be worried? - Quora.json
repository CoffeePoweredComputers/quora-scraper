I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re still using one & that it\u2019s still working but appears to be on its last legs of operation. Time to join today\u2019s world & opt for an upgrade at least to a DVD player or use the internet for entertainment viewing. You may be one of the \u201cLast of the Mohicans\u201d using the old school VCR player. If any of your VCR tapes are worth preserving, it might be wise to convert them over to a DVD for future viewing or preservation. ",

If there\u2019s a tape in the VCR, eject the tape, switch the machine off, then switch it back on - does it still buzz? If so, remove the cover of the VCR, listen to where the buzz is coming from and report findings for further troubleshooting. ",
