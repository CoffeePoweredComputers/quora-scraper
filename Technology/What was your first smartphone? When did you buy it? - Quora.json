            "answer_text": "My first ever smartphone was the Samsung Galaxy trend 2 GT S7392 which I had bought for INR 6499. I bought it in January of 2014. Used it till March of 2016 after which I discontinued using it. It had 512mb RAM and 4GB of internal space. It was a 4 inch TFT display screen with WiFi and 3G.  I had exactly the same black variant. As far as performance was concerned, I had a hard time using it since it use to freeze and crash quite often. Also it used to heat up a lot when I used mobile data and drain it's battery. Oh and I could not take selfies as it lacked front camera. Still, I was a school student and having a smartphone was a big deal. The phone was very sturdy and never had a dent on it's screen.Moreover I used 3G data on it as well. Sometimes I do miss that phone though..all those endless group chats I used to have on WhatsApp with my school friends, copying important stuff for school and watching movies or playing songs while traveling. I have so many memories with that phone. ",
