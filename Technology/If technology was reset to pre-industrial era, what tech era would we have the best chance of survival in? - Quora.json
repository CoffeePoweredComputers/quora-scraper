            "answer_text": "Its hard to know what you mean. do you mean \u2018from now\u2019 in a sort of realisticish scenario when we suddenly we lose the use all tech, like massive solar flares or earthwide EMP attack. or some magical scenario where everything is sort of deleted and reset. In the EMP scenario, almost everyone dies. every country in the world cant generate enough food to feed its people, it can\u2019t distribute it, cant maintain control for a long period. chaos would break out and desperate people would kill each other for the last remaining supplies until only the nutters in the bunkers with their piles of MREs, the odd well armed and violent scavenger and some of the remaining indigenous tribes were left. Even those who knew how to farm the land would not survive, because everyone would be coming to them to beg, steal or enslave them. Those who think they can survive by hunting and foraging would be one of a massive swarm of such people that would eradicate every edible animal before dying of starvation. simply too many armed predators, too little prey. MAYBE some of the deeper parts of africa or russia would maintain a sustainable ecosystem that could support a few hunter gatherers, due to how hard it is to get there. but maybe not. In that case the answer is tribal level tech, for those who live in the deep jungles, would be the best. simply because its sustainable. the tribes of papua new Guiniea and the deep amazon would barely even notice the loss of human civilization. perhaps they would encounter some desperate survivors trekking through the jungle trying to survive, perhaps not. either way, they would be just fine on the whole. The nutters in their bunkers would finish their MREs and canned peas and be forced into subsistence farming. some would be ok, others wouldnt. their tech and tools would wear out and break and they might not be able to replace them. contrary to popular belief you cannot easily survive indefinitely with a stock of farm tools, seeds and good land if you have no way of making it sustainable. if you dont know how to make tools, and have the resources to do so, you will eventually fail. also individual scattered families are not sustainable. you need small communities to survive and all those scattered preppers would be more likely to shoot each other than co-operate. im sure some would band together and build lasting communities, most would merely prolong the end. The general and consistent problem in the EMP scenario isnt that humans cant survive it, its that THIS MANY humans cant survive it. the dwindling survivors would strip the land of its resources to the point where it could barely support anyone. no one would be able to grow anything, no one would be safe. if you put 10 million modern people spread out in the right places on earth unmolested, many stable communities would form and the world would be able to support them with hunting, foraging and simple farming. but do the same with 7 billion and you just watch the world burn. In the magical scenario where modern people are dumped into a past age it wouldnt end well in any age. there are too many people to be supported by any previous level of tech. mass scale industrial farming is the only way to feed 7 billion people, and without food, society totally breaks down. Also, modern people are on the whole utterly unready for pre-industrial life. the hard work, the skills required, the co-operation and forward planning. the average person has 7 days of food available and the idea of having to plan your food supply a year ahead, let alone actually making it happen, would be totally alien.
