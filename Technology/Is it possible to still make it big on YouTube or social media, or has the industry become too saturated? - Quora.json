            "answer_text": "The simple answer is Yes. Although the no. Of YouTubers / content creators is increasing rapidly we should also consider the amount of viewers who are consuming this content. An audience wants something new and refreshing . Obviously the good old creators are still there and have audiences attention but if you are creative enough, if you are willing enough , if you bring something fresh in the game then definitely people will watch it and appreciate it. ( I am a new youtuber as well and honestly being successful on YouTube is easy than it will be tomorrow and so on) ",

YouTube has 1.5 billion logged-in monthly users watching a ton of mobile video I couldn\u2019t find out how many YouTube marketers there are, but I am willing to bet that it is not even close to being enough to saturate a market of that size. So, yes, it is still very possible. Cheers! ",
