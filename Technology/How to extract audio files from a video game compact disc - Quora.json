            "answer_text": "It depends on the game, the format of the music and the extent to which the developers have tried to stop you getting hold of it. If you're lucky, you can do a file search of the disk (and the install directory on your computer) and find a bunch of audio files lying there ready to listen to. On some older games you might even find that the game CD is also an audio CD, with the game on track 1 and the rest of the tracks containing game music (if that's the case, be careful about playing track 1 - it could sounds pretty horrible or even break your speakers!) If not, you may have to do some digging. Sometimes they'll have renamed the file extensions to stop curious people like you fishing them out. Sometimes they'll be in a weird format, like .MOD, and may require a fancy audio player to play or convert. Sometimes they'll be compressed or encrypted to stop you getting your grubby paws on them, especially if the music is licensed. Generally, though, the best way to get the music from a game tends to be to go listen to it on YouTube. It's generally on there, unless your game is very obscure. ",
