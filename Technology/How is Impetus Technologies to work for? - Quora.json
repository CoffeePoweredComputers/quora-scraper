            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, I work at Impetus full time as a software developer.I have started working here 2+ years back in July 2013. I have enjoyed so much working here that I can't explain in few words. I work with StreamAnalytix team which has made industry's only multi-engine real-time streaming analytics platform. I will try my best to write an impartial answer. Impetus is good in work culture, ethics, integrity(do what you say), and innovation.We have multiple events specially in Big Data group to bring out innovative ideas out. In order to relax work pressure we organize fun events for long hours. We strive hard to make it enjoyable and full of fun. We celebrate each others birthday officially and unofficially(you know). People are quite supportive if you are ready to give your 100% in every task. People are quite passionate about their work. Impetus is the best in providing work-life balance. They strive hard in making a good resource out of you by giving you multiple training on various topics ranging from hands on training on new technologies like Apache Spark, design patterns etc or non-tech training like communication skills. If you feel the need for any training you can ask for it and improve your expertise. And for all your efforts be ready to get a very good increment. Although we are a small company but we are trying very hard to make a huge impact in field of Big data, future of IT world.  Few of the things that you may not like is work pressure. If you are introvert sort of guy and do not share your problems until asked, you will fail here. You have to approach people and use your intuition to keep improving on estimating tasks. If you can justify it you can get anything you want here. Another thing can be no pay for weekend working but the reason for company do not pay is that it do not support the concept of extending work hours on weekends (this forces us to complete our tasks in the given estimate or work on weekend as penalty). So far, I haven't worked on weekends more than 2-3 occasions when we had a critical delivery. PS : I have just come from a fun event and I am feeling too good. Disclaimer : These are not official words and other people here can have different views. ",
