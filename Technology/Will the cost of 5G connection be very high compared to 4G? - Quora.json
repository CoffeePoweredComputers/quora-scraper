            "answer_text": "Cost of 4G connections. Hmm that is a very vague term. Do you remember that all the telecom companies had created a consortium to charge prices as high as Rs. 250 per GB before Jio stepped in? Now the same companies selling plans offering up to 45GB a month for as little as Rs. 150. Needless to say, this primary facie looks like there was a huge profit margin behind expensive data (I am guessing in thousands of %) The cost of data is never too high except the initial stages wherein the cost of infrastructure needs to be recovered, it is the huge margin that the companies charged over the cost price that makes the end product expensive. So to answer your question, though the prices of 5G might be a bit higher in the initial stages, it should soon drop into a reasonable range soon as economies of scale kick in. ",
