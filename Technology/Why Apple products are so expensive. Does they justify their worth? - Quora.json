            "answer_text": "Apples products can be broadly categorized into 3 parts. iPhonesiPadMac/Macbook1 - For iPhones, the competition has more or less caught up or even surpassed the individual features that an iPhone has. Still, they are a premium quality product and work well in the ecosystem. Ina few markets (like India) they are surely overpriced, but a part that blame is shared by the current taxation policy (But, with locally assembled iPhones that would not be applicable, since no Import duty would be levied) 2 - In the tablet category, unless you need Windows on a tablet for your professional needs, you cannot buy a tablet other than an iPad ( if the budget allows). There is no competition to Apple's tablet offering as on date (April, 2019) 3 - For Macbooks, they are good looking and have their pros, but the recent keyboard failures throw a dark shadow on the quality and longetivity of these products. Plus they are priced significantly higher compared to similar and even better offerings from competitors (eg. Dell XPS) For someone invested in Apple's ecosystem (having 2 or more of the above device), they can fully enjoy the purpose of these machines (features like handoff, etc.) For those looking to buy their 1st iPhones, the competition is good (or even better than them). Note : I'm typing this from 2016 S7 edge, so it isnt like smartphones from competing brands will fall apart in an year or two. ",

            "answer_text": "Apple designs their own software, which is more intensive than, say, a phone simply running on Google\u2019s Android software. As a result, Apple phones are in their own unique class of mobile devices. Plus, the actual metals used in creating the phone are higher-end than any other smartphone. Creating a higher-quality phone naturally would increase the cost of it. But the fact that Apple can market a phone for $449 and still make a profit shows that they were clearly upping the price because they knew people would pay. And it\u2019s actually a smart idea. Apple product has never been cheap in any country and dramatically the cost of its new gadgets is increasing over time. It has become a symbol of status and only rich class people can afford them. Also, the technology required to manufacture them is very costly. A lot of times you must have wondered why these apple products are so expensive. In this video, you will know the reasons why Apple products are so expensive.  ",

            "answer_text": "I think, apple is a bigger brand than many other smartphone out there. Second thing, they do offer great piece of hardware. If you will see and compare apple\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 CPU\u2019s with any other processor ex qualcomm you will find the difference in the make itself, I have gone through many stuff where many experts have mentioned the quality of the sand and many other things required in producing processor is far more better than others. Answer to your second question, I would say yes, it does justify their worth(somehow). I was an android user and few years back I switched from android to ios, the performance is quite awesome because I know what is my need and expectation from a smartphone. But regarding support, I think apple is worst at the support part. Apple\u2019s hardware and software integration is fantastic which makes it a great performer. ",

            "answer_text": "Apple doesn\u2019t want to sacrifice quality for price \u2014 served mainly to reinforce his argument that Apple values great products over all else. And also Apple\u2019s innovation and product pipeline is driven at least in part by an effort to produce new gadgets at lower price-levels. And don't forget about the brand name mainly they are gaining money because of their brand name. No they don't justify their worth actually they are charging really high price for providing those specs which others phones are giving at much lower price.

But in other nations (india for example) they charge 30\u201340% on top of their existing prices , which is absurd for anything be it apple or pineapple whatever the hell\u2026 So as a rational buyer - No it doesn\u2019t justify the price unless you get it around the US pricing. but specifically for apple, they provide some features that only \u2018they\u2019 can provide. For example iOS, MacOS, etc. No one else can provide you with these things no matter how much they charge. So at these times apple plays the monopoly game ,and justifies their absurd prices by giving exclusive features and experience. ",

In India, yes, I\u2019ll give you that. But If you\u2019re talking from a US standpoint, not so much. The difference between India and the USA is 40%, which is really significant. To quote Tim Cook (not exactly verbatim) \u201c Innovation doesn\u2019t come cheap\u201d Now there will be people in the comments who go \u201c apple is using existing technologies\u201d \u201cthere\u2019s no innovation\u201d I would be glad to remind you that even though apple doesn\u2019t innovate much, they take up existing technologies and make them perfect- and that costs moolah. In short, apple uses its capital to perfect whatever they do, and this by itself justifies their cost. ",
