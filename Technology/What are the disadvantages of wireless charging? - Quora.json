            "answer_text": "Since Kenzi Mudge already covered the disadvantages (and you should read her response first), let\u2019s flip it around to see why you might want to use wireless charging. Convenience is the main reason for a wireless charger. For now, it\u2019s probably the only real reason as well. Once you have a charging pad or stand set up, it\u2019s very convenient to simply put your phone on it to charge up. No fumbling with cords, or accidentally dragging something off a table if you forget to unplug the phone. While it\u2019s still novel, the technology is getting better, and less expensive. With a newer Samsung device, you can take advantage of the higher power transfers (2A / 15W), compared with the iPhones and last gen gadgets (1A / 5W). We did a buyers guide / review on the Belkin charging pad, for your reference:Best 15W Wireless Charger Pad For Samsung Under $60 Cars in 2018/19 model years are now coming with wireless charging, which is a real convenience over needing another cord in the car. Ikea, and customer furniture makers, are now building wireless chargers into their furniture. Again, it\u2019s the convenience. Charging by wire right now is still the fastest, most efficient way to get power into your battery. In five years, I expect that wireless charging will be the dominant mode. If Starbucks can more a little faster on building the chargers into all their stores, it might happen even quicker. Here\u2019s a quick snapshot of the concept and a product implementation, courtesy of Belkin:  ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s slow. Fast charge can provide 2.5A or more, but Qi is typically 0.5A to 2A\u2026 although this can decrease battery deterioration.It creates some waste heat. Lithium batteries deteriorate faster if they\u2019re charged while hot.If you don\u2019t have a well-shaped wireless charging pad, the phone may charge intermittently, get warmer than usual, or get accidentally bumped off before the charge is complete.You can find chargers and cords everywhere. Wireless chargers are not as easy to find and they\u2019re more expensive.Having USB chargers in homes and businesses enables nearly everyone to charge. Having wireless chargers doesn\u2019t help others nearly as often.It\u2019s not nearly as convenient to use a wireless charger while also using the phone.",
