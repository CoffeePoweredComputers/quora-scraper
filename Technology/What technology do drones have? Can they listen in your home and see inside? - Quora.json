            "answer_text": "There are several different types of civilian drones that you can buy currently. There are also military drones which fall into the same categories and then there are military drones that are used in combat. Those are in a category all their own and will not be disused here. They can be grouped into 3 general categories - toy, photography and racing. Toys are just that. They come in sizes from something that fits in the palm of your hand to several feet across but most are pretty small so that they can be flown indoors without wrecking the place. Toys are often hard to fly in a precision manner because they are not very responsive. Virtually all toys now come with cameras installed in the nose. Some use fish eye lenses so that they can see a lot of what is below from the nose. Most are video capable and many provide a realtime feed that is picked up by a control app that you run on a smart phone or tablet so that you can see what you\u2019d see if you were riding on the drone. Many of these cameras shoot near HD these days. Photography drones are generally bigger than most toy drones somewhere around 12\u2033 to 18\u2033 diagonally from rotor to rotor. They almost always have landing rails or feet that extend 10\u2033 to 12\u2033 below. In the space between the legs will be a camera usually on a gimbal or some type of movable mount. Unlike the nose mounted cameras in toy drones this camera can be pointed in any direction including straight down and this can be accomplished via the controls so the operator can move it at will. These are usually HD cameras most shooting 4K so the resolution is at a professional level. Many can shoot movie quality video and can take HD stills at the same time. Some of the really high end drones of this type come with cameras or can be outfitted with cameras worth many times the value of the drone itself. Even if you\u2019ve never handled a camera you can shoot amazing high quality video and stills as soon as you get in the air. These drones also can come with a number of other features like obstacle avoidance, auto return, auto pilot which allows you to define a route for the drone to fly autonomously which can extend it\u2019s range greatly because you do not need to maintain a connection to control it. These drones have a control range of around 1.5 miles in ideal conditions but that range can be extended to as much as 4 or 5 miles with special add on equipment. The best of these drones can stay in the air about 30 minutes before you need to switch or charge the battery. Some can also record sound along with the video. These are fairly expensive ranging in price from about $500 to $5000 or a lot more if you want the best cameras and/or sensors. Drones in the over $10k price range are often outfitted with additional sensors for use in a agriculture, stockpile management and probably 100\u2019s of other industries. When outfitted for these applications they can get very expensive $20k to $70k is not unheard of. They usually have advanced software to process and visualize the sensor data. Racing drones are used for competition racing utilizing a course defined by air gates and other guides. These drones are a bit smaller diagonally the camera drones in fact the are classed according to size. The standard is 250mm diagonally but there are 180mm and 150mm and 100mm classes too. They do not have landing rails or any camera slung beneath. They are often comprised of carbon fiber and are open such that the circuit boards are visible and easily accessible to facilitate repairs and upgrades etc. There is a nose mounted RC camera that provides real time video via a dedicated frequency separate from the control channels. This camera is needed for racing and the camera signal is usually received by video googles worn by the pilot giving them a pilots eye view - called FPV for first person video - of the action which is needed to maneuver and respond quickly because they fly fast - 50 to 80 mph some even faster. This camera is relatively low resolution because the objective is to get a usable image without interruption not shoot nice video or stills. They are very useful for racing but that\u2019s about it. Now I\u2019ve described the equipment each class of drone generally come with but there are customization and upgrades that can additional capabilities and technically the sky is the limit if you can keep it light enough you can add to a drone to give it additional capabilities however this is rare for non commercial use. Believe it or not none of these classes of drone are good for spying. The toy drones actually would be the best for spying because they are relatively quiet and very hard to see but they are hard to control so it\u2019d be hard to maneuver into a good vantage point but there are a few exceptions. The photography drones certainly can take great shots of just about anything but unless you can get what you need from a few hundred feet away your presence can be detected because of their size and the noise they make. Racers are virtually useless for spying because the camera is oriented to give the best view in front and because they are loud and if you\u2019re in the air they aren\u2019t great for hovering they like to be moving and fast. As mentioned there are some exceptions in the toy class. There are a few toys that are very controllable and in the right hands could be used to spy quite effectively. These are the ones to look out for. If I were interested in spying I would use 5\u201310 small maneuverable toy drones and land them in inconspicuous places around the area I wanted to observe. This would provide silent monitoring/recording stations offering multiple viewing angles from nearly invisible positions.  From right to left 2 180mm racing drones , hexicopter photograpgy drone in flight the landing rails retract giving the camera 360deg of unobstructed viewing, 3 toys of various sizes. The smallest on the far left is one of the toy class that is very well suited for spying / surveillance. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is very broad - I am only going answer it very narrowly. Long Wave Infra Red (LWIR) sensors can easily see inside a home. It is not too hard to mount these on a commercial drone. Intelligence community (IC)drones likely have similar cameras on them. A number of WiFi protocols can be compromised via drone based attacks. The drone just needs to get close enough overhead to pick up the RF signals coming from your home router and then a skillful hacker can get in your internet connected devices. Most of these devices have microphones and cameras and these can be hijacked for surveillance purposes. Using these audio data can be acquired surreptitiously. Generally speaking the bulk of the drone\u2019s energy is consumed by its motion. A smaller fraction is consumed by any data it is transmitting. Typical commercial airborne drone endurance is an hour or so at best. For military/IC drones the number is about four hours. These numbers become larger if you use a ground based or floating drone instead of an airborne one. ",
