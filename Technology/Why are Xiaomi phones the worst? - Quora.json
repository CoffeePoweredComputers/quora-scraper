            "answer_text": "I can tell you why. When Pocophone F1 launched they had a touch issue that affected the vast majority of the shipped devices. They tried to hide this fact for as many people as possible claiming a software update was all it took to fix it (from the very first mentions of the touch issue). An official statement came a whole year after official release in July 2019 (release August 2018) claiming they were still working on this issue (It was more or less repeated the whole year). Meanwhile people were waiting patiently, putting their trust in this company and since time had passed it would invalidate most peoples phone for repairs. Which left people with an unbearable touch screen outside their return period, where they now have to struggle with lengthy process of returning. I tried within the return period and they straight out denied the issue, even though it was very easily reproducible and I wrote a thorough description of the issue and how to be sure to reproduce it (Typing characters fast on the edge of the screen and see it swap first entered letters with the second wave). This problem was so obviously a hardware problem, because the first 2\u20133 ROM updates only implemented a \u201cguessing\u201d-algorithm when horrible input lag was detected, that guessed which letter came first on the touch keyboard (yes, the keyboard LITERALLY guessed which CHARACTER you typed first, due to massive input lag and unresponsiveness mainly in the edges of the screen). Overall the touchscreen was utter garbage. It felt really, really weird to type on, it was the slowest of all smartphones I\u2019ve had in terms of productivity. Ghost-touch and extreme sensitivity (You only had to hold your finger hovering over the digitizer to initiate a touch, and touching headphone wires also triggered the digitizer) They kept on stringing their customers, for a whole year. I was glad I returned it within the return period, or I would have been left with a phone with great specs, but absolutely nerve-wrecking flaw on the most important aspect of a phone the digitizer/display assembly, your only choice of input. This made the phone feel \u201ccheap\u201d, \u201crushed\u201d, \u201ccatfished\u201d. The \u201cTianma\u201d display and input lag is well known all across the Poco F1 community, it\u2019s one of the most well-known discussed issues on reddit and is still discussed to this day. Many fanboys tried to talk around the issue claiming a custom ROM would fix the issue. I don\u2019t believe they ever were capable of detecting the issue, because a later post with a guy from reddit that assembled all device IDs and regions would reveal it was more or less every phone on the market affected with this issue. (I can\u2019t find the link to this post right now)  The official Twitter statement a whole year later in July, would be denying of the issue as well, as it had been for a whole year prior up to this, yet they still mention it albeit not acknowledging it entirely. \u201cWe will need to collect some devices to further test\u201d? Excuse me wtf? It\u2019s been a YEAR, you have had literally the whole community talking about this issue everywhere? YouTube, Reddit, MIUI forums, xda-developers - the vast majority of the discussion on this phone is on this issue alone, and yet they refuse to acknowledge it. Because they knew they cheaped out on the displays. How on earth can you ship so many devices and have almost 100% affected devices without it failing quality control?  Do you experience latency on the edges of the touchscreen ? And still claiming a year later it will be fixed by next update, as promised a year prior. Poco F1 software update 10.3.6.0 promises to fix touch issues  There you have it. This is why I don\u2019t trust Xiaomi with a phone another time (I\u2019m glad I got out, and didn\u2019t have the headaches of daily use this guy had a year later..). Bargain or not, you won\u2019t see me defending a company hiding their obvious hardware defects by completely denying it and postponing the issue with false hopes for people who spent a large sum of money for a device where the main input to the device (screen assembly, digitizer) is broken as shipped. Pocophone F1 from launch to history a year later was a massive failure hidden behind a success of sales. I have heard good things about their electric scooter tho \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af ",

            "answer_text": "I have used Lenovo, Karbonn, Samsung , Nokia , Asus and 3 Xiaomi devices , so I think I'm able to answer this. My answer is that they are the best in the segment and most durable & specification rich smartphones in the market for the price point in India. I had a Redmi note 4 from 2017 , it fell into water 1 time , fell into the ground twice , rooted the phone and installed every custom rom available in the websites , installed every custom kernels in the market available to boost battery life and performance. Installed Dolby Atmos for Redmi note 4 , enabled Camera2api and installed google camera took DSLR like pics and what not, Did everything possible with that phone. The phone never heated while playing PUBG for 1\u20132hours . I even used the phone while charging still no heating ( i won't recommend this on any smartphone , don't do it). Still it survived everything without any issues. I never went to service centre when i used Redmi note 4 for 1 & half years.Then i thought for some upgrades so i exchanged Redmi note 4 with Xiaomi Poco F1 (i can't tell you the amount of Hype it created that time for the specifications it gave for that price) the cheapest flagship killer of that time with snapdragon 845 in 2018. It is a complete beast can run any games or apps , battery life is commentable i charged in the morning it lasts for nearly 1 day with gaming and Youtube videos ( I'm a sort of heavy user , i used to edit videos too ) . The phone charged in just 1 and half hour (Qc 3.0 ). Although i faced some issues with Poco that it had decent amount of heating while playing Pubg at HDR. A issue reported by customers was Screen bleeding , light emitting from below. I also faced it to an extend but not entirely visible unlike as seen in pictures (i replaced it twice from flipkart).Xiaomi also provides mi PROTECT(for accidental damage and liquid protection) an insurance named ONE assist provided the claims ( They are the most pathetic insurance company in the world , they will reject the claims many times without any reason , you may have to raise many complaints or even have to go consumer court for repairing the device after accidental damage )Overall my experiences with xiaomi is quite good when compared with Nokia and Asus ( Asus has one of the worst services in the world don't ever buy it, they would ask you to change motherboards for any issues even if the phone is softbricked ). Edit:- some Xiaomi service centres also advice for motherboard change without checking the device which may be softbricked. Hope this helps . ",

I used to own an old Huawei G8 and the Xiaomi phone feels like a cheap phone when you keep both of them in hand. In addition, software experience is totally horrendous. With each software update, they fix one issue and then a new one pops up. Additionally, MIUI itself is full of bloatware which occupy a space in your phone\u2019s storage and slow it down. Xiaomi fanboys always suggest using a custom ROM instead of MIUI, but to be honest, using custom ROMs and tampering with phone\u2019s stock software is not something for the average consumer. Xiaomi phones tend to have lots of fans and fanboys, but it\u2019s to a great extent related to their cheap prices. However, I\u2019d personally pay a bit more to get a phone with a nicer build quality and better software experience. ",

You need to explain why do YOU think it is worst. e.g. If I say you are the worst person I ever met, you can not justify or explain anything until I explain the details.Let me still try to answer: Just do 5-minute research by reading Amazon/FK reviews for any Xiaomi device and compare with any competitor in same as well as +20% price bracket. Note that Xiaomi is globally known for its world-class products at ~5% profit margin at the hardware level. A little googling never hurts. ",

All of them have been excellent phones, far better than anything else on the market at double the price point; and Xiaomi have kept pushing updates for 4+ years on even the oldest (might be longer, my daughter finally killed it last year). My Xiaomi Note 3SE cost \u00a3120 and rang rings around my wifes \u00a3600 Samsung Note 3; although TBF, the Sammy had a better camera. I will run my Note4X for another year or so then buy another Xiaomi Note - probably the Note 8 by then. ",

            "answer_text": "Xiaomi phones are not bad at all. Instead, they are the best phones you can get in a very low price. But as Xiaomi is a Chinese company many people do not trust it. If u see Xiaomi phones have the highest specs than any other phone in the same price. They give Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, Long-lasting Battery, Best Camera, and many more. Some people have reported the issue that their xiaomi phones become hot while charging. But , xiaomi has removed this disadvantage it had and the latest phones of xiaomi like Redmi Note 7 pro do not become hot at extreme levels. Xiaomi due to these reasons still remains THE NO. 1 SMARTPHONE BRAND IN INDIA.  ",
