Even when it isn't the result of an attack or data breach, the results can be crippling.\u201d \u201cMost of the time, we don't think about technology, since most of the time it just works. No one expects to show up at a store and be unable to make purchases. The same thing is true for the power grid, mobile phones, and the internet. We just expect them to work because most of the time, they do.\u201d \u201cIn reality, however, the infrastructure that makes it work is actually quite fragile. Most of our daily lives depends on interconnected pieces of hardware, all of which run sophisticated software code. While many of the most critical pieces have backups and redundancy, that isn't always the case.\u201d Target Suffers Pair of Outages and It's a Reminder We're All Just 1 Technology Fail Away From Chaos ",

            "answer_text": "Communications, with respect to some other well thought out answers, I believe this to be the #1 best answer. Without communications all other infrastructure fails. Not only do they fail, they don't get repaired because without communications no one is assigned to repair them or even informed of the various failures. Without communications people start to do what they think is best. That is the very definition of chaos because there would exist no uniformity of purpose or action. Removing communications gets rid of any solidarity of purpose or direction. ",
