            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. The credit for manufacturing a phone can\u2019t be given to a single company. They contain a hell lot of parts and components, and no single company can gain expertise in manufacturing all of them. Now coming to the iPhone, here are the various manufacturers of some of its components:- Camera Module: Largan Precision.Accelerometer: Bosch in Germany, Invensense in the United States.Audio Chipsets and Codec: Cirrus Logic in the United States (outsourced for manufacturing).Baseband Processor: Qualcomm and Intel in the United States.Batteries: Samsung in South Korea, Huizhou Desay Battery and Amperex Technology Limited(ATL) in China.Cameras: Sony in Japan, OmniVision in the United States produces the front-facing FaceTime camera chip but subcontracts TMSC (in Taiwan) for manufacturing.Chipsets and Processors: Samsung in South Korea and TSMC in Taiwan. Alongside their partner GlobalFoundries in the United States.Controller Chips: PMC Sierra and Broadcom Corp in the United States.Display: Japan Display and Sharp in Japan. LG Display in South Korea. Samsung for the iPhone X.DRAM: TSMC in Taiwan, SK Hynix and Samsung in South Korea.eCompass: Alps Electric in Japan.Fingerprint sensor authentication: Authentec makes it in China but outsources it to Taiwan for manufacturing.Flash memory: Toshiba in Japan and Samsung in South Korea.Gyroscope: STMicroelectronics in France and Italy.Inductor coils (audio): TDK in Japan.Mixed-signal chips (such as NFC): NXP in Netherlands.Plastic Constructions (for the iPhone 5c): Hi-P and Green Point in Singapore.Radio Frequency Modules: Win Semiconductors (module manufacturers Avago and RF Micro Devices) in Taiwan, Avago technologies and TriQuint Semiconductor in the United States, Qualcomm in the United States for LTE connectivity.Screen and Glass (for the display): Corning Inc.(Gorilla Glass) in the United States. GT Advanced Technologies produces the sapphire crystals in the screens.Semiconductors: Texas Instruments, Fairchild and Maxim Integrated in the United States.Touch ID sensor: TSMC and Xintec in Taiwan.Touchscreen Controller: Broadcom in the United States (outsourced for manufacturing).Transmitter and Amplification Modules: Skyworks and Qorvo in the United States (outsourced for manufacturing).All of the above components are transported to Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron Corporation for final assembly and we get the iPhone as we know it, Simple and Elegant. Inspite of all this, the whole product is designed and engineered in California, USA. This is why each and every Apple product including the iPhone proudly displays, \u201cDesigned by Apple in California\u201d. Thanks for reading my answer. Hope you liked it. ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly Taiwanese company, Foxconn, who has 12 factories in China with the biggest one in Shenzhen, where the payrate for factory workers starts at $1.75 USD per hour. The OLED panel (as of right now in 2019) is supplied by LG and the IPS LCD panel was always supplied by LG. Samsung did sell Apple AMOLED screens for the iPhone X and Apple Watch but now LG is the new supplier. The camera sensor is from Sony.. Sony is literally the only company selling camera sensors because they have the best ones. They are the Sony IMX and all flagships essentially has the same sensor but the camera software is what makes it different. The built in SSD memory storage is likely from SanDisk.. Or possibly Samsung or a mix of both. There's only SanDisk, Kingston, Samsung as the biggest SSD makers.. there are other small SSD makers but Apple wants a low fail rate and the best quality so they usually go with SanDisk which lasts a long time and has a low fail rate. The RAM is from Samsung as they are one of the biggest makers of RAM memory.. Samsung has been selling Apple RAM chips ever since the early versions of the iPhone. Again, Apple wants the best quality and Samsung RAM chips are one of the best and they can probably manufacturer a lot of RAM for Apple. Fun fact: Samsung makes more money selling Apple parts than they do sell their Galaxy phones. Batteries are ALWAYS made in China by various Chinese battery makers.. they likely use a lithium ion battery. Even Samsung and LG purchase batteries made in China. Apple buys a bunch of different parts from different places for each phone.. and Foxconn is the one assembling the phone and providing the motherboard for it. The working conditions and pay rate is horrible in the Foxconn factory.. with undercover reports of people looking very tired and everyone is always sleepy. The pay is about $1.75\u20132.50 USD per hour and they work 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Two very healthy young men in their 20\u2019s died because they were too exhausted and worked too much.. factory workers commited suicide and that was why it got so much attention.. they now have nets to catch people who jump from their tiny apartment rooms from the balcony or window. Just wanted people to know where their iPhone is coming from and who makes it. ",
