            "answer_text": "WiFi is a label for a license free wireless connection, the deployment of a WiFi signal does not require an FCC license and is used to define a standard of transmission. There are several standards in use which have evolved over the years; like 802.11c, 802.11a, 802.11ac, 802.11n, etc. The release of each subsequent protocol improves the throughput and increases reliability. To ask what will replace WiFi is like asking what will replace cellular service. Neither will be replaced, these services will constantly evolve and increase bandwidth to accommodate the latest requirements. The current needs far outstrip the initial release of the 802.11 standard. Today, this protocol cannot serve the multiple connections and video streaming that is demanded from today\u2019s applications. Same goes for cellular, the initial protocol was GSM, then CDMA and 2G, 3G and now LTE4G soon to be superseded by the LTE5G protocol. This evolution required additional frequency bands to allow for the millions of simultaneous calls and the enormous data transmissions. For instance AT&T carries over 6 Petabytes of data daily on their networks, that is 1000 Terabytes. the cell services work in the 700MHz, 800, 900 MHz, 1.2GHz and higher. Same goes for WiFi, the initial frequency band used for WiFi was 2.4GHz, then came 5.3 and 5.7GHz and now there is a standard for the 60 GHz band. The evolution of WiFi will keep going as long as our applications keep demanding more bandwidth; therefore the short answer is no, nothing will replace WiFi. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not so much about replacing it, the ability of the 802.11 standard (wifi) is developed over time. Wifi is a common name for what engineers from IEEE have adopted as a common standard for global connectivity. Your WiFi will work anywhere is the idea. Every manufacturer of network devices can build a smart device that connects to the internet. Wifi is currently the most common method of connection for smart devices. Apps for mobile devices, PC software, and operating systems all know how to use wifi. Competing technology exists with Bluetooth, LTE, 3G, 5G, WiMax and even the manipulation of light flashing on/off millions of times per second to send data. The human eye would not even notice it, but led lights could transmit data if controlled properly. I don't really see that any of these technologies will ever be completely abandoned. The use case scenarios vary widely. Each technology has pros and cons. ",

Home \u201cInternet of Things\u201d devices and in-home entertainment and other systems can all run well using WiFi and if security is maintained, there are inherent benefits to running such services locally. However, one of the most important use-cases for WiFi was to supply internet to devices like smartphones in such a way that LTE or other cellular internet usage was minimized when the user leaves the home. In an era with LTE and soon 5G coming, matched with unlimited data plans, this is less and less relevant for such devices. It\u2019s already completely feasible for a lot of people to purchase the low-storage lowest price device in its class because customers can just stream data without worrying too much about data caps and the like. Still, though, WiFi serves a key role and will persist for some time. ",

            "answer_text": " Have you ever heard of LiFi? During the last years, research and developments have been carried out to take advantage of the use of light as a means to improve Internet connectivity. This concept is known as Li-Fi, which means by its translation of English, light fidelity. Unlike conventional wireless connectivity, Li-Fi makes use of lamps and other light sources to achieve faster speeds. Is this technology enough to completely displace the use of Wi-Fi? Although the LiFi technology is still in the experimental stage, it should be noted that it promises to be the wireless network of the near future and that it will replace the well-known Wi-Fi wireless system over time. Let's see why and what are the advantages and disadvantages of Li-Fi technology. ADVANTAGES LI-FI vs WI-FI: It can offer speeds of 500 Mbps (megabits per second), that is, almost 10 times faster than the optical fiber used by Wi-Fi.It is cheaper than Wi-Fi, it is said to be up to 10 times cheaper.Any light bulb or lamp can be converted into a hotspot or luminous router cheaply and easily, by putting a simple Li-Fi emitter.The light, by not going through walls, is much safer than Wi-Fi. It can be used in places that are very concerned about security, such as banks.It does not require the quoted radio frequencies required by Wi-Fi. Radio frequency communication requires complex radio circuits, antennas, and receivers, while Li-Fi is much simpler and uses direct modulation methods similar to those used in low-cost infrared communications devices, such as remote controls.Absence of cables.Electric light does not interfere or interfere with communication, it does not cause interference with other systems.It does not saturate the frequency bands used for the transmission of information via Wi-Fi.It is energetically more efficient than Wi-Fi Hope it helps, OKportal Technology ",

So imagine walking down a street at night that's illuminated by LED light. That LED light will generate wireless internet signals for all to use. Same goes for indoor buildings like libraries, restaurants, etc. that use LED lights as their primary lighting source. All those LED bulbs will generate wireless internet signals to surf the web! It's super green, clean technology but we're not quite there yet, I'd give it about 10 more years before you start seeing LiFi show up. It's really very exciting technology that'll open the door for so much more. I'm a poet and didn't even know it! HaHa, I hope this helped answer your question. Have a great day. ",

            "answer_text": "Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) is a new wireless technology that transmits high-speed data using light (i.e. Visible Light Communication or VLC) rather than radio bands. LiFi is designed to use LED light bulbs similar to those currently in use in many energy-conscious homes and offices. However, LiFi bulbs are outfitted with a chip that modulates the light imperceptibly for optical data transmission. LiFi data is transmitted by the LED bulbs and received by photoreceptors. That means they're making a lightbulb with Li-Fi technology inside. Li-Fi can deliver data quite a bit faster than Wi-Fi, but like Wi-Fi, its speed depends on the initial potential speed of the data being delivered by, for example, your home internet service. If your home internet speed is capped at 1Gbps speeds, your Li-Fi system wont go any faster than that. Li-Fi depends on your device being within range of the light being transmitted by your Li-Fi bulb. You literally need to be able to see the light to get the data. A below image demonstrates the working of Li-Fi.  In short, Li-Fi is a Super-Fast alternative to Wi-Fi. Unlike Wi-Fi network signals, Li-Fi is based on light and can't penetrate through walls, which makes it more secure from external sniffing. Meanwhile, it also means there is less interference from other devices. ",

Already, Google offers print services between devices and printers via the Internet, and there is no reason why this should not extend to cellular connections. Creating private networks between cellular connected devices will allow your devices to work together as they do now, except they will be using cellular connections rather than traditional ISPs, Ethernet and WiFi. Moving MiFi technology into individual devices with the growth of 5G networks could be the next step. ",
