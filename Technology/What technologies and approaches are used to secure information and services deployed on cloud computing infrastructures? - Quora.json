            "answer_text": "Technologies and approaches behind a cloud security architecture can be classified in the following categories: Application & Interface Security Application Security - Applications and programming interfaces (APIs) shall be designed, developed, deployed, and tested in accordance with leading industry standards (e.g., OWASP for web applications) and adhere to applicable legal, statutory, or regulatory compliance obligationsData Integrity - Data input and output integrity routines (i.e., reconciliation and edit checks) shall be implemented for application interfaces and databases to prevent manual or systematic processing errors, corruption of data, or misuse.Data Security - Policies and procedures shall be established and maintained in support of data security to include (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) across multiple system interfaces, jurisdictions, and business functions to prevent improper disclosure, alteration, or destruction.Datacenter Security Asset Management - Policies and procedures shall be established for the labeling, handling, and security of data and objects which contain data. Mechanisms for label inheritance shall be implemented for objects that act as aggregate containers for data.Controlled Access Points - Physical security perimeters (e.g., fences, walls, barriers, guards, gates, electronic surveillance, physical authentication mechanisms, reception desks, and security patrols) shall be implemented to safeguard sensitive data and information systems.Equipment Identification - Automated equipment identification shall be used as a method of connection authentication. Location-aware technologies may be used to validate connection authentication integrity based on known equipment location.Secure Area Authorization - Ingress and egress to secure areas shall be constrained and monitored by physical access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel are allowed access.User Access - Physical access to information assets and functions by users and support personnel shall be restricted.Data Security & Information Lifecycle Management Non-Production Data - Production data shall not be replicated or used in non-production environments. Any use of customer data in non-production environments requires explicit, documented approval from all customers whose data is affected, and must comply with all legal and regulatory requirements for scrubbing of sensitive data elements.Encryption & Key Management Entitlement - Keys must have identifiable owners (binding keys to identities) and there shall be key management policies.Key Generation - Policies and procedures shall be established for the management of cryptographic keys in the service's cryptosystem (e.g., lifecycle management from key generation to revocation and replacement, public key infrastructure, cryptographic protocol design and algorithms used, access controls in place for secure key generation, and exchange and storage including segregation of keys used for encrypted data or sessions). Upon request, provider shall inform the customer (tenant) of changes within the cryptosystem, especially if the customer (tenant) data is used as part of the service, and/or the customer (tenant) has some shared responsibility over implementation of the control.Sensitive Data Protection - Policies and procedures shall be established, and supporting business processes and technical measures implemented, for the use of encryption protocols for protection of sensitive data in storage (e.g., file servers, databases, and end-user workstations), data in use (memory), and data in transmission (e.g., system interfaces, over public networks, and electronic messaging) as per applicable legal, statutory, and regulatory compliance obligations.Storage and Access - Platform and data-appropriate encryption (e.g., AES-256) in open/validated formats and standard algorithms shall be required. Keys shall not be stored in the cloud (i.e., at the cloud provider in question), but maintained by the cloud consumer or trusted key management provider. Key management and key usage shall be separated duties.Identity & Access Management User access policies and procedures shall be established, and supporting business processes and technical measures implemented, for ensuring appropriate identity, entitlement, and access management for all internal corporate and customer (tenant) users with access to data and organizationally-owned or managed (physical and virtual) application interfaces and infrastructure network and systems components. These policies, procedures, processes, and measures must incorporate the following:\u2022 Procedures, supporting roles, and responsibilities for provisioning and de-provisioning user account entitlements following the rule of least privilege based on job function (e.g., internal employee and contingent staff personnel changes, customer-controlled access, suppliers' business relationships, or other third-party business relationships) \u2022 Business case considerations for higher levels of assurance and multi-factor authentication secrets (e.g., management interfaces, key generation, remote access, segregation of duties, emergency access, large-scale provisioning or geographically-distributed deployments, and personnel redundancy for critical systems)\u2022 Access segmentation to sessions and data in multi-tenant architectures by any third party (e.g., provider and/or other customer (tenant)) \u2022 Identity trust verification and service-to-service application (API) and information processing interoperability (e.g., SSO and federation) \u2022 Account credential lifecycle management from instantiation through revocation \u2022 Account credential and/or identity store minimization or re-use when feasible \u2022 Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) rules for access to data and sessions (e.g., encryption and strong/multi-factor, expireable, non-shared authentication secrets) \u2022 Permissions and supporting capabilities for customer (tenant) controls over authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) rules for access to data and sessions \u2022 Adherence to applicable legal, statutory, or regulatory compliance requirementsSource Code Access Restriction - Access to the organization's own developed applications, program, or object source code, or any other form of intellectual property (IP), and use of proprietary software shall be appropriately restricted following the rule of least privilege based on job function as per established user access policies and procedures.Infrastructure & Virtualization Security OS Hardening and Base Controls - Each operating system shall be hardened to provide only necessary ports, protocols, and services to meet business needs and have in place supporting technical controls such as: antivirus, file integrity monitoring, and logging as part of their baseline operating build standard or template.VM Security - Data Protection - Secured and encrypted communication channels shall be used when migrating physical servers, applications, or data to virtualized servers and, where possible, shall use a network segregated from production-level networks for such migrations.Interoperability & Portability APIs - The provider shall use open and published APIs to ensure support for interoperability between components and to facilitate migrating applications.Standardized Network Protocols - The provider shall use secure (e.g., non-clear text and authenticated) standardized network protocols for the import and export of data and to manage the service, and shall make available a document to consumers (tenants) detailing the relevant interoperability and portability standards that are involved.Mobile Security Encryption - The mobile device policy shall require the use of encryption either for the entire device or for data identified as sensitive on all mobile devices, and shall be enforced through technology controls.Jailbreaking and Rooting - The mobile device policy shall prohibit the circumvention of built-in security controls on mobile devices (e.g., jailbreaking or rooting) and shall enforce the prohibition through detective and preventative controls on the device or through a centralized device management system (e.g., mobile device management).Security Patches - Mobile devices connecting to corporate networks, or storing and accessing company information, shall allow for remote software version/patch validation. All mobile devices shall have the latest available security-related patches installed upon general release by the device manufacturer or carrier and authorized IT personnel shall be able to perform these updates remotely.Threat and Vulnerability Management Virus / Malicious Software - Policies and procedures shall be established, and supporting business processes and technical measures implemented, to prevent the execution of malware on organizationally-owned or managed user end-point devices (i.e., issued workstations, laptops, and mobile devices) and IT infrastructure network and systems components.Vulnerability / Patch Management - Policies and procedures shall be established, and supporting processes and technical measures implemented, for timely detection of vulnerabilities within organizationally-owned or managed applications, infrastructure network and system components (e.g., network vulnerability assessment, penetration testing) to ensure the efficiency of implemented security controls. A risk-based model for prioritizing remediation of identified vulnerabilities shall be used. Changes shall be managed through a change management process for all vendor-supplied patches, configuration changes, or changes to the organization's internally developed software. Upon request, the provider informs customer (tenant) of policies and procedures and identified weaknesses especially if customer (tenant) data is used as part the service and/or customer (tenant) has some shared responsibility over implementation of control.These technologies and principles are taken from Cloud Control Matrix (CCM) created by Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) If you like my answer, please hit \u201cUpvote\u201d button below.
