            "answer_text": "Q: What are some Tesla beaters? What makes them special? A: I take some issue with how this question is formulated. Why beaters? Why this obsession with \u201cwinning\u201d or \u201cbeating\u201d or \u201ccrushing\u201d something or someone? Why people have this perpetual Monster Truck Rally attitude? It is everywhere from politics to cameras and from sports to toothpaste. I\u2019m effing sick of it. So here, two Tesla beaters, one current one not: I give you the G-Whiz, an electric vehicle that sold way more units in its years of fabrication than Tesla did. It was dirt cheap and in some countries was considered a quadricycle so no licence was required to drive it. It was not allowed on the highways for that very reason, but it would be perfectly suited to the urban life and congestion. What better way to bring EVs to the people? Here it is in all its glory.  Now the current one which beats Tesla on everything else but the price. It has 670 HP combined power and will do 0\u201360 in 3.2s, quicker than a Lambo Aventador. Yes it might be slower on acceleration than a Model S on Ludicrous mode, but if one of them owners ever challenge you, offer to do a best out of 50 runs in 30 minutes. It is also way better handling than any current Tesla (whoever tells you otherwise has no clue really). It takes 5 people in perfect comfort and serenity, pretty much anywhere and, due to a wonderful feature called a fuel tank, the range is only limited by geography. Before you start objecting and throwing ICE insults this way, please be aware it actually has 50 mile range on electric power alone, so you can use it for regular CLEAN city commuting with no issues. It really combines the best of both words. Save for the (eye watering) price, it\u2019s the most complete and compelling package on the market today. I give you the Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid Sport Turismo. Also the longest model name in the world (try saying all that 3 times fast)  So, here you go, two Tesla beaters, proof positive I can be just as highly opinionated as anyone else. ",

            "answer_text": "At this point, there aren\u2019t any. There are a few multi-million-dollar schoolboy-poster offerings from the likes of Rimac that are faster and handle better, but as a fast and practical electric road car, there is currently nothing that even comes close that you can buy today. The lower end of the market is developing nicely - we\u2019ve just bought an MG ZS EV to replace an aging Prius as our second car. There are some releases coming Real Soon Now that look to be perhaps as good as a Tesla, although minus the Supercharger network, which is quite important. The Polestar 2 and Ford Mach-E in particular look pretty decent. ",
