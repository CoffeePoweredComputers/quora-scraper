            "answer_text": "As always, it depends. Personally, I switch between my 2 computers: 2012 MacBook ProSamsung S9 with Samsung DeXMy S9 is obviously not my primary computer. But, I can use it to do many things, including: regular Microsoft Office (Word, Excel and PowerPoint)Google Chrome for a wide variety of tasks I can completeTeamViewer (for some IT work)VLC for audio/video playbackYoutubeMicrosoft Outlook for managing multiple email accountslight HTML, PHP, SQL editing and testing (sometimes better than my MacBook, depending on what I\u2019m working on)But when I have to do anything resource intensive, I go back to my laptop. The phone is more of skin of a very light Chrome OS, as far as I am concerned. But, as long as you understand its limitations and manage your expectations, you should be good to go. So, what if your phone doesn\u2019t have Samsung DeX and is from another brand? Well, I would spring for something which does HDMI output via USB-C. This means that you\u2019re not limited to the small screen on your phone. The downside is that I now have to walk with extra equipment, such as my Samsung DeX dock, an HDMI cable, a power brick (to power the dock), USB-C cable, Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. But, if you\u2019re good with the phone on your screen vs the 72\u2033 in the conference room, more power to you. Phones have gotten ridiculously powerful over the last few years. But if going to iOS, I would go with an iPad with iPadOS, as opposed to the iPhone, which negates the point of your question. So yes, a phone can sub for a laptop from time to time, depending on what you need to get done. ",

            "answer_text": "How can I use my phone as my PC? I am not sure how you define a PC. If you have a mid to high end Android phone running Android 8 or later, you can download many apps that will allow you to do much of you might do on a PC. In fact many people probably limit their PC use to social media, email, and surfing the internet. All of that can be done easily on an Android phone. MS Office and its look alikes can also be installed on an Android. There may be limits due to screen size and keyboard, to how well your phone will satisfy your needs. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately not by default. For Androids you will have to root and then use an app like Complete Linux Installer - Android Apps on Google Play I saw some non-root required OS also but didn't try them yet. The above one gives lots of OS options compared to non-root ones. For Windows and iPhones probably not possible. Would like to mention, in case it helps. I am not sure if all Windows tablets are like this or not, but my iBall tablet is just like a laptop. Even desktop version of softwares can be installed in it. ",

There's a failed kickstarter that had a plan to make this happen, using a hardware dock and an app, no modified Android required.  Unfortunately, it didn't make it, but the dev. claims they are continuing work. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/andromium/andromium-the-next-evolution-computing-platform Samsung did one too... naturally 3x more expensive, and only works with their phones.Samsung Smart Dock turns your smartphone into a desktop ",

It was doing the Continuum thing but appearantly both Android and iOS not picking up the torch. iOS is just catching up to Android in that iPad Pro only now supports Bluetooth mouse which Android had for better part of a decade by now. Apple is as far as using phone as PC as anyone gets, Android is closer but no Continuum. ",
