            "answer_text": "Infrared heating has been around for almost 14 billion years. Even for us humans it has been used by man ever since we started hanging around fires to stay warm. Bonfires, coal stoves, gas burners, electric resistance coils all have an EM wave component. Infrared heaters came into popular use in the \u201960s for lower cost heating to keep people warm in high ceiling buildings without heating all the air in the building. Any time you sit in front of an electric heater and see a glowing coil, you are getting infrared heat. The problem with infrared in a house is exactly what makes it popular in a factory - only the surface inline of sight is heated - you literally fry on one side and freeze on the other. Not a problem if you are working on a car, blood pumping and redistributing the heat through conduction but very uncomfortable sitting down or sleeping. Infrared is not risky but,on the other hand, not recommended for residential comfort ",

            "answer_text": "Infrared heating at home has been around since fire. Most of the heat you feel is infrared from the fire. You need to do more reading so you know the history behind what you are curious about. The answer is yes. Any form of heating is risky. The good thing is the manufacturers do everything they can to make it safe to use. Just like you would if you had to make a fire. ",
