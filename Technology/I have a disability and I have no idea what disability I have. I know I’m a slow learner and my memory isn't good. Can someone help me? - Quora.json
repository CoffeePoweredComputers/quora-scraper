            "answer_text": "You can get neuropsych testing done to evaluate your cognitive skills. I had such testing following my stroke. I learned that my \u201cvisual memory\u201d had been affected by the stroke as well as other subtle things. I wasn\u2019t even aware that there are different types of memory. When I played some online cognitive training games after the testing, it became obvious that something was clearly wrong with my ability to remember things I\u2019d seen just moments before. You might try some of those sites and pay for full access for a month or two of whichever site you like best. Play the different types of games to see what areas you do well vs poorly. See if you can improve your cognitive skills through practice. My visual memory improved slowly but it still isn\u2019t great. ",

            "answer_text": "It would be in your best interest to know your diagnosis/diagnoses. You can certainly ask your physician or whomever made the diagnoses. You can ask your parent/s or guardian/s, too. You have the right to know. You can call the doctors or counselor yourself to get that information but you would need to sign a paper called a Release of Information. If you are in school and have an individualized education plan, you could ask the school counselor why. I\u2019m sorry, and a bit surprised, that no one has discussed this with you before as you should have been told. ",
