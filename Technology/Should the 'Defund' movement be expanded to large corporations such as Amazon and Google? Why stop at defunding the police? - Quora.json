            "answer_text": "You obviously don\u2019t understand this dumb \u201cdefund\u201d movement to begin with. Defunding any police department is a huge mistake and will leave the vulnerable population of every town and city where this takes place, in dire straits. Look at what happened in Seattle, when idiots took over a section of town. People died, people were shot, the leader (supposedly non violent) carried a gun to a meeting with a reporter, claiming that he doesn\u2019t know who to trust. Yea right. You can\u2019t defund something that doesn\u2019t belong to you, nimrod. Google, Amazon, Yahoo, Microsoft, Ebay, Etsy, you name it, they don\u2019t belong to the government, so what is it you wanted to defund? Amazon makes billions but you\u2019re jealous, don\u2019t buy from them. You hate Google because they\u2019re big business, don\u2019t use them. Same with Yahoo, Microsoft, and all the rest. If you don\u2019t like them, don\u2019t use them. But don\u2019t try to put dumb ideas forth for the rest of us to supposedly follow. Doesn\u2019t work that way. If, on the other hand, someone from this dumb Defund movement wants to have a debate, a conversation, a discussion, then bring it on. Otherwise, it means nothing. It will leave the people NOT INVOLVED IN THIS without protection in cities where they need it most. ",

            "answer_text": "Google and Amazon aren\u2019t (completely) taxpayer funded whereas the police are. If you don\u2019t like Google, use another search engine. If you don\u2019t like Amazon, use another website. If police in your area are violent and corrupt, you can try not calling them or talking to them, but you\u2019re still at risk of being harassed, falsely arrested, or otherwise victimized by them. Most people think that corporations shouldn\u2019t get government subsidies, but corporate welfare is very profitable for politicians of all parties because they can be turned into campaign donations. Occasionally politicians come along that fight against such grift, but sadly they are few and far between. It is a hard temptation to resist seeing how much money is at stake. ",
