            "answer_text": "Excelent question but it would be difficult to say. But I imagine you are saying what would be if he traveled in time and still was a person of the Renaissance, right? So based in that, let's start by which ones would be easy. Photographic camera, very easy because there were camera oscura that was similar, but of course, it used to take a lot of time to create an image, but he would understand easily because he understood the concept. More info here: The History of The Discovery of Cinematography Planes, helicopters, easily also because he created an idea of helicopter so it would be easy for him to grasp the idea and what we have know is not that different of what he conceived. Computers. Now we are getting closer. But NO, NOT EVEN THAT!!! Leonardo created the design of what it looks a calculation machine:  That yes, it's different of what we have for computers but if someone explained the idea, he would see it's not that different of what he conceived, so not even that. That's how amazing he was, a man out of his time completely. Space travel, no again, he knew so much about engineering and propulsion, he would see that as a normal step in time. Maybe television would impact him a little but optics and transmition of images where not that odd to him (talking about camera oscura again), so he would understand the idea but it might be odd for him that we can transfer an image from one place to another, but I believe he would not see it as something that strange. The internet might be as the television, the idea of connecting so many computers and that you could search for any knowledge there would impact him, but again, I don't think he would have a a hard time getting the idea behind but it might take some time for him to really get it, but I'm sure he would in few days. I cannot think of anything that would be that odd or strange for him to understand, he was a visionary and did some things people could just imagine there and know we see they are possible to do. So not even Quantum mechanics would be that odd. Yes, he would have a really hard time to get that idea, but you could say that for almost anyone right now, so he would just be as the next guy, but I would say he would get it faster that anyone else who is not in the area already. I like to think he get ahead of his time 500 years in many aspects but there is one I cannot be sure, but I like to think he did. In the Monalisa, you cannot be sure if the woman is smiling or not, is the viewer who gets to decide that. Again, I'm not sure if that was his intention, but that idea of the importance of the viewer has only become a reality at the end of the XIX century and beginning of the XX century, starting with literature and then we can see that in painting and other arts. So the answer would be, nothing, he would understand it all but some things would take longer, but he would get them and quicker than most normal people even today. He had a mind out of this world.

            "answer_text": "He would \u201cGET\u201d whatever he put his mind to, but that is the question, what would he put his mind to ? What didn\u2019t he explore in his day? What turned him off? What did he abject to in his day? I think he would be annoyed and repulsed by allot of modern art and sensationalism . He would be really turned off by mediocracy . He would be turned off by our modern day laziness and quick fix solutions . As in his day, he would have problems with business administration and or applied business. He wasn\u2019t into the quick buck. He was a perfectionist and too obsessed about it. He would have a real problem with business people and their mentality. Imagine describing the entire Faster Farms Chicken corporate concept to him then taking him out to the slaughter and packing yards. Imagine him in a class of 30 students being force feed concepts designed for the masses to get. He would definitely be a liberal, tree hugging hippy with militant attitudes towards corporatism. ",
