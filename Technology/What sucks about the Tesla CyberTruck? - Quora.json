            "answer_text": "My credentials: I have owned a Model 3 for about 16 months, and I have had a Ford F-150 for the last three years. I live on an acre, with lots of trees, and when the winds kick up, we get debris like nobody\u2019s business. My wife and I finally caved and bought a truck just so we can haul the yard debris to the dump. I am 5\u20326\u2033 and my wife is 5\u20324\u2033, which is important to what I feel about Tesla truck. I like the built in ramp. Makes hauling stuff up into the bed easier. What I think sucks will be the angular side walls to the bed. Yes, the cover is nice, but there are just time when your load will exceed the height of the bed side, and you need to be able to reach over the side of the bed to get to the tie-down points. At my height, it is barely possible to be able to reach over the side of the bed on the F-150 to get to the tie points. With the Cybertruck slanted bed, it will be that much harder to get to the tie points to get your load tied down. I get the idea that, for an EV, aerodynamics plays a big part in getting the range. But doggone it, a vast majority of people buy a truck because they need to haul stuff with the truck. The bed has to be utilitarian. I don\u2019t know, I will wait until the Cybertruck comes out on the road. By then the F-150 will be seven or so years old, and we MAY be ready for another truck, and having gone down the path to an EV already, this MAY be a good alternative for the next yard hauling vehicle.

What you have is a bunch of whiners saying \u201cthat\u2019s not what I think a great truck looks like\u201d Let them \u201celectrify a Ford f150. Good. It will be a smoothly running truck that slower, less roomy, and carries less than a Cybertruck, and can\u2019t drive as far. Every line on that cyber truck has a purpose. The truck screams Eff you, I dont care what you think. And I love it. Now. Its not good enough to say \u201cI dont care what you think\u201d for that, we have the Pontiac Aztec The cybertruck is just too different for some people. Musk even told everyone.. but they dont listen. Just like he told them that it was going to look like it came right out of Blade Runner. and..yet..people\u2026were\u2026still\u2026surprised. ",

This is such a big deal that I would expect Tesla to remedy it in the \u201cReal\u201d vehicle. . Apparently no provision for racks - those things that stick up out of the sides of the bed to allow carrying things like pipe, ladders, lumber and/or a box for things you don\u2019t want slamming into the back of your head in an otherwise-survivable collision. . No specs on leg room. Is it going to be a large vehicle with virtually no leg room for anybody taller than The Crash Test Dummy (like the origional Humvee was)? After seeing what they did (or didn\u2019t do\u2026) with the Model X, I have to wonder if Elon Musk knows - or even cares. ",
