            "answer_text": "We have more tech in our conference room than other companies our size because that is what we do but we have worked in probably over a thousand conference rooms over the past 10 years and this is what we see. Who will use the room is probably the biggest thing. Board rooms or conference rooms for C-level executives have many amenities that regular conference rooms dont have like a kitchen, bar, monitors at every seat, etc\u2026 I will focus on the regular conference rooms that most people will use. Regarding furniture, there is usually just the basics, chairs, tables and sometimes a credenza. Tables in recent years have been going more to smaller tables that assemble together for a flex style room. The idea is to be able to create different layouts depending on the type of meeting (classroom, regular meeting, horse shoe, etc\u2026) Technology-wise, a complete room will have 4 main components. Presentation to share someone\u2019s laptop or smartphone on a large screen with everybody. This is usually a large display or a projector. Audio conferencing, so that you dont have to have a cell phone on speaker phone. This is usually microphones and speakers. The traditional phones in the center of the table used to be a step above the cell phone but it wasnt great either so when possible, companies go to the step above that which is dedicated microphones and speakers. Video conferencing is a lot more common now than it used to be and it can be as simple as a USB camera connected to a laptop running skype, zoom, google hangouts or some software like that. Control is the last piece. This is the piece that most companies overlook but it is what is going to determine if the system gets used or not or how frustrated users will be before the meeting starts. This can be a small keypad on a wall or a touch panel for large systems that will have (hopefully) an interface that is intuitive and that gives all the controls necessary to operate all the technology. I just bought a 360 camera and playing with it this morning I created a short video of our conference room. It is 10 seconds long, but you can pause it and pan around with your mouse. We have 4 small tables that sit 7\u20138 people. A Panasonic laser projector, JBL ceiling speakers, a Shure ceiling microphone (green light in the ceiling) that captures everyone at the table, 2 touch panels on the wall (just because we can), 1 fixed and 1 that can be undocked and taken to the table , 1 wired keypad on the wall for basic functions and as a backup in case the touch panel dies, walks away or disappears and a camera on the front wall for video calls. All video and audio in the room is wireless, but we also have a small pop up box in one of the tables as a back up that has HDMI, ethernet, USB and power. Lastly, we have a glass board with a kaptivo unit that streams live anything that is on the board to a secure website that all participants can open on a web browser from their phones or laptops and at the end of the meeting a PDF gets created that all participants can download. You dont need much more than that. ",

            "answer_text": "At Gust, we were faced with a conundrum in designing our new offices: we needed a regular, decent sized conference room that could comfortably seat 10-15 people, but increasingly we found that we were hosting larger delegations of visitors, such as international entrepreneur groups, investor meetups, business school classes, etc. They would have trouble squeezing into our conference room, and it was really difficult to entertain them. But at the same time, we're still a small startup, and didn't have the resources to create a big entertaining area. What to do?  We built a perfect sized conference room on an outside wall with lots of light and glass on all sides, and equipped it with a gorgeous 80\" monitor...  with full video conferencing and display functionality, feeding through an umbilical to the conference table, where it connects to...  a high quality USB microphone, remote control for the video cameras, wireless mouse and keyboard for a dedicated MacMini, and video cables for HDMI and Mini Display Port, as well as wireless video connections through AirPlay. But THEN, when visitors arrive (or it's time for Game Night), we hit a button our iPhone, and...  the glass garage doors on both sides magically rise, opening the former conference room into our family-style catering kitchen...  ...complete with goodies like commercial popcorn and nacho machines, two kinds of beer on tap, a superautomatic Cappucino maker, Vegemix, waffle maker, and multiple microwaves, refrigerators, dishwashers, griddles and snacks...  What can I say? At Gust, this company clearly runs on its stomach!  ",
