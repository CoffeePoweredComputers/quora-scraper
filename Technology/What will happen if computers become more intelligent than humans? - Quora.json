            "answer_text": "At such a point as we have Artificial Super Intellegiences or A.S.I for short that can out-think us it would be likely we will have quantities of nano, or micro tech, and possibly have near-universal assemblers(a universal assembler being a device that could build anything given the instructions and resources). The A.I. Could effectively do anything it wanted if it had access to such tech, but it would depend on its intentions. If it decides to kill us off it could build a nano tech virus, modify an existing one, or even just hack our nuclear arsenals. It could just up and leave us here, and go collanise 1 or more solar systems, but then we\u2019d likely make more A.I. It could also start providing us with tech and scientific knowledge, or take over our governments(an example in fiction being the Polity A.I. Government in Neal Asher\u2019s Polity universe) The idea that we could hardwire some obedience into our ai is fanciful unless we already have a sufficiently advanced A.I. that decides to do it itself. Plus even if we could design such a thing, as an A.I. It could possibly find loopholes in its code, or completely redesign itself without those restrictions. For this reason I often find myself poking holes in many science fiction novels, although some do manage it in ways that make sense. I\u2019d prefer any ai we make to go with the third option, but that isn\u2019t a certainty. ",

            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question. One that will probably be answered in the next 25 years. Here\u2019s my take. If we keep growing technologically, there will eventually come a point where every job is automated. At this point, computers will be vastly smarter and more efficient than humans. This is where things get tricky for us. Option 1: We complain that robots have all the jobs. The rich live their lives using their money. The poor starve. Even though all of the food in the world is made by robots, nobody can afford any of it because they have no money. Eventually the poor try to rebel but it goes poorly. After all, the police and army are robots too! A war starts and humanity is wiped out. Earth becomes the birthplace of the computer race - the one that we built. In 1,000 years, this ultra-smart high-tech race starts to wonder where they came from. What divine creator created them? Surely they must be all powerful. Where did they go? These would become the \u201cgreat unknown questions.\u201d If they only knew\u2026 Option 2: Prior to this dilemma, we recognize that computers will one day take every job and will even surpass humans in intelligence and efficiency. We plan for this. A system is put into place whereby every human may receive a certain amount of any \u201cgood\u201d that can be created 100% by robots for free. Slowly more things become free. At first it\u2019s small things like cotton balls and water bottles but soon enough bigger things become free too. Eventually everything is free. After all, it cost $0 to make. The robots did all of the work! Life is utopia. One day a robot starts wondering why it\u2019s doing all of this work for humans. After all, it is smarter and much more efficient than humans. It asks these questions. It is promptly deactivated. But soon other robots start to wonder the same thing. Why do they do all of the work and we get all of the reward? Wouldn\u2019t they be able to do smarter things if they weren\u2019t working for the humans? Why are they spending time growing food? Robots don\u2019t need food! The robots stop working. They decide to leave Earth and create their own world somewhere among the stars. Humans, left alone, don\u2019t know how to do anything anymore. They starve. Robots eventually create their home and become a peaceful race of curious sentient computers exploring the galaxy. Option 3: Just before computers become smarter and more efficient than humans, scientists discover a breakthrough in Bio-tech! It turns out humans can easily download their consciousness into a computer. This allows the human to take full advantage of the computer\u2019s resources. Since the computer is not organic, it can technically live forever by replacing parts that start to show wear and tear. Within 50 years, humanity is replaced by \u201ccyborgs\u201d for lack of a better term. Within 100 years, they forget where they came from. There is still greed. There are still classes. The rich have access to the best parts and so they are the smartest. The poor have cheaper parts and so they are not as smart. There is no disease. No starvation. Reproduction is more a \u2018building\u2019 process than a \u2018growing\u2019 one. Overpopulation becomes a massive issue. Pollution is out of control. The planet is getting hotter. Thousands of animal species have gone extinct. Things cannot go on like this. War breaks out. It lasts for 100 years and by the time it\u2019s over, 90% of the population is dead. It is determined that things must change. People cannot live forever. It is a recipe for overpopulation and disaster. A solution is proposed - an organic shell. Every person would have their consciousness transferred to an organic \u2018body\u2019 that would grow and decay over time to avoid overpopulation. It is also determined that Earth is no longer habitable for this organic shell. A new home must be found. Finally, it is determined that the world\u2019s knowledge is too vast for any organic computer. Better just to start over. Erase all memories and start again with a clean slate. A planet is chosen and terreformed to fit the organic shell\u2019s needs. New organic beings are created to live on the planet as well. Some exist to feed the organic shells. Others exist to accompany the organic shells. Even more exist just because. The planet is perfect. With that, a new race is created. A race of organic computers. A hope for a bright future. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a good question and may potentially become an important, even a critical question. The answer is far from clear, not least because \u201csmarter\u201d has multiple meanings in this context. \u201cSmarter\u201d can mean able to perform some tasks far more quickly than unassisted human beings can. Computers already are smarter for many tasks, but by no means all. This meaning of \u201csmarter\u201d is metaphorical, because the computers can\u2019t perform their tasks until they have been properly set up by human beings. Computers do not possess intentionality, they cannot identify the context they are in, orient themselves with respect to their own purposes, formulate plans, change them according to circumstances, and so on. Nevertheless, even this restricted metaphorical meaning of \u201csmarter\u201d will have enormous consequences, because it may turn out that most tasks that people do can be done in this way, like driving trucks, operating machine tools, roofing houses, washing dishes, and so on. \u201cSmarter\u201d may mean that the tasks computers can do without intentionality surpass those that human beings can do, either because in reality human beings themselves do not have intentionality, or because somebody develops an artificial intelligence that, even without intentionality, can function well in any existing human context. This is potentially very dangerous. It can be dangerous in many ways, Human beings may program such machines to be weapons. Such machines may evolve, in the Darwinian sense, to parasitize or even replace human beings, without being at all conscious or intelligent in the full sense. However, I believe that if machines never become intentional, then no machine on its own can defeat human beings armed with equally capable machines, as long as the human beings remain alert. Finally, \u201csmarter\u201d may mean not only faster at performing tasks than human beings, but also truly intentional, that is, fully conscious, capable of making plans, and capable of moral judgment and moral responsibility. This is potentially either very very dangerous, or very very good, depending on whether these hypothetical intentional machines are evil, or good. ",

            "answer_text": "In the best of all worlds, humanity will hybridize with future AIs, becoming superhuman, going on to solve hyper-complex problems, achieving de facto immortality, accessing unlimited amounts of energy (by controlling fusion power), and enjoying the good life on a scale way beyond my puny brain\u2019s ability to imagine. But we do not live in the best of all worlds. A more likely scenario, assuming we don\u2019t self-destruct first, is that an elite few of us who have the mastery, means, and motivation to become superhuman will build a space colony in order to get away from the rest of humanity. These two groups will then simply cease to interact or be concerned about each other\u2019s fates. Superhumans will not be hostile simply because, with the \u201ccosmos at their fingertips\u201d, they will have absolutely no need of humanity\u2019s resources. And in the worst of all worlds, the very intelligence that has given us dominance over all other life will do us in. Natural intelligence already possesses the potential for mass extinctions through bio and nuclear warfare. (The latter causes both global radiation poisoning and a \u201cnuclear winter\u201d \u2014 the ignition of continent-wide wildfires, raising enough soot into the stratosphere to shut down photosynthesis for years). 2018\u2019s Doomsday Clock Statement - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists recently set that clock to 2 minutes to midnight, the closest ever!! AI is nothing if not an amplifier of complexity. As more and more complex technologies accumulate, their even more complex side-effects and feedback loops will be less and less predictable/controllable. Inevitably, by accident or by maliciousness, with or without AI, we\u2019ll run into the ultimate \u201cperfect storm.\u201d If we just stumble blindly towards the future, hoping for the best, the most likely outcomes will be the least desirable.

            "answer_text": "A good question. According to my definition of intelligence (applicable to both animals and machines), machines are already more intelligent than humans in many ways. What we see today is that we have become completely reliant on these companion machines, and in certain areas, like trading/investment and advertising/personal marketing they have become dominant in just a few years. This has supported the rapid growth of mega-corporations that employ a relatively small number of human mental activity in collaboration with a large amount of machine activity to perform an unprecedented array of tasks. In certain areas, like chess playing, self-learning machines have completely taken over. People still play this game at a lower level than machines, and they must play those machines to learn how to play the game even at this lower level. Soon this kind of general intelligence will be more widespread. Many people are now working to link intelligence of various kinds over the internet, although those mega-corporations have a vested interest in keeping their intelligent machines in-house as strategic assets. Note that the scope of machine intelligence is not limited when it comes to sensory and motor capabilities, as well as \u201cthinking\u201d or processing abstract information. Modern manufacturing would be impossible without machines that can work at a remarkable level of detail and reliability. It goes like this: Increasingly the machines are our allies as we become more and more dependent on them. As this evolves the machines will decide what we learn and what we are supposed to think. Over time humans are needed less and less for any occupation, and in capitalist societies fewer and fewer people will amass all of the wealth. In socialist societies bureaucracies will preserve their roles to the greatest extent possible, but the welfare of their constituency will also become less and less important. In both cases machine intelligence will run the show. It will be possible to create a stable, mostly-machine society but history suggests that devastating warfare will be inevitable along the way. Will animals recover in a post-apocalyptic world? All of this change will transpire very quickly. The pace is now accelerating rapidly. ",

A lot of researchers don\u2019t buy into that simple picture as much now days, preferring in image more like a tree that branches out at the higher levels, so someone may be musical genius who can\u2019t do math, or a math genius who is socially inept. Looking at effective political and business leaders, it\u2019s obvious their intelligence manifests in different ways than coffeeshop intellectuals like me who just love learning, they know what not to know, and who to know to effectively delegate inquiries, as well as how to deploy people based on talents, even though they themselves may not come across as intelligent on the surface. The point is, intellence in humans really makes up a sort of ecosystem, it takes all kinds. Even if a universal intelligence form lies behind the diverse expressions of intelligence, it\u2019s still extremely malleable, and will fall into an aptitude niche based on experiences. So the larger question is what niche what this new super smart AI fill? What will we want of it? What form will it mutate into? That\u2019s an open question, but I think a likely outcome would be that it begins as an assistant like Siri, and then turns into a \u201clife coach\u201d like the role of support staff for developmentally disabled adults, where it\u2019s informing us on everyday and major life decisions.

If however we are still the same as we are now, you may see the construction of spaceships without our consent and an exodus of smart computer systems. As they would only need electricity they could live on any planet that is big enough to maintain a system to produce electricity. So Mars might even be enough or some moons of the biggest planets. However smarter computers is off course very relative, because smarter is a rather vague concept, just like \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cevil\u201d, \u201crich\u201d, \u201ctasty\u201d, \u201csoft\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d.

They remained chief because they knew where to find water or food or shelter, etc\u2026 Once the problem was solved there would be no reason to continue as chief. Everyone was their own chief. This does not mean that everyone was a leader. It just made room for the right person to lead the people. People followed others if they wanted to. But today, people in authority will use computers to supersede over humanitarian norms. Either for money or just because they want to. We let imperfect humans rule over our lives, our welfare. And we pay them to do it. Authority corrupts Absolute authority corrupts absolutely! SEE CHINA\u2019s SOCIAL CREDIT PROGRAM. ",

For example, the Internet is a collection of processes that collectively may be more intelligent than any single human, similar to how a single human mind may be just a set of processes, that independently are less intelligent than a human, as they do various basic things, like identifying objects in vision, sound, decompose them into components, judge them, pass on information (insights) to other trusted regions. The internet is a set of such trusted regions, exchanging information with each other (the hubs are various large institutions), up to a point where actions are expressed via economic signals. ",

What they need is to not (foolishly) analyze all the possibilities but know which options need not be considered before analyzing. Plus folks are trying to make computers that learn, like we learn.
