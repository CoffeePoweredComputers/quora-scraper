            "answer_text": "Living in Estonia is sophisticated, more sophisticated than anywhere else in the Europe owing to its high-tech systems. Most of the things have gone online, no matter they have gone online or not elsewhere in the EU. Right now the wages seem to be lower but they are just poised to grow higher. It is also of political significance as it is close to Russia and it is also a NATO country. Its people are wiser and have the will power to make firm decisions. The president is a strong will power lady who first started e-residence and even after years, though all admire it, no one has plans to start e-residence. They have lack of will power and hence lack of technical resources. It is such a hig-tech nation that even if its government is set to exile, it will continue operating while in exile and all records will remain intact. This is specially good for IT companies and businesses and as all businesses are dependent on IT, and now further on IoT or Internet of Things, which has most sophisticatedly named by a scholar Jay as Internet Automation or Network Automation- NA, as the scholar cites in his business blog on one of his domain registration transfer and renting or lease portals with business advisory. Now as decision making by the regime is more easy than anywhere else as among less people there will be less less school of though and thereby less conflicts and control can also be exercised easily. Tallinn does not need to contend its own people as Washington DC, and as Trump\u2019s legs are pulled by his own countrymen who are ready to drown America for their pseudo persona of being noble humanitarians. The approach which is destructive and disastrous and impragmatic is destroying America and even Trump seems helpless and takes U-turns from his commitments. It is such a situation where even POTUS turns helpless, now set aside anybody else. But small and competent nation will be super power of the future.  TALLINN, ESTONIA The framework of a highly developed Estonia has been made by the Estonian president,now what really mater is favorable approach of the residents rather than adverse. With time when the sowed seeds will bear results in the near future the outcome will stun everyone. Special features of Estonia i. Hig-tech control and operation of regime ii. High-tech IT business infrastructure iii. Lesser possibility of internal conflict iv. Survival or persistence of regime even in extremely adverse situations as Tibetan government set in Exile by China v. Proposed fully crypto currency nation. vi. Liberal pro-developmental regime policies vii. Ease of business operation viii. NATO country ix. Russian proximity x. EU membership and so on\u2026\u2026.  ESTONIAN GIRLS This determines a very bright future for Estonia despite pessimism of a few. What more, even the regional IT based businesses lie those of news and entertainment media as hindi media audio and video domain of the portal, even those of vast countries are being located in Estonia as it provides opportunities and the executive is comparatively honest. This proves how businesses can be controlled form Estonia. Thus, the favorable circumstances of Estonia create high optimism. ",

            "answer_text": "Estonia is a very unique country that is high tech but full of nature and ancient history. On one hand, it is know as the most technologically advanced country in the world for its good infrastructure, fast internet, startup scene, business visa programs, Estonian e-residency, and other features such as the ability to vote online. On the other, it\u2019s the least densely-populated country in Europe with the highest amount of natural predators in the wild. Quite an interesting mix! While it\u2019s close to Russia and Finland, it is also almost completely flat. There are many primeval forests, bogs, animals, birds, and other wildlife. The countryside is quite rural but pretty and safe, which makes it great for a road trip. In the capital city of Tallinn, there is a high quality of life, lots of water and trails to explore along the Black Sea. It\u2019s also known for its picturesque Old Town, nightlife, restaurants, and history. You can also take a ferry from Tallinn to Helsinki.  The other large cities are Parnu (beach), and Tartu - known for its university. The cost of living in Estonia is quite high, but that is characteristic of parts of Northern Europe and Scandinavia. The cuisine is similar to Scandinavia as well, with lots of fresh bread, cheese, yogurt, fish, berries, and beer (also nice craft cocktails). The population isn\u2019t that diverse, but almost everyone speaks English, which is helpful for visitors. I also found the locals to be friendly but not particularly outgoing. Overall, Estonia is a quiet, pleasant place to explore and is a nice place to visit if you like nature, history, and are looking for something different compared to Western Europe, but cheaper than Sweden, Norway, or Denmark.
