            "answer_text": "UPDATE: Either I missed it or the person who asked the question added \u201cNikola\u201d meaning the person, not the car company. Sooo, I read the question wrong but will leave my answer for anyone who might have made the same mistake I made. And by the way, GREAT question, Nikola Tesla DID have some sort of idea for free electricity for the masses. I\u2019m not qualified to answer! Not sure how to answer this one. Perhaps the person asking is shorting Tesla stock (meaning they stand to make money when the stock goes down, ie they want to see the company fail) and is hoping that by asking a leading question will cause others to think less of Tesla. So the answer is NOTHING \u201chappened\u201d to Tesla\u2019s free electricity for the \u201cmasses.\u201d Now here is where I will make assumptions. I assume the the question is leading me to ask myself: hmmm, something happened? I read further and I again ask, electricity was free for the masses? Then I think hmm, I do recall something about Tesla charging is free for life. Next I think ah, Tesla took it away :-( Now since I\u2019m the average person I now have the idea in my head that Tesla took away free charging. If I were considering Tesla as a choice for a vehicle, this may be enough for me to give other brands more consideration. (score one for a person shorting the stock!) If I\u2019m just a little suspect of the company or even just big companies I might think, I knew, it they are no good (score two point for the shorter) Next time Tesla comes up in conversation I can add my negative position as I believe it to be true. If anyone I discuss this with shifts their opinion of Tesla in a negative way, score a bunch more points for shorters. If there are people who own Tesla stock in the conversation perhaps we as a pair, or even worse, a group - we all might come to the conclusion that maybe it\u2019s time to sell our Tesla stock. Shorters score again! THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT SOMEONE SHORTING TESLA IS AIMING TO ACHIEVE. Maybe you get the impression I don\u2019t like Shorting stocks. That would be correct. We are taking about a real company that has real people at it working hard to produce something. That\u2019s worth something to me. The fact that companies have to contend with large groups of people whose sole purpose is betting that the company will fail AND taking active steps to make it happen is an unfair pressure on a company. (I know, life is unfair. But I don\u2019t have to encourage it) So asking a leading question like this one, on a public forum that tends to be well read can be in fact damaging to Tesla. Now for the truth, and I sincerely apologize if the person asking the question is maybe an 8th grader with a serious question. If you are, good on you for your curiosity and so sorry about being an \u201cadult\u201d and talking about stuff that was not really your question. Here is the answer you were looking for. **NOTHING \u201chappened\u201d to Tesla\u2019s free electricity for the \u201cmasses.\u201d** If what you mean is that the Model 3 is the car for the masses - free charging was never promised for this car. To be clear the FREE for LIFE charging has NEVER been offered to Model 3 buyers. If anyone can show me this in writing, from Tesla, I PLEASE let me know as this would be very uncool of Tesla. The Model S and X DID offer free charging. For the LIFE of THAT car. Why might Tesla offer it on the S and X free? Well, long pause, compare the price of the S and X to the Model 3. I think that explains it. More bluntly, as Tesla says, Free Supercharging was \u201cbundled\u201d into the sales price. In fact, the Nissan Leaf offers FREE charging for ONE year. (bundled) This is a bonus a person gets when buying these cars. So yes, the Model S and X had the bonus for FREE for a number of years thus providing \u201cfree\u201d (bundled) electricity. However, the S and X are not cars for \u201cthe masses\u201d - even if it seems like it where I live! I see them all the time! Love it! But sadly, I am not one of them. There is good news though, the new \u201cbundle\u201d is: \u201cAs of 1/1/2017 buyers get 400 kWh of free Supercharging credits per year.\u201d Even better: IF you can get a referral code from an existing Tesla owner you would receive FREE for LIFE Supercharger access (as long as you own the car) on the new Model S or Model X purchased. So if you want an S or an X with free Supercharging, flag down an owner. I\u2019m sure they will be happy to help you out. Heck, I\u2019ll help you find one if it will convince you to buy a Tesla. End notes that are not really relevant to the question: I do own a Nissan Leaf. I think the overall experience is far superior to any gas car I\u2019ve ever owned. 50K and I still have all my \u201cbars\u201d - a measure of battery capacity. I do not miss stopping for gas.I do not have any range anxiety.I love how quiet it is.I appreciate the snappy acceleration.Low maintenance - tires and wipers has been about it with 50K I was a bit surprised, I really don\u2019t drive more than 80 mile in one day. I\u2019ve owned mid range cars. Honda, Toyota, VW and Ford. I\u2019ve driven well over 100k in various brands of rentals including the big USA three, the South Koreans and Audi and Mercedes but never BMW - just never had the opportunity. Lots of love for driving. Electric really is the best experience, in my opinion. I like to take 400\u2013800 mile trips about 2 or 3 times a year. I keep an old Honda Civic for this purpose. If or when it every dies I will just rent cars for these trips. I\u2019d love to have a Model S because with Supercharging it would cover 100% of my driving needs but reality says the extra cost of the S is better spent elsewhere. However, I think it is pretty remarkable that the Leaf covers ALL of my daily needs. I even have a little trailer that I can haul stuff in. And I\u2019ve hauled a TON of stuff in it. I mean literally, 2,000 pounds! The gravel place weighed it. Advice: drive slow, plan for stops, use back roads, 25\u201330mph and all is well. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "This is an ambiguous question. It has for subjects both Tesla Motors (company) and Nikola Tesla. Nikola Tesla the eccentric inventor and electrical pioneer for whom Tesla Motors is named after in his later life was pursuing and promising free wireless electricity for everyone. But the other topic, Tesla Motors, has promised supercharging stations around the country that will charge their EV cars, and that for certain customers, the charging will be free of charge. Two entirely different scenarios. I think not that many are familiar with Nikola Tesla, a legendary figure. So going against the grain, Tesla was a genius shall we say. He invented the polyphase induction motor which is the workhorse electrical motor; Tesla Motors uses them in the cars. He is probably responsible along with Westinghouse for the AC power distribution and grid we have that works so well today. In his later life Tesla was making some outrageous claims however, that he was onto something big - wireless electricity for everyone that was going to be totally free. Tesla in his workshop:  By http://wellcomeimages.org/indexplus/obf_images/4c/6e/da5709a57832dbbb048ba4a17fe6.jpgGallery: http://wellcomeimages.org/indexplus/image/M0014782.htmlPhotographer: Dickenson V. Alley, CC BY 4.0, File:Nikola Tesla, with his equipment Wellcome M0014782.jpg After 1890 inventor Nikola Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using spark-excited radio frequency resonant transformers, now called Tesla coils, which generated high AC voltages.] Early on he attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. He found he could increase the distance at which he could light a lamp by using a receiving LC circuit tuned to resonance with the transmitter's LC circuit. using resonant inductive coupling. Tesla failed to make a commercial product out of his findings but the resonant inductive coupling used is now a familiar technology used throughout electronics and is currently being widely applied to short-range wireless power systems. (left) Experiment in resonant inductive transfer by Tesla at Colorado Springs 1899. The coil is in resonance with Tesla's magnifying transmitter nearby, powering the light bulb at bottom. (right) Tesla's unsuccessful Wardenclyffe power station. Tesla went on to develop a wireless power distribution system that he hoped would be capable of transmit power long distance directly into homes and factories. Early on he seemed to borrow from the ideas of Mahlon Loomis, proposing a system composed of balloons to suspend transmitting and receiving electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet (9,100 m) in altitude, where he thought the pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions of volts) long distances. To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air he set up a test facility at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899. Experiments he conducted there with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, as well as observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes, led him to incorrectly conclude that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy. The theory included driving alternating current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil working against an elevated capacitance to make the potential of the Earth oscillate. Tesla thought this would allowing alternating current to be received with a similar capacitive antenna tuned to resonance it at any point on Earth with very little power loss. His observations also led him to believe a high voltage used in a coil at an elevation of a few hundred feet would \"break the air stratum down\", eliminating the need for miles of cable hanging on balloons to create his atmospheric return circuit. Tesla would go on the next year to propose a \"World Wireless System\" that was to broadcast both information and power worldwide and attempted in 1901 to construct a large high-voltage wireless power station, now called the Wardenclyffe Tower, at Shoreham, New York. By 1904 investment dried up and the facility was never completed. http://www.teslasociety.com/tesla_tower.htm So what happened to these promises? He was not able to deliver a working system and whatever secret plans he had he took to the grave when he died a penniless man. ",

            "answer_text": "Simply put, the company made a decision that terminated the free use of charging the vehicle at their Superchargers, which was offered to Roadsters, Model S and Model X vehicles purchased in the past. This is mostly in anticipation of the Model 3 and the massive expected volume of cars to be produced. The prior models were premium vehicles at a premium price, and while they are still just that, Tesla decided to end that program. However owners are still alloted some amount of \u201cfree\u201d supercharging, just not unlimited. However, the Superchargers are not intended for everyday charging, but mostly for long-distance driving along highways between cities.
