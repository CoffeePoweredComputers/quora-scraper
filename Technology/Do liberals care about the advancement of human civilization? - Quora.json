            "answer_text": "Human civilization is more likely to advance when the population is well-educated and has a firm stock of knowledge to build on. An ignorant population ends up doing menial labor to benefit more advanced foreign nations. Liberals are very much in favor of education. Human civilization is more likely to advance when they are continually trying new methods and ideas and adopting the ones that work. Conservatives try to protect traditional methods and ideology, even when they don\u2019t work. Liberals are skeptical of tradition and in favor of change. Human civilization is more likely to advance when civilization is stable and the population is invested in the societal structure. If people are starving, they lose that societal investment and turn to crime to feed themeselves and their families. If a lot of people are starving, nations become vulnerable. Look at what happened in Russia, France, and Cuba. Look at what nearly happened in Ireland. Liberals want to protect the stability of civilization by keeping the poorest people from becoming desperate and dangerous. Human civilization is more likely to advance when it is healthy. Pandemic health crises can decimate the population and destroy the economy. But if a person in generally good health catches a terrible disease, he has a fighting chance of surviving and getting better. If a person in poor health catches a terrible disease, it is almost certainly going to kill him. A healthy population is a resilient population. It will fare better if a new disease sweeps through the nation. Liberals are in favor of high-quality healthcare for all people. Human civilization is more likely to advance when all members of the society are able to contribute to the best of their ability. When women are prevented from advancing in their careers despite ability and hard work, society suffers. When a high-performing person is not permitted to perform at the highest level of their ability, then all they would have accomplished is lost to us. When minorities are kept in menial jobs, locked in poverty, and deprived of opportunity, everything they would have accomplished is lost to us. When those accomplishments do not happen, human civilization advances more slowly than it would have otherwise. Liberals are greatly in favor of ending sexism and racism. Liberals are in favor of education, ingenuity, stable society, a healthy population, and opportunity for advancement for everybody. All these things advance civilization. The real question is, why do conservatives oppose them? ",

            "answer_text": "Given that liberals and conservative voters run about equal in most elections with the winner winning by only a small margin of votes, I wonder if you mean, do they want to subside everyone\u2019s hedonism? The Trump vote was like not all conservative. Keep in mind, progressives who succumbed to the Russian propaganda and lies about HRC, probably voted for him, too. Statistics also show that those with higher education vote democrat. Is high education somehow associated with \u201chedonism\u201d? I think not. Here is a story that might explain liberalism to you. There was once a conservative man who had a lovely waterfront home and the water was sparkling clean and transparent. Then he began to find debris in his water, and the water got cloudy and he called experts in and they told him that the debris was coming from other home owners and businesses and even from over seas. The man was very irate because he loved his beautful blue water and it distressed him greatly to find medical debris and garbage on his pristine shores. He tried to build a dam around his property, and sand bars and put a net in the water to try to filter out the disgusting items and debris, but all the junk just caught on the net and it created a a barrier and the beach began to erode and in some areas there was stagnant water and a stench. The situation got worse and worse and no matter what he tried, the ocean outside his bedroom was no longer the joy it had been. He took down the barriers and stopped efforts to keep out the debris as he realized that the sea reaches everywhere and as long as there are ignorant, nasty people littering the earth and blighting our communities, we will all suffer. He began to see that most of the Earth\u2019s problems are related to the very same thing - lack of education, poverty, and the basest of human instincts, such as avarice and ego. In one word, Ignorance. With this realization, he became a liberal. ",

How does elimination of government funding of basic science contribute to the advancement of human civilization? How does putting regulations on who and how someone loves advance human civilization? Or did you mean that the only \u201ccivilization\u201d is rich, white, straight men? Taxes, and public goods funded by those taxes, do not impede civilization. They are civilization. ",
