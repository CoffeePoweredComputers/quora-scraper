            "answer_text": "What is Apple up to with iPhone upgrade program? Making money. Apple is up to making money. They make money by getting people to buy iPhones and this program will get more people to buy iPhones, thus bringing in lots of sweet sweet cash that Apple can stockpile in their giant spaceship. It is not clear for me how Apple profits from this program. Let me see if I can clear it up. More upgraded phones? Yes! Control of the second hand market? Not control, just getting a piece of that sweet market money. Does it help them sell more credit cards? Apple doesn\u2019t sell credit cards. Do they get commission for bringing customers to Citizens Bank? Yes and other banks, but that\u2019s a fraction of the money they make. Like a rounding error. What am I missing???? Let me help out. iPhones hold their value very well. So older model iPhones sell for a lot of money. An iPhone that is 2 years old still sells for 50% of the value. So if Apple can buy those at a discounted rate, they can refurbish them (they already have all the infrastructure in place), sell them, and make a ton of money on the margin. What\u2019s more they just sold two iPhones and made money and may have brought someone into their first, lower cost iPhone, likely getting another lifetime customer. Without the trade-in program, two things will happen instead of them making money on two iPhone sales: either the original owner would have still upgraded and they would have made money on the upgrade while another outfit like Gazelle would have made money on the trade in, or the original owner would have just held onto their iPhone for longer. The second buyer might have bought a used iPhone from someone else or a cheaper Android phone instead. So with the iPhone program best case Apple sells two iPhones and brings in at least one more iPhone user into the Apple ecosystem. Without the iPhone trade-in program worst case Apple sells no iPhones and someone bought a cheap Android phone. Seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it? The only people who suffer are the people who offer iPhone trade-in programs whose business Apple is stealing. ",
