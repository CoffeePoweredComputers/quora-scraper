In fact the General Intelligence (G) has started declining in the west since about 1800. We simply have it too good, and have removed darwinian selection pressure and replaced it by dysgenic behaviour. This will likely continue until we can no longer keep the machines running. Or an event happens that collapses the economic system. Note that the event that will collapse our economic system can become smaller and smaller in magnitude since we become every day less capable of dealing with it. Then darwinian selection will reestablish itself en the cycle can take another turn. ",
