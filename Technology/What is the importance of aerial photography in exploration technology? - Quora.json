            "answer_text": "Aerial photography is used widely whenever there is a need of mineral exploration.Moreover, in exploration geophysics, aerial photography can be used to determine the physical components of subsurface and its anomalies. Apart from that, there are a few more types of explorations in which aerial photography holds quite an unbeatable importance \u2013 fossil fuel exploration, hydrocarbon exploration, geothermal exploration and groundwater exploration. With an aerial photography, a geologist can extract a precise and concentrated picture of earth and its particular conditions. So, if you are looking for any photographers in Canberra, who can offer top quality professional aerial photography service, then contact only Geoff Comfort Photography.  ",

Aerial photography plays an important role in exploration technology..You can map a very larger area in very less time and cost. Aerial photographs are 40% overlaps so they are pretty much accurate. Exposed features can be easily recognized, and interpretation is also quick.. ",

            "answer_text": "Aerial photography is undeniably a vital part of exploration technology. What else than a UAV explores the remote terrains better? Moreover, aerial photography has become so advanced that it is now possible to garner geographical details of an area by just flying a drone over it. The drones these days are optimized for performance, size and cost; thus, reasons for low aerial photography prices. To know this niche better, you can visit Survey Graphics Mapping Consultants. ",
