            "answer_text": "In theory, no, not by design. Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) systems have antennas located inside and outside of the vehicle. The PKE transmits a signal to the vehicle and the antennas determine relative position of the key to the vehicle space. It can determine if the PKE is inside or outside the vehicle.  The video illustrates how a PKE (marketed as a PEPS by Valeo) works in conjunction with the vehicle\u2019s body control module to locate the key and activate various subsystems (door locks, puddle lamps, etc). In practice, low battery reduces the strength of the transmitting key and can cause errors. Additionally, if the antenna is not packaged correctly or there is insufficient antennas, the vehicle sheetmetal can block the signal (blind spot) causing errors. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. \u201cKeyless entry\u201d simply means that you have some method of unlocking the vehicle without using a physical key (hence \u201ckeyless\u201d). Remote entry systems have been around for decades. It is very easy to lock a basic remote, along with the rest of your keys, inside the vehicle. \u201cSmart\u201d keys, on the other hand, are a different matter. Smart keys are detected by the vehicle anytime they are near the vehicle, and the vehicle knows if the keys are inside or outside the vehicle. If you lock the doors, and then close them, and the vehicle detects that the keys are inside the vehicle, the doors will unlock and an alarm of some kind will sound to alert you to the situation. ",
