Some do, the vast majority don\u2019t. I doubt it\u2019ll take off like they think it will. Most gamer\u2019s are happy with the current solution. EDIT: Where I think it will be profitable is not as a replacement service but as a supplementary service like Geforce now or Xcloud that isn\u2019t too expensive. ",

            "answer_text": "Shareholders and Mr moneybags want it to be the future of gaming because it has many things that hurt the consumer. It has DRM which prevents the player from selling or buying games from unofficial sources, monthly fees which makes them able to gain a income every month. It can also be done for very cheap making it a low cost investment for the consumer, and high profit for mr moneybags. No, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be the future of gaming. ",
