            "answer_text": "Technology allows each of us to be more efficient at not wasting resources. If we were 7 billion cave dwellers, we all would've consumed ALL nature. All forests would have been burnt, all fish, gone, all large game, gone, etc. Soon, we can actually pretend like we live on another planet and save its environment. We do this by extracting resources below the fragile biosphere. We can almost dig in space, too already! And we can mostly live in mega structures, awesome and as of yet unimagined 3D cities with plenty of kickback space (that's yardspace with a few hours of sunlight, too). It should be possible to turn Earth into a giant nature reserve (and tourist trap) within the next century or so. \u201cJust\u201d 100 billion people could be living in some 500,000 such 200 story tall mega structures. That's just 1 per thousand sq km of Earth land. More on the ocean, too! In a couple centuries or so, a thousand times that population should be living in mega structures spinning in space\u2026 ",

Even though millions of people seem to think so and make decisions based on nothing more than ignorance and a desire to think they\u2019re actually accomplishing something good. Stupid is as stupid does. ",
