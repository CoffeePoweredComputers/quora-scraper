            "answer_text": "There are many forms of clean coal technology (CCT). I will not list them here. CCT began in earnest in the late 70s. By 1992, I was asked by my employer to research and write a report on the various methods and impacts for business development. The report is lost to antiquity, I\u2019m afraid, but here is what I remember: Ash removal from the airstream: This is the oldest CCT. Bag houses and electrostatic precipitators collect ash. It is then landfilled and monitored. Today, sometimes the ash is used in cement blocks for buildings to meet LEED certification requirements. Controlling the ash mitigates the challenges of putting all that ash in the air. The advantage is clear air. Beijing\u2019s bad-looking air is a result of urban coal-fired power plants, among others. Moisture removal: coals with a high moisture content are sometimes cooked or dried prior to shipping so water is not shipped. The advantage is this increases the BTU per pound and the price per pound and saves on shipping costs. Sulfur dioxide (SO2 or SOx for multiple oxidations) removal: This requires a scrubber on the smoke stack and is fairly expensive ($100s of millions). They come is dry and wet packed scrubbers. They also remove ash. The advantage is no acid rain. Nitrogen oxides (NO2 or NOx for multiple oxidations) removal: See SOx above, except less NOx is removed. The advantage is less smog (brown cloud). Carbon dioxide removal: This one is newer. I only know of 2 methods at this point. Capturing it and injecting it into the ground, really deep, and bubbling the airstream through algae-filled water tanks where the algae grows and gets farmed. The advantage is less CO2 in the atmosphere from humans. Other: I have come across other methods over the years, but quickly dismissed them as fraudulent and thought no more about them. Hope this answer helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, the term \u201cclean coal.\u201d It is just a marketing tool that really should be \u201cslightly less filthy coal\u201d. Which of course doesn\u2019t have the same marketing appeal. \u201cClean Coal\u201d is used to describe two different technologies, Ultra Super Critical power generation and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Untra Super Critical power generation refers to is coal that is pulverised and the steam created is at at a much higher temperature, up around 600 degrees. This increases efficiency and decreases CO2 emissions by between 9% and 17%. So, it is more efficient than normal coal, saving emissions. However the cost to build these power stations increases by 20% to 30%. So, it is a little cleaner and much more expensive. Far more expensive than renewables and still much les \u201cclean\u201d The second \u201cclean coal\u201d refers to Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS). This can remove 90% to 100% of the carbon and so is very clean. The trouble is that it is very inefficient and requires at least twice as much coal. It has also never been done at comercial scale. Most probably because the cost far too prohibitive. Compared to renewables, \u201cclean coal\u201d has no advantages. Renewables are already cheaper than standard coal and far cheaper and cleaner than \u201cclean coal\u201d Why are we even having this discussion? ",
