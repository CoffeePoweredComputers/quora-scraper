            "answer_text": "Previous posters all have addressed very valid points.Price. Weight. Range. Performance. I would like to add another one, which is a big factor for many motorcyclists.Motorcycles are seldom a choice of reason. Of logic.While some people will buy one to get to through traffic faster on their way to the job place, most people will buy one out of pure passion.Motorcycles stir the soul.Motorcycles are an object of passion, for many people. They are not a rational choice.There is a connection between them and the rider that simply does not exist with a car, no matter how good it is.One aspect that does, erm... drive the soul... is the sound.It really is.Making a motorcycle engine sing at high revs is thrilling.And addictive.Some manufactures have sound departments, where engineers specifically design exhaust systems not for maximum performance or lower weight or to fit here and there, but to sound good.Many, many motorcyclists buy aftermarket exhausts not for the performance gain but for the sound alone. Some people even buy specific models based on the sound they provide... An electrical motorcycle just doesn't cut it...It really doesn't. P.S.on a side note, there is something that most people don't consider with electrical vehicles.Batteries last only a few years. Then, you have to change them.These batteries are VERY, VERY, VERY expensive.Most people don't take this into consideration when they do their calculations on how much does it cost running an electrical vehicle.What you save on fuel... well, a big chink of it will go to new batteries after a few years.

            "answer_text": "One important factor that is not directly mentioned here: Batteries are heavy. Electric car manufacturers have done a good job of using super light materials on the car chassis such as aluminum and carbon, and using this room for increased weight due to batteries. Scooters and motorcycles have a much smaller total weight already. There is less room to play with. Bmw already has a maxi-scooter ( BMW C evolution) out that has a 100 km range. This is an acceptable range for daily commuter use. But they are expensive compared to gas-consuming competition. Please see following table for comparison of range, top speed, weight, max. power and price (Germany):                      BMW C evolution    BMW C600   Vespa300ieRange           100 km                 min. 285 km     min. 235Top km/h    120 km/h            175 km/h           122km/hWeight         265kg                    249kg               163kgMax.Pwr      15 PS                    60PS                 22 PSPrice            15000 Euro           11200 Euro     5790 Euro In summary, BMW electric is trying to achieve what Vespa is doing with more than 2.5 times the price and with more than 60 % additional weight.

            "answer_text": "Two factors that separate gas-driven motorcycles from their electric 'counterparts': Range and recharge time. An electric bike might (!) have equivalent range as a gas-powered bike (if ridden conservatively), but the breaking factor is the recharge time.  Until we see universal-fit modular battery systems that allow someone to 'swap out' a depleted battery for a fully-charged one in minutes (instead of sitting around for 4-8 hours for theirs to recharge), there probably won't be much acceptance of electrics.  And where there's little acceptance, the major manufacturers won't pour money into R&D.  They'll let the boutique companies (Brammo, Zero, etc) do the heavy research, and then license their designs once the electric bike tech reaches the point where it can compete with gas engines, across the entire spectrum of riding.

All valid reasons why a company wouldn't want to jump in and make an electric bike but none of the reasons stated prevent them from doing it.  I don't see the most innovative.  motorcycle companies in the world (Honda, BMW, etc) with millions in R&D simply waiting for small upstarts to invent the future and then license it from them at an unknown cost. It just goes against their entire heritage.  I read a lot about the range and recharge time issue which brings to mind Tesla. Tesla has done it with great success. Yes they are expensive, $60k+.  Why is there not a mass produced Tesla equivalent in the motorcycle world. Say $30k, 200mile+ range, 1hr to 80% recharge, packed with innovation, and super high quality. ",

I get over 50 mpg!If I took it easy I can go 1000 miles on just 4 or 5 stops...Think about this, 1K miles for under $100 in fuel, on a bike I paid around 5K for.  Don't get me wrong, the idea of electric is awesome! But we're talking upwards to $16K for a bike that goes 100 miles and then needs to recharge for 4 hours. Which is acceptable if you live in a city I guess. But if that was the case I'd probably buy a new Ninja 300 for $4K and putt around at 70-85 mpg.  And at 350 miles a tank one fill up would last weeks.  So to conclude the response, although it's a wonderful concept it's simply not feasible yet. ",

And the price starts at $39K So until battery technology improves electric motorcycles will be a niche market for people wanting to be green (that do not mind the disadvantages: price, range, price, unpredictable range, price, super mega ultra slow refueling, price, lack of noise, price, and for some being automatic).  That does not count the fact that there are few model types (currently there is no cruiser, sport touring, touring, cafe racer, and choppers). One thing I do not understand is why none of the companies have a chopper.  Electric bikes could compete in this category very well. As a motorcycle class/group choppers have the shortest range (usually around or lower than the average electric without extended packs).  They are unreasonably expensive. Usually have very powerful engines (do not know why).  Except for being quiet, and electric chopper would be perfect. ",

Electrical scooters now come into the competitive range of conventional scooters. As they often are used within city limits, they may get unexpected legal help. As soon as major cities decude to close their central areas for vehicles with combustuon engines, affordable vehicles with electric engine become desireable. Today a scooter which reaches 30 mph and a range of 60 miles, meet the requiremets of many people. And these types of scooter are widely available. In Munich several Pizza delivery services use elechtric scooters. Motorbikes are a different story. They need at least 100 miles of range - when operated in sports mode. They need options for a quick recharge - and not only in cities, but in the countryside where they are operated. Currently a motorbike like the Brammo Empulse offers half the performance and half the range of a conventional bike with the same price tag. Who should want to buy such a thing? ",

It's kind of the dumbest electric motorcycle because Brammo chose to keep a gearbox and a bunch of other bumf rather than go for the radical simplicity electric allows, but it's a major manufacturer and it's an electric motorcycle. The range issue others reference is becoming a bit of a non starter now with Zero offering 185 miles range on a single charge for city driving and 94 miles highway. The charging is still an issue as while they have a CHADeMO higher speed option, they still don't deal with Tesla Superchargers. The Zero range has gone up by a factor of four in just four years while the bikes have also had major brake and shock upgrades and gotten cheaper. It's pretty easy to see it increasing another 50% in the next couple of years. 50% more range and Supercharger access and all bets are off.
