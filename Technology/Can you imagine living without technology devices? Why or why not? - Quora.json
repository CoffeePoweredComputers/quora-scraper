            "answer_text": "My answer depends what you consider \u201cthe world\u201d. And: What is technology ? (is the use of fire technology? Bricks? Concrete? Optical glasses? The list is endless\u2026) If today all technology would disappear, the effects of technology until yesterday still were effective. The great evolutionary pressure technology put on the Biosphere would be effective. Global warming would come, but perhaps to a smaller degree. - The timeframe things happened on earth previously is wide beyond our imagination. If the presence of mankind would be relevant to the system Earth and its biosphere would be relevant in 100 million years? I doubt it. The time mankind witnessed the last 10 000 years would have had an deep impact on evolution, being an accelerator, just like a giant earthquake or meteor impact. It would have changed the circumstances for the evolution of new species. - The impact on mankind would be enormous. Chaos, wars, a mass starvation and a dramatic thinning of the population would be a result. But even if all knowledge of previous techniques would somehow disappear, mankind would reinvent technology. Our brain is komplex enough to persist on the use of tools, refine them and push the boundaries forward. Probably our way to this new tec would be different. But it would guide us to information technology again. And it would become exponential again. To get a better understanding, what the nature of technology is like, it is my best advise to think about exponential growth. Technology is growing exponentially. That\u00b4s not an assumption, that\u00b4s reality. As Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and the most successful forecaster of technological achievements, says in the last sentence of his most recent book \u201cHow to Create a Mind: (i will have to translate it, my copy of his book is in german) \u201cAwakening the universe and - by saturating it with human intelligence in it\u00b4s non-biological form - deciding it\u00b4s destiny, this is our determination\u201d \u201cDas Universum zu erwecken und \u2013 indem wir es mit unserer menschlichen Intelligenz in ihrer nichtbiologischen Form durchdringen \u2013 \u00fcber sein Schicksal zu entscheiden, das ist unsere Bestimmung.\u201d (the german translation I have in my copy of his book) ",

            "answer_text": "Until one stops to think about how much technology we currently use one doesn\u2019t really notice how much we take it for granted. It\u2019s so intertwined with our daily lives that I honestly have no clue what life would be like without. I mean there are the obvious pieces of technology, such as phones and computers. But then there are pieces of technology that we don\u2019t even think about. A copy and pasted definition of technology from a quick Google search states that technology is: \u201cThe application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in an industry.\u201d\u201cMachinery and equipment developed from the application of scientific knowledge.\"\"The branch of knowledge dealing with engineering or applied sciences\u201dNo matter which version of the definition of technology you subscribe to pieces of technology that we might not even think about include things like cars, printing press, farming tools and those are just off the top of my head. So you ask how I imagine the world without technology? How my day-to-day life would be like? And the only response I could reasonably give would be: I imagine my life and the world to be a foreign place where we might be able to survive (since there are those who lived 1,000s of years ago who survived without technology) but even if we do survive the world and our lives would be completely unrecognizable when compared to today\u2019s world/life.
