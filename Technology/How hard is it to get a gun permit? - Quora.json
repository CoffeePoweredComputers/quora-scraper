            "answer_text": "Here in Canada it is pretty easy, so long as it's not for self-defence or a firearm on the prohibited list (such as an AK, Uzi and so on). To obtain a non-restricted long gun, such as your typical 870 WingMaster, or Remington Model 700, you must pass a firearm safety course, consisting of a roughly 8 hour single day. These courses are readily available, commonly at your local Cabela's on Saturdays, or privately via certified instructors. The course is one time only, unless you let your firearm licence (PAL) lapse for 6 months or more past its 5 year cash grab renewal. Course Information - Firearms Safety Education Service of Ontario If you wish to purchase a restricted firearm, typically your Five Seven, Glock whatever, 1911 etc, you must take an additional Restricted Firearm Safety Course, typically held on day 2 of the regular course, on Sundays. It should be noted that you cannot use restricted weapons other than at a licenced ranges, certainly not to carry in your glove box, or on your person. Once you pass the required safety course, you apply to the RCMP to obtain your acquisition licence (PAL). There is a 28 day minimum cooling period before the RCMP will issue the licence to you. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Once this process is complete and you have licence in hand\u2026have at it, buy your ammo, firearms to your heart's content for the rest of your life, barring incidents that would result in forfeitures and seizures (domestic violence with a weapon for example). Typically in rural areas, you take the course and get your PAL at 18, just to get it done and allow you to hunt with a firearm on your own. You CAN hunt using a borrowed firearm without a PAL under certain conditions. ",

            "answer_text": "In the vast majority of the US, there\u2019s no such thing as a permit to own a gun. You pass an instant background check, and then walk home with your new gun. That\u2019s it. A few locales have more strict ownership requirements, but those don\u2019t seem long for the world with Heller affirming that the second amendment applies to citizens owning guns at home, with McDonald forbidding states and cities from violating that right, and with Trump getting 2 Supreme Court picks. If he gets a third, expect to see a lot of gun control laws and gun bans being struck down. For permit to carry, it depends on state. 14 states require no permit to carry concealed. The vast majority of the rest have a \u201cshall issue\u201d law where anyone who passes a written test, easy shooting test, and isn\u2019t a prohibited person must be issued a carry license with no government discretion allowed. A handful of the most left wing states have \u201cmay issue\u201d laws that range from in distinguishable from shall issue, to virtually impossible to get unless you are politically connected or a celebrity. That\u2019s going to depend on a lot on your state, and possibly city and county. ",
