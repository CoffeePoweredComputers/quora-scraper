            "answer_text": "For the beginning of WhatsApp, one of the most used features is the ability to send bulk messages. it allows businessmen to find out what people who interact with them, to distribute information, or publicize promotions that can help build customer loyalty. Bulk messages save time, optimize resource use, and it is a great way for business-customer interaction. Creating a WhatsApp bulk message system is simple, there are two parts you have a try: Part 1: get access to the WhatsApp Business API Before you can start thinking about creating your WhatsApp message bot you need to get access to the WhatsApp Business API. To do this, you need to verify your business on Facebook since WhatsApp is owned by Facebook. You can find detailed steps through the Facebook help section. Once you get your API, then apply it through a third party Vendor. Part 2: write it with simple commands You can create a WhatsApp bulk message system by simply drag-dropping commands in bot chief. The code for these commands is automatically generated in the system. So even if you are not a coder, if you know English, then you can use these command blocks directly based on your needs. After opening it, and then operate your message sent flow on the page completely. The system will automatically record these steps and generate corresponding commands. Then you can run it to send a bulk message on WhatsApp. You can choose to compile to a stand-alone system, then sell it on other platforms. It\u2019s an integrated license and the auto-update system allows you to have the control to manage the key of the system and update info after you sold one copy of your bot. If you do not have time to create it by yourself, you can just get a whatsapp bulk messaging system from here. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, well there are two parts to the solution. build a bulk messaging system. Simple. You can do this either as an HTML web based application/website or a mobile app. There really isn\u2019t any donor don\u2019t here. I suggest that you play to your strengths in terms of language.Here\u2019s the tricky part. I don\u2019t know if WhatsApp has an API for bulk messaging. Like, do they have an API that allows any kind of messaging? If they do, then great! You can get away with an API call that allows you to send one message at a time\u2026just loop that call and you\u2019re A-for away! If they don\u2019t\u2026then I honestly don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll legally develop a bulk messaging system for their application.",
