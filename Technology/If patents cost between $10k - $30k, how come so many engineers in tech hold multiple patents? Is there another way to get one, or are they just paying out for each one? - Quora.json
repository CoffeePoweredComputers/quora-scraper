            "answer_text": "Big companies acquire patents like stamp collectors acquire stamps. Partly it\u2019s for prestige, partly for self-defense, in case some competitor patents something they make and sues them for their own product. They often have lawyers on staff, or on retainer, whose main job is filing patents, and they regularly bother their engineers to come up with ideas they can file on. Often the ideas are ridiculously trivial. One of my favorites is US Patent 6,280,318 - \u201cCentral forced air cooling of a gaming machine\u201d. In other words, using a fan to cool electronic equipment. Unbelievably, this blindingly obvious patent with a hundred years of prior art behind it was actually granted in August 2001, and even less believably, it took five people to invent it. Their names are Cynthia Criss-Puszkiewicz, John Beadel, Paul Haefeli, Gregory Parrott and Kirk Tedsen. Now I happen to know a couple of those people and I have to tell you, they aren\u2019t proud of it. I know because I\u2019ve teased them. But their employer had seventy lawyers on staff and they were only doing what they were told. To be honest with you, I hold a couple of only slightly less embarrassing patents myself. I don\u2019t even know how many or what all of them are. One day the company counsel caught me in reception, said \u201csign this patent application\u201d, and thrust a dollar bill into my hand to make it legal. I never found out what that was about, or if it was granted. Another time, we had outsourced a new product to a consultant and it seemed to be taking a really long time. One day we discovered - I\u2019m not sure how - that the consultant had filed a patent application on our new device, and didn\u2019t want to deliver one to us until it was granted in case we would be able to invalidate the patent by claiming prior art. We killed the product and did it a different way. If you thought the cooling fan patent was improbable, I have to tell you that on March 3rd 2009 the US patent office issued Patent 7,499,276 to Joseph W. Cole for a \u201cGaming device cooling system\u201d. It too claims the use of a fan to cool electronic equipment, but it sucks, whereas the other one blows. (geddit?) ",

            "answer_text": "I just submitted my first patent application a few weeks ago to the US Patent Office while an engineer at a big tech company (Intel Corp), so I\u2019m qualified to answer this question. First off, any patent an employee comes up with belongs to the company. This is part of the contract, so us inventors will be listed as the inventors in the patent, but we sign away all rights to the Intel. And because Intel will own all the rights to the patent, they pay all the legal fees to get the patent filed, not the engineers. The inventors (engineers) will write up an Invention Disclosure Form (IDF), and present it to their boss, who will brainstorm with the engineers, and then the inventors will file the patent application on the company\u2019s internal website. The IDF comprises of describing the invention, reviewing prior similar work in the acadmeic literature (to make sure the idea is novel), discussing the pros and cons, applications, etc. Then this IDF is reviewed in Intel\u2019s internal committee meeting, where they decide whether this patent is worth filing or not. Filing a patent costs a lot of legal fees, so you only want to file patents which are actually worth having. If the internal committee of experts approves the IDF, the IDF is then sent out to an IP law firm, and the external IP lawyers will work directly with the inventors to draft the patent application. The lawyers will take over the patent completely, and will ask inventors questions, and submit drafts to them for feedback. Once the inventors approve of the patent draft created by the lawyer, the law firm will then file the patent application with the US Patent Office. As you can see, the legal fees add up quite fast when drafting patents involving complex ideas. Yes, Intel owns the patents, but I don\u2019t think that the researchers care about that too much. For researchers, what matters is the joy of discovery and the line item on the resume. We\u2019re grateful that our employer could pay for the facilities to do the work and to help get the patent filed. I have enough money and I view submitting patents as part of my job, and not something that necessarily needs to be directly linked to money. ",
