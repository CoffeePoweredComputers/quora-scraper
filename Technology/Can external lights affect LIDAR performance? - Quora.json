Either saturation or spoofing is possible: Saturating and Spoofing LiDAR Attacks Cast Doubt on the Safety of Driverless Cars Saturation is conceptually similar to blinding night vision with very bright light. Spoofing to make the car AI think an obstacle is not really there, or a bogus obstacle is there, would require sophistication. Maybe a hacked Velodyne unit, if you could exactly align their spins, although I\u2019m sure Velodyne has thought of that and has some type of random jitter in place to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen between adjacent AVs.

An effective countermeasure (K40, Escort, etc etc) does just that!Doing it incidentally with something not purpose built for that is unlikely. ",
