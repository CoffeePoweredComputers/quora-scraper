            "answer_text": "If Islam were to be the guiding principle, science and technology would advance to such a high level that is well beyond our imagination to predict and it would be put at the service of humanity as a whole and not serving the interests of  what I call GLOBAL  SHARKS!  (The Global Elite: extremely extremely wealthy and immoral individuals that will stop at nothing to reach their aims). For that to happen we would need to get rid of the corporatocracy and break its global dominion agenda that has only served the interests of the Global Sharks while the gap between the haves and have not continues to grow at an alarming rate despite the advancements in science and technology.  Since the Global Sharks have infiltrated and control every field: the media, politics, science and technology, economics, heath and education, banking, etc. you are talking of a mighty fight against  a  giant and since the corporatocracy will burn the whole market if it cannot get it all  only a mighty power can subdue them. The fight will be much greater than that of Prophet Dawood (David) with Goliath. That mighty power who will be able to bring down Ad-Dajjal (Antichrist) is no other than Mohammad Al Mahdi who will be accompanied in his mission by Prophet Jesus (as) who will return. After defeating the AntiChrist the earth will reveal all the treasures it is hiding and people will look for individuals to give their zakat to (right of the poor tax) but they will find none (everyone will be wealththy) (source: hadith)If you do not believe in God and your God has become your I will only believe what I see Ego then of course this reply will be to you a grandmothers\u2019 tale! (read on before you collapse my reply )    Consider this data before you collapse me: \u201cAccording to a study that was just released by Boston Consulting Group, the wealthiest one percent now own 39 percent of all the wealth in the world.  Meanwhile, the bottom 50 percent only own 1 percent of all the wealth in the world combined.  The global financial system has been designed to funnel wealth to the very top, and the gap between the wealthy and the poor continues to expand at a frightening pace.  The global elite continue to hoard wealth and heap together enormous mountains of treasure in these troubled days even though the economic suffering around the planet continues to grow\u201d.  (source: There's a war on for your mind!). How did this happen?   History repeats itself: Do you really think that the Global Sharks would want to loose their privileges and world dominion? This struggle has happened many times before and the Sharks of the past have fought tooth and nail to keep their privileges too and they too stopped at nothing (bribes, murder, embargoes, economic and social sanctions, conning people, using false gods to indocrinate people, wars, propaganda, fabrication of false hadiths etc. ). Global Sharks have become so sophisticated and cunning that they can even \"manifacture\" public conscent to perpetrate their crimes in their quest for Global Dominion. Don't be a fool and tool in their hands! and practice what I call RIAR : Read, Investigate, Analyse and Reflect. God has distinguished us from animals by giving us the power to refect. He (SWT) did not create us to sleep, reproduce, work, eat and engage in entertainment, so what did He create us for? ",
