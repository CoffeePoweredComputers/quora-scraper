            "answer_text": "We had one-hour photo labs. I ran one in West Sussex in the late 1980s. You could bring a 35mm colour film in and, within about 35 minutes, a set of 24 or 36 6\u2033 x 4\u2033 prints came out. The cost was between \u00a34 and \u00a37. The service was also available in some labs for the very small film you got in Instamatic cameras and 126 format. There was, however, no advanced exposure correction and no retouching. The service was not available for black and white film, and larger formats such as 120 film (medium format) that came from cameras such as the Rolleicord, Rolleiflex and Mamiya TLRs or from medium format SLRs made by, for example, Hasselblad and Bronica. If you wanted that you had to go to a professional laboratory like Colab or PRC. ",

            "answer_text": " I just finished developing a roll of film - something I\u2019ve been doing for about 75 years. It\u2019s very simple - two chenicals plus water. I put the film in a tank that has a light trap in the cover, then add developer for (in my case) 8 minutes. The developer converts the silver halide that\u2019s been exposed to light into grains of solid silver. I then run some water into the tank to \u201cstop\u201d the development process, then process for a few minutes to disolve the unexposed silver halide in a chemical known as \u201cfixer\u201d. That\u2019s it - takes about 20 minutes. I scan the resulting negative image, but the image can also be printed photographically. Photographic film - Wikipedia ",
