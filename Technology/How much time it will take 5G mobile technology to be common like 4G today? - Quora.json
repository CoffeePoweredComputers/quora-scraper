            "answer_text": "It's going to take some time before 5G is standard on smartphones. As of now, the providers in the US are just starting to build our their 5G networks which could take 24+ months to complete nationally. 5G phones are beginning to trickle out for consumers as well. I look to Apple as a benchmark to see when things hit the mainstream since they have a large following. They plan to have a few 5G iPhones in 2020 and look to 2022 and 2023 to have the technology readily available in future models[1] . So I suspect it will be a 5 year timeframe that 5G will be standard for smartphones. Footnotes[1] Apple will release two iPhones with 5G in 2020, top analyst says",

            "answer_text": "For a mobile phone, the hardware consists of many modules, such as touch screen interaction module (LCD screen), camera module (front/rear camera), audio module (speaker/microphone/headphone jack), etc. Software is also divided into operating system software, application software and so on.  The first batch of 5G mobile phones on the market will have almost the same hardware appearance as 4G mobile phones. In terms of software, 5G phones will use iOS or Android systems as well, and the application software will not change much. The biggest difference between 5G mobile phones and 4G mobile phones lies in the communication module. Non-communication components such as camera, LCD screen and fingerprint recognition are not divided into 4G and 5G. 5G can be used, and 4G can also be used. The reason why mobile phones are mobile phones is because of the \"communication module\". The core of 5G mobile phone is its \"communication module\". \"Communication module\", mainly 5G baseband chip. This is what Huawei's recent controversy over chips is all about. To be exact, 5G mobile phone chip refers to the SoC chip (System-on-a-Chip) of mobile phone, which is the main processing chip of mobile phone. Baseband chip is one part of the main processing chip. The main processing chip includes the baseband chip.  Baseband chip, including baseband part and radio frequency part. Baseband chips, which process baseband signals, are equivalent to the Modem we use, which determines the standard of how fast a mobile phone can support a network. Huawei's Kirin 980 is the main processing chip for mobile phones. Huawei's \"Balong 5000\" is a baseband chip for mobile phones. Kirin 980 is not integrated with Balong 5000 for the time being, so it is not a real 5G chip now, but it may be integrated in the near future. And Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 is the main processing chip of mobile phone. Its 5G baseband is X50.   The 5G chip will support 5G communication frequency band, including Sub6GHz (low frequency), mmWave (millimeter wave, high frequency), 5G communication standard and 5G network. It will enable mobile phones to achieve the highest theoretical data download rate of 10Gbps. This rate will far exceed the current 4G mobile phone, reaching an unprecedented high. At present, 5G chips have not been officially released (if I haven't missed the news), so we still need to wait patiently for 5G mobile phones to come on the market. ",
