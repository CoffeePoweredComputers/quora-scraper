            "answer_text": "First, we should note that both companies aggressively push the development of their products technology in a relentless effort to make everyone else play catch-up. \u201cPlanned obsolescence\u201d means a product is designed to become inadequate in a shorter timeframe than a product of its type should last, forcing the customer to buy a replacement. The evidence is that neither Apple nor Samsung do this. It can appear this way, because they push their hardware development so hard; current phones have capabilities that were unavailable to anyone just a few years ago. But actively obsoleting? Not really. Apple: Sells older, former flagship models for lower prices Apple continues to sell its previous generation phones for years. Apple currently sells four generations of iPhone (counting the 6S and SE as the same generation, as they share CPU and camera, if not screen or chassis). They all run the same version of the operating system, with features that vary only in by hardware added to newer devices (dual cameras, FaceID, Apple Pay and the like). This doesn\u2019t look like a strategy of obsoleting their own products to force upgrades.  Samsung: Uses former flagship technology for new, lower priced models I just hit Verizon\u2019s website (because I\u2019m a customer) to check current Samsung smartphone offerings. They\u2019re selling the S9/9+, S8/8+, and Note 8 \u2014 all flagships for this or last year \u2014 and using older tech in models such as the J7, J7V and J3. Again, this doesn\u2019t look like a strategy of obsoleting old products; they\u2019re using old tech to sell new products at a lower price.  I don\u2019t see evidence here that Apple or Samsung are trying to make their old products stop working. If anything, when we consider that Apple supports iOS on devices even older than shown here (everything back to the iPhone 5S, a 5 year old device), it looks like they try to keep hardware usable for quite a long time. The average American\u2019s phone upgrade cycle is around 30 months; Apple products are supported for twice that long. Samsung isn\u2019t so aggressive; its business is a product of the pre-Apple phone industry when carriers dictated software updates, not manufacturers. It doesn\u2019t keep its devices up-to-date with security updates or new OS-level features after about two years. But the phones remain quite usable. With regards to their phone markets \u2014 which based on the question phrasing we must assume was the intended area \u2014 both Apple and Samsung appear not to go out of their way to obsolete their old phones. They just push new technology development very, very hard. Apple in user experience ways such as multitouch, retina screens and FaceID; Samsung in raw power ways such as larger, flexible and brighter/more colorful displays, and in utility ways such as being one of the first mass-market waterproof smartphones.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I don\u2019t believe in planned obsolescence as a primary design initiative by either company. I realize there are a lot of people that believe in planned obsolescence \u2014 especially on the part of Apple \u2014 but I place those people firmly in the category of conspiracy theorists and give them little credibility. Both Apple and Samsung are under incredible competitive pressures to come out with new, exciting features that will inspire consumers to either stay loyal or switch. This makes obsolescence a byproduct of the design process, not a plan. Advances in technology come really fast, so consumers with older devices often feel like they are left in the dust. To some extent, that is as it should be. Both Apple and Samsung have a responsibility to shareholders to increase the value of the company. The best way to do this is to make sure the software works best with the latest hardware. Apple is in a somewhat better position to do this since they can design both the hardware and software to work together (whereas Samsung is somewhat beholden to Android). So it is only natural that new features will be optimized to function best on newer models. So the obsolescence happens organically, it isn\u2019t planned. Apple has more control over it since they design both the software and the hardware, but in a sense that might make their devices more resistant to obsolescence. I know several people still using their iPhone model 3GS and 4 phones. ",
