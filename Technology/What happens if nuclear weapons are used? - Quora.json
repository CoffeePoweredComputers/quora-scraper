            "answer_text": "Depends on how many are used. If a terrorist nuclear weapon was detonated in Manhattan or London it would be extremely devastating. It would kill thousands of people and the world would become even more paranoid of terrorism than before. Think about 9/11 change the worlds attitude to national security. Imagine if a terrorist nuclear device would change the world. It would be awful but the world would overcome it. However if it is nuclear war, that is a different story. Even a small localised nuclear war, like Indian and Pakistan or possible one between North Korea and the United States. Would cause drastic climate effects globally. Famines will occur as a result, on top of the millions who would die as a result of the initial effects. It would have drastic global economic consequences. What would happen if the Indian economy just ceased to exist and how bad that would be for the world. Then we have the nightmare scenario, a NATO-Russo war. In which thousands of nuclear weapons are detonated across the northern hemisphere. An EMP alone would cripple any nation, and that would just be the start of the attack. What would remain? No proper form of government, infrastructure destroyed, no proper forms of education, no technology, no water, no food, no electricity, climatic effects (nuclear winter and ozone layer depletion), no proper forms of health care, increase in rates of cancer, crop and livestock depletion, where cities once stood would be large piles of ruble and the largest economies in the world would be no existent. In the Southern Hemisphere, they wouldn\u2019t be directly hit but they would also be effected. Economies will collapse from the absent of major powers. Lack of food and materials from lack of trade. Areas in Africa and in the Middle East who are already at risk of famine would see their populations die. Governments would likely collapse and borders would fail. In fact with absent of the countries in Northern Hemisphere the countries in the Southern Hemisphere would struggle to survive. Even more developed countries such as Australia and New Zealand heavily rely on trade. They would also fare badly from the climatic effects, while less extreme compared to the north it would have devastating effects on the south. ",

            "answer_text": "What happens if nuclear weapons are used? People on the receiving end cease to exist. Killed by radiation and the immense heat. Countries on the receiving end no longer exist. A nuclear bomb will destroy infrastructure and the vegetation. Neighboring countries will feel the heat. Radiation from the nuclear weapons can reach other places causing cancer and some heat from the blast. If nuclear weapons are used the land becomes inhabitable, wildlife die off, People get various radiation related ailments, and the event becomes a reality to live with. Cheers ",
