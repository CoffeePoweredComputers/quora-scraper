            "answer_text": "If it\u2019s possible, I would take them to the store and let them try out some of the ones on display. I\u2019m on the spectrum, and I know the experience of using a device really matters to me. The way the tablet looks, feels and operates will be a big part of whether or not they enjoy using it. Personally, I do tend to prefer Apple products because they\u2019re simple to use, have a clean interface, and their construction is really satisfying. I\u2019d say an iPad wouldn\u2019t be a bad place to start. You\u2019ll want a case and screen protector since they are a child, and will probably drop it. I recommend tempered glass screen protectors if your child prefers the way glass feels. Plastic screen protectors have a different texture, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend them unless they dislike the glass. With the case, it\u2019s definitely a matter of which textures they enjoy. Once again, I\u2019d really recommend letting them pick it out if possible. All in all, it really comes down to their preferences. Everything is about the experience when you\u2019re on the autism spectrum. You\u2019ll want them to enjoy how the tablet feels, that way they can use it comfortably. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean to cure Autism? There is no cure. I suppose some symptoms could be toned down with medication, but that could have side effects considering it\u2019s unnatural. Or maybe you mean the easiest type of tablet for an autistic child to take? When I was little, medication was easiest to take when it was in a super surgery syrup. Sometimes I could stomach it when it was dissolved, but it wasn\u2019t until I was bout 12 that I could actually take pills. You probably know the child best. Are they intolerant to the texture? the taste? You can always talk to a doctor to find something that works for you. ",
