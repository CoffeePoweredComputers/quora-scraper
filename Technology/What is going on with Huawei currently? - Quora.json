            "answer_text": "What are the huawei people doing in the vortex when the whole world is looking at huawei on the cusp? How do huawei people themselves see what they are going through? On May 21, in an interview with Chinese media in shenzhen, President ren once said: Our company employees are all silly, none of them were scared, we feel very common. The article on the net is very commonly exaggerated, say ying feiling to do not supply goods to us on the net like the net, which has this to return a responsibility? Somebody made this up. So if you really want to know about huawei, take a look at our voice community. In the heart of the community, these days, many employees quietly tell the story of what happened to them, telling their heart, perhaps, this is the true portrayal of 180,000 huawei employees, but also represents the heart of each of us the most true voice of huawei. \u4e00\u3001We are the same as before 01 I am a terminal female soldier, outwardly calm, inwardly steadfast. Today, all kinds of news about measures taken by country A against our company came from the media. I went to work peacefully in my heart, one after another, meeting after meeting, with A calm appearance and A firm heart. More brothers working overtime in the evening, the conference discussion, each brother from their own responsible for the post analysis program. The meeting has a clear purpose, an efficient agenda, a clear plan and a clear plan. While I was doing my weekly user analysis, I was taking minutes of meetings. After the meeting, I revised the ST report materials for tomorrow. It was 10:30 when I was about to leave work, and the rain was so heavy that I bought a raincoat on 711 and strode forward in the wind and rain. Earphone spread beyond the sea, not the hearts of surging, eyes wet! I am an ordinary CBG female soldier, this is my ordinary work day, no matter what kind of difficulties the company faces, I believe, each of us huawei people will unswervingly more united efforts, we will not be down! 02 I am an overseas marketing personnel, people in, position in. Back from Finland, the members of the representative office held a short meeting at the airport. All the members rushed to the office overnight to engage in a new round of fighting, continued to adjust the battle formation, made clear the new round of fighting objectives and measures, carried out the intense and orderly work, and rewarded the company with victory, living up to the youth. The people are there, the positions are there! 03 I am a manufacturing staff, the more this time the quality to be more excellent. In the manufacturing site, everyone is busy, not because of the ban, but the delivery of the product itself and the expansion of production plan has not been completed, the leadership also stressed: the more this time the quality is better, more open, more let the customer rest assured! 04 I am an old supply chain employee. We have prepared for it and know our supply capacity. Finally. Now is estimated to drop some \"fat meat\", short term will be a bit more difficult, but we still have a good idea of their supply capacity. Although now many people all night, but no one said tired, fighting force is also much stronger than usual. I've been with the company for 14 years and have absolute confidence in it. Time is in our hands, whether one year, two years or three years, through the efforts of all the people in huawei, we will eventually lead the world. 05 I am an administrative staff, difficult, can break through the storm, how late, send each soldier home. Now, with heavy rain, the number of passengers will increase, but the cars sent back will be slow, and the resources available for the cars will be relatively less, so there will be a large area of delay. We have mobilized the surrounding resources and added more than 20 vehicles. However, the strong wind and heavy rain are just like the real challenges we face. Take it easy, no matter how hard it is, you can break through the storm! How late, send each soldier home. \u4e8c\u3001 We seem to be different 01 No one panics, only people work harder I do not know if there is a company in the world, when the United States is not often at gunpoint, almost every day international media headlines. The company's staff in the canteen, eat while watching the world's superpower intimidation, true and false reports, and then back to work, and has been for half a year... No one panics, only people work harder. Our families have also chosen to stand firmly with us and with the company. 02 My girlfriend stopped arguing with me Recently, I have been working late every day, including Saturday and Sunday. My girlfriend didn't understand. Always complaining and arguing. Last week's news of us sanctions against huawei was overwhelming, and she, who rarely follows the news, saw the reports. She took the initiative to ask me whether she was afraid of the us sanctions and felt great pressure. She also said that she would never quarrel with me in the future, and that she would be my strong backing and warm harbor, so that I could set my mind at work and make contributions to the company's victory in the American war. She also came back from her parents' home. What my girlfriend said moved me a lot. I believe that there are so many family members of huawei making efforts silently behind us. With our concerted efforts, the company will surely survive this challenge and create more glory! 03 The wife said, the evening to eat a good meal to drink some soup before work Recently, due to an incident, I went back home at midnight on Saturday night the day before yesterday. At breakfast on Sunday morning yesterday, my father, who is more than 60 years old, told me that I must follow the company and work hard even if I don't get paid. Today Monday daytime, sent WeChat to the wife, tonight return will compare late go back, may want early morning ability go back, the wife returned a message sweetly, evening want to eat good rice, drink some soup again work. I also saw many posts of support from other colleagues and families. Why can't we win this battle? 04 My family had advised me to leave my job, but now advised me not to become a deserter Because I could not take care of my family when I worked in another place, my family members always advised me to leave my job. But after the incident happened in these two days, my family members advised me not to be a deserter. \"You've got to have some backbone in your life, you stick with it for a few more months, and you leave that time feeling like a deserter.\"  Long ago, ren always said, shangganling in the heart. Be a hero at all times and in all places. Now, shangganling in the foot, rushed up, defend the position, we are the hero of huawei. From \uff1a \u534e\u4e3a\u5fc3\u58f0\u793e\u533a ",

            "answer_text": "Google withdraws Android license for Huawei.  Google limits access from Huawei to the Android operating system: for those who now have such a device, nothing will change The American internet giant Google limits the access of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei to the operating system Android. Reuters and the technology website The Verge report this. Nothing changes for current owners of a Huawei device. For those who buy a Huawei device in the future, it is still coffee watching. \"This is about purely economic trading,\" says tech journalist Pieterjan Van Leemputten. \"Huawei and Google are both victims.\" a week ago US President Donald Trump marked an announcement disallowing organizations from utilizing telecom gear made by organizations representing a national exchange hazard It is one of the aspects of the trade conflict that is going on between the US and China.  With the decree, the US is mainly targeting telecom giant Huawei. America fears that China uses networks and material from Huawei to be able to spy. Something Huawei denies in all keys. The consequences of the new decree are already being felt. Alphabet, the parent company of the American internet giant Google, has strongly limited Huawei's access to the Android operating system. According to The Verge, the license has even been completely withdrawn. Android is what iOS is to Apple for most brands of smartphone and tablet builders: the system on which the devices run. Those companies need a Google license to run Android on their smartphones and tablets. Nothing changes for existing devices, but what in the future?Google says it must comply with the decree. According to Google, nothing will change for the owners of existing Huawei smartphones. They will still have access to apps that are popular and/or important, such as Google Play Store, Gmail, and YouTube. They will also be able to receive updates from those apps. Huawei itself also says that smartphones and tablets will receive security updates from both Huawei and sister brand Honor. \"All existing Huawei and Honor devices that have already been sold or are still in stock will continue to receive updates and after-sales service,\" it says in a statement. It will still have to be clear what will and will not succeed What will happen in the future is not yet clear, says Pieterjan van Leemputten, a journalist at Data News, in \"The morning\". \"It will still have to be clear what will and will not succeed, where a sleeve can be adjusted, which functions will be lost.\" For example, users of new Huawei devices may no longer be able to download apps via Google. New security updates may also no longer be available.Van Leemputten suspects that we will get a first indication of the consequences in the fall when Huawei plans a new release. \"The device that is then launched may already be bothered, we will have to notice it.
