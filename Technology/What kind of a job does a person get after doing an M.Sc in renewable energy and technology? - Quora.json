            "answer_text": "My Master\u2019s course is a bit unique in that it is MSc. in Renewable Energy Engineering and Management, so we got to learn about renewable energy, climate change, and sustainability from both engineering and management points of view. It always depends on the course structure itself, but in general, you can imagine the following avenues: Research: A \u2018Master of Science\u2019 (note the \u2018science\u2019 in there) program is oftentimes, specifically geared towards giving you the skill-set required to perform research in your field. The research can be either technical in nature (for e.g. improving solar cell efficiencies, new materials for offshore wind turbines, development of new biofuels, or integration of renewable energy with traditional electricity grids), or economic (for e.g. economic models for future renewable energy deployment), or policy-based (for e.g. policy packages for achieving a certain renewable energy target). There is a lot of ongoing research in many different topics.Engineering: Also an option, especially if your Bachelor\u2019s degree is engineering-based. You could work in design of projects and plants, in construction and procuring for new projects, inspection or maintenance of existing projects.Consulting: You could start your own consulting business or work in a consulting company to advise homeowners on renewable energy solutions based on their needs, or you could work with big companies or your city/state government to design the whole concept, or to give recommendations on renewable projects they already have or want to implement.Financing and investment: Another option is working with companies to help finance renewable energy projects. You help them make a business model for their application and make a case for which financing/investment options they could go for.Non-governmental organizations: If you are really interested in giving back to the community and making a difference, you could also join non-governmental organizations which implement renewable energy projects for poor communities or communities without proper access to energy, to help them become more energy-independent. You could also develop new products to help these communities get their energy from natural sources.Politics: A bit far-fetched, but can also be imagined. You could bring your expertise to a local party, or work in the renewable energy ministry of your city/state/country to develop energy policies. Ultimately, working in policy means your work would have the potential to produce a lot of impact.These are some avenues I can think of off the top of my head. This is, by no means, an exhaustive list and I\u2019m sure I must be missing many other options. Working in renewable energy also introduces you to the issues of climate change and sustainability, and once you learn about them, you have the option of getting involved in these fields too. So, there are a lot of possible job options once you get into the field; it\u2019s all about what you like and what you want to work on. The possibilities are endless. ",

As a masters in Rn energy energy technology I believe you\u2019d be taught about the aspects of renewable energy and technology ongoing currently.
