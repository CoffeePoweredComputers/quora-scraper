            "answer_text": "They\u2019re important because they keep us inter-connected and they streamline the processing and manufacturing of goods and services. Without technology, we would not have access to limitless amounts of information and knowledge that sources like the internet provide us. We would not be able to easily communicate with people across the world in seconds, and we would be unable to process international transactions on a wide-scale. Technology strives towards the globalization of our world. Without it, we would be more isolated and localized as a society. Science is the foundation upon which technology relies upon, and upon what our universe relies upon. Without Biology, our bodies wouldn\u2019t have evolved to create the multi-cell organisms we are today. Without Chemistry, we would be unable to find cures for diseases and medicine to help treat people with life-threatening diseases. Without Physics, nothing would exist, as it literally governs the laws of our universe. So to answer it bluntly, they are very important. Without them, our world as we know it, wouldn\u2019t exist.
