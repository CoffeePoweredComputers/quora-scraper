            "answer_text": "Tree-planting is one of the best ways to help a forest regrow after a wildfire, and its also one of the best ways to curb carbon emissions. But it\u2019s a job that requires a great degree of intelligence in order to know exactly where and how to plant the seeds, as well as a lot of back-breaking manual labor.

They can monitor the saplings with the help of drones and take appropriate steps as the situation demands as per the observed data. ",
