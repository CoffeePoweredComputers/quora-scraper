            "answer_text": "With a physics degree and programming skills you are well equipped to work in scientific computing, which is the application of algorithms and simulations to solve problems in science and engineering. If this is what you want, you should focus on learning programming languages like MATLAB, R, C/C++ and Python and how to use them as modelling and simulation tools.  However, most of those jobs are found in academia or research institutes. From your question it seems like you are more interested in a standard software development job in the software industry. To get into the software industry as a developer, you should be skilled in at least one object-oriented programming language. Usually Java, C#, C++, Ruby or Python. In addition, you should at least be somewhat comfortable using common web development tools, such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Knowledge of at least one database technology (usually some kind of SQL) is also important. Start by learning from online courses. As soon as you are familiar with the syntax, try to build something on your own, like a web application. If you focus hard on this for 6 months, you can have the basic skillset needed for an entry-level developer job. Word of advice: Even if you opt for this route, having that physics degree will be a huge advantage! ",
