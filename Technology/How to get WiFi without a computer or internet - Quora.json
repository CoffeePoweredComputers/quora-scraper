            "answer_text": "To answer the question as written, the answer is simply to get a wireless router and power it up. This will provide you with a WiFi network. WiFi, like Ethernet, is simply a method of connecting devices to a local private network. Devices on the network, whether they connect by Ethernet or WiFi, can communicate with each other. For example, you could have a NAS as a data server connected to the router by Ethernet and use it to record information from security cameras that connect to the router by WiFi. WiFi does not mean there is Internet access available. Many people seem to assume wrongly that WiFi and Internet are the same thing. ",

            "answer_text": "??? You need a WiFi router to create a WiFi LAN. There are also devices (like printers) that support WiFi Direct - a 1:1 connection without a router. But, what is the point of getting WiFi without a computer or internet? Do you want it for your smart phone? You smart phone might have a WiFi radio, which means you have a device with WiFi capability. So what is it you want to do??? Connect your smart phone to your TV set? Control a drone? It\u2019s unclear to me what you hope to do with WiFi. ",
