            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on what you mean by what are the best product companies. I sometimes ask that question in design and PM interviews. And when I do that I seek some subtle answers. One answer is focused on who is making the most elegant, easy to use, novel products, probably at scale. On that bucket we could put the list below. Some folks would only describe products as physical products. I go further than that and consider google a product-based company. So my list looks like this: AppleGoogleTeslaEtcOften people don't recognise the design of marketplaces as a product. So Airbnb would not fit there or is not a typical answer. And \u201csingle product\u201d companies like Facebook or Netflix also are not typically mentioned. I think that\u2019s a narrow conception of product. With Google, products tend to have recognisable names like Sheets, Gmail, AdWords. Facebook products like video don't tend to be named or thought of as separate from the main UE. Netflix same as above. Users think of FB or Netflix as a single product. But if you work inside those organisations you\u2019d see a number of products that get assembled into a user experience. The second way to answer the question is more around who has the best product management practice. That is, where can you learn the craft. And it used to be that eBay and PayPal and Google were great places to learn the craft. Many folks from these places went on to start great companies (YouTube, Houzz, etc). Once you learn the craft you can develop it for a different focus. Some places with a respected product practice are: GoogleFacebookAppleTeslaeBay (depends on years)Yahoo (see above)PayPal (see above)I guess a third way (not one I typically use) refers to great products as beautiful objects. Meaning who is making the most beautiful objects these days. For a while Path was recognised as a leading App from which many followed it's novel ideas (like it's pop up menu). But I rarely use this meaning of \u201cgreat product\u201d. ",
