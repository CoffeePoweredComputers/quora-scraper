            "answer_text": "before computers the only thing that has a similar keyboard was a typewriter. for the very young people here, it was a machine fully mechanical, where you put paper and you press keys like a keyboard but unlike a keyboard they where hard to hit (realy hard), that had mechanical parts that hit barely the same spot.but in a system that showed marks based on metalic parts that hit harder so for the r it show an r and so on by \u201cpush\u201d. each time you press one key the paper moved (with the rod), and each time you pressed enter (that was not a key but a level) you moved the paper up and go with it to the left side again. so thats how letters by machines where written before.
