            "answer_text": "Machine learning is made of several components. A model, the parametric function that you are trying to define. A goal function that is directing the learning. An optimisation algorithm that is updating the model to maximise the goal function. All machine learning is based on this. Deep learning is just the most generic way of doing this. It\u2019s based on raw linear algebra with no fancy theory. In the end, all machine learning methods are equivalent, they just use different data structures and different mathematical traditions to justify why it\u2019s a good parametric model, good goal function and a good optimisation algorithm. Probability Graphical Models for example were based on the statistics Bayesian mathematical school. What\u2019s deep learning ? When do new models and new goal functions stop being \u201cdeep learning\u201d ? If you define deep learning as multi layer linear regression optimised through log likelihood, then deep learning is probably dying. The new paradigm of machine learning is programmable flow structures. Here is a nice article on the topic: On Machine Learning and Programming Languages Tensorflow has become a programming language, with conditional paths and loops. The structure of the models have become Turing complete programs. Models are not parametric mathematical functions anymore, they are parametric programs. Depth has no meaning when the structure of the model is a program, so deep learning isn\u2019t a proper name anymore. It\u2019s only a question of time before the deep learning name fades away to be renamed programmatic learning. So the answer is, deep learning is already dead, you just didn\u2019t hear the new name yet. ",

            "answer_text": "Artificial Intelligence is a field of study that deals with understanding and building intelligence. This goal has many challenges that become obvious once you notice how our own brain(a good example of natural AI) works. These challenges have not been solved by Deep Learning. Learn from few examples and versatile learning. All respectable systems require thousands of examples to learn a concept. In contrast, a child once shown a cat will recognize almost all cats in almost all contexts. There is research going on to handle this problem but it is very early days: Learning to Learn and advances in Unsupervised Learning.Learn robustly. Even the most advance Deep Learning systems can be fooled with easy to construct examples, Robust Adversarial Examples. Other systems are dropping very important information like relative orientation and hierarchies. For example, CNNs have no idea about how the different components of a face should orient w.r.t each other. Some new work to fix that: Understanding Hinton\u2019s Capsule Networks. Part I: Intuition.Additionally, there are many problems at which humans are still beating Deep Learning systems like summarizing large documents. In summary, Artificial Intelligence BIGGER_FIELD_THAN Machine Learning BIGGER_FIELD_THAN Deep Learning. Deep Learning is a way of doing Machine Learning. Machine Learning is just one of the tools that can help in achieving the goals of AI. This is so because as of now Machine Learning has been effective at solving easier versions of problems facing AI. ",

Deep learning is simply one of many supervised learning models within machine learning and isn't real common outside of very large tech companies or academia; it fails completely on small datasets compared to tree-based methods and penalized regression. AI is a different field than machine learning, and most of it relies heavily on explicit programming of the software to exhibit the desired behaviors rather than machine learning algorithms, though some are used with robot vision and motion planning problems.

            "answer_text": "There are lots of confusion and overblown expectations about deep learning and in many cases relatively simpler models more suitable than their deep learning counterparts. Deep learning takes the concept of adaptive AI behavior a step further from machine learning using unstructured data available. It deals with such concepts as deep neural networks, machine translation, bioinformatics and many more: Why deep learning may not be the right solution for your business  The problems most, especially small, businesses are facing do not really require such complex and sophisticated methods. Deep learning is also inherently slow. For example, it can take several weeks of just training using multiple GPUs. Having to make all these decisions also means paying for them. Deep learning also demands huge sample sizes to train on. Deep neural networks often take hundreds of thousands or even more samples to achieve high performance. Many problems require so-called labeled datasets (each sample is annotated with an expected value). Such labeling is time-consuming and may often require to do it manually. Deep neural networks are often considered black boxes whose inner operations are not really interpretable. But interpretability is important because it can give new insights into relationships between numerous variables and expected outcomes. It also increases the trust of the people who use it. This ability to explain solutions is inherent to many simpler methods, in particular, linear ones, where the direct relationship between parameters can be analyzed. ",
