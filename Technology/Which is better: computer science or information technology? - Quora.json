            "answer_text": "Yes. If you like it and can do well at it. The wording of your question is ambiguous - are you comparing IT with Computer Science, as two opposing courses of study? Or are you grouping them together as opposed to studying History or Classics? If you are asking whether you should study IT and Computer Science, my answer is YES. I had two careers and the one I spent most of my time on, Music, was wonderfully satisfying but I didn\u2019t make enough money to have a family and all the other things people want to do when they work full time. When I was in my late 20s I took some courses in Data Processing at my local UC extension - UC Berkeley extension. After about 7 classes I got a job, and later had my own company which produced niche database software for Orchestras. Having learned how to design, build and implement database applications, I became a self-employed software engineer/programmer and worked for myself for the next 15 years. I paid myself well. I live near silicon valley so all my jobs were with companies here. I think it doesn\u2019t really matter where you are located, because you can do work off-site in most cases. The heading for this question is \u201cComputer Science Education/Studying\u201d so I assume you are younger, maybe in college, and choosing a major or area of study. I don\u2019t know what the alternatives are, but in my experience IT/CS is a very good way to make a living. Apparently there are a lot of jobs going unfilled in the US. I bet a lot of them are in tech areas. ",
