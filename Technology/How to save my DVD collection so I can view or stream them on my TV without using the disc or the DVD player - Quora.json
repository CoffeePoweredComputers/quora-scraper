            "answer_text": "You\u2019ll have to \u2018rip\u2019 them, with any DVD ripper software.Ripping them, basically means bypassing copyright protection, and copying the content to a harddrive.The content will be very big in size, like usually between 2 to 6GB for a movie. After ripping, you can convert the content, using free programs like Handbrake, or some other DVD programs. Most free DVD encoding programs, either have excellent video encoding, or excellent audio encoding. But some paid versions have both of them. The best video codec to this date, is h.265.A 2 hour full size movie can easily fit in a 400MB file; and it\u2019s preferred for 4k content (or content above 1080p). That\u2019s about 10x smaller than MPeG 2. The second best video codec, is h.264. I personally use this one, because it\u2019s more common. A 2 hour video can easily fit in 600\u2013800MB filesize, which is still a substantial compression vs the MPeG 2 compression used on traditional DVDs. The best audio codec is Opus. From lossless (1000+kbits) audio, it can create near CD quality at 48kbits, or even 24kbits sounds pretty good! This format is preferred, however it\u2019s not always compatible with a lot of media players out there.The second best is OGG. The same audio can be compressed in 80kbits, and still sound very good! Compare that to MP3, which needs at least 128kbits, but preferably 160kbits to sound good! After you\u2019ve ripped and converted all formats, you can put them on a harddrive or SSD (a 128GB drive can easily host over 150 full size movies) ",

Which really eats into hard disc space.We tend to only watch a dvd a few times , so is it worth the bother.?The studios organised anti piracy options into their discs ,so software to rip them is less available.",
