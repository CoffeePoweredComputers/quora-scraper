Boring, for my taste as a lively young man. More suited for the phlegmatic old crock I\u2019ve since become. Anyway, if NYC lost Manhattan and the Bronx, and acquired Nassau County instead, and if it were cut off from the United States, it would be similar in size and population to Singapore. That is, bigger in area and smaller in population, but only moderately so. ",
