            "answer_text": "The Nintendo Switch is by far the most powerful handheld ever made. It got about 1/3 - 1/2 the power of a PS4. Here\u2019s a few impressive stuff it been able to pull off so far. Hellbade, by far the most realistic game on the Switch:  Zelda - Breath of the Wild - 360 Square km fully open world.Big enough to fit Skyrim, the Witcher 3 and Fallout 4 on it\u2019s map alone.Also fully open as mentioned above. Not even Horizon Zero Dawn can say that.  Xenoblade Chronicles 2 - Open world style JRPG with living moving continents.   ",

            "answer_text": "At this time the two most powerful handheld consoles are the Nintendo Switch or any of GPD\u2019s Pocket PC devices. Although Handhelds are an ideal option for gaming on the go, most games run at 720 p or 540 p at 30 fps, meaning that you won\u2019t get the best performance out of them. It\u2019s better just to get a Mini ITX PC and a small monitor, you\u2019ll have a better time on that. ",
