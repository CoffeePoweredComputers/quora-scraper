            "answer_text": "First and foremost you need to be patient. What you see today is not 5G. It is a deployment of base stations with 5G radio capabilities but under full control of legacy 4G network. Without a 4G cell, there is no 5G radio. Which means that all of the advanced features of 5G are unavailable today. And by the way: as long as there is no higher bandwidth, 5G will not be bit faster than 4G \u2014 it is the same radio frame, same timing. 5G broadband was put in place to be there, when the demand exceeds the supply. Which will be some time around 2025, if you want to believe current traffic predictions. And at that point the individual experience of 5G will be pretty much that of a very good 4G connection today. What is 5G good for, then? Well: the main focus is on industrial and service applications with massive amount of devices with ultra low bandwidth and ultra low data speed (but millions of them) in smart grid and smart home applications. Real time applications and ultra reliable connections for critical services (like remote surgery). Redundant connections for autonomous driving and traffic control. Operators created the public 5G hype essentially to get people behind it, and collect the money. Wait until 2025. ",

            "answer_text": "I work in telecom industry let me try to explain here, if you want direct answer scroll down to last 3 lines. First of all 5G termed as 5th generation it refers to frequency around 24\u201339 GHZ. 4G was 2\u20138 GHZ. the principles are Higher the frequency- Higher speed. Same way higher the frequency closer your receiver need to be from tower. if your remember the FM channel towers are 100\u2019s of kilometre away as their broadcast frequency are low. But our cell towers are closer to us. that is because if you need speed you need to be closer with higher frequencies. Having said that 5G phone \u2014 yes required as you mobile should be enabled to capture and process high frequency . 5G simcard , yes you will have advanced encryption , authentication and other things to do here 5G Location- there will be more smaller towers required near your location to get speed. traditional towers sitting far away wont give 5G performance.

            "answer_text": "Yes, you do require those things to experience 5G network speed. However, cell phone users do not need 5G speed. If you have 4G speed, you can do anything without issues. For example, you can easily stream uninterrupted 4k videos with 4G. If you are experiencing issues with 4G, it is likely that your local operator merely needs to update their core network to allot for more users. Companies are the ones who will mostly benefit from 5G. They will be able to deploy applications at a scale and latency that are just not possible with 4G. Note also that 5G will only be available in cities. Outside of cities, you\u2019ll still have similar service to what\u2019s available now. ",
