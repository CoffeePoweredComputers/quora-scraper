            "answer_text": "Alcatel Mobile Phones is a joint venture created by the partnership of the French Alcatel-Lucent company and the Chinese TCL Corporation.  Alcatel Mobile was never acquired by anyone, it was created by these to companies and is co-owned by them. Alcatel-Lucent provides R&D and IP for the venture and TCL oversees supply chain and manufacturing. Both companies would see it as an investment of which they are equals. As for the brand all of its phones are made in China and the company is listed on the Hong Kong Exchange. I however would view it as a multi-national company. ",
