            "answer_text": "Seeing that Macbook Pro hasn't been launched yet for the 2020 model, it would be only speculation. But, 2020 model would have the Apple Silicon as they are calling it along with the Intel model. As Apple mentioned, it would take another 2 years to completely transistion to Apple Silicon which is essentially ARM based processor base, so it would release 2 models - one with Apple Silicon and another with Intel processor. Leaving that aside some things to expect in 2020 model is sleeker design, same keyboard layout with few minor improvements, MacOS Big Sur, thinner bezels, improved battery life and higher resolution camera. If you consider these improvements, the Software upgrades seems to be a major one which would eventually be rolled out to older Macs too. So, if you already own a MacBook Pro, I would suggest wait for 2021 else you can definitely go for 2020 model ",

            "answer_text": "I was also having the same question BUT BUT BUT read this*** In 2020\u2019s edition they removed their problematic butterfly mechanism which made user experience pathetic. Which makes it a reason to buy 2020 MBP BUT\u2026 In 2021 they are going to release ARM processor which will replace intel. This will result in better thermals and smoother performance. So in my opinion you must buy it in 2021. Thanks :) ",
