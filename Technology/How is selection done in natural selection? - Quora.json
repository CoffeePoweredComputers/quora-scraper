            "answer_text": "\u201cNatural Selection\u2019 is the result of an insight that Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus had when he was a country priest keeping the parish records of births and deaths. Malthus noticed that no matter how good a year the farmers had that there were poor people going hungry. He noticed that births increased geometrically while agricultural surpluses grew (at best) linearly.  from Malthusianism - Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism#/media/File:Malthus_PL_en.svg) As you can see in the graph, the number of people to be fed quickly outstrips the amount of food with which to feed them. The inevitable result is people die \u2014 most notably the poor. The increasing competition for limited resources results in death (of usually the poor) by the inevitable: Starvation, Disease, or War. Malthus wrote of his insight in his An Essay on the Principle of Population. He did so to argue for the futility of charity/public assistance to the poor and for regulation of marriage and procreation of the poor. Both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace read Malthus\u2019s essay and realized that the theoretical problems they were having explaining the dispersion of species geographically could be easily answered if they applied Malthus\u2019s insight into human agriculture to Nature. In any environment, the resources needed to sustain life are limited. Access to resources can be maximized by different organisms occupying different ecological niches, but within each ecological niche, there will only be so much resources. Hence, conspecifics will reproduce geometrically until the available resources are insufficient to support them all. Then they must compete for those resources. In such a competition, those organisms that are fitter (better equipped) will succeed while their lesser conspecifics will die. If the \u2018fitness\u2019 is the result of genetics that can be passed on to the next generation, then those capacities are passed on to the next generation. (I.e., \u201cthey are selected\u201d.) The genetic traits of the conspecifics that fail to live long enough to reproduce are not selected. Those traits go extinct. \u2018Natural Selection\u2019 is the necessary result of living organism reproducing geometrically in a Malthusian environment of limited resources. \u2018Natural Selection\u2019 selects those organisms whose traits allow them to have successful sex before dying. [Some organisms just make it. E.g., the male black widows and male praying mantises that die just after having sex. See, Yong, E. (Sept 20, 2016) \u2018How Male Widow Spiders Avoid Being Cannibalized During Sex\u2018, Nat. Geo. and See, World's Weirdest: Deadly Praying Mantis Love, Nat Geo.] ",

It is the inevitable end consequence of a population of individuals with heritable variation living, reproducing and dying with differing degrees of success that are impacted by the specific details of those variations. \u201cDone\u201d is a metaphor invented by humans because the human brain has experienced strong selection factors favoring a bias towards teleological thinking patterns, and framing the process with this metaphor makes it easier for humans to understand the basic concepts.
