            "answer_text": "As a long time heavy equipment operator, I would have to say that in addition to all of the wonderful and well reasoned answers you are surely getting, please consider adding the diesel engine to the list. Before the advent of Rudolph Diesel's compression fired, vegetable oil burning, internal combustion steam was the power for the engines of industry. Steam engines are external combustion, with high pressure steam supplied to pistons (or turbines) bia a boiler. Remember that metallurgy at the time was a bit diecy, insofar as a lot of steel hit the market with high percentages of sulfur that made the metal brittle. Make a boiler out of that, or get an operator who isn't totally focused on the mundane task of watching pressure gauges and constantly making corrections for same and you have a bomb simply waiting to happen. In fact, catastrophic boiler failures resulted in untold deaths and injuries in looms, mines, on railroads, and in countless other industrial settings on all of the developed nation/states of the era. This was the impetus for Diesel's engine. Unlike a gasoline engine, which uses a volatile mix of gasoline and air, fired by a spark plug, Diesel's engine fired by compression. When the piston hits top dead center on the compression stroke, pressures in the cylinder head are sufficiently high as to cause the fuel/oil mixture to detonate without the need of wires, magnetos, and spark plugs. That, and diesel oil is not nearly as combustible in open air as gasoline, making it much safer to store. (And again, Diesel's original design called for vegetable oil as a fuel, not petroleum. This made his engines feasible in lesser developed continents of the era, such as Africa.) Granted, his design was crucial in submarine and tank development and continues to power many truly horrific engines of war to this day. But it likewise brings power to areas that have none, provides emergency power to hospitals and rescue services in times of electrical grid failure. His engines have made industry safer: most notably in agriculture, mining, timber, and construction. His engines power some of the largest pieces of equipment on earth--movers and loaders that have literally moved mountains! and his engines power ambulances that provide critical rescue for the wounded--not to mention moving freight across the oceans, over the rails, and on the road. Nowadays, you even see large diesel trucks racing Paris to Dakar, and souped up versions of same entertaining crowds at tractor pulls and even pulling some very impressive times on regional drag strips across the United States. You would be hard pressed to touch one piece of food or manufactured goods in this age that has not been touched by the descendants of Diesel's creation, which first debuted at the Paris World's Fair in the late 1890's.

Flight: provided the ability to easily travel internationally. Also, allowed for the conduct war against civilians that increased the stakes of going to war for a nation. 5.  Atomic Bomb: made World War obsolete.  Without the atomic bomb, WWIII and possibly WWIV would have already happened. 6. Space Flight: a large number of technologies were developed during the space race that led to huge advancments in technology and the use of sattellites that form part of the foundation of modern communications. 7. Microchip: allowed the development of electronics and computers that has massively accelerated advancements in all aspects of life (technology, social, etc.) 8. Information Age: massive amounts of information sharing became available to all citizens. 9.  Advanced Medicine: increased the lifespan and quality of life for everyone. I'm sure there are many more.
