            "answer_text": "Urbanization will continue and the countryside will be used for agriculture and outdoor activities. Cities will optimize logistics and you will be able receive and send goods or get from A to B quickly and easily, using a multitude of transportation methods. You won\u2019t have to spend much time visiting shops to get what you need. Food will come fully prepared to your dining table. Digital experiences will be immersive (through virtual reality and other technologies) and you will be able to learn and experience nearly anything you wish from your home. Repetitive jobs will be given to robots and machines. Humans will spend more time serving other humans, taking care of the planet, and performing creative and artistic jobs. Humans may spend more time sleeping and resting. You will be enrolled in continuous education. The notion of an educational \u201cdegree\u201d will feel outdated. Physical space will be customizable and shared. Perhaps you will have a living room at your disposal only once a week. Using various visualization techniques it will be made to look the way you want it. The next day, your neighbor has it, and she will virtually \u201cdecorate\u201d it to her own liking. Healthcare will become more preventive. You will be able to take measure of yourself in countless ways and then get medication and supplements to balance off any negative developments. You will have your own virtual personal trainer. Everyone will have a digital identity with some of it exposed to the public and much of it private. Managing your profile, the data, and how it is presented will be a time-consuming task. It will be a digital imprint of your phenotype. Societal decision-making, i.e. politics, will evolve. Voting and decision-making will happen digitally across a variety of cross-sections of society (not just through a representation that is today mostly geographic). Personally I will turn 88 in the year of 2050. I hope I will be alive with reasonable health and in good spirits. Perhaps I will have an exoskeleton that lets me move around like a 60-year old. Some body parts will have been replaced by new ones or artificial ones. Eyesight and hearing may be artificially enhanced. I will have a room at home with every wall a screen so that I can project pictures and impressions from earlier in my life into the room, re-living those moments. Note: I am just thinking out loud here. I have no formal skill or information in predicting the future. Here I have also conveniently ignored all scenarios in which the world will run into trouble. I will now eagerly see what comments and other answers there will be on this question! ",
