            "answer_text": "Nature consists of two forces, reception and bestowal, which need to be balanced for the sustenance of life. The laws of nature, which we need to learn and abide by if we are to reach this balance, are unyielding, absolute and independent of our interpretation. Therefore, we must figure out how to clearly identify them, and learn to implement them so that we do not cause ourselves too much harm. The laws of nature evolve from its inanimate level where both forces, positive and negative, constantly evolve and reach a certain equilibrium between themselves. First in atoms, molecules, etc., and then in plants, in living organisms, animals, and then at the level of thinking, perception and awareness. This is the fourth level also known as the \u201chuman level.\u201d We must understand and comply with all these laws so there is balance between the force of receptio and the force of bestowal, so that everything would work in balance. This is the task that nature has presented before us. ",
