            "answer_text": "I was undecided between chemistry and physics, so started a joint course, but eventually qualified as a chemist and worked in industry on R&D on a chemical plant.  I realised that I would have done chemical engineering had I known about it, so proceeded to study, take exams in chemical engineering and completed a design project for the Institution of Chemical Engineers.  I have done work which bridges both fields.Both careers are valid, one is not better than the other.  Both have a considerable range of career options which will suit some people more than others.  In general, chemical engineering is better paid and more likely to lead to management, but money should not be your main aim.If you love chemistry, you should do chemistry, because there is surprisingly little in chemical engineering.  What chemical engineers do is to provide the conditions for chemical or biological reactions to take place by physical processes such as heating, cooling, stirring, bubbling gases through etc.  Then they carry out processes such as distillation or filtration to separate and purify the products.  Finally they minimize the energy usage of processes, and dangers to people and the environment.  It is a very broad subject area.  Of course, chemical engineers have to be competent in chemistry and be prepared to learn any chemistry involved in a process.   May also deal with complex biological systems and get educated in that area.However, chemical engineering is absolutely NOT applied chemistry.  The degree courses are completely different.If you choose to be a chemist, I would advise a career plan through to PhD in order to get a good job in industry.  For a chemical engineer, a Masters is pretty much required.  A PhD is somewhat optional unless you wish to be an academic. ",

            "answer_text": "At the time I am writing this answer: chemistry with an interdisciplinary knowledge of biology and mathematics(data analysis). At this time,the world has been drastically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, wherein a hitherto unknown coronavirus has infected the entire globe, and has led to measures such as self-isolation,quarantines and lockdowns across the world which has changed our lifestyles. At this time,the entire world is looking towards the development of a vaccine and/or cure,and that can be only be done by intensive biochemical and pharmaceutical research. So one can surely expect that funds in such interdisciplinary research wil increase after this pandemic, as the importance of good biochemical research has become evident all around the globe. So,you can definitely expect a rise in pay for people working in the pharmaceutical sector as the importance of such majors will increase in the future Also, a bitter truth is that chemical engineers are probably not very useful in contributing towards the process of drug discovery. This is because while there job is to upscale existing reactions and processes,they don't have much of a role to play in finding out the cure/vaccine. The only branches of engineering even helpful in contributing towards finding the cure are biochemical engineering and biotechnology, and they are pretty closely related to a biochemistry study as they are simply the application of the latter.So as of now, if you have interdisciplinary knowledge of the subjects mentioned above,and you have done enough projects and internships wherein you have learnt to apply the said knowledge to the pharma world, you would have a career growth maybe better or at least equivalent to a chemical engineer,who is waiting for the discovery before he can begin his work ",
