You\u2019ll need to contact your phone operator in order to get which provider terminated the call to your number using their networkYou\u2019ll need to contact that provider so they can point you to the account that initiated the callThat account probably belongs to a VoIP company, which resells their services to an end user, so you\u2019ll need to contact them too to determine who exactly initiated the call to your numberThe end user can also be a business, and in that case you will need to repeat the previous stepIf the end user is the final point, you will get to the person that scammed youObservation: unless there\u2019s a criminal investigation in the process, it will be very difficult to get the records needed to get to the final step. Truecaller won\u2019t really help you here, because they can only access what you already see, which is the fake Caller ID. ",

If you are referring to the fake Caller ID left by telemarketers, there is no real connection and no way to get the real caller info without a court order. Obviously, upstream providers know where the call is coming from, but they are obligated not to disclose this to just anyone. No matter how annoying you may find this, there is no criminal act here and nothing that can be done to overseas telemarketers. ",
