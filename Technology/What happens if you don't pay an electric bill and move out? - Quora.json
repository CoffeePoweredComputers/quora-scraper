            "answer_text": "I moved into a place where the previous tenants left without paying their bill. First the electric company refused to supply service due to an overdue bill. I explained that I just moved in 12 hours ago. I insisted my family needed electricity. Next they asked for a HUGE deposit. I couldn;t figure out why I was having so much trouble after having been a home owner in the neighboring state for 15 years. They asked for my former utility company to supply a credit report which resulted in no deposit requirement. Then they tried to add the previous tenant\u2019s bill onto mine. I told them to take it up with the landlord and provided his contact information. Same thing happened with heating oil and cable. About a year after taking up residence the water was turned off. I figured they were doing repairs and used my \u201cemergency\u201d water. The next day still no water. I called the township to figure out where water came from and the water company said I probably didn;t pay my bill. I asked what bill? (I had always had well water so this was a \u201cbill\u201d that I didn;t miss.) They got annoyed and asked for my account number. I explained I didn;t have an account. She explained it was printed on the top right of my bill. We were back to what bill? Several days later I came to find out the bill had not been paid for several YEARS and I was lucky one to live there when service was terminated. When they asked for $2500 I asked how much water cost. She told me $0.xx per unit. How much is a unit? One. Turns out they thought I used 2000 gallons of water a day for a whole year. I got the landlord to pay the bill and I contributed what I thought I owed. In short, the effects on your credit may be something you are willing to live with but tenants following you will have headaches they did not cause. You used the services. Pay your bills. ",

His next step will be to locate you, give the sheriff there a copy of the judgment order and they go to pick you up and find out why you haven\u2019t complied with that order. IF\u2026 you owned the property and defaulted they could put a lien on it\u2026and many municipalities now put late, overdue and defaults on state tax returns (a percentage, not 100%) and collect it that way\u2026 ",
