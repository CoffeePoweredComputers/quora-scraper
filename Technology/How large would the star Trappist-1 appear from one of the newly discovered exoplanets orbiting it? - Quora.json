            "answer_text": "TRAPPIST-1 has an estimated radius of about 0.11 times that of the Sun, giving it a diameter of about 153,000 kilometers. The planets all orbit at different distances, naturally; the nearest is about 1.66 million kilometers out, while the farthest is about 9.42 million kilometers. The formula for angular diameter, the size an object appears in the sky, is [math]2\\arctan \\left(\\frac{d}{2D}\\right)[/math], where [math]d[/math] is the diameter of the object and [math]D[/math] is the distance. This yields values of 5.28 and 0.93 degrees for the closest and farthest planets, respectively. The full moon subtends an angle of a little less than half a degree in the sky. So, for comparison:  Pardon my lack of graphic design skills. ",

It had me thinking of the opening sequence of Avatar where they land on the moon of that giant planet. Not sure if they have released the facts about the star only that it is a dwarf star. So I guess again a very fierce red hue, very confusing to be so close to something so large looking like a true fireball in the sky. ",
