            "answer_text": "One technology that did not exist 10 years ago was keystroke dynamics for behavioral biometrics. The technology is here now and it makes authentication with 2FA look like this.  The way we do authentication at the moment for 2FA is expensive, insecure and clunky from a user experience point of view. We should be focusing on find a solution that is best for the user. Behavioral biometrics will change that. There will be no need to switch devices anytime you want to log in to your account, they will not be so easy to spoof and it will be cheap since no additional devices are required. This will change in the next 10 years. ",
