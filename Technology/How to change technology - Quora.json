            "answer_text": "It may or may not be blind. It's very possible for programmers to change their core language; even when changing jobs. I regularly hire people with experience in different languages than they actually end up using for us. Unfortunately, judging you off the back of proprietary tech is difficult. That's all kind of irrelevant though. Whether potential employers are right or wrong, the best way out is to get experience. Programming is the easiest field to get experience in. You don't need to be hired first. Just make some software (using java)! I can tell you that I'd be more impressed if I saw someone actually release software, than if they'd just got a tech demo running. There's so much work involved in what often seems like just tidying things up. Releasing something forces you through that process. If you want to release java software, perhaps you might think about making some Android apps for Google Play. ",

            "answer_text": "Starting ones career with right technology / field is as important as starting it. As of now you hv 2 years of experience in a particular technology, now most of the opportunities you will be getting would in same technology, There are many things in consideration, like salary you would be expecting after 2 years would be way more that that of a fresher would expect but in terms of relevant experience you are a fresher, and another factor is that your profile now hv a tag of your current technology so HR/ RMG would go for ur current profile while looking for projects for you. Every manager would like to hire a team of experienced members at lowest cost to maximize the Output , If the hire you they hv to train you in minor or major terms. It was all about problems that you hv. Now telling you the solution in simple words Fake it till you make it? No, Fake it till you become it !! All you hv to do is to make your profile look you hv worked in projects as java developer , atleast for more than 6 months . That way you would start getting calls for java opportunities. Then in interview its all up to you how you impress the interviewer with your skills telling lies or truth\u2026. Justified ??? Best of luck\u2026. ",
