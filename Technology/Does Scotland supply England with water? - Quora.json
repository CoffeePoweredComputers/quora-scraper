            "answer_text": "No, most areas of Britain have local supply, for example London draws it from the Thames and Lea. Some places such as Manchester which draws it\u2019s from Thirlmere in the English Lake District pipe it over longer distances, but local sources are readily available across Britain which due to its maritime climate has adequate water available in all four kingdoms. The Scottish government raised the idea of selling water to the English South which is drier if climate change causes issues but this has not been taken up yet as the financial cost would be astronomical.

            "answer_text": "Not really. It is very difficult to supply distant areas with water. Water is heavy and difficult to transport. Most areas are supplied by water in their immediate vicinity. This is why Scotland, Wales, Cornwall and Northwest England spend half of the year almost underwater while southern and eastern England have hosepipe bans in summer. ",
