            "answer_text": "No doubt this modern technology is something we need in our day to day lives. Like Smartphones to remain update, Televisions to watch the world through it, Internet and Computers to keep an eye on what's new is happening and to do work faster, and so on. But you know, what these technologies overturned the era to be ?? It ruined the day to day life with it, No I'm not blaming technology for this but I'm blaming for over using, and over depending upon it. Case 1 - Year 1990s A Kid was crying over something. What parents did ? They tried to understand the cause and trying to sort it out or make him understand. Year 2019 4 yo kid cries and what parents are doing ? They gave him Mobile make him watch cartoon, so that the child stop crying. What's this ? Dependency! Why? Because eventually the kid will stop crying by watching cartoons and we know it works. Case 2 year 2004 Kids getting back from school at 4 pm and look they are in rush and excited because whoever reaches the field first, he's gonna bat first. Either kids are running or playing. You can imagine those moments when evenings in the playground were so crowdy and nousy. No tension for getting dirty or getting hurt. Year 2018 Playgrounds usually remains empty or least kids are there . Who's there ? Who's parents can't afford to buy a smartphone for their kids. I've seen many parents who don't let there kids to play out in the grounds just because they thing there are gonna dirty or may got hurt. And instead of playing with them they hand over them a smartphone, a laptop/computer or tabs so that there child can't complain about being getting bore. Case 3 Year 2007, its Saturday and it's half day of school premises. While I was at school I used to wait for this day because this was the most active and interesting day of whole week. Why? Because we used have drills or exercise in the first period then 2 or 3 classes then the last period was games, plus half day. So most of Saturdays were like half day fun plus when we reach home we find food is ready, and after getting freshen up Paa (father) is gonna feed us by his own hands , whole family is eating together while sharing about school moments. Year 2018 Same half day same getting home. But what's missing ? The togetherness . Everyone has got a smartphone , the concentration is on mobile not in the food or people around you. Someone's talking with other, someone is watching some random videos, someone is playing games, and last someone has plugged in earphones and enjoying music. If I'm gonna write till the end there will be endless cases where technology ruined endless moments of life. The life which we used to live but now we are just spending it\u2026 Last case Me and my best friends (we are group of 3) whenever we got time we used to roam in the woods around our City. Stealing mangoes , cashew fruit, guavas , and various fruit plus we used to play hide and seek , racing , cricket , kabaddi (one of my favorite). Our favourite part time was riding bicycle as far as we can go. The best childhood i have spent. It was all around 2010 , and today's the day where we meet twice or thrice in a week , now we don't play games, We all three have bikes now but we don't have time to spent it together, no roaming in the woods. Our only mod of contact is Smartphones and internet. You know why ? Because we got busy , life got busy and technology is helping us out to stay connected. So I dont completely blame technology for ruining life. No it helps too. But you know people should understand, there should be a limitation for its use. Children are lacking parents love, morals which parents should educate. Kids don't know what they are loosing by not enjoying life. You can't enjoy a life by just playing games in computer or Smartphones , try playing with friends in the out. You gonna realise whats the fun in running and spending some energy in it. In my conclusion The overuse of technology is something that is ruining life, sense and originality. People needs to use it with a limitation and tryna stop depending on it. Otherwise there will be a day when people will forget whats it really like to be living , whats it really like to to be a human. Just my experiences and opinions. You may not be agree with it. But really it's happening. Thanks btw .. ",

            "answer_text": "Lets take this one step up. Technology has ruined the traditional family. Not only has it made us subservient and needy for more technology, is has made us lose the basics to general survival instinct. Instead of kids going out, getting exercise, and building strong character - they now sit in front of the tv, computer, console systems, or their phones - with pizza and potato chips. The majority of their friends are cyber pals, instead of the kids next door. And that\u2019s ok because the kids next door are doing the very same thing. Technology is great for what it does, but it has become our crutch, and our shackles as well. ",
