            "answer_text": "In this modern age of fast-growing technology and increasing competition among tech companies, information security is the biggest challenge that a company, as well as the users, are facing. Shortly past, a breach that compromised the information of a few million people would have been massive news. Now, breaches that have an effect on hundreds of millions or even billions of people are far too common. Widespread news of security breaches and hacking of personal accounts of some multi-millionaire personalities have come in the past 2-3 years. In May 2019 Australian graphic design tool website Canva suffered an attack that exposed email addresses, usernames, names, cities of residence, and salted and hashed with bcrypt passwords. Recently a social media website twitter reported hacking of personal accounts, among the hacked accounts, were President Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, the Apple, and Uber corporate accounts, and pop star Kanye West.  As we use our smartphones for a lot of sensitive tasks, such as online banking and confidential business negotiations, there's more of a need for sturdy mobile phone security. There're always vulnerabilities that criminals will notice and exploit. Most of our smartphones are Android or an iPhone uses a Google Id or an Apple Id to backup data, passwords, location, surfing history. But in some cases this secured network is also hacked, thus there is a big question on the privacy and security that are being provided. All the tech giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple are constantly working to improve their privacy and security settings to make user data more secure in every domain. Smartphone security depends not only on the phones that we use but also on the mobile device management (MDM) technology installed on company servers, that controls and manages device security and prevents any kind of data breach. Both work together to provide good security and safer devices. A Smartphone usually consists of three layers of data security namely Device Protection: Allowing the remote data \"wiping\" in case the device is ever lost or stolen. Data Protection: Preventing corporate data from being transferred to personal apps running on the same device or on personal networks. App-Management Security: Protecting your in-app information from becoming compromised to third party users. In most phones, there are settings that allow you to verify any apps coming from unknown sources before downloading as well as it checks the app before installing, and as a rule of thumb, we should stick to the Apple, Google Play or Microsoft recognized stores, rather than third-party app deliverers. However, we should always read the reviews, even in the official stores just to ensure you're not adding anything suspicious to your device. Users must always keep their apps updated in order to eliminate any potential harm due to app bugs or threats. Try Saving your essential and confidential data in Hard Drives rather than utilizing free cloud platforms to ensure more security. Utilize device management tools offered by manufacturers like inbuilt device tracking. Always keep track of your in-app permissions and permit only those settings that you find essential.  Use public wifi wisely, as most people jump to any free wifi available that may risk their security. Enable two-factor authentication in Emails, google accounts, Facebook, twitters, and wherever possible it just ensures you have a second wall of safety for anyone who could know your passwords. We can use the new technology of security keys. It is like a small physical device that looks like a USB thumb drive and works in addition to your password and 2FA on sites that support it. One of the easiest ways for hackers to get in our devices is through spam and phishing emails, always lookup on your spam folder, and delete the potentially harmful one. We can use a certified and recognized antivirus software like Avast, McAfee, and Panda to halt such threats. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s really a question of whether or not a smartphone is secure, it\u2019s a question of has the smartphone been securely configured. Both Android and iOS (no need to address the other smartphone systems, as they occupy 1% market) can be secured, but aren\u2019t secure out of the box. My biggest complaint with Android phones, is the vast majority of phones are not updated in a timely manner (if at all). iOS continuously updates the system, securing any vulnerabilities.
