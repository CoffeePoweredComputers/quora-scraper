            "answer_text": "To understand how manufacturers know how many cars to make is a complex answer. I'll try and lay it out below: When the manufacturer shows a new model of a car, they show it to their dealers and get sales estimates from them. The dealers basically agree to buy \"X\" number of a new model, based on the sales of previous models.The manufacturer reviews their last several years sales, plus the sales of competing models to estimate their production runs.But auto manufacturers have a very sophisticated model of \"Just-in-Time\" manufacturing, and except for initial start up, try and only make the cars that they have buy orders from the dealers. The dealers, who have already \"signed up\" to take a certain number and mix of cars, send their orders to the manufacturer. The manufacturer then sends orders to the parts and systems suppliers for the cars that they need. They also give the suppliers specific dates and times for certain items to reach the production floor. The delivery is also pre-staged so that the red seats and black seats arrive in the correct order at the correct time to go directly into the required car on the line.If the manufacturer or dealer has not estimated correctly, there may be too many of one model and not enough of another. During the year, the dealer can revise orders, but at the end of the year, they just gotta find a way to sell what's on their lots.When a manufacturer delivers a new model or line, they have to give their suppliers estimates of production (forecasts) so the suppliers can make enough of the right parts.  If the manufacturer has under estimated the response of the market to a new line, everyone in the supply chain tries to adapt, but there will always be one or more constraints that can't be improved. That's when dealers start tacking on \"delivery costs\" to increase the selling price of a popular model. All of this is like trying to juggle alligators. If it works right, you are a hero. If you are wrong, you are in the doghouse. But after many years, the manufacturers and their dealers mostly get it right. They will have a good idea how many white cars, black cars, tan interiors, etc. are going to be required. Note: The \"just in time\" model of the automotive industry is a facinating topic all by itself. I'll try to explain more about it another time. ",

            "answer_text": "Do manufacturers sell all of the cars they make?  It depends, but generally yes. It might take quite a long time to clear their stocks and they might end up needing to give large incentives to clear stocks of slow selling models. We are all used to seeing zero or low cost financing, end-of-year runout deals, dealer incentives ... etc. That all costs the manufacturers and their dealers money.  That leads to the second part of your question, namely how do they know how many (cars) to manufacture? Building too many (or the wrong mix of models within a given nameplate) and then having to give deep discounts or pay storage fees for yard space at distribution centers is very expensive.  To avoid this, they try to estimate demand and build just enough so that their dealers only have enough supply (say 30 days to maybe 60 days inventory) in stock to meet demand without running out. Having too many or too few are both bad. For a new model they just make an educated guess based on their market research. For models that have been on sale for a while, they have a background level of sales data, so they \"know\" how much room they have to play around.  They keep track of their own sales, total market sales, economic trends and seasonal trends (spring/summer is higher than fall/winter I think), so when they're heading into slow cycle, they start building fewer cars. That might even mean reducing shifts, but usually they would just send fewer down the line on a given day. For some slow selling models within a given lineup they might stop building altogether until there's enough demand.  When they are heading back into higher demand period they start earlier and build up a supply. If they get lucky and have an in-demand product they add shifts and order champagne.  ",

            "answer_text": "For a long time now, most manufacturers have only built cars _to order_ What that means is that every car built has a buyer before the first nut hits the first bolt on the assembly line - that buyer might be a dealer rather than an end purchaser, but the manufacturer is not carrying the risk of unsold stock. Dealer cars have a standard set of specifications although a dealer might vary this if he believed it will make for a better-selling item. Dealers seldom if ever order more vehicles \u201con spec\u201d than they believe they can sell. When they get caught short, they\u2019ll simply discount the vehicle until it sells. ",
