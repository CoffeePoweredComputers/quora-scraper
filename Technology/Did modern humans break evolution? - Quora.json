            "answer_text": "That depends on what you mean by \u201cmodern.\u201d But evolution was \u201cbroken\u201d the moment it included humans. Humans are in an entirely different\u2014and higher\u2014kingdom from all other creatures on Earth. We are unique in ways evolution cannot account for. I just addressed this issue in another answer. So I\u2019m providing a link to that answer, as well as others where I\u2019ve dealt with the supposed evolution of humans. Unfortunately, the same or similar questions will continue to be asked on Quora. And, somehow, millions of people are missing the solid answers I\u2019ve posted. Yes, it\u2019s a thankless job.  Johnnie Lockett's answer to What are some animals that don't have a satisfactory evolutionary explanation? Johnnie Lockett's answer to In the process of evolution, why did only one living species (humans) become as advanced as we are now? Why didn't other species come up to be as advanced? Johnnie Lockett's answer to Why do many religious people think humans are not animals? Johnnie Lockett's answer to Why are humans smarter than animals? Johnnie Lockett's answer to Why didn't other animal species evolve to be as advanced as humans? We like to think human as a superior species, does every other species (animal) also think that they are superior? Or they admit human is above them? Johnnie Lockett's answer to Why are humans the only mammals who have to wipe after defecating? Johnnie Lockett's answer to Why do humans think differently than animals? Johnnie Lockett's answer to What is a human? What do we call a person, and what does one person contain?  By the way, I\u2019ve already gone rounds with those who disagree and think they can overthrow my reasoning on this issue. And I just don\u2019t have the time\u2014or the willingness\u2014to do so again here. If the reader thinks my answer is flawed, someone very likely has already raised the same objections that you will. If you\u2019re that interested, then you can surf the comment threads in the answers I\u2019ve provided links to. On the other hand, if you simply want to debate, I don\u2019t want to hear from you anyway. So, I think I\u2019ll turn off comments on this answer\u2014for my own sanity\u2019s sake. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Evolution isn't a mechanism or a thing, it's a description. You can't break a description. The number of mutations that take place with every generation is about the same as it was a thousand or a hundred thousand years ago, so even the mechanism is intact. More mutations surviving means more experiments so a faster rate of change. The only broken part is attitude, with a lot of fear by what could be called older models that newer upgrades could replace them. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The presumption is that technology (particularly medicine) makes us no longer subject to natural selection. That is not true. Natural selection still works. What really slows down natural selection is our population. But that happens to any and every very large population. It\u2019s part of evolution, not breaking it. There are 7.5 billion humans. Large populations cannot change very fast (in terms of generations). It simply takes too many generations for a new trait to spread so that everyone has it (fixed). With our generation time of 25 years, we are looking at over 175 billion years before a new trait could become fixed. We\u2019ve seen this before in the fossil record. It\u2019s called \u201cstasis\u201d. Humans are in stasis. Not because of our technology, but simply because of the huge number of people. ",

            "answer_text": "You seem to think that evolution is a process. No! It is the result of what happens over hundreds of thousands of years, given minuscule organic changes due to subtle mutations and dying off of lines of species that are not quite as good at surviving as other lines. It\u2019s been going on for hundreds of millions of years. We have sort of put a crimp in evolution because we work very hard to make it possible for the disabled to survive, have normal lives and procreate. The survival of the fittest no longer applies nearly as much as it used to. Evolution will, however, continue to happen. We just don\u2019t have a clue how it is going to occur and when. Here is a link to a site that explains how evolution actually works. How Evolution Works If you wish to read a fascinating account of the discovery of a missing link, and what it all means, get a copy of the book, Your Inner Fish. Not overly long, extremely readable and clear. ",

History attests that once established, nature and the DNA work to ensure the stability of a species. Thus Gorillas will only ever be Gorillas and so on. Science and the fossil record attest that macro-evolution cannot and has not occurred. No new life forms have ever developed from another. Speciation has been restricted to life\u2019s families, the dog, the cat and so forth. The human race is specifically excluded from speciation. We are a unique family and not able to cross breed with any other species. Our DNA ensures we will only ever be human beings and always able to interbreed with any other nationality. Chinese can breed with Hottentots, Siberians with Sudanese and all around the world. This won\u2019t change. ",
