Self driving cars/machines will impact jobs such as and driving and change the car rental industry (I wrote a lengthy blog post[1] about it). This will impact delivery services, postal services, mining, construction, agriculture and transportation in general. Retail shopping will also be affected. Amazon is developing a cashier-less grocery stores[2], why not whole malls where you just select merchandise from stores and walk out? General Medical Practice will hopefully be affected. Currently we have highly trained individuals who most of the time tell you things you already know (you have a cold). An AI constantly monitoring your health could alert you whether you just need to rest or whether you actually need to see a doctor. This has the prospect of making medical care better and more affordable and free valuable human resources for medical research. AI\u2019s will also create new jobs. We\u2019ll need more people in technical fields to integrate AI into our lives. There will be a slew of new jobs types aimed at training AIs (classifying training data, selecting training sets, debugging unexpected behaviours, etc..)We\u2019ll also need more service personnel to maintain all those complex autonomous machines . And we\u2019ll also need more people to keep people honest and not find ways to take advantage of AIs. The promise of AIs is not that things will remain the same only with robots doing some jobs instead of humans. AIs will affect the way we do things and open new possibilities.

            "answer_text": "Line workers. I used to work as a group leader at one of Toyota\u2019s large manufacturing plants, which had line workers in shifts creating automobiles 24x7. Line work was hard work, and parts of the job required mad skills. Just to understand how difficult line work is, I volunteered to do their job for a week. The work required me to repeatedly lift and place large metal objects nearly 6 kgs (13 lbs) in weight for eight hours, while constantly moving from station to station. It was the hardest work I\u2019ve ever done. The scrawny little kid that I was nearly died by the end of it.  (Me on the right with my friend who clearly edited this pic with too much Kawaii. This was taken right after a day\u2019s hard work.) The average time spent by a line worker there at the job was a few years. That\u2019s it. After that, repetitive strain injuries start to creep in if you keep at it, and you are required to if you are unlucky enough to not get promoted. Line workers also get paid peanuts for their back-breaking labour. I\u2019m studying robotics now, and I see how machines can work tirelessly, and with much higher accuracy than us humans can at such repetitive jobs. I bet the average time spent at Toyota by a robot at the same job would be at least 30 years. I believe the job of a line worker is going to go extinct in the future, when robots will get cheaper. And you know what, I hope it does, because nobody ought to survive by going through back-breaking manual labour in the future. ",
