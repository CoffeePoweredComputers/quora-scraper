            "answer_text": "1. Eat Right The foods you eat \u2013 and don't eat \u2013 play a crucial role in your memory. Fresh vegetables are essential, as are healthy fats and avoiding sugar and grain carbohydrates. You can find detailed information about nine foods for brainpower here. For instance, curry, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, and walnuts contain antioxidants and other compounds that protect your brain health and may even stimulate the production of new brain cells. Increasing your animal-based omega-3 fat intake and reducing consumption of damaged omega-6 fats (think processed vegetable oils) in order to balance your omega-3 to omega-6 ratio, is also important. I prefer krill oil to fish oil, as krill oil also contains astaxanthin, which not only protects the omega-3 fats from oxidation but also appears to be particularly beneficial for brain health. Coconut oil is another healthful fat for brain function. According to research by Dr. Mary Newport, just over two tablespoons of coconut oil (about 35 ml or 7 level teaspoons) would supply you with the equivalent of 20 grams of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), which is indicated as either a preventative measure against degenerative neurological diseases, or as a treatment for an already established case. 2. Exercise Exercise encourages your brain to work at optimum capacity by stimulating nerve cells to multiply, strengthening their interconnections and protecting them from damage. During exercise nerve cells release proteins known as neurotrophic factors. One in particular, called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), triggers numerous other chemicals that promote neural health, and directly benefits cognitive functions, including learning. A 2010 study on primates published in Neuroscience also revealed that regular exercise not only improved blood flow to the brain, but also helped the monkeys learn new tasks twice as quickly as non-exercising monkeys. This is a benefit the researchers believe would hold true for people as well.1 In a separate one year-long study, individuals who engaged in exercise were actually growing and expanding the brain's memory center one to two percent per year, where typically that center would have continued to decline in size. To get the most out of your workouts, I recommend a comprehensive program that includes high-intensity interval exercise, strength training, stretching, and core work, along with regular intermittent movement. 3. Stop Multitasking Used for decades to describe the parallel processing abilities of computers, multitasking is now shorthand for the human attempt to do simultaneously as many things as possible, as quickly as possible. Ultimately, multitasking may actually slow you down, make you prone to errors as well as make you forgetful. Research shows you actually need about eight seconds to commit a piece of information to your memory, so if you're talking on your phone and carrying in groceries when you put down your car keys, you're unlikely to remember where you left them. The opposite of multitasking would be mindfulness, which helps you achieve undistracted focus. Students who took a mindfulness class improved reading comprehension test scores and working memory capacity, as well as experienced fewer distracting thoughts.2 If you find yourself trying to complete five tasks at once, stop yourself and focus your attention back to the task at hand. If distracting thoughts enter your head, remind yourself that these are only \"projections,\" not reality, and allow them to pass by without stressing you out. You can then end your day with a 10- or 15-minute meditation session to help stop your mind from wandering and relax into a restful sleep. 4. Get a Good Night's Sleep Research from Harvard indicates that people are 33 percent more likely to infer connections among distantly related ideas after sleeping,3 but few realize that their performance has actually improved. Sleep is also known to enhance your memories and help you \"practice\" and improve your performance of challenging skills. In fact, a single night of sleeping only four to six hours can impact your ability to think clearly the next day. The process of brain growth, or neuroplasticity, is believed to underlie your brain's capacity to control behavior, including learning and memory. Plasticity occurs when neurons are stimulated by events, or information, from the environment. However, sleep and sleep loss modify the expression of several genes and gene products that may be important for synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, certain forms of long-term potentiation, a neural process associated with the laying down of learning and memory, can be elicited in sleep, suggesting synaptic connections are strengthened while you slumber. As you might suspect, this holds true for infants too, and research shows that naps can give a boost to babies' brainpower. Specifically, infants who slept in between learning and testing sessions had a better ability to recognize patterns in new information, which signals an important change in memory that plays an essential role in cognitive development.4 There's reason to believe this holds true for adults, too, as even among adults, a mid-day nap was found to dramatically boost and restore brainpower.5 You can find 33 tips to help you get the shut-eye you need here. 5. Play Brain Games If you don't sufficiently challenge your brain with new, surprising information, it eventually begins to deteriorate. What research into brain plasticity shows us, however, is that by providing your brain with appropriate stimulus, you can counteract this degeneration. One way to challenge your brain is via 'brain games,' which you can play online via Web sites like Brain Games & Brain Training. Dr. Michael Merzenich, professor emeritus at the University of California, who I interviewed two years ago, has pioneered research in brain plasticity (also called neuroplasticity) for more than 30 years, has also developed a computer-based brain-training program that can help you sharpen a range of skills, from reading and comprehension to improved memorization and more. The program is called Brain HQ, and the website has many different exercises designed to improve brain function and it also allows you to track and monitor your progress over time. While there are many similar sites on the Web, Brain HQ is one of the oldest and most widely used. If you decide to try brain games, ideally it would be wise to invest at least 20 minutes a day, but no more than five to seven minutes is to be spent on a specific task. When you spend longer amounts of time on a task, the benefits weaken. According to Dr. Merzenich, the primary benefits occur in the first five or six minutes of the task. The only downside to brain games is that it may become just another \"task\" you need to fit into an already busy day. If you don't enjoy brain games, you can also try learning a new skill or hobby (see below). 6. Master a New Skill Engaging in \"purposeful and meaningful activities\" stimulates your neurological system, counters the effects of stress-related diseases, reduces the risk of dementia and enhances health and well-being.6 A key factor necessary for improving your brain function or reversing functional decline is the seriousness of purpose with which you engage in a task. In other words, the task must be important to you, or somehow meaningful or interesting \u2014 it must hold your attention. For instance, one study revealed that craft activities such as quilting and knitting were associated with decreased odds of having mild cognitive impairment.7 Another study, published earlier this year, found that taking part in \"cognitively demanding\" activities like learning to quilt or take digital photography enhanced memory function in older adults.8 The key is to find an activity that is mentally stimulating for you. Ideally this should be something that requires your undivided attention and gives you great satisfaction\u2026 it should be an activity that you look forward to doing, such as playing a musical instrument, gardening, building model ships, crafting or many others. 7. Try Mnemonic Devices Mnemonic devices are memory tools to help you remember words, information or concepts. They help you to organize information into an easier-to-remember format. Try: Acronyms (such as PUG for \"pick up grapes\") Visualizations (such as imagining a tooth to remember your dentist's appointment) Rhymes (if you need to remember a name, for instance, think \"Shirley's hair is curly) Chunking, which is breaking up information into smaller \"chunks\" (such as organizing numbers into the format of a phone number)There are some other memory exercises like mind palace and knowing exercises.I hope you will find this answer helpful.

            "answer_text": "Since you're talking about short term/working memory, I have some bad an good news for you. Bad news are:There are limits on our capacity for processing information.here is more about it:(updated to include newer evidence on memory capacity limitations, as pointed out by some of the commenters - thank you!)Four is the \u2018magic number\u2019The Magical Number Seven (the original paper claiming the limits of the processing capacity for our memory is 7 +/- 2) Yes, I know there are some people who can remember more than those 4 or 7-/+2 items, but they are clearly outliers, and/or have trained to remember better and are able to use other abilities to 'boost' their working memory, using strategies that actually help encoding and recall (see below) - e.g. memory palaces or other types of mnemonic strategies. Good news is:You can improve the way you transfer the information from working memory to long-term memory And you can do it in 3 different ways: But first, a quick reminder on how the process of learning (putting stuff from short/working memory into long term memory) happens: To get what you've read/heard/learnt from your short-term (working) memory that lasts about 10-15s into your long-term storage (this is the actual learning process) you go through a 3-stage process:- encoding- storage- retrieval  You can improve your capacity to remember stuff by 1. Improving encoding (improving your ability to understand what you're trying to learn) by e.g. - improving your focusJoanna Jast's answer to What are some ways to focus better when working? - seeking understanding (e.g. reading, listening etc for understanding and attaching meaning to it) - making notes that reflect that understanding of read passages, chapters-> write a short summary of what you have just read; you may make some other comments - developing some smart ways of remembering stuff, e.g. mnemonics, such as memory palaces:Magnetic Memory Method - Anthony Metivier other funny things9 Types of Mnemonics for Better Memoryor by creating stories in your mind. 2. Improving storage by creating multiple connections with prior knowledge if you imagine information you;re reading, hearing, learning being put in files, encoding is the process when you file those files in your 'filing system'; the better your filing system (those little tags on the files on my picture above), the easier it will be to find the piece of information you;re aftermultiple connections with prior knowledge= multiple tags=better encoding = easier to find'creating connections'/chunking is about creating pieces of information/knowledge that makes sense to you and that you can relate to something you already know, e.g. 'Process X is like preparing a three-layered cake, because..' or 'Y reminds of of Z... but with W in the middle'here is a little more about the techniques involved: Fast and forever - an unauthorised guide to quickly learning and remembering anything anywhere3. Practicing retrieval - using spaced repetition principles and in avariety of ways, so not just simply recall, but also being able to apply the theory to practice, Joanna Jast's answer to How can I use the technique of spaced repetition effectively?
