            "answer_text": "Because you could put a lot of money into a problematic space. You often get excess moisture or water. It is cold. You may have equipment noises. Your sewage will sometimes spill out there. Ground water can leak into your walls. Your windows are often inadequate. There is usually only one way in, which makes it a fire trap. The ceilings are often low. the floors are usually cold. If you insulate the floors, that reduces your ceiling height and changes the height of your first step. There is often times mold. so if there is any other place you can gain living space, go there instead. If you should decide to put what resources you will need into the space to make it habitable, there is another thing as well. When you finish walls and ceilings, you will be concealing plumbing, electric, heating and ventilating, cable wires, and alarm wires, so next time any one of them needs work, you will need to expose them and then cover them up again. So use a drop ceiling if you have headroom. That will take up another 3\u20134\u2033 of ceiling height. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are a few reasons: Moisture, height requirements and egress. Basements can be incredibly damp and they can be prone to flooding. It\u2019s not if your basement will flood but when. Most building codes will have a minimum height requirement for living space as opposed to space where you don\u2019t spend a lot of time like your attic or basement. With all the utilities located there, it can be hard to meet that requirement in your basement. Living spaces need at least two points of egress. A bedroom will have a door and a window but that window has to be large enough for a person to be able to use it to escape a fire or similar catastrophe. It\u2019s hard to provide that in a basement without an exposed wall. ",
