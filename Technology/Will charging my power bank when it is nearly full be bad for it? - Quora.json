            "answer_text": "I'm assuming your power bank has lithium battery, if so it's not bad at all but lithium ion gets stressed during staying at high voltage levels so some people prefer to keep it at 70% but that way you will not get full capacity out of it. So in my opinion, if it is at 90% no point of charging but if it is even at 80% and you are going on a trip where you will need the power bank to function properly go ahead and charge. ",
