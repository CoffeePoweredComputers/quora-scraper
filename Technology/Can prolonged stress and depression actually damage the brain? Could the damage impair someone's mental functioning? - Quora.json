            "answer_text": "There is a current theory of the neurobiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) (with a lot of evidence backing it up) which suggests that chronic stress causes neuronal death in the hippocampus which then leads to MDD.  Here is an article about this: Chronic depression shrinks brain's memories and emotions The causal relationship (that is: whether the decrease in hippocampal size causes MDD or the other way around, or there is some third factor involved that influences both the size of the hippocampus and the disease) is still a little unclear, but the evidence of a relationship is there and is quit strong. The hippocampus is strongly implicated in memory function and one would assume that a decrease in hippocampal volume would affect memory in some way. In fact those with MDD do show cognitive and memory deficits. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear ,what happened in past is not important . Every mind loss start from stress . What is your know planning ? How will you manage with situations . Situations will not change you will have to means,you will have to change . You just tell me what you learned from past ,medicine is doing own work but be intelligent. A person goes to near the doctor for treatment of lever ,you tell me doctor can do repair your lever but if you again will drink then how the lever will properly work. Your body is machine it needs time to repair itself. What is your planning ? It depends on your pattern of thinking because your pattern of thinking create stress . If your home in this condition that repairing is not sufficient ,you will have to damage all old pattern , it means you need new will power and pattern of thinking. I am just trying to say don't be serious but use precautions for stress . How will you fight ? People laugh in park without any reason but activity work for mind . You will have to get two position. 1 your mind maximum time in two form , first thought comes and then you think about thought ,if thought will come about your future with health ,then it may be it create stress ,then why will you think about future for health ,when it give you stress. You use your patience in every work because I can Not understand you more but I know I am not harming to your mind . Patience is very very important for you ,I don't want to write but I will have to right that my concentration just catch in very fast that thought is negative or not ,then I don't give concentration to thoughts . Medication will do your chemical balance but your concentration can fight with negative thoughts , if you think that negative thought create stress then increase your concentration . I am again alerting you if you will use your patience and one side will write about thoughts which deep thinking create a stress and your mind get heat and stress and when ever temperature will change of your mind ,your cells will have to damage. There are many things you can do with your treatment so don't be confuse ,just use both things meditation and concentration. Same use some particular yoga to blank your mind and then sit for meditation. I said that your mind can live in only four position 1 desires 2 thinking 3 taking decision 4 working. I also know the capacity of mind so you can not develop your concentration till then you will not give concentration that why I write and what is role , I hint you all four action very quickly and you are to improve that just develop your concentration that you can see all four work in action the replay. I give you one example , your mann send a thought that you are to eat pizza , now I break in four action 1 your desire - you are to eat pizza 2 your memory cells send a image of pizza hut and you can call him and send a signal to decision cells 3 decision cells - give the order to hand 4 your hand is calling . I give you example I ask from my child on the road that just only find desires from your thought the she tell me 10 desires in approximate 5 minute so just use conectarte like a watchman that what is happening in mind. If I say that just closed your eyes and write about your thoughts then your thoughts speeds will automatically slow because this is fight between concentration and thoughts like in meditation so don't worry what I am saying nothing will harm to your mind while you will be benefit when you will use meditation.
