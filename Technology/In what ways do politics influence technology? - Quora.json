            "answer_text": "I think it may be impossible to extract them. Government officials in the Second World War marshaled energy towards creating radar, nuclear weapons, rocketry, computing, and much more. The spending dictated what was developed. The technology arguably ensured the victory of one side. The Internet, of course, has its roots in a government project to ensure communications during a nuclear war, and now has a separate life that affects government policies. There are many other examples of the interplay. For decades, large technology companies relied  on government contracts for continued development of some of their most advanced products, and to carry them through downturns in the consumer economy. Sun Microsystems, for example, counted on the NSA and other large agencies almost as much as it did Wall Street and telecom companies. Technology likewise affects government power, steering the capabilities of the military, national security, and less flashy bureaucracies. As the wellspring of much of our economic growth in recent decades, it also steers policies. There may be a parallel here with the way that certain ideas -- calculus, evolution, the telephone -- arise at about the same time in several places. There is simply a climate of capability, expressed differently by tech, business, and government. ",
