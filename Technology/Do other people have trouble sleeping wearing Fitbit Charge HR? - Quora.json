            "answer_text": "I feel that way as well, as do my sisters. I'm not sure if it could be electric, or simply that I'm not used to sleeping with something on my wrist. Now, believe me when I said I gave it an honest go. I slept with it on for 1.5 years and realized recently that my sleep is best and that I feel more rested without wearing my fitbit. So while I enjoyed my sleep statistics, I sleep more soundly and wake up easier when I sleep without the device on. ",
