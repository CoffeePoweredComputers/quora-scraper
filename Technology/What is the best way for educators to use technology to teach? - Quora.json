            "answer_text": "There are several approaches. The first uses updated Computer Assisted Instruction, programmed lessons with bells and whistles and games in the digital version as update to the older versions on PCs. These new versions also track student performance and can make automatic changes in the questions so that a student has success with his/her answers. These are a hot item for districts focusing on basic skills and/or distance learning. A second gives each kid laptops, chrome books or notebooks. For the most part, teachers use these to give homework assignments, take in homework, and have kids manage their class schedules. Many of these would go to Edmodo. A third approach starts with a district setting up a scope and sequence of skills. (e.g. how to open Word, use Google docs and maybe how to Code) so kids can be taught how to use digital tools for completing learning tasks. Teachers rely on sites such as Read-Write-Think, PHET, KHAN Academy, Class Tools and maybe specialized sites like CANVA to make lessons and projects. Use will vary by teachers. A fifth approach allows techie teachers to adopt the multitude of tools A fourth combines all of these, but there are few places this comprehensive. Teacher would have PCs so kids could practice basic skills when needed with CAI. They would learn digital skills for digital tools and then use these as skills and tools in reading, math, science and other content lessons.o ha A fifth approach is to have a tech teacher teach courses such as coding and computing, digital media, etc. Generally speaking, however, school wide use is left up to teachers. The result is a mishmash. At the best, a teacher like Jim Bentley in Foulks Ranch Elementary (Ca) has transformed his grade 5 class into a PSA lab. Kids raise money, produce Public Service Announcements)As for local services and learn all their required curriculum via their projects. Kids in Jim\u2019s classes (he taught himself the new ways after many years as a conventional teacher without tech). At worst, kids are on CAI for the full day, every day. Sadly, there are very few districts who elevate digital skills instruction to the same level as reading, writing and arithmetic. In this century, digital skills are equally if not more important as a pre-requisite for learning the 3Rs and then taking kids beyond to use digital skills and digital tools integrated into every subject and able to extend critical thinking, thinking and problem solving. Specific courses for coding and programming are a must before grade 8. In addition, individual teachers, if the entire district won\u2019t, can redesign course work with all digital tools available and give kids the digital skills they deserve and will need to live, learn and work in this century.

            "answer_text": "Evaluate your objective and decide if tech will enhance or improve a lesson. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s: \u201cStudents will be able to read a text passage aloud with minimal pauses, correct pronunciation and intonation\u201d. Without tech, this lesson would require working with small groups of students so that you can give them feedback on their reading proficiency. Then you will need to assess their reading proficiency one-on-one. With tech, you could have students record themselves reading aloud on a device. Then you would know where all students are currently (sometimes known as a pretest). You can leave feedback for students online. Then you could group student together based on their ability. For students who need a lot of support you could record your voice so that students could listen to your recording and practice by \u201cwhisper reading\u201d. Then they could tecord their reading for more feedback. And so on until they have reached proficiency. For students who need a little support you could be very specific in your feedback to them, (i.e., use more expression in your voice). Then they could read a text passage for their assessment. For advanced students, their pretest would become their assessment. Then you could provide them with additional apps that would challenge their vocabulary. Using tech can save valuable time for teachers, especially when it comes to practice and assessment. Using tech also produces a permanent record of progress for each student. Lastly, it allows teachers to differentiate so that all students get the support they need. Hope that helps. ",
