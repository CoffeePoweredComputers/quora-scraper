            "answer_text": "It could, at some point. But it won\u2019t compete with high-quality \u201cbroadband\u201d services for a while, except (most likely) in small (dense) areas. The first benefit of 5G may be rural areas, places without broadband first. It\u2019ll be a few years, at least, before 5G starts to be able to compete with existing wired services to a home. But that\u2019s the idea: for the first time a wireless service can start to compete with wired. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean things will be apples to apples in comparison, but 5G has potential and there is some cool technology/innovation behind it \u2014 if it becomes fully realized. I personally believe I am unlikely to ditch wired for 5G anytime soon, but I will adopt 5G as a backup to my home connection\u2026 and surely as my mobile solution, etc. I suspect a lot of people underestimate the time to deploy or realize the benefits\u2026 it\u2019s further off than most realize. Another note: the wireless providers don\u2019t necessarily have the experience of providing homes Internet access. One of the issues is IPv4 exhaustion, the 5G services may have IPv4 proxies or translation, running on IPv6 only, etc\u2026 for the average user, that doesn\u2019t mean much. For others, it means a lot. I need my own public (routable) IPv4 address\u2026 I\u2019m not sure 5G will provide that. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Absolutely not. I would get a slower and more expensive Internet in that case. Longer ping time and slower top speed. I have optical fiber at 1000Mit/s and I expect to get an upgrade to 10 000Mbit/s within a few years. This without any sort of data caps or data limitations. a few TB in a weekend is not uncommon. So in all aspects as I can know of, a switchover to 5G would be to make my Internet experience to be much worse then it is today. I will, of course, use 5G when on the move, but at home or at the office optical fiber is the correct and best way for Internet connectivity. Now to the really interesting part. I have not met anyone that has switched over to optical fiber for the Internet that even consider using any other kind of Internet access. And in Sweden, today above 50% of all premises already have optical fiber Internet access. ",

Image credit: What is 5G and how will it accelerate industry 4.0? If you are using a broadband connection, the answer is no, broadband is much stable than any cellular network.If you are using a shared WiFi, the answer still no, WiFi is specifically designed to penetrate through walls in order to provide faster and stable connectivity in close proximity. 5G can provide you faster speeds but not much in indoors even if it does, it won\u2019t be as stable as WiFi.If you are already using a mobile hotspot/ mobile broadband, then probably it won\u2019t make any difference unless the mobile manufacturers don\u2019t enhance the power and speed of hotspot.

            "answer_text": "In theory, 5G can offer comparable speeds to replace the broadband internet connection to the home - say, 100 Mbps. But there is a catch. To consistently deliver 100 Mbps to a home, and to deliver to a meaningful number of homes (say, 50) from one cell site, you need at least 100 MHz of aggregated bandwidth and this is only available in the spectrum with frequencies greater than 3.5 GHz (with one exception, Sprint\u2019s 2.5 GHz band.) Most network planners believe that the 2.5 GHz and 3.5 GHz bands will be earmarked for mobile broadband services, which means they will be looking at frequencies above 3.5GHz for fixed broadband services. As we go higher up in frequency, the range falls off, and the walls of the house block the signal. To provide fixed broadband service, the cell site needs to be fairly close to the home (around ~ 1 km or less), be fed with fiber to the cell site, and have a rooftop antenna to recieve the signal at the home. All this adds to the cost, and the current assumption is that 5G fixed wireless access will be a niche solution that addresses situations where fiber and coaxial cable are not available. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a lot of hype and misunderstanding about 5G. 5G comes in two basic flavors. The 5G being offered in most areas of the US today offers only a small advantage over 4G. The hype is about 5G over milliliter wave (MMW) bands.[1] These are very high frequencies (26 to 60 GHz). They offer about 10 times the current cellular bandwidth, but they work over only a short range and don\u2019t penetrate walls well. Providers are experimenting with the technology now. For example, parts of Houston have MMW. Early reports are that the service is quite good. If you have access to MMW 5G with good signal strength, you will see performance more or less equivalent to what coax cable providers offer today. Whether you will ever get an MMW signal, and what it will cost, are open questions. Footnotes[1] 5G Frequency Bands & Spectrum Allocations - CableFree",

It turns out that even 4G LTE can provide a decent Internet connection if the local cable company is a total AH about bringing service to your house. Just this afternoon I found out that Comcast wanted to charge $3,500 to add a single house to the cable in this neighborhood. The owners, understandably, told Comcast where they could go, and opted for a much more generous data plan and hot spot. ",

            "answer_text": "In a simple answer NO. Any type of radio transmission will have a limit on frequencies and the amount of traffic the system can handle at one moment. Optic fibre is only limited by the speed and capacity at the terminal ends. If you could produce terminal infrastructure that has a speed of one thousand tera bits, the optic fibre would have no problem with that. However not in a snowflake chance in hell could 5G be able to do that. 5G is ok , like taking a push bike to a store, but optic fibre is like taking the F35 to the same store. Just dont believe all the hype and rubbish you hear about 5G at the moment. ",

The only time where wireless is preferable will be the rural areas where laying cables is too expensive. Cost of implementing a solution to a problem become more expensive as you get closer to the theoretical maximum of the media. Current technology is a long way off the theoretical maximum of wired media but we are a bit closer to the maximum of wireless. ",
