            "answer_text": "You need a printer which has the following requisites: All metal nozzle. TPU is very flexible and require higher temperature than what PEEK nozzles can withstand routinely.Direct extrusion nozzle, for 1.75mm filament. 3mm flexible filament is very hard to print.Build chamber 30x40x15cm or better. You will probably want to print two shoes together, right? Cartesian printers are easier to find with this kind of volume.Heatbed 110\u00b0, or heated chamber. Flexible filament retracts a lot more compared to other filaments when cooling.Welcomed features: Open Hardware. That means you can repair it with cheap parts.Active community. This helps a lot when starting.What doesn't matter: Multiple extruders. It is already a nightmare to print well with one.Speed. You will print at 20\u201360mm/s anyway.Noise. You won't want it running near your bed anyway. Flexible ABS makes smelly fumes when printing and printing a pair of shoes easily takes a full day at medium resolution.Resolution. Too small nozzle and it doesn't print, too small layers and it takes weeks. You will need some hand polishing.",
