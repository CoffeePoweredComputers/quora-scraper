There are a lot of tools and frameworks that have a huge demand in the coming years. You need to explore and find the one that suits you the best. Let us look at some of the hottest tools for the software industry that are highly paid. Big DataWith the advancements in technology, Big Data is becoming a growing need for various companies. Big Data deals with large volumes of data that is present in both structured and unstructured form. The amount of data mined each day is tremendous. Data is extracted and converted to a meaningful form by Big Data architects. Big Data technologies like Hadoop, Spark, and Scala help reduce the cost of storing huge chunks. The high speed of these technologies, combined with data analytics, assists organizations in making decisions. Big Data finds its use in various sectors such as banking, technology, e-commerce, education, etc. Thus, the demand for Big Data architects is on the rise. Data Science and AnalyticsAccording to a report by Harvard Business Review, Data Scientist has been referred to as \u201cthe sexiest job in the 21st century\u201d. The huge amount of data being made available by Big Data architects paves the way for Data Scientists to analyze the data and draw insights. Python and R are two of the most used programming languages by a Data Scientist. Knowledge of Deep Learning frameworks such as Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras is highly recommended. Artificial Intelligence is all around today, starting from banks to your Netflix recommendations. Cloud ComputingCloud Computing is considered the next big revolution in the IT industry. Cloud Computing technology is the availability of on-demand computing services, starting from application storage to processing power. The services are usually provided over the Internet and charge a small fee. The main benefit is that organizations or individuals need not possess an IT infrastructure or data centers for working with large volumes of data. Many organizations nowadays are switching to the cloud due to work from home culture. Thus, there\u2019s a huge demand for professionals with Amazon Web Service, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure services. BlockchainThis technology powers cryptic currencies like bitcoins. Blockchain finds its applications almost everywhere, starting from health care to real estate. Hyperledger is an open-source platform for blockchain enthusiasts. Internet of Things(IoT)The IoT elucidates the network of devices used to connect and exchange data over the Internet via sensors. IoT finds its applications in traffic system management, waste management, building smart homes, and energy usage. DevOpsThe concept of DevOps evolved so that development and operations can be handled simultaneously. It was designed to reduce the time needed for a development cycle. DevOps help in automating infrastructure, streamlining workflows, and measuring application performance. Docker and Kubernetes are frequently used by DevOps engineers to manage, deploy, and containerize their applications. Augmented Reality and Virtual RealityAugmented Reality and Virtual Reality helps you experience things that are close to reality. Students pursuing Biomedical Computing can use AR in surgeries. Virtual Reality finds its applications in various games and creates a simulated environment for practice. The hottest tools for software industry are discussed here. You can choose any of the ones listed as all the technologies are on-demand and provide good pay. You can check the various courses available on upGrad to learn some of the trending technologies now.
