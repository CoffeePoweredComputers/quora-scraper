            "answer_text": "What Is a Firewall? It\u2019s not really a wall at all\u2014it\u2019s more like a filter. It would actually be more accurate if firewalls were called \u2018firefilters\u2019 because they\u2019re not built to keep everything out. Instead, firewalls are designed to filter threatening communications. Firewalls function using a system of either inclusive or exclusive parameters, allowing specific types of communication in or excluding others. Generally, a firewall is controlled by an access control list, which has a particular set of guidelines that allow or resist access to specific computer communications. These guidelines can be customized to fit any need on just about any device capable of going online. Different Types of Firewalls There are two types of firewalls: network firewalls and host-based firewalls. Network firewalls are typically used by businesses that contain a comprehensive network of multiple computers, servers, and users. The network firewall monitors the communications occurring between the company computers and outside sources. If a company wishes to restrict certain websites, IP addresses, or services like Instant Messenger, it can do so using a network firewall. Aside from controlling employee behavior on office equipment, this type of firewall safeguards the sensitive internal data of the company, such as customer databases and employee information. Firewalls stop intruders from accessing this information and protect the business from cyber attacks. Host-based firewalls work similarly but are stored locally on a single computer. Every home computer should have some kind of host-based firewall installed on it. This functions as the first line of defense against cyber criminals and various online scams and attacks. Host-based firewalls are also recommended for business computers that are network connected but not protected by a network firewall. They can also be useful for homes with multiple computers sharing the same network. Most of the time, home computers are covered by a hardware firewall, like a router, which protects the network. But every home computer should also have a host-based system kind in place to guard against specific types of attacks. Host-based firewalls are easy to install and protect your computer from malware, cookies, email viruses, pop-up windows, and more. Along with desktop computers, mobile devices can be installed with firewalls to protect online activity on the go.  If you use a computer at home, the most effective and important first step you can take to help protect your computer is to turn on a firewall.Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP SP2 or higher have a firewall built-in and turned on by default. (Note: Support for Windows XP ended in April 2014.)If you have more than one computer connected in the home, or if you have a small-office network, it is important to protect every computer. You should have a hardware firewall (such as a router) to protect your network, but you should also use a software firewall on each computer to help prevent the spread of a virus in your network if one of the computers becomes infected.If your computer is part of a business, school, or other organizational network, you should follow the policy established by the network administrator.",

            "answer_text": "The purpose of a firewall is to act as a filter for traffic, ideally preventing unauthorized access and unknown traffic. However I\u2019ve gotten wind that the form of security isn\u2019t enough for today\u2019s evolving security threats. There are many new emerging technologies like user analytics and monitoring that is believed to be a more progressive approach to threat mitigation. Here is a great article that explores many of these thoughts. I will attach it and I hope you enjoy reading it: https://itsecuritycentral.teramind.co/2017/07/07/technology-developments-in-data-security-say-goodbye-to-the-firewall/. ",
