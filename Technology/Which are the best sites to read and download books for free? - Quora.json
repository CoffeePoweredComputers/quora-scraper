            "answer_text": "Your local library may carry ebooks (US libraries generally do).  GoodReads is a source for free books given away by the publishers or authors, in order to promote the books.  Amazon has programs that you can join and that allow you to download books for no further fee, and there are periodic giveaways by some publishers through Amazon, also in order to generate more reviews and more sales.  Project Gutenberg produces ebooks of those books that are out of their copyright periods.   But please be careful -- If you get a book that is IN copyright and that isn't being given away by the rights-owners, then you are stealing. The people who upload those stolen copies aren't ethical by any stretch.  The ONLY way authors (almost always poor) can earn money from their work, work that made the books you want, is to control the production of new copies of that work.  IF they're willing to hurt the authors by making copies that eviscerate that control, why would you trust their files not contain malware to hurt you, too? ",
