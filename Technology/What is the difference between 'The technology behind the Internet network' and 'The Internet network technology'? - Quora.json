            "answer_text": "Thank you for A2A.  The question is a bit difficult to answer because I am not certain what you are looking for. (In fact, without A2A, I would not have answered - at least until I saw others.) But let me take a guess and if you comment / reply, I shall adjust as necessary. The first - technology behind the Internet - are the things that make it go. As a network & peering expert, I would point to things like BGP, fiber optics, TCAM, etc. But there are others, such as HTTP, HTML, SQL, storage, processors, etc.  The Internet technology would be, IMHO, more along the lines of what those underlying things enable. Simple and common examples would be online banking, eCommerce, digital health records, online movie streaming, etc.  So the first is a foundation, the second is what you build. The first is invisible to most users, the second is what users want & need. The first is esoteric and hidden, the second is visible and accessible to all. The first is a requirement for the second, but the second is the reason the first exists. Let me know if I came close to answering what you meant to ask! :-) ",
