            "answer_text": "There are loads of digital products online, millions of products in fact so it can be a little overwhelming to know what is a good product to promote! There are a few things I like to consider when looking at digital products to sell online: Is there a hungry market for the product already?Is it legal and ethical to sell the product you\u2019re looking at?How do you get paid and how often?Does the product offer support if something goes wrong?Is the product good value for money?If there\u2019s already a hungry market for your product then it should be easier to sell. Making sure it\u2019s legal and ethical will also keep you out of trouble, there\u2019s no point making a whole ton of money if it lands you in handcuffs! Payment processors can be temperamental when it comes to selling digital products so it\u2019s a smart approach to check which payment portal you can use and make sure your product is compliant with their terms, Paypal is renowned for freezing monies for digital products and holding the funds for extended periods of time. It\u2019s also smart to sell products that offer good value and support so you just have to do the selling and the company takes care of the rest, this is a good way to just focus on making money without stress of refunds and complaints. Hope this helps, all the best! Jeremy :) ",

            "answer_text": "Yea about that I would suggest you create a niche or content about something that you are interested in and then try to find a product that is related to that niche/content because you can't just start selling random product online you will not get any traffic to your product which means you will not get any sales. So if you know this already the best way to find a digital product to sell online would be to check some of the biggest Digital Marketing platforms like ClickBank or JVZoo, Shareasale, Muncheye, etc..

If you have a passion or interest consider finding products which relate to it. That way you can build content around it to draw in prospective customers. See my bio for a training resource. ",
