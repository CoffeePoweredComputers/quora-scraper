Thus, its elements are largely independent in operation despite being highly interactive and interdependent with respect to tasks performed. So, ordinarily, the loss of even large parts of the internet would simply diminish its operational capability, but the remaining parts would be able to cooperate to perform many, if not most, tasks, but perhaps on some diminished scale. But a major weakness of the existing internet is that it was never designed to guard against malicious actors! Hence, it is conceivable that a virus could be created which would bring down most, if not all of the internet (at least for a time). [1]\u201cA complex system is a system composed of many components which may interact with each other. Examples of complex systems are Earth's global climate, organisms, the human brain, infrastructure such as power grid, transportation or communication systems, social and economic organizations (like cities), an ecosystem, a living cell, and ultimately the entire universe. \u201c See in Complex system - Wikipedia ",
