            "answer_text": "Virtually any functioning, modern computer will run any video game. Of course, however, this does not mean the game will run smoothly on the highest-settings; in fact, it may glitch and stutter at the lowest settings. If you want to determine whether a gaming PC or regular PC is superior, then that\u2019s a different matter. You will have to take in a few considerations: What do you consider gaming? If your idea of gaming is playing Fortnite or Minecraft (or something of that caliber) then virtually any PC, or laptop will suffice. But if your idea of gaming is playing a high-end, Triple-A game (like Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3) then a more powerful machine will be necessary.Are you buying a cheap or expensive PC? An expensive regular PC will almost certainly perform better than a cheap, second-rate gaming PC.How old is the PC? If you buy a high-end gaming computer from 2005 and compare it to a simple, modest 2020 PC, then the modern PC will undoubtedly run better (This is a bit of an extreme example, of course).To get really good value out of a gaming PC, you have to spend a lot of money and consistently game. If it\u2019s just an occasional hobby, and you primarily use the PC for other purposes, perhaps work or school, then maybe it\u2019s not worth it. At the end of the day, it\u2019s really up to preference. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. It really depends on the game you're trying to run, and if you have the correct hardware[1]to run it. You don't need a huge liquid cooled gaming rig to enjoy PC games, as there are plenty of affordable and well received alternatives that will keep you and your wallet happy. Have you ever heared of video game streaming? Not the kind where somebody sits in front of a camera with a headset on for three hours straight, I'm talking about a streaming service much like Netflix and Hulu, Specifically one called Nvidia Gforce Now. [2] I use this one alot to play Rising Storm 2, and a really performance heavy game called DCS world using a small Macbook air and USB flight stick and it works flawlessly. Gforce Now only costs $10 a month, and there are multiple plans to fit your budget. If you don't want to spend any money they offer the service for free actually. (I probably sound too far feched to be telling the truth, right?) But get this, it's the version that I used for a year and it does not run out. the only catch is that you're limited to an hour a day, but that gives you plenty of time to mess around, and plenty of time to consider a subscription! I enjoy it atleast. I provided a few articles about affordable PCs and Gforce reviews if you're interested.

            "answer_text": "That really depends on how the machine itself performs and the availability of expansion ports. Open up your computer, check how big the CPU cooler is, a beefy cooler usually indicates a machine with decent processing power, an Athlon II x3 or equivalent will do. Your machine has AGP or PCIe ports on it\u2019s motherboard? (PCIe x1 will do if you don\u2019t have full sized ones) AGP and PCIe ports are brown colored if your machine is from 2011 or older. or black PCIe ports with a lock at the end that resembles that one of a RAM slot if your machine is relatively new. Brown PCIe x16 ports indicate that your board supports PCIe 2.0 speeds, this is important when checking graphics cards minimum specs, the black ones that I described support PCIe 3.0 speeds. ",

            "answer_text": "This depends on what the game is recommending your hardware should be to play it at bare minimum and also if you want high settings. All games will display this in their Hardware & OS recommendation. The Operating System is the first think you should have right. All software will tell you the specs your computer will need to run it. Solitaire is a game\u2026 Some people like these types of games. Runs on any computer. Microsoft Flight Simulator is a game too\u2026 Some people like these games too. Needs a NASA computer to run it\u2026 Just kidding\u2026 my computer can run it: Windows 10, Ryzen 7 1800x, 24 GB memory, 100 GB free space & RX Vega64 with 8 GBs of Vram!

            "answer_text": "You can play most games with a normal pc, however the performance won\u2019t be nearly as good. Gaming PCs are optimized to the stresses inflicted by gaming, such as high graphics requirements or high memory use. So yes, you can use a normal pc for gaming, but you won\u2019t be running Minecraft with shaders anytime soon ",
