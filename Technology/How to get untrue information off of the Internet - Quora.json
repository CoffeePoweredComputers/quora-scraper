If Donald Trump and religion has taught us anything, it is that despite evidence, facts, and undeniable proof, people will still choose to believe in whatever they want to believe in over the truth. All you can do is make sure that you don\u2019t believe in stupid lies like them.

It is important to be able to exercise critical thinking skills in order to avoid being taken in by the unfortunate amount of untrue information which abounds on the internet.
