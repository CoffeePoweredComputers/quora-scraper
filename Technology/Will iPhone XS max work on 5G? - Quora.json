            "answer_text": "Apple will not likely offer 5G support until it becomes beneficial to do so. Things that must happen for this to be beneficial to Apple: Wide adoption of the cellular standard, so that users can actually use it.Radio chip that integrates 5G radios with LTE radios. Apple has always waited for a power efficient solution to the latest cell technology, only implementing after a unified radio chip is availableActual perceived and realized benefit to the consumer5G is not really a thing yet. Phones that report being in a 5G network, are trying to fool you. Almost every 5G network is actually an LTE network, but the carrier changed the branding on your phone to say 5G. AT&T did this same thing with 4G \u2014 before LTE was available on their network, they decided the high speed 3G network was like 4G speed wise, and branded their HSDPA 3G network (an actual 3G standard) as 4G. And the shocker is the ITU allowed it, knowing full well it was not 4G. They later built out an LTE network (which still is not 4G, it is a sub-standard of 4G that enables the slow evolution to 4G) we never achieved true 4G, and now we are being sold in 5G. Don\u2019t believe the hype. Why Apple 5G iPhones Might Not Be Worth the Wait Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 doesn't have 5G because 5G isn\u2019t ready for the iPhone 5G iPhone in 2020 lets Apple wait for next-gen technology - 9to5Mac ",

And because Apple is stubborn and doesn\u2019t want to use Qualcomm it will likely be much longer than Android phones get 5G. So no, the XS Max can\u2019t use 5G even if some ISP\u2019s say so, it\u2019s physically impossible. ",
