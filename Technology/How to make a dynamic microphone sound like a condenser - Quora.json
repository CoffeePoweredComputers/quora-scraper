            "answer_text": "With difficulty. Dynamic mics have a relatively heavy coil attached to the diaphragm, and this limits their ability to respond to fast transients. The coil needs to remain within the field of a permanent magnet, but with large excursions due to very loud sounds it is hard for a design to keep the field constant - that can result in some level of distortion. Thus dynamic mics tend to have a slightly duller and less \u201ctransparent\u201d sound than most capacitor mics. ",

            "answer_text": "It cannot be done. Why do you think we pay the big bucks for those condensers? Dynamic mics have their own virtues. That is why, for instance, broadcasters often use dynamic mics for male voices when their budget would allow any microphone. Listen to your microphone, use it for what it does well, and save up for a decent budget condenser mic if that is what you need. ",
