            "answer_text": "I find I cannot do without my smartwatch anymore. The gadget is a useful addition to my smartphone. In busy surroundings I sometimes do not hear the ringing tone of the cell phone in my jacket pocket. I certainly don't notice the vibration alarm. The situation is different with the watch, which vibrates directly on the wrist, so that you can also hear the alarm. At trade fairs and other events, I have already received important incoming calls that I would otherwise have missed. A very useful feature for me are the notifications. I used to pull out my phone every time I heard a notification tone to see which app notified me for what reason. Today I read the notifications myself first on the smartwatch and then decide whether I have to use my cell phone at all, for example to reply to a messenger message. Another function that I use frequently is payments with the smartwatch. Google Pay is also officially available in Germany with watches based on Wear OS. I have also organized Apple Pay and use both services depending on the end devices currently in use. The handling is similar: Double-click a button on the watch, move the smartwatch near the terminal and wait for the confirmation tone for the successful transaction.
