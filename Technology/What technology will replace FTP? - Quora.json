            "answer_text": "Web-based replacement for FTP server Sharing files on the Internet has been a challenge. Often companies deploy FTP servers to allow users to upload or download files. These sites are difficult for business users to use, time consuming for IT to administer, and lack the reporting and tracking capabilities necessary to demonstrate compliance.Unlike FTP, SynaMan allows users to easily and securely share files across devices, anytime, anywhere. With SynaMan, on-going file and account management is easy. LDAP and Active Directory (AD) integration ensures that SynaMan users are automatically validated with existing network accounts and passwords.SynaMan can be effectively used as a replacement for an FTP server. The following table lists some of the benefits in using SynaMan verses an FTP server.FTP to be Discontinued Soon, Replaced with WebDAV FTP support is being discontinued in the near future. If you (or your designer) use FTP to upload and change design files then you\u2019ll now use WebDAV instead. WebDAV displays your BigCommerce store as a folder on your PC or Mac \u2013 exactly how file sharing software like Dropbox or Google Drive works.Technology has a way of reminding us that time doesn\u2019t stand still. There are always better pieces of information to act upon, technological advances being discovered, and new ideas being put into practice. In order to keep up with the needs of the rapidly-changing e-commerce environment, BigCommerce is updating the way you interact with the files that your site relies upon by implementing WebDAV as the preferred method to manage the files for your store. WebDAV makes processes such as uploading products, product images and editing design files quick and painless.Since FTP is going away soon you will need to prepare yourself (and your store) for this change. We have created a few resources to make the transition straightforward and worry free. If you have been using FTP and are not familiar with WebDAV, just think of it as a way to upload, download, and edit files located in your site\u2019s document library from the convenience of your desktop. For those of you who use cloud-connecting apps such as Dropbox, WebDAV will seem very familiar to you. Similar to Dropbox, you use your own computer to create a link to your repository in the cloud.",

FTP does not really have to be replaced, it works quite ok as long as you do not need encryption, FTPS is kind of broken. ",
