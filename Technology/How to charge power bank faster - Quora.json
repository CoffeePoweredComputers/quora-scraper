            "answer_text": "If it is a lithium polymer battery that has multiple cells, you can increase the current relative to the output current and capacity of the battery. Ensure you are using a balancer to ensure that the current is distributed evenly between the cells. Many power banks have a controlled chipset that dictates the amount of current that can be delivered to the batteries while charging. Most of them are configured conservatively, and bypassing them can result in faster charging\u2026 If you know what you are doing. I would use a hobby charger, they are great, and the digital ones are very diverse in types and capacities they can charge. If you know the statistics of the battery (output voltages, cell type, cell count, milliamp hours, etc.) you can usually charge it quite a bit quicker. Many of these chargers have their own safeties built in, and use some general electronic theory mathematics to do the calculations for you on what the battery can be charged at without damage. Assuming that you put in all of the information for the battery correctly. I have a bank that uses Li-ion 18650\u2019s. I was rather unimpressed with the internal regulators ability to charge it timely. Mind you, I didn't know the battery type until I opened it up. It would take about 5 hrs to charge VIA its supplied charger and usb cable. I removed the batteries, installed individual terminals, wired appropriately, and put it on my hobby charger as a 6 cell, 4.3v, Li-Ion . Charges in about 2 1/2 hrs now. A little warmer during the charge, but well within the safe zone. If you have a little know how, its worth it to bypass if you use it frequently. ",

            "answer_text": "As electronic devices have played an irreplaceable role in our modern life, keeping their battery alive is a constant concern. Needs create idea and market, power bank comes up to become the best partner of electronic devices. Power bank is very easy to use, simply plug a USB cable into the device which needs to be charged, in a similar way in order to charge a power bank, insert the USB cable into a qualified USB charger or a computer and connect it to the power bank, apparently applying a USB charger will be more effective due to higher output current rating. Most customers only pay attention to the key features like capacity, how many times and how fast the power bank can charge devices. Don\u2019t forget there is one more question you need to ask\u2013 How long it will take to fully charge a power bank? The input rating is the key when it comes to recharging the power bank \u2013 the higher is the input current rating the more quickly it will charge. You\u2019ll usually see a figure in Amps on charger, for instance 1A. You multiply this number by the voltage (5V for USB) to find the rating in Watts. A 1A input can charge at 5W, anyway, you would better look for a device that can charge at 2A (10W). Do note that for a high capacity power bank like 20000mAh, 2A input rating is not the best solution. Let\u2019s assume the power conversion rate is 90%, it will take 20000 mAh /2000 mA / 90% =11.11 hours to get fully charged, the result is not that acceptable. How about 4A input? Let\u2019s take a look, the charging time turns to be 20000 mAh/4000 mA/ 90% =5.56 hours, it saves 50% of the recharging time. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Can a power bank be charged faster? In most cases you can\u2019t but in some cases you might be able to do it. Let me explain a little. Typically inside of a power bank there is a lithium cell or multiple lithium cells in parallel and to charge them properly there is also a charging circuit inside that follows the proper way of charging lithium cells (as you might already know overcharging lithium cells can be dangerous). This circuit has a maximum output capability, in terms of power or current and you can\u2019t pass that value and if you even do so chances are you are damaging the circuit. So even if you use a higher current adapter as input for the power bank it is not guaranteed to charge the power bank faster yet if you have a power bank of 10Ah and an input adapter of 1A, you can try a higher current one which might work. There is also another issue with how USB power is implemented, smart chargers won\u2019t put out much current unless your power bank properly negotiates with the charger. ",
