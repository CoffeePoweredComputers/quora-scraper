            "answer_text": "If you aren\u2019t passionate about coding, then you should probably do networking. Networking is really left brain, organized, and directed. You won\u2019t necessarily need to bring passion and creativity into your work if you learn your fundamentals well and get your appropriate training. You will sometimes have to think outside of the box, but network engineering is closer to a technical job than a science job. You\u2019re less likely to run into situations that have never been seen with a job in networking, and in coding that\u2019s all you\u2019ll do if you\u2019re doing your job the best way possible. With coding you will have to heavily rely on other\u2019s work but in a completely different way. Instead of installing and configuring equipment in an organized and methodical way, you\u2019ll usually end up sifting through a bunch of code and documentation to figure out how to tweak code into your brand new original concept that hasn\u2019t been done before. Sometimes you\u2019re doing something that is very similar to what has been done before, but usually those situations will involve unpredictably putting pieces together for a specific platform. Coding always has a level of uncertainty to it. Networking is fairly predictable. Yeah, the WiFi might go out in the middle of the night and you have to go reconfigure it, but that isn\u2019t something that hasn\u2019t been solved by the company that provided it to you, and if it isn\u2019t then you\u2019re going to have to wait on them anyway. In short, coding is for you if you like solving problems and pasting snow flakes together. Networking is for you if you like predictability/stability and originality. I personally like coding better, but both have their negatives and positives. ",

            "answer_text": "It is impossible to answer this without knowing what motivates you, how much you know about each field, what your education background is. Without such information, any recommendation would be similar to the generic, boring \u201cfollow your passion\u201d dogma. In fact, \u201cfollow your passion\u201d is the worst career advice to give! It doesn\u2019t tell you anything about the opportunities, the challenges, the joys, the frustration, the happiness and the agony one might face if one pursues that career path. It is easy to give, easy to forget, carries no responsibility so refrain from someone who keeps telling you so.  In stead of telling you which path to choose, I can share with you what it looks like to be a software engineer working in the tech industry: A software engineer (SWE) will have opportunities to convert abstract ideas into concrete applications and products, to solve problems or to create values. Think about video games, stock exchanges, TV networks, online video and photo sharing sites, self-driving cars, airplanes, or even your microwave. All of them are created and run by softwares. A SWE will have to continuously learn new techniques, skills, programming languages, new technologies in order to stay up-to-date and to be performing at work. As a SWE, you will be rewarded emotionally when the product you build, the application you develop, the platform you design launch successfully and work flawlessly. Your users will laud you, your colleagues will congratulate you, you will pat yourself in the back to thank yourself after so many hard-working years. Or be punished with long hour of coding, annoying meetings, frustrated debugging sessions or painful post-mortem analysis where you are under the gun. Rest assured you will hear a lot from your angry customers. A SWE will be highly sought after and be rewarded with juicy compensation package, pampering working conditions such as free snack, lunches and dinners, free high tech gadgets when the tech market is booming. Or be laid off ruthlessly when the tech bubble burst. But all in all, a career in Computer Science and Software Engineering will promise you the chance to have lifelong learning, continuous development, and the chance to create magnificent things using just your brain.  Now, you have to ask a network expert for her advice in Networking, \u2018cause I am not one. ",
