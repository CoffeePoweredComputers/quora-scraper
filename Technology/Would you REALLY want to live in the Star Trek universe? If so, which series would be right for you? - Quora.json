            "answer_text": "I would choose to live on Earth during the TNG era. I would be crazy not to want to live in a utopia. However, there is something that has always bothered me about a \u201ccashless\u201d society. If you take away money, how much incentive is there to work? And, how many jobs are there in the Federation other than Starfleet officer? There is an episode of DS9 where Sisko and Co. are on earth, and they hang out at his dad\u2019s restaurant. And, I realize that the food there is technically free. So, the only motivation for having a restaurant is to cook for others? How many other jobs are there? Not cab driver, because someone can beam from one place to another. Or, maybe there are \u201cbeaming stations,\u201d and then you have to walk or need to ride some kind of hover car? So, the choices really seem to be artist, musician, shuttle pilot, Military officer, teacher, writer/journalist, Doctor, cook, or technician. If I translated my current career to a Star Trek future, I would probably be a journalist. I am skeptical about this future only because not everybody will be motivated by the same thing. We have people who lack motivation now when there is money, so in a Star Trek future what will those people work for? Why would they even have a job? I\u2019d hope that everybody would be enlightened, but this won\u2019t always be the case. The civilian life of Star Trek is a black hole because the shows are about Starfleet and space travel, not just life in the future. It feels like non-Starfleet officers still travel to different worlds like its nothing, but have you ever noticed how many times civilian transports go missing or have to be saved by the Enterprise? Not great odds. So, in conclusion, it would be great to live in a TNG world but I think that it would take greater effort to contribute to the world without money. I probably would excel at this because even now I work for a cause and not just a paycheck, but its still nice to see a paycheck from time to time. ",

            "answer_text": "I would love to live in the Star Trek universe. Earth is a Utopia at least until the Borg and other aliens attack Earth. People can pursue the career of their choice to better themselves and society and not to pay the bills. The social issues are all addressed with no poverty and little to no bigotry! The emphasis of society is the betterment of self and others and not the acquisition of material wealth and goods. The peoples of Earth and educated and enlightened. They live in a peaceful Federation with many other planets. I would rather live in the TNG (at least before the Borg) century with replicators and holosuites. I would love to interact with a story and not just read it! I would love to play Madame Curie discovering Radium, Meg Murray in a Wrinkle in Time, and Gwenivere and Morgan La Fay In King Arthur. ",
