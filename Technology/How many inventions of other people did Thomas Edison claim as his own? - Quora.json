            "answer_text": "Simply put there is absolutely no way to be sure. Thomas Alva Edison claimed to have falsely invented so many things that he would have easily been as intelligent as Einstein, Tesla and Enrico Fermi altogether if it were true. Although Edison had patents on many important things that he claimed to have invented he had no input into many of his patents. Even the light bulb which would have been his most useful invention is questionable. Several European citizens claimed to have invented this before him. Edison was definitely involved in producing a filament for the bulb that would last as long as possible but that may have been the extent of his involvement. Edison employed many workers to come up with ideas that could possibly be followed up on by them or other employees and he would then file for patents in his name and take credit for the invention. He hired Tesla to fix the problems associated with direct current and told him that he would pay him 50 thousand dollars if he could solve them. When Tesla had completed this task and asked for his payment Edison told him he did not understand the American sense of humor and that he had only been joking when he had told him the amount. Tesla immediately resigned and had to rely on construction work for a few years for sustaining his living expenses. Edison had told potential employers of Tesla that he had attempted to take credit for direct current from Edison. The two men became lifelong enemies. Tesla had attempted to interest Edison in his idea of alternating current AC-DC which Tesla eventually created himself thus lighting oor World as we still use the exact same system today. Edison employed as many as 80 people to try to come up with ideas and inventions that he could patent in his name and make profits from. If an employee requested payment for an invention that he or she had invented they were immediately terminated. So there is no way to know how many if any Edison actually invented himself as he was only interested in profit and not making contributions to the comfort of the individual which is exactly opposite of Tesla's views.

            "answer_text": "Just Like Henry Ford had developed the assembly line, to efficiently exploited labor, Edison had developed an invention incubator, in which tallented employees could bring raw ideas to fruition. Many of the ideas were his own, but many more were borrowed from others. His incubator was very effective in translating ideas into practical inventions, for which he claimed the patent rights. That\u2019s capitalism. This practice of the employer retaining patent rights for the work of his employees is alive and doing well in our modern intellectual property environment. Employees are asked to sign away rights as a condition of their employment. Those who cannot accept such terms are forced to become entrepreneurs\u2026 and it happens prodigiously these days. ",
