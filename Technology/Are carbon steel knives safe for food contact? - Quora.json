            "answer_text": "Are carbon steel knives safe for food contact? Absolutely and it\u2019s been used safely for centuries! There\u2019s been a huge push for stainless knives in modern times based solely upon the marketing sales pitches rather than actual scientific and engineering facts. For starters, very few stainless alloys can be heat-treated and hardened to the level of carbon steel. This is critically important when it comes to cutting tools because the tool\u2019s value is determined by balance of three factors:1. Ability to hold an edge.2. Strength.3. Wear resistance. When it comes to knives in particular, two additional attributes are added:4. Ease of sharpening.5. Corrosion resistance. Here\u2019s where the science and engineering facts come into play \u2026 alloys with high corrosion resistance generally have lower wear resistance, less strength and less edge-holding ability while being difficult to sharpen. Alloys with extreme edge holding abilities are typically wear resistant, but difficult to sharpen and have lower strength and corrosion resistance. Thus, the best knife alloys focus on edge holding, strength and wear resistance because ease of sharpening and corrosion resistance are secondary concerns. 1095 and 5160 are two of the most common carbon steels used for knives because they have the correct balance of strength and edge-holding ability, but lack a little in wear resistance over tools steels like O1 and D2; however, the latter two also lack the strength afforded by 1095 and 5160. Therefore, the ultimate blade is one that is known as being \u201cbimetal\u201d or \u201ctwo metals\u201d. This is where the cutting edge is a narrow strip made from O1 or D2 and is welded to a spine made from 1095 or 5160. This arrangement still leaves some things to be desired since overstressing the blade can cause the edge to fracture while the spine remains resilient. Thus, until one bites the bullet and drops sufficient coin on a true forge-welded laminated blade (a/k/a pattern welded), the best choice of blade is going to remain carbon steel alloy of 1095 or 5160. If your kitchen blades are rusting, you have not properly cared for them. Personally, I rust-blue the blades I make, but nonetheless, the sharpened edge and other wear spots remain bare steel which never rusts because they\u2019re properly cared for. Rust blue is the conversion of the unstable iron oxide Fe2O3 into the stable iron oxide Fe2O4 and when done properly it looks like this steel (sorry, don\u2019t have a picture of a blade handy but the finish is the same as appears here on the action and barrels):  Fe2O4 is stable and highly resistance to corrosion with moderate care. The nature of the finish also makes it essentially non-stick so carbon steel knife blades finished with true rust blue will not have things like potato slices glued to them by the starch and raw animal tallow does not leave a heavy residue build-up while cutting as happens with all other alloys. Yes, I do admit to having some stainless steel blades and even the two the are extremely expensive do not perform as good as my old carbon steel blades and they certainly don\u2019t even come close to comparing to a decent forge-welded laminated steel blade.

            "answer_text": "Yes. Carbon knives will, however, start to corrode and oxidize in the presence of moisture and acid. To help stop knife material from getting onto the food, you need to build a stable patina on the blade. This acts as a barrier that helps to prevent self-perpetuating orange rust from forming and damaging the blade as well as to prevent the same from rubbing off onto the food. Care must still be taken with acidic foods because, especially if the acid is strong and the patina is not well-established, the acid can remove the patina and transfer it to the food. This is not harmful and typically doesn\u2019t even happen but can affect flavor and appearance when it does. Rust in and of itself it actually not hazardous, either. Tetanus doesn\u2019t just appear magically in rust. That\u2019s not how bacteria works. It comes from the outdoor environment. Other bacteria cannot survive for a long time on naked dry steel. A small amount of rust on an indoor knife that has had maybe a few days at most to even begin rusting will not make you sick. As long as the person using the knife washes and dries it after the end of every shift, there is no reason to worry about knives in particular. I\u2019d be more wary of plastic cutting boards. Also remember the vast majority of kitchen knives used today throughout the world are still non-stainless carbon. And virtually all of them from about a century ago and all the way throughout the existence of metal knives were reactive. ",

            "answer_text": "Officially : no. If you take a very good care of your carbon steel knife there may be no strong risk for your health I guess. It is not like if eating extremely tiny fragments of Iron oxydes and hydroxides could kill you. Rust is not safe though and could contain all sorts of diseases. Having food in tiny corrosion holes could also be a problem since bacterias may devlop. Whatever you will do, there will be no food contact certificate delivered. The blade will not be clean and metal oxydes will migrate into food. We are not supposed to eat rust. Also, if many steels contains Iron and Carbone, some contains more dangerous elements like Cobalt. This is why most knives are in stainless steels nowadays. These 420/440 stainless steels are like Carbone steels but with Chromium added. These have an extremely good hardness. Due to the high amount of Carbon they have, them corrosion resistance is way lower than soft 18/10. Still, this is enough to prevent food contamination rust as loong as no rust can be observed on the bade. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. High carbon blades can be made into top grade chef knives. The only real consideration with a high carbon steel is that it WILL rust if left wet. Wiping your blade frequently to keep the blade clean and free of moisture will help with this. Also, you can have a high carbon blade treated in order to create a patina, which creates a layer of hard oxides on the surface of the knife. It may look dirty, but the black oxidation actually seals the surface of the steel and keeps it safer from moisture. In fact, here\u2019s an article written for the publication Serious Eats by a culinary director about why chefs SHOULD use carbon knives if they\u2019re serious chefs. You can clearly see the discoloration on his blade, however this is not a problem and is desirable for a carbon blade. Why Serious Cooks Use Carbon Steel Knives ",

The problem with carbon steel is it rusts if not dried carefully after using. If there is much humidity carbon steel knives might even need to have a light coating of cooking oil to prevent them from rusting. The problem of rust leaving ugly looking stains on food is why almost all my kitchen knives are stainless. Not because of any fear about the regular steel leaving rust stains being unhealthy, but just because it does not look nice. ",
