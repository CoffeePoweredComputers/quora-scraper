            "answer_text": "Yes, it will increase the amount of tasks you can run in the background If you have to too many memory heavy tasks for your RAM to handle, your computer uses your hard drive which is exponentially slower than RAM. Adding more RAM will allow you to run more applications in the background. This is useful for video/image editing and rendering as well as running Virtual Machines, however if you have less than, say, 8GB of RAM, adding more may even help in other moderately RAM heavy tasks such as gaming and of course running Google Chrome in the background :).

As you Have an i3 8 GB will Do the best job For you\u2026.. ",

If you are unable to run some software and it tells you that it is due to insufficient memory, obviously more RAM will help. Whether or not it is worth the money depends on how you value your time.

Basically RAM is used to store temporary process files and when you switch it off the files stored in RAM are gone. So more RAM means more performance. ",
