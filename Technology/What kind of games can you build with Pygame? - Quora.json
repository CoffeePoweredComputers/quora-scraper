            "answer_text": "Hello. Pygame is good for 2D, physics orientated games, but I have found that it is very hard to compile/ execute on a website. People are often introduced to this module from the Raspberry Pi (often children), as it uses it with Python 2.7, but the functionality with it compared to a game engine like GoDot, is very little. In other words, without extensive programming skill it is excessively difficult to create a good graphic game (compared with GoDot) and you wouldn\u2019t create a multi-player game on it at all. ",
