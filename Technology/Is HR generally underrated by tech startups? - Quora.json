            "answer_text": "Is HR generally underrated by tech startups? Short answer: Yes. For reasons related to speed and cost-saving preferences in the early days. But things change quickly. In an interview in Elad Gil\u2019s High Growth Handbook, Marc Andreessen, who has been a successful scale-up founder as well as has overseen many high growth startups as a VC, suggests hiring an HR head when the company is at size 50\u2013150. I am inclined to agree with him especially coupled with my own advice to startups that they pay for a good startup lawyer. A good startup lawyer can help prepare the scaffold for the early crucial hires, especially since these are likely to get equity based compensation as well. She may also be able to help the startup stay compliant e.g. safety and accessibility regulation, setting up workplace pension (a requirement in the UK for employers to offer to those between 22yo and retirement age and earning over \u00a310,000 a year). As the company scales, the people, who come to work for it, may not bring the same risk appetite as the very early hires. These would, for instance, be people to whom other steady benefits and perks matter, who may want flexible working etc which creates an administration workload. Further, as the numbers grow, it may be harder to scale the early bonhomie in the founding employees\u2019 group - which means more conflict may arise requiring resolution and intervention - and more formal processes are needed. A competent HR partner in the company would bring experience to build the infrastructure and processes but more importantly as Patty McCord writes in her book, a strong culture where people would be happy to work (employees) as well as proud to have worked (alumni). One startup I have known has ended up with a patchwork quilt of employment contracts in its team - an outcome of enterprising solutioning in early days but also a problem that was avoidable by using a lawyer once. As hiring takes more and more time for enabling crucial functions, it definitely cannot do without an HR partner with vision and startup experience for long. ",

            "answer_text": "Recruiting top talent isn\u2019t just about having a great idea, a great team, and a competitive pay package with stock options. I certainly don\u2019t want to minimize the importance of that because you will not recruit top talent unless you have that. But there are some other important elements to building a successful company. That\u2019s where HR comes in, but maybe not in the way you think. Before we even finished raising our initial funding we did two important HR related things that made life infinitely better for all our future employees. You will likely need to do the same thing: A. Benchmark your benefits package. When you\u2019re recruiting top talent, you\u2019re not just recruiting the potential employee, you\u2019re also recruiting their spouse. One of the questions potential employees consistently had were about our benefits packages. We made sure our benefits package was comparable or better to our much larger competitors. And since we were acquiring our talent from these same companies, it became even more important for us to have great compensation packages. In fact, they would even tell us that our having a really good benefits package made it easier to sell going to a risky startup to their spouse. B. Have a great company culture. My cofounders and I came from what were considered the two best companies in our industry (Maxim Integrated Products and Linear Technology). We talked a lot about what we liked and disliked about both companies. One of things we were all adamant that we didn\u2019t want was hiring any brilliant jerks. You\u2019ve likely dealt with brilliant jerks at some point in your life. They\u2019re the people that are really smart, but have so much baggage that their smarts are never worth the price. The trick is to never let yourself believe you\u2019ll be able to effectively manage a brilliant jerk. You will not be able to. You may inadvertently hire a brilliant jerk. Then you need to move them on from your company quickly. You don\u2019t need a HR VP or even an in house HR department to have great HR. One of the smartest things we did was outsource or HR function to TriNet. TriNet did a great job of handling our payroll and we were able to give extremely competitive health care packages to our employees. The reason I like outsourcing HR early on is you do not want HR to become a political power center. I\u2019ve seen HR too often in my career become to big and too powerful for its own good. It\u2019s almost like your HR VP needs to justify his or her existence. You don\u2019t need an HR VP early on. In fact you don\u2019t ever need an HR VP. I\u2019ll contrast two companies in the same industry that I worked at. The first being Maxim Integrated Products and the second being Micrel. Maxim had no VP HR and grew to $1B/Year in revenue during my time there. Politics were at a minimum, the benefits package was fantastic, employee turnover was minimal. Maxim\u2019s HR organization, as it was, reported to finance, and was purposely kept as small as possible. Micrel had a VP HR and its revenue was stuck at $200M/year. The company had aspirations to grow to $1B/year, but could never get there. The company\u2019s politics, in my opinion, were divisive, the benefits package was minimal compared to Maxim. and employee turnover was high (an average employee worked at the company for maybe four years). But what about recruiting. Don\u2019t you need HR for recruiting? No. And you certainly don\u2019t need (or want) HR driving recruiting at your startup. I was looking for a VP Engineering after the original VP Engineering quit. One of my cofounders found a potential candidate for me to interview. One of the first questions I asked the candidate was, \u201cHow are going to build your team?\u201d I knew he wasn\u2019t a credible candidate when he said he would find talent by going on bike rides. Yes bike rides. You can\u2019t be a manager at a startup if you can\u2019t recruit. This is an ironclad rule for me. Every manager I\u2019ve ever hired that has struggled running their area of responsibility hasn\u2019t been able to recruit top talent. Getting HR in the middle of recruiting isn\u2019t going to help you. HR is only going to get in the way. Think of it this way. Does HR have a network of experts ready for you to hire? They don\u2019t. HR is going to access outside recruiters whose goal is to get you to hire the candidates who they know. Sometimes the quality may be good and sometimes the quality may not be so good. You reduce your risk by recruiting through your network. You already have a connection with the candidates. Likely you or someone on your team has worked with the candidate. That is a huge risk reducer.
