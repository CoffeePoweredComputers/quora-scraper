            "answer_text": "Well, if we\u2019re being honest no one ever gave a single shit about ratings except for a few stickler parents. Most of us have been playing Call of Duty, Halo, and GTA since we were 12. You aren\u2019t some horrible person if you play the game. Next, in this day and age a preordered game is generally an electronic version. Even if you were 12 the seller would have no way of knowing. Just enjoy the game. Lastly, ratings are suggestions, not laws. Many stores require you to be 18 in my experience (or just be 15 and look 18). So you aren\u2019t breaking any laws or rules. Enjoy your game! ",

            "answer_text": "If your country does not require ID to purchase R18 games, or they are not banned (GTA is slated to be banned in Thailand due to gratuitous violence against innocents, thanks to our eSports Association trying to dictate gaming), you can just play. If the store suddenly requires a proof of age to receive a physical copy, just ask that the preorder be picked up or activated by your parents. Usually, R18 is not enforcing (or punitive) on individual players, and is even more rarely actuallly enforced. There are usually no laws punishing underage gaming, and if so, such activity is almost undetectable unless you stream your game and receive money. ",
