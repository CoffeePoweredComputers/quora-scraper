            "answer_text": "COMSATS is a decent enough university but being a graduate i feel that we lack the necessary exposure. The labs are state of art, and the facilities are good enough. Most theoretical teachers are highly qualified, but i personally feel that the lab instructors are under qualified and enough emphasis is not paid on lab projects and lab activities. So in general, it depends on how much interest you take in labs. If you want to learn no one can stop you from learning, but in general the lab atmosphere is not such which compels you or forces you the learn any way. However, i would advice you that if possible go to FAST for CS as the course curriculum is far more up to date with some of the most recent courses such as machine learning also included in their curicullum.
