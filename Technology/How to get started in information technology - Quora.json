            "answer_text": "How to Start a Career in Information Technology Many people love the people in IT (Information Technology). This is a good field but it does not mean that you work with computers only. Helping others use their computers is often a big part of the job. The opportunities in IT are broad: ATM technicians, PC techies, network administrators, webmasters, and many, many more are all potential jobs in the IT field. Steps 1 Discover if you are already skilled in IT. If you have a PC and use it for more than just typing and basic office work, doing homework, playing games and casually browsing the web, then you have the right stuff for the job.  2 Make a list of what types of IT work you might be interested in. For example, if you love computer games, you can list \"game testing,\" or \"writing game software.\" If you enjoy designing, \"graphic design\" or \"software design\" should go on your list. If you are interested in how the internet works and how computer connect to each other, \"network administration or network design\" will work for you.  3 Choose something that will make you happy. If you really enjoy it as a pastime, you will progress in the skill much faster.  4 Get to know the right people. Many IT gurus love to assist people. Look into a formal or even casual apprenticeship. Make a geek your new best friend.  5 Search for educational opportunities in your area or online, and determine what the entry requirements are for each field of study. Make comparisons.  6 Supplement self-taught skills with a few classes or an associate degree, and move right into the job market. The more education you get in the field, the better your income will probably be in the long run, but there are entry level jobs even for people with little education.  7 Look into professional certifications. Even without a college degree an MCSE or A+ certification can gain you significant credibility.  8 Seek internships at reputable companies. An internship at Google or Microsoft will open a lot of doors for you later.  9 Write a competitive resume and list it at prominent internet job sites. Include any cities you'd be interested in moving to.  10 Take the best entry level job you can get, and in your spare time, focus on honing your skills and on keeping up with the constantly evolving applications, hardware, and software that you'll need to utilize.

            "answer_text": "I once took a 20-year old young man with ~ZERO~ IT experience (he worked at a bar) and in a few months he was employed by a technology consulting company. Here is how you do it: 1.) Find a mentor - find someone (or multiple people) in the IT world that can guide you. Meet with them on a semi-regular basis. They can give you good advice and it will start to build your network. If you are lucky you will find one that can be your mentor and can help groom you for the IT world. Invaluable are tips on everything from dress, how to dress up your resume, how to interview well, current topics, good disciplines, etc. 2.) Pick an area of IT and start \u2018owning it\u2019. By this I mean learn everything you can about it, get your hands on some equipment and start building a lab. You would be shocked at what you can do for next to nothing. Some examples: Old, crappy, derelict PCs and laptops that people dump at Best Buy - you can install Linux or even VMware on them and you have a free server that you can use for a variety of purposes in your education. A 10-year old desktop system can be made very useful for your purposes and really helpful learning hardware. And if you blow it up\u2026.nothing lost. Same goes for networking gear like switches, routers, etc. You can pick up dirt cheap or free Cisco gear if you know were to look. Ebay can help, your local electronics recycler can too. Watch for companies dumping servers. A large company in my area frequently dumps gear at\u2026.get this\u2026GOODWILL. I\u2019m talking 3 or 4 year old Dell servers, storage arrays, all sorts of stuff with PLENTY of life in them.Many companies have software emulators for IT components. That means they can be hosted and work exactly like their hardware counterparts. These emulators are very good, sometimes functional equivalents, and they are dirt cheap to free. Examples of this are just about any Cisco networking gear, storage subsystems, and load balancers. You can put some mighty powerful architecture together with spare gear and emulators.If you have a home PC, or laptop - virtualize it. It will give you the ability to run multiple servers and operating systems on the same piece of gear.Ask your friends for their old gear. This is never fail - someone always has something laying around that can be helpful when learning.3.) Pick an area to study and work on getting a certification. I recommend the following: First - study for the CompTIA A+ certification. Easiest to study for, great intro into IT and computers. There are no shortage of books, online courses (live), YouTube videos, and computer-based learning available to help. Again, try to do it as cheaply as possible.Next, get another certification in the next level of something that interests you. Good next steps: - Linux - Windows - Networking (Cisco CCNA) - Virtualization (VMware, or open source systems like Xen or KVM) - Storage Administration4. ) Once you get some certs (and you are keeping your mentors up-to-date on what you are doing), start looking at temp employment agencies (like Manpower), IT consulting companies, staff augmentation firms, etc.. Get a sharp resume together, list your mentors as references, start circulating it. 5.) Read, Read, READ! 6.) Network, Network, NETWORK! Attend any IT-related user groups, conventions and vendor shows in your area. They are great networking opportunities as well as great places to learn. Most are inexpensive or free. 7.) The most important thing to reminding yourself - You can do this!! As someone with over 30 years in the industry, I can tell you all you need is attitude and aptitude. If you can learn, and you have an attitude that you will find a way no matter what\u2026you can make a great career at just about anything. If you do the above, I would be surprised if you did not have an IT job in one year or less. I have personally seen it happen numerous times. There are far more free or cost-efficient ways to educate yourself today, meaning it is much easier than before. A degree helps, but it is not necessary in this field. I make more than most doctorates in my field, however I only have a community college degree to my name. (BTW, I highly recommend your local community college, or places like Strayer. They are cost efficient, have a \u2018consumer\u2019 attitude toward your education. (Meaning they are taking your money, they owe it to you to try to teach you something. This is different than a university where most of the time they feel it is a privilege for you to hand over your money to them, results be damned.) While skills like public speaking, presentation, technical writing are very important, you don\u2019t need to mortgage a house for a degree to get them. And you don\u2019t necessarily need them to land your first IT job. As for my bar worker - fifteen years later he is the Sr. Network Admin at an expensive private school pulling down some serious coin with a small team working for him. He will retire well\u2026. Good luck! ",
