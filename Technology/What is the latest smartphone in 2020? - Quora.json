            "answer_text": "There are several smartphones that have been released this year starting with the Samsung Galaxy S20 series. These are designed to deliver impressive capabilities because they are geared towards business use. The camera specs are much better on these devices which should be expected given that you will have to pay more than $1,000 for it. There is also the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro which are both ready to compete against other flagship phones. These gadgets are performing well under heavy use with a 90Hz refresh rate. OnePlus is not stingy when it comes to the RAM which is a plus. Apple also has released its iPhone SE 2020 which is their way of appeasing Apple users who want a more affordable unit. This is ideal for those who do not want a fancy iPhone to use. For starters, the design of this device is similar to the previous models and may not be that eye-catchy. Still, Apple has made it a point to give it a boost in terms of performance by equipping it with the A13 Bionic chip which is the same as that in the iPhone 11. I guess it can be forgiven for its lack of pomp but it is worth it to invest in. There is also the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro Max that is running with Snapdragon 720 chipset. This is a large smartphone given that its size is measured at 6.67 inches. It has a 5,020mAh battery which can withstand heavy use. Motorola has also released a smartphone this year which is the One Fusion Plus. Although it is smaller than the Redmi, it has a higher chipset in it at 730. I think that there is not much difference between its battery life and that of Redmi. ",
