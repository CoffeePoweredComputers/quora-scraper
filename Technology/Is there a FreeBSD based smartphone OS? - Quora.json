            "answer_text": "The only BSD based smartphone is the iPhone. iPhones run iOS which is one of Apple Darwin operating systems. Darwin is free and open source, which originally came from NeXTStep. NeXTStep was based on FreeBSD and the Mach microkernel. Apple updated every bit of NeXTStep, first transforming the Mach Microkernel into the XNU hybrid kernel (Apple has not used Mach in many years) and then updating and replacing every piece of NeXTStep until all that is left now is FreeBSD, OpenBSD and custom Apple components. Apple then takes Darwin OS and puts a custom user interface on it for each unique product which creates Apple\u2019s operating systems which includes: macOSiOSiPadOSAudioOSwatchOStvOSBridgeOSSEPOS OSSo iOS is essentially Free/OpenBSD with Apple\u2019s XNU hybrid kernel.

            "answer_text": "James MacInnes is quite correct, if one is speaking about what's under the hood. But i think you mean is there a smartphone that directly runs some sort of FreeBSD derivative directly. The big problem with BSD is the serious lack of driver development (except in Apple); and many drivers would have to be written for a smartphone. I am not aware of any, but that doesn't mean some BSD geek somewhere isn't working on retrofitting a smartphone for FreeBSD.  Closest I've heard is the Ubuntu Phone, which is at least *nix-like, if not actually FreeBSD. ",
