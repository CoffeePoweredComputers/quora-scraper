            "answer_text": "No one has requested an answer from me, but I think I can answer. OpenBSD is the most secure, and is mainly used in routers. FreeBSD is the most scalable, and is mainly used in servers. NetBSD is the most portable (having a rump kernel) and is mainly used in embedded computers. Overall they are good for NAS. ",

            "answer_text": "FreeBSD - if I remember rightly, this one has the largest package set. NetBSD - this has broadest feature set, including experimental stuff, and supports the widest range of platforms. OpenBSD - widely regarded as the most secure of the BSDs, certainly the most thoroughly code inspected, although it should be kept in mind that their focus is on remote exploits. It's the most conservative, feature-wise. ",
