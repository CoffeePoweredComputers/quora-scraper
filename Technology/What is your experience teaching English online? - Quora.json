            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been teaching online for 2 years now.Personally, I like it. It\u2019s much easier than teaching a full classroom.Working from home is always much better. I love the freedom.I choose my own working hours and I don\u2019t have to work if I am not in the mood to. Also, You don\u2019t have to wear formal clothes, drive to work and things like that. I am teaching Chinese kids and they are usually well-behaved and eager to learn. The job itself is not very stressful, which is really important for me. Also, the pay is really good. ",
