            "answer_text": "Taking into account the growing seriousness of the illness, advancement in science towards healthcare is the need of the hour. Application of nanotechnology in healthcare is very vast ranging from imaging to biosensors.Use of nanotechnology in healthcare will not only help in proper treatment but also in early detection. 1.Early detection of disease : The sooner the disease is detected more easy it will be to treat that particular illness. To achieve this research is focusing on introducing nano-particles in the body in tissues,bones and lymph nodes which will enhance the sensitivity of MRI , CT-SCAN and not only that but it will also help in occurrence of symptoms at an early stage. 2.Tissue Healing and wound care: Various nanoparticles are investigated to see if they can be used in an effective way to increase the rate at which the wound will be healed.This wound dressing material has the ability to form an intimate dressing and to control the release of active compounds over periods of upto 1 month to promote and accelerate wound healing. 3.Wound Infections: Researchers have designed a drug molecule that releases antibiotic in presence of specific infection.They envisage a dressing impregnated with various antibiotics with actual release of only a specific antibiotic released for a specific infecting organism. 4. Hemostasis: Use of a nanofibre impregnated with a special kind of gel that helps to achieve hemostasis within seconds.Once the injury heals,the nano toxic cells can use it for as building blocks for tissue repair. 5.Microsurgery: Smart biological instruments are embedded with miniature sensors with added functions to help surgeons.Nanobots can undergo biopsy which will cut the tissue and can be brought to a doctor later on for examination 6.NanoBots: These robots could operate under the direction of an external force and induces a drug in that particular organ. However still studies are going on to the evaluate the impact of these applications on humans and surrounding environment. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are few of the highlights: Using nano semiconductors (quantum dots) to improve the conversion of light to current in stacked (or layered) semiconductors. The dots \"harvest\" the light in an efficient manner (excitements are highly sensitive to intensity)  and thus help transfer the energy to layered (in this case bi-layered) semiconductor. This concept will be applied in solar equipments and photo detectors. The article regarding this research was published just last week so we are far from mass production. But it will be fruitful down the line.  Use of nanoparticles to treat inflammations in the intestine. There is a field called nano therapeutics which deals with the process of targeting nano particles and nano devices  during drug delivery (using different mechanisms) for in vivo treatments. Similar research is being done on gold nanoparticles and breast cancer.Claytronics: Now this is a very new area of study. It focus on programmable communication between catoms in the 2D plane to generate 3D materials.I could go on and on and maybe even write the longest answer on Quora. But instead I will share with you an excellent website which will answer your question in the best way possible: Phys.org - News and Articles on Science and Technology  ",
