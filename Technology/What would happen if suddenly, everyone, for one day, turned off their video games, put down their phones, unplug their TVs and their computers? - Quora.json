            "answer_text": "Alright, so: Original question on time of answering is \u201cWhat would happen if suddenly, everyone, for one day, turned off their video games, put down their phones, unplug their TVs and their computers?\u201d Scenario: Almost all important technology simply doesn\u2019t work anymore. Part 1: Turning off their video games. This would have relatively little impact on the world. Twitch, a popular game streaming service would lose a day\u2019s worth of revenue, which would set them back a little bit. So would other gaming-related services, such as Steam, GOG, and Youtube Gaming. Part 2: Not using phones. The telephone has become such an integrated part of daily life and business architecture that shutting them down for one day would cause massive financial ruin. All phone-related business would grind to a halt. AT&T and T-Mobile are screwed over out of a day\u2019s worth of payment. Families would be equally devastated. Friends and family would be unable to contact each other, unless they use e-mail (assuming part 4 isn\u2019t done yet.) Not to mention the possible deaths from those who would call 911 in an emergency but are unable to receive emergency care due to a lack of communication methods. Part 3: Unplugging TVs. Televisions are a tool for mass communication from authority to essentially everyone. People look to the television to be entertained and informed. One day without these would be relatively harmless, but nobody would know the news unless they still get the newspaper on their doorstep, and even then it would be slightly outdated due to the time it takes to print and deliver them. Part 4: Unplugging Computers. Disabling every single computer on the planet would be absolutely catastrophic. The Internet, the mass collective of every computer on the entire planet sharing information and making life easier, would simply collapse. You see, the Internet *is* the computers that compose it. Without these dedicated servers and home machines, the entire internet would shut down. Google, Amazon, Reddit, Quora, and every other site is gone. News will now be truly unattainable. So many things happen on the internet that I am unable to explain the actual devastation this could cause. All that\u2019s left for communication is radeo, and I don\u2019t think that will get us very far. Part 5 (BONUS): Is there any good that will come of this? Well, I suppose everyone would go outside or something like that. It would definitely serve to break up the monotony as all of humanity tried to figure out what caused everyone to suddenly quit their technology for a day, and even more so when the day ends and they start using it again. Plus, I suppose I should mention the electric surplus that we might get from not using these for a day. The amount of power draw for these kinds of things is pretty insane. ",

Technology is part of our lives now, it can never be taken away just like how guns have become part of peoples lives. Times have changed and we must change with it. ",
