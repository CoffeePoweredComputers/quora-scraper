            "answer_text": "There are two basic types of treatments Wastewater, sewage, effluent etc must be treated before discharge - at least in civilised countries - the treatment depends on the pollutants. Potable or drinking water must be filtered to remove silt and dead animals etc and then sterilised. Sterilising can be by boiling or chemical tablets for small quantities or in large quantities chlorine gas dosing. Also you should do as we do in Australia and catch nice clean rain from the roof. Unfortunately some primitive people in countries with high rainfall have told me that devils live in the roof so the water cant be used, but there is no helping them ",

For cleaning up house hold water that you have used there are some good plans for building a bog filter where water is cleaned naturally by plants that grow in wet conditions before running off or being absorbed by the earth.
