            "answer_text": "It has totally changed Science fiction writing, which has now moved from Gee whiz machines to moral, social, and political impact of technology, and also crosses over with the paranormalIt has totally changed Animation. In traditional drawn animation there were distinct styles of animators, whereas now, computers use libraries of figures and special effects, which make animation look much the same whoever does it. There is also the tendency to add much action simply because it is available, though not adding to the storyThere is also the overlap with storytelling and animated video games, which blur the aspect of personalities in animationIt has changed Action movies with Special effects often being the dominant part of the movie, but not contributing much to the story itselfHorror movies are actually less horrible with Special effects as we are more aware of the effects than the charactersMuch the same with War movies, where the action takes over from the effects of war on those involvedCrime and Detective stories have moved from the brilliant detective or super criminal, to the technical experts and advanced communication methods of teamsIn all, storytelling at its best is a person telling a story to a group of people, and letting them imagine the events and characters. A well written story stirs the imagination to the point where we feel involved in the story, and identify with the protagonists This has been replaced with our being given story gift wrapped, and we are simply observers On the other hand, technology has given unlimited access to the means of making movies, and so broadly widened the types of movies that get made Science fact extends on Science fiction. Wildlife documentaries now take us places that were not possible in the past. And ultimately, we have stories in our pockets, in our houses, and in some form or other, just about everywhere we look Also, for children, the idea of storytelling is no longer just a passive entertainment. From a young age they now learn to manipulate sounds and images to the point where expressing ideas is as natural as playing As technology advances, we get closer to transmitting our thoughts more accurately to others, and this will continue until such times as we can eventually transmit our thoughts and feelings directly As with all things, it is impossible to say whether this will be good or bad, but for sure will be different ",
