            "answer_text": "When it comes to revenue, Google is a behemoth. It is considered to be among the Big Four technology companies along with Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Netflix (FAANG). Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet is the fourth on Forbes\u2019 Top 100 Digital Companies, and it is a trillion-dollar company. so, how much money did Google make last year? Google made $110B in 2017, $130B in 2018 and will likely report $148B in 2019.  Going by the trend Year 2020 will see google reaching around 165 Billion dollars. Let\u2019s explore the Google products that brought such impressive revenue: The top revenue makers for Google: Google AdsGoogle AdSenseGoogle AnalyticsGoogle PayOther RevenueGoogle Ads represent more than 80% of Google\u2019s revenue Ads are used to make profits in many of today\u2019s social media channels, search engines, games, etc. Google uses them in Google Search, Admob (mobile app ads), and the GDN Google Display Network. How does Google Ads (Google AdWords) make money? Google rebranded its advertising feature that used to be called Google AdWords into Google Ads, and it is one of their main channels of profit. Google Ads is one of the features that actually is responsible for the bulk of Google\u2019s profits, more than 80% since it is so widely used. And that actually makes sense because it is fairly important for any person or company to advertise something on the biggest search engine platform in the world. It is making sure that plenty of people will see what you\u2019re trying to sell, and you can literally filter out the people that you want to see your ads by many categories. How does Google AdSense make money? Another source of revenue for Google is its Google AdSense service which is similar to Google Ads but instead of displaying ads on Google\u2019s services, it displays ads on other sites. It is oriented towards publishers (website owners) that can earn out of their platforms by allowing ads to target their visitors. How does Google Analytics make money? Google Analytics is a tool that helps you analyze the metrics connected to your website and gives you lots of information that you can use to base your business decisions on. It was invented in 2006 and has since empowered webmasters to make more data-driven decisions about their sites. There are many, many possibilities with this free tool, however, the most commonly known are: Tracking the number of website visitsTracking the duration of those visitsTracking the sources of the visitsTracking which pages exactly they landed on, visited, etc.Used keywords (you can also use Google Search Console)Preferred sections of the visitorsTypes of devices visitors come from.How does Google Pay make money? Google Pay is another service that brings Google some revenue. In the past, this service changed its name a few times; it was called Google Wallet, and before that Google Checkout. The point of Google Pay is simple- to make purchases easier for the sellers and for the buyers. The consumers can create a free and simple Google Pay account where they input their payment information. This data is kept in a secure database. You can use Google Pay to make basically any time of online payments. You can buy clothes, food, apps, pay in stores, and even send money to somebody. Other Revenues Besides all these well-known ways in which Google makes money, they also have other projects and sources of revenue. Some of the things that are into this other revenue are Play Store, Android, Google Apps, the Google Cloud platform, etc. We all know and use these services, and they are not even detailed in their financial 10-Q reports. Waymo Self-driving company Waymo was started out of Google\u2019s X (its development facility for \u201cmoonshot\u201d projects) It is a fully self-driving service that is expected to become even bigger in the future. Other offline projects under the X Development facility include Google Glass which didn\u2019t really blow up, project Loon, project Wing, etc. Google Maps In the third quarter of 2019, Alphabet properties/websites made more than 70% of the company\u2019s revenue. These include Google, YouTube, Gmail, Google Play, Google Finance, and Google Maps. Google Maps also earns money from partnering up with companies that benefit from navigation or tracking like ride-sharing companies, trucking companies, etc. Specifically, Uber/Lyft pays Google to use its maps when routing drivers around the city. Google Business We can\u2019t leave out Google My Business of this conversation. As I previously mentioned, Google is used to building their products a long time before monetizing off of them. The same goes for Google my business which is a feature of pinpointing the location of your business, where you can present your products, new offers, etc. It looks like in the future, they will try to monetize off of this. Google Drive G-suite also has a portion in Google\u2019s revenue. G-suite is the cloud platform that includes Google Docs, Google Drive, Sheets, Slides, Forms, etc. You can pay to have an upgraded version. More team possibilities are available like shared Hangouts, shared calendar, etc, or more drive space and other advantages for a monthly fee. Google Translate Another well-known service is Google translate. It surely helps with the world\u2019s communication. Even though the version that we use on the web is free, the feature can be used by other applications which load the translations via API calls. Android Today, 2.5B devices use Android. The super popular OS is a great indirect revenue maker for Alphabet. With Android, Google learns your mobile usage patterns, can pre-install Google Chrome for your search habits and sell you apps through its Play Store. Oracle estimated Google made $31B from Android since 2008. Conclusion Google makes a ton of products I love and use daily. From search to Youtube to Adsense, Google definitely has a great grip into our daily lives. This competitive advantage comes from its ability to invest heavily into creating great products without the need to monetize right away. Google is one of the top four digital companies in the world for a reason. They are not afraid to take risks when it comes to this, and at this point, they totally have the power to experiment and try to predict what the future will bring.

            "answer_text": "Obviously off of selling user data. That\u2019s what Google is infamous for. Even though they claim not to sell user data, they actually do make money off of advertisements. A lot of behavioral tracking goes behind the scene. One of the most basic ways Google makes money is through Real-time bidding or RTB. It\u2019s like basically putting billboards on empty locations. But everything is digital. Google tracks your behavior and then sells that information to advertisers. Advertisers then pay a sh** ton of money to have a spot on your web browser or your phone.
