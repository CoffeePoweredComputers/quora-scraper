Posting a copy and paste answer in every comment section. Therefore I will delete that comment and allow his answer to stand uncommented on. My original answer: Never had a \u201cplan\u201d. Just 5 lines on his 2015 campaign website that he claimed was ready to \u201cRepeal and Replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act \u201con Day One\u201d of his presidency. You remember the \u201cplan\u201d that was \u201cso Great that if I show it to anyone they would steal it\u201d that he campaigned on all through the 2016 Campaign. Well he never even showed it to the REPUBLICAN controlled House and Senate so in 2017 the Republicans Repeal only American Health Care Act was a crash and burn when the self proclaimed \u201cGreatest Negotiator on the Planet\u201d couldn\u2019t make a deal to keep all the Republicans on board. \u201cNobody knew health care could be so complicated\u201d: Donald John Trump, February 27 2017. Actually Donnie, EVERYBODY knew, except YOU! Remember when he teased a \u201chealthcare plan\u201d in the lead up to the 2018 midterm elections? Just more vaporware. Or in 2019 when he announced that he would release His health care \u201cplan\u201d in the next three weeks, multiple times during the year? Vaporware! And now the those zombie 5 lines from his 2015\u201316 campaign website have been resurrected along with the promise \u201cthat it will be voted through on the First Day of my Second term in office\u201d. And in July of 2020 he promised that His plan would be released \u201cin 2 weeks\u201d. Been more than 2 weeks, still waiting \u2026 (sound of crickets) Fool me once, \u2026 No plan then, no plan now, Never Had One EVER. ",

            "answer_text": "Never was a plan, never will be a plan. Like the plague america will just have to live with whatever the health insurance industry can provide. You know like pre ACA. Everyone testing positive for the plague will have a pre existing condition. Some may recall how the health care industry handled pre existing conditions pre ACA. Trump and the Republicans want to erase the ACA as everything else the black president acheived because he was, you know, a black democrat. Neither Trump or the Republicans care about \u201caffordable\u201d healthcare or whether we have healthcare or not because ,you know, free market, freedom, yadda, yadda. For a demonstration look no further than their concern and empathy for the 225,000 deaths from the plague they refuse to do anything about. Or the hundreds of thousands of dollars a Hospitalized plague survivor is liable for. When the ACA is murdered there will be no replacement. ",
