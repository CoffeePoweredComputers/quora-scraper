            "answer_text": "I just bought a router for my wireless internet, it works well when installed. It has both lined and wireless connection with my computer. Soon I find there are some interruptions in the internet connection by long scripts running in the process, and it is hard to stop. I try to quit the windows one by one but it does not quite responding. I switched off the new router and changed to the old one. To my amaze, my Norton internet security had been restricted, its extensions cancelled, and the window is changed. I have to manually restore my Norton internet security extensions, performed a system restore but I suspect my data, passwords and all personal information may have been stolen. And I am not sure there is any spyware had been left in the system that the system restore cannot clean them out. So it is true, some devices are dangerous, especially if your name, email address, phone number, keywords\u2026 had been included in the blacklist, the Trojan programs will be activated to deal with you immediately in a malignant manner. And human control will be notified to take control to do more damage to your system. All this is done through the internet using your data. ",
