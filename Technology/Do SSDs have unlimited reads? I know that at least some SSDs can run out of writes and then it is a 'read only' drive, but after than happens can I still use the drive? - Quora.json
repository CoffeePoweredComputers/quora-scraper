            "answer_text": "While strictly speaking Neelima & Tony are correct that there are issues which could cause reads to make data corrupt, especially after the write life-cycle has been reached. You also need to take this into context. Just how long would that take? Well some studies have already been done: Modern SSDs can last a lifetime The life span of an SSD - how long does it last and what can be done to take care? How Long Do Solid State Drives Really Last? Grueling endurance test blows away SSD durability fears The worst case in that meant a SSD failed after writing 728 TB of data. What they effectively did is just write random data onto the drive then overwrite it again and again constantly for a year. What you can also see is some of the drives are still in this test and have already surpassed the 2 PB (1 PB = 1000 TB = 1 000 000 GB) mark. Thus some manufacturers make MUCH better drives than others. And what does this mean for you as a user? How much are you going to write, never mind read after it has failed? You\u2019d really need to do something strange to surpass a handful of GB per year. So even if you bought one of the weaker SSDs you\u2019d likely not see the write-cycle issue crop up for several years to decades. And on others it might only happen after you\u2019ve left this world. Now compare that to spindle drives which also wears out mechanically as their parts rub together. These have also been shown to last between 2 to 20 years (depending on manufacturing quality). So should you worry? I\u2019d be much more worried about a HDD failing than a SSD, and from personal experience this is very justified (of the 15 or so HDDs I\u2019ve had 5 of them have failed in under 5 years, 3 in under 10, the rest are still usable after 15), while the 3 SSDs are running constantly (one is now 7 years old inside my file server / desktop combo, the newest in my laptop is 2 years). But also I\u2019d be extremely worried if all my stuff is on only one drive (no matter which). If you need to store data for long periods, then none of the normal media would suffice. Not without some possible problems in a few years to decades. For long term storage you should really be looking at archival quality optical media, something like MDisc (or other archival blue ray discs): New Blu-ray Disc offers 'lifetime of storage' ",

            "answer_text": "No, they do not have unlimited reads. The SSD may switch to a read only mode after it has been determined that there aren\u2019t enough \u201cgood\u201d blocks remaining to write new data to. Blocks wear out after going through a large number of program/erase cycles. However, NAND flash also suffers from: Read Disturb: A read disturb error occurs when data is changed during repeated reads (between erases). Repeated reads to a block without an erase can alter data contained in that block. To recover, it is necessary to erase the block and reprogram the data. Data retention issues: During extended storage periods, NAND cells can lose data by charge loss. This problem is exacerbated at high program/erase cycle counts. To recover from this, it is necessary to erase the block and reprogram the data. High P/E cycles aggravate both read disturb/data retention, so reading indefinitely is not possible. Data retention also deteriorates at higher temperatures. ",

Writing to Flash memory requires firing electrons at relatively high energy into structures where they get stuck - the high energy cause some displacement of atoms which eventually causes failure in the cells (something like 10000 writes). Magnetic drives wear symmetrically, i.e. reads and writes cause equivalent wear. ",
