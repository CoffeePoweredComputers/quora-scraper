            "answer_text": "Humanity has been obsessed with making the world a better place since we developed language. We have always tried to improve our lives through science, philosophy and spirituality. Personally I think this question is too vague, so I will give you my own interpretation of your topic: What are the policies of science and technology that are implemented in the Philippines? My understanding of the topic is this: Science and technology in the Philippines are often used for political purposes. There have been several cases where a person's freedom has been taken away because of their views on science or technology, usually by way of imprisonment. In other cases, people who advocate against GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) have received death threats. It is a well known fact that the Philippines has one of the highest numbers of imprisoned journalists in all of Asia and the Pacific. It also has one of the most corrupted government officials and politicians, as seen by their history. The Philippines is a country with many problems and contradictions. The Filipino people are very religious, yet they have one of the highest divorce rates in Asia. The people of the Philippines are very family oriented, yet they have a high rate of teenage pregnancy and divorce. They also have a higher than average number of single mothers raising children on their own. The Philippines is one of the most corrupt countries in Asia, yet they have had a very strong economy for years. This has been attributed to their workers' high levels of education. They are also known for being especially efficient when it comes to call centers and business. ",

            "answer_text": "You know what needs to be implimented innthe Philippines? A red tape reduction policy. When it takes 3 days & bribes to change the name on a vehicle registration, or you have to line up at 4am to apply for or renew a passort and it still takes all day to happen you know you have a problem with inefficient government processes. Streamlining government services would not only increase customer service but would also SAVE money for the government, and would cost very little to impliment. ",
