            "answer_text": "Pneumatic tools work by air pressure. This force is what causes the system to work; in other words, it is the power that drives the machine. Air pressure is provided by an air compressor. This machine has a gas-powered pump mechanism that continually forces air into a steel container tank until the air becomes pressurized. The pneumatic tool is hooked up to a hose that is attached to the tank via an air valve.
