            "answer_text": "Branding! Yes, seriously. Historically speaking, there was no clear transition from a protoscience called \u201calchemy\u201d to a modern science called \u201cchemistry\u201d. The name change was a deliberate - and successful - attempt made in the early 1700s to improve the social status of the discipline. The alchemists re-branded themselves, and now we call them \u201cchemists\u201d. It\u2019s true that in the era where the discipline was called \u201calchemy\u201d, alchemists\u2019 studies were infused with large doses of mysticism and philosophy and what many people today (especially scientists) would consider nonsense. However, that was true of all science, not just alchemy. Before the modern era, there was no sharp distinction between science and philosophy, or between science and religion. The study of the natural world was a part of philosophy. Those philosophers who focused on the aspects of philosophy that dealt with what we now call \u201cscience\u201d were known as \u201cnatural philosophers\u201d. While they may have focused their attention on the natural world, natural philosophers were still philosophers. They were educated in the concepts and writings of philosophy. They routinely used theological or philosophical arguments to support or reject theories about the natural world. What made alchemy different from other sciences is that it had not, traditionally, been afforded a lot of respect. Astronomy and physics and mathematics were the realm of the educated elite, people who chose to spend their time contemplating universal truths. They were pastimes for aristocrats and monks. Alchemy, on the other hand, was more associated with craft traditions. It required working with one\u2019s own hands. It was often smelly, and sometimes dangerous. On top of that, the promise - always just out of reach - of actually transmuting other metals into gold was so compelling that alchemy had long been associated with con artists. Not that alchemists were mostly frauds - a lot of them were serious people who were genuinely engaged in systematic study of chemical transformations. At the time there was no theoretical reason for them to believe that that couldn\u2019t include creating gold. It was the cold fusion research of its day: perpetually unsuccessful but too potentially important to abandon. Unfortunately, since even the most serious alchemists never succeeded in creating gold, that left plenty of room for lazy alchemists to pretend to try, and for con artists to pretend that they had succeeded. Alchemists of the 18th century wanted to distance themselves from that, so they lumped together all other chemical investigations and called the result \u201cchemistry\u201d, while re-defining \u201calchemy\u201d to refer only to attempts at creating gold. There was a purposes behind the specific manner in which alchemy changed its name, too. As readers interested in languages probably know already, the term \u201calchemy\u201d derives from Arabic. That\u2019s because for a period during the Middle Ages, the center of learning and culture in the Mediterranean world had shifted to the Islamic world. Because of that some fields, like alchemy or algebra, acquired Arabic-derived names, easily identified by the Arabic prefix al-, which is Arabic for \u201cthe\u201d. By adopting a new name derived directly from Greek roots, alchemists were engaged in the broader obsession with the ancient Greek and Roman world that was common in intellectuals of their era. They were emphasizing that chemistry, too, belonged among the respected intellectual disciplines that could trace their roots to the Classical world. So, with all that in mind, \u201calchemy\u201d is the study of chemicals and their properties up to the early 1700s, and \u201cchemistry\u201d is all the work on the same topic since then. That\u2019s the difference. Same field, one continuous history, with a name change. Before I finish, I suppose I should acknowledge that there is also what we might call \u201cmodern\u201d alchemy - people calling themselves alchemists long after the original alchemists changed their name. This alchemy originated in the 1800s during a period of great interest in spiritualism and the occult. By that time chemists had discarded the elements of mysticism in their studies, but mysticism was what some people in that era wanted. So, they dug up old alchemical texts and started reading them. Far from being heirs to the traditions of the alchemists, these people have revived old beliefs that the original alchemists themselves discarded as they became obsolete. Such \u201cmodern\u201d alchemists aren\u2019t engaged in the systematic study of chemical behavior, as alchemists through most of history were. That area of study has moved far past where it was a hundred years ago, and we call it chemistry. These few \u201calchemists\u201d today are simply engaged in various forms of mysticism, occult studies, and/or pseudoscience. ",

            "answer_text": "Alchemy is a so-called protoscience, meaning that it isn't actually science in the modern sense of the word, but it was an ancient tradition that established many important thoughts and conventions, like the use of procedures, equipment and terminology, that would ultimately form the paradigm of modern chemistry, which is the proper science that deals with matter and its transformations. The origins of alchemy spans thousands of years and multiple continents, and it was practiced by many cultures in their own form. Alchemy was similiar to chemistry in the sense that it was related to the study of the composition of matter and the transformations it undergoes, but its roots were firmly in the realms of the spiritual, the philosophical and the magical. Alchemists aimed to do things like creating elixirs of eternal life, and transforming base metals into precious gold and silver, which we today know is (practically speaking) impossible. Despite many of these futile pursuits, the early alchemists also attempted to establish a system for the identification and organization of different substances, which, while not always correct, ended up being a framework for the creation of the modern periodic table. So to sum up, alchemy was chemistry in its adolescence. Today, most alchemical concepts have been disregarded as untrue or pseodoscientific, but nonetheless its developments were crucial in establishing the science of chemistry. ",

What chemistry today fails to recognize is the spiritual component of chemistry. Alchemy is the all-chemistry of everything. From the creation of the universe to the creation of man, all is included in the Sacred Science of Alchemy. The principles of alchemy are freely available for study and quite easily demonstrable to the individual that is willing to take the time to learn and experiment and prove the precepts that are so well known at inner levels.

When a base, or common, metal such as lead was found, it was thought to simply be a spiritually and physically immature form of higher metals such as gold. To the alchemists, metals were not the unique substances that populate the Periodic Table, but instead the same thing in different stages of development or refinement on their way to spiritual perfection.  Alchemist: Someone Who Transforms Things for the Better. Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with compounds composed of atoms, i.e. elements, and molecules, i.e. combinations of atoms: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other compounds. The word chemistry comes from alchemy, which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine.  pic credits: Google ",

In the quest to turn base metals into gold, and to create a universal elixer, these alchemists would try many different combinations, and processes to achieve this goal. While it has not been recorded if anyone did find a way to make gold, what they did find was how to make a wide variety of chemicals, and materials. This was due to the careful note taking of the attempts and the outcomes. While it was far from what we would consider science today, it did set some of the standards for modern day chemistry. ",

In the second case Alchemy is actually the process of changing things with method, and it can be applied to anything, mostly it comes down to interpretation but the whole turning common metals to gold was an attempt at explaining in extremely concrete and down to earth words how alchemy works with the human soul, and the whole lead to gold thing is actually an allegory about enlightenment and becoming pure. I mean, how do you explain to medieval illiterate people to concept of enlightenment without sounding like a heretic? Interesting tidbit: Yoga apparently translates directly to Alchemy, but that is because eastern and western Alchemies focus on different semantics, as such i guess we could not translate Yoga literally to Alchemy\u2026but it is\u2026so\u2026toss semantics, right?
