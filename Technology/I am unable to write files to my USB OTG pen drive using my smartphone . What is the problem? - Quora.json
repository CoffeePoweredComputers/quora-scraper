            "answer_text": "Sorry to hear this problem. Try the following, 1. Go to settings>storage>unmount OTG, then mount the pen drive again. Now open file manager and try using pendrive. Follow the below steps too, 1. Connect the flash drive with OTG cable to the phone 2. Go to settings -> storage. 3. Click Mount SD card under \"USB Storage\" Also note the fact that, normally this is related to the drive being formatted in a file system that is not compatible with Android. Android appears to only like FAT32 while most USB drives are formatted with exFAT or NTFS. If your device is Rooted you can use Chainfire's Stick Mount from the Play Store which can access the device with virtually any format. Otherwise, you will need to find a way to format it with FAT32.  I had a 64GB dual USB OTG drive that would not work correctly until I was able to format in using (removed) to FAT32. Of course you will need access to a Rooted device to do this. Hope you understand the problem and fix it :) ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, this is happened sometimes when mount OTG with smartphones. This is caused by some reasons:   1. You may not mount your OTG properly with your phone. Please un mount and mount again.  2. Check in the settings whether it is connected or not.  3. Check  what version of USB your mobile support. If it supports only 2.0, then there is no use of  OTG version 3.0 4. Check the file system of your OTG device whether it is NTFS or FAT32. FAT32 is the basic file system & bluff - free. So if your OTG is in NTFS file system then change your file system to FAT32. 5. Still if it's not working, download & install apps related to OTG support or troubleshoot in Google Playstore. Hope it helps!! ",
