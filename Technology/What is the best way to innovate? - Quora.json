            "answer_text": "This answer was moved from a simpler question. Adapting the answer to the new version of the question: The best structured innovation approach is the simplest one that works. The question is simply how can I improve a product or process through some radical change in the approach. Finding the cause of any blockage to this discovery by using any of the structuring techniques is the essence of any approach. Why the TRIZ Group? is the website for Victor Fey\u2019s approach to planned innovation. His work on a technique call TRIZ was developed in Russia. Don Clausing, who had earlier spotted off shore techniques which could be usefully applied to USA engineering, noticed TRIZ and eventually wrote a book with Victor Fey. Effective Innovation: The Development of Winning Technologies, published by ASME Press in 2004 is the book. Clausing\u2019s other imports were The House of Quality and the Taguchi Method for testing. No small contributions to American Industry. I had the honor of providing early comments on the Effective Innovation draft. TRIZ may not work well with a lone practitioner, it was developed in the context of the Soviet Caspian Sea Flotilla. Its targeted projects might rival the Space Program in complexity and scope. Briefly the technique involves 40 principles of innovation. The results of fitting the principles to the challenge at hand is recorded in a Contradictions Matrix.  A number of TRIZ-based computer programs have been developed whose purpose is to provide assistance to engineers and inventors in finding inventive solutions for technological problems. Some of these programs are also designed to apply another TRIZ methodology whose purpose is to reveal and forecast emergency situations and to anticipate circumstances which could result in undesirable outcomes.

            "answer_text": "I was recently reading Creavity, Inc, the story of Pixar from the eyes of its co-founder Ed Catmull. I read this question just as I had finished reading this paragraph\u2026..  And it struck me that that paragraph very much encapsulates the process of innovation in my eyes. It starts with doing. When you innovate, you take a process or way things are done and you try and do it better. You don\u2019t know if it will work. If people knew your new way worked, they would have done it already! But you take that leap of faith and you test something. Most people you will meet in life are stuck in the idea phase. They have lots of great ideas. But they are never able to take the next step and turn it in to execution. So the first step to innovation is to realize that action, even if your plan is a bit unstructured, will always trump inaction. That being said, you always want to give yourself the best chance to succeed with anything you try. So make sure you understand the \u201cwhy\u201d around the current state of affairs.  Source: Ed Catmull Many people assume that they are brilliant and the way things are currently done is just because people are numb-skulls and like doing things sub-optimally. This is bad line of logic to take. Assume that processes and the ways things are done are for a purpose and then extrapolate why they might have missed the mark on certain pieces. Next, to innovate effectively you need a certain organizational culture. Employees need to be emboldened to debate leaders and challenge the status quo. Don\u2019t build a culture of yes-men. Make sure to always elevate the best ideas on their merit and throw hierarchy to the wind. Your goal as a leader is to innovate and change the world, not win arguments. Finally, be quick to pivot and change direction. Because our first principle of innovation was around action, it means sometimes you head down a path and realize it wasn\u2019t the right one. You need to change course. Innovators get comfortable with failure and pivoting. They don\u2019t drag it out until it magnifies. In business, having the foresight to adapt is one of the strongest predictors of success that you will find. So build a team of candid, creative, purpose-driven thinkers, with a culture of robust debate, and you will be on your way towards innovation. ",
