            "answer_text": "In the UK, BA and/or MA in Interior Design. You can easily do architecture too and then specialise in Interior Design while working (and you can\u2019t do the other way around - so if you\u2019re torn between the two, perhaps consider architecture). That might be useful if you want to do commercial or bigger projects too. Saying that, I know people with fashion degree (like Lee Broom whom I used to work for), art degrees or no degrees at all that have successful interior design careers. After the first 2 years in the industry, no one has ever asked me about a degree, but the degree might give you the skills, confidence, connections and platform to launch your career - it did for me. Hope this helps! ",
