            "answer_text": "What do you mean by \u201cthe old format of channels\u201d and \u201cAV and home\u201d? First, new TVs don\u2019t need set-top boxes as the digital receivers are built in. The boxes have a line-level output (via RCA, SCART or HDMI) to connect directly to the TV, and (for the better ones) an RF output which connects to the TV\u2019s aerial socket and is tuned in on a spare channel. If by \u201cthe old format of channels\u201d you mean the channel numbers used by the various TV stations, this is retained for the convenience of the viewers. Digital channel numbers - correctly called Logical Channel Numbers or LCN - can in fact be anything, as they are only significant to the box (and the viewer). The LCN is unrelated to the broadcast frequency. ",
