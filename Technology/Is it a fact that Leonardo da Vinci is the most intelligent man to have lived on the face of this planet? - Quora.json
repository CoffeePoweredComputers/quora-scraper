            "answer_text": "It depends entirely on how you define intelligence. The Middle Ages was topped off by Thomas Aquinas who was the great compromiser with church doctrinal teachings and thereby opened up much of what we consider to be the liberal arts and sciences to free investigation. So were it not for Aquinas, people like da Vinci, and Galileo, and more modern geniuses like Einstein would have spent their lives being told that the things they most loved to explore and think about were sinful and forbidden. There are a couple other biggies like that, (like Newton), but Leonardo is the lead horse by far when we look for candidates for the BROADEST intellect in modern western history at least. But let\u2019s not leave out Lao Tsu in China, and Maimonides, and any of the great scientific geniuses during the later centuries from anywhere else in the world. But if you are looking for a \u201cMan for all Seasons,\u201d then he\u2019s your top dog alright! He is our model for what we mean when we say, \u201cRenaissance Man\u201d. He spent his life trying to learn something about everything! That was the ideal during the time in which he lived. Most people think that Michaelangelo was the greatest sculptor who ever lived, and perhaps Titian or another of the fabulously talented Renaissance painters was the greatest one of them all. But Leonardo was the only one in all of those horse races who finished as a win, place, or at least a show. In a word, he wasn\u2019t just a genius, he was an omnigenius. And there haven\u2019t been that many of those who didn\u2019t end up being forced to drink the Kool Aid \u2014 like Socrates, for example. Once you start down that road, it\u2019s a lot like trying to figure out who should be crowned Miss America, or Miss Universe, or Miss World! Or who\u2019s picture should end up on the magazine cover after being designated the sexiest man alive. ",

            "answer_text": "It is unfair to rank talent and creativity as they are really subjective. Leonardo da Vinci is one of the most diversely talented individuals that I know of in the history of humankind. Here are some facts that prove the same: Born in 1452 in the Tuscan village of Vinci, Leonardo was the epitome of the \u201cRenaissance man\u201d.From the humblest of beginnings he became the period\u2019s most famous artist, creating masterpieces including The Last Supper, The Vituvian Man and the Mona Lisa \u2013 perhaps the most celebrated painting in history. Fewer than 20 of his paintings have survived, just a fraction of his output.Leonardo was more than an artist: he was a scientist, mathematician, inventor and biologist, making substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, optics and hydrodynamics.He conceptualized flying machines, a type of armored fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, an adding machine, and the double hull, also outlining a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics.Leonardo's fame within his own lifetime was such that the King of France carried him away like a trophy, and was claimed to have supported him in his old age and held him in his arms as he died. Interest in Leonardo and his work has never diminished. Crowds still queue to see his best-known artworks, T-shirts still bear his most famous drawing, and writers continue to hail him as a genius while speculating about his private life, as well as about what one so intelligent actually believed in.Here are some of the popular stills of his great work (still present): It is Mona Lisa. In the present era it is arguably the most famous painting in the world. Its fame rests, in particular, on the elusive smile on the woman's face, its mysterious quality brought about perhaps by the fact that the artist has subtly shadowed the corners of the mouth and eyes so that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined.
