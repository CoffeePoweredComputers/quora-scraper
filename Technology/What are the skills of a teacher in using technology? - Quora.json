            "answer_text": "I was part of an iPad pilot program at my middle school while I was still a teacher. I went on to teach various Humanities subjects on iPads for three years. I really enjoyed the opportunities to engage students in a language native to them (tech) and challenge them with projects and assignments using new resources. I also benefitted from a vast reduction in paper usage/collection/storage. Some general tips I can give you are: Teach from the back of the class. When the screens are up, you have to be placed such that you can see each screen. Sit in the back to lecture/demonstrate on your device, and also circulate while students work independently. The worst thing you can do is sit at the front. If there\u2019s the slightest opportunity for them to go do something else on their devices, they will absolutely take it. I used a school-issued iPad or sometimes my iPhone on AirPlay to lead class notes, show videos, etc. My laptop (receiving the signal) was hooked up to the classroom projector. Hopefully your school is outfitting you with the necessary tools.Be very strict about your turn-in policy. When you turn in assignments digitally, everything is timestamped. It\u2019s up to you to hold students accountable. Obviously, there\u2019s a learning curve here, and you might have to ease them into the routine if it\u2019s new, but after they\u2019re acquainted, be consistent in your expectations and what results they can expect.Take advantage of the various apps and websites you can now use. I\u2019m a huge fan of Turnitin. Kahoot! was popular in my classes and great for test reviews. My school piloted Canvas as a learning management system (LMS). I used Google Drive (and Docs, Slides, Forms, etc.) extensively, since the school had their employee and student email accounts through Google; this allowed for keeping myself organized and teaching the students to organize themselves. I used ClipGrab to download and keep educational YouTube videos. Apps I used regularly were tools like Prezi, Quizlet, and Notability. I had students make videos at home for public speaking and Greco-Roman mythology projects. There are so many options. Find what works for your curriculum and what\u2019s feasible for your students.Don\u2019t get rid of paper. When I left teaching, there was still no good method of administering digital assessments. All my tests and quizzes were still on paper. And about one third of my teenage students still preferred to take notes on paper. Paper notes and digital notes each have their advantages and disadvantages. I\u2019m not in favor of discarding what works just so you can update to tech. I still assigned projects like making Greek theater masks and mosaics, and the students enjoyed them.Digital curriculum is still evolving to the standard of print. When we first switched to iPads at my middle school, a lot of courses had inferior textbooks (because they had to find an online or downloadable textbook). If this happens to you, use print books and educational websites to supplement your material. Hopefully publishers are working on making better material available.In closing, be willing to experiment, do a ton of online research, and let the students teach you a thing or two sometimes. I loved using more tech in my teaching. It made my students put in more effort and allowed me to grade essays off my iPad. ",
