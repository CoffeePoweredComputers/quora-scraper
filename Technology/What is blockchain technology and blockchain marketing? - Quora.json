            "answer_text": "In simple words, a blockchain is a decentralized distributed digital ledger, that is, a database across several nodes or computing devices. Each verified transaction (data exchange) is stored into units known as blocks. Each block contains the transaction data, a timestamp, and the cryptographic hash of its preceding block. Rather than relying on a centralized system, a blockchain uses a Peer to Peer (P2P) network to store data at multiple locations. Each location is called a node, and it stores a copy of the data right from the genesis block. Every time a new record is added in the database, it automatically gets updated across all nodes on the network. The transactions are verified by users on the network by solving a math problem. Once the block is verified, it gets added to the chain of existing blocks. A verified block can\u2019t be edited, and this is where the immutability aspect of the blockchain comes into the picture. Why Blockchain in Marketing? To understand how blockchain will change the marketing landscape, let\u2019s look at the three fundamental reasons why blockchain is rapidly gaining widespread adoption: 1. Decentralization In a centralized or client-server model, there\u2019s one (or more) entity known as the server that hosts all the information, and you (the client) must communicate with the server to gain access to the information. For example, if you need to send money to someone via the internet, you need to do so by going through a middleman such as a bank. Along with the addition of a middleman, the centralized model is susceptible to many threats such as data leaks. On the other hand, a P2P network is decentralized. There\u2019s no single host of the information. In fact, as seen earlier, every node in the network stores the information locally. So, if you want to send money to someone, you can do so directly without routing it through a middleman. 2. Immutability The second aspect is security through the immutability of records. Once a block is verified, the data stored in it can\u2019t be altered. Even if someone tries to deceive a block in the blockchain, it will significantly change the data along with the hash of its previous blocks. Since the whole blockchain has now changed, it can\u2019t be verified with any other node. Anyone trying to hack into the blockchain needs to alter records at every node, which is practically impossible. 3. Transparency Since blockchain is a distributed digital ledger, all users in the blockchain have access to the transactions that have taken place. While this aspect might raise some eyebrows, there\u2019s no need to do so because although the transactions are available to the blockchain users, the identity of users remains concealed. 4 Benefits of Blockchain in Marketing We just looked at the strategies brands can use with blockchain-based products in their marketing activities. Here are four ways your marketing campaigns can benefit from blockchain technology. 1. Reduced Costs Since blockchain is a decentralized, peer-to-peer technology, you can cut down an enormous amount of costs right off the bat. The main reason is you are essentially removing third parties from the equation. Ad networks are notorious for burning a hole in advertisers\u2019 pockets in the name of fees or profit cuts. The inclusion of smart contracts ensures that you\u2019re paying only if the terms of the agreement are met. This enables brands to deal directly with publishers, freelancers, external vendors or users and pay them without relying on the middlemen. And although blockchain may incur some infrastructure costs, the transaction costs are almost nil. 2. Audience Targeting As a marketer, it is disappointing to see the terrible results of your marketing campaigns. The ad copy, visual creative, ad format, target audience, everything was well thought out, but it just didn\u2019t work. By decentralizing the advertising ecosystem, brands can directly connect with the right publishers and take their message to the right audience. Additionally, since users get paid for viewing ads, brands can be assured that they\u2019ll get the most bang for their buck. 3. Increased Efficiency Activities that involve paperwork tend to be time-consuming and tedious. Take invoice processing, for example. Once you raise an invoice, you need to wait for the payment. Furthermore, the involvement of a middleman delays the payment release. Blockchain tackles this problem by enabling transactions to take place in real time. Since the information is accessible to both the parties, it is not necessary to maintain separate records. Again, the implementation of smart contracts facilitates immediate payment as soon as the terms in the agreement are met. 4. Decentralized Applications When it comes to traditional mobile apps, the rules are dictated by the Play Store or App Store. The same goes for any platform that has a single authority that controls the entire platform. Since no single authority governs decentralized apps, there is no my way or the highway approach. We saw how Steem enables brands to create apps and provides them with an opportunity to monetize and build a community. Similarly, Ethereum, EOS, NEO, Tron, Cardano, etc. are some platforms that enable you to build apps on their platforms. The absence of a single authority allows you to connect with your target audience directly. ",
