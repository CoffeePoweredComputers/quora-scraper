            "answer_text": "1950? Try 1975. The Cray-1 supercomputer took 115 kilowatts to run\u2026 and about as much again to run its cooling system. It ran a 64-bit processor at 80 MHz, performing 160 million floating-point operations per second. It had 8 megabytes of memory, and 303 megabytes of storage, and cost around eight million dollars. Meanwhile, I have a Raspberry Pi 4, with a quad-core 64-bit processor running at 1.5 GHz, performing 13.5 GFLOPS, with 4 GB of memory and 32 GB of storage. It cost about $90 at Best Buy. It takes less than 15.3 watts (that\u2019s the most its power supply can put out) and needs no cooling. So, the Pi has greater performance\u2026 and uses about 1/15,000th as much power. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you compare. If you adjust to computing performance then there is nothing that matches the 1950s computers. The slowest computer or smart phone is thousands of times more powerful if not millions so that comparison makes no sense. If you then compare high end computers to high end computers then modern super computers are very power hungry. For example Chinese Tianhe-1a which was the fastest super computer ten years ago used four megawatts. I do not know if this includes cooling. The Eniac which is generally regarded as the first computer and which was in use in 1950 used 160 kilowatts so a modern top computer uses some 30 times more power. ",
