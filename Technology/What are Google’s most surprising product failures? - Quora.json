            "answer_text": "I had high hopes for G+. Years ago when the dust started to settle and we could see who was left standing I did my very best to squint and hope I was not seeing how things played out.  I was in Japan, so I had to listen to how and why Mixi was better than anything the United States had (Which is ironic, go look who owns Mixi now), and I was making plans for a few months I would be in Chengdu & Beijing. What that meant, was that I had to hear about QQ, Weibo, Taobao, Baidu, Chairman Mao, 1.3 (or 1.4) Billion people and 5,000 years of recorded history and achievement\u2026in comparison to a few hundred for the United States. I don\u2019t know why, but they always smiled when they told me that, it was weird. So, because I was in a marketing department at the time, I took a little initiative and did my due diligence so I could at least give the illusion of making an informed decision. In all honesty, all of these are wonderful, so I mean no offense.. Facebook was too social for me. & Twitter looked like ADHD + Crystal Meth To be honest, I don\u2019t think G+ ever got close to being a Facebook wannabe. G+ was way more confusing than it needed to be. It\u2019s really so confusing that it\u2019s hard to imagine that it accidentally became confusing, because being that confusing takes some effort and planning. To me, this is like when people sit around looking at each other, and nobody wants to be the bad guy and point out that someone in the room forgot to put their pants on. Everyone just shakes their heads with confused faces while staring at the wall or ceiling. I have several G+ emails from when I was setting up various business pages and needed to contact G+ support with a few questions. I sometimes had to correct them when they told me to \u201cOpen Google Video\u201d, I have other Q&A\u2019s with G+ customer support, where I asked them about the requirements for obtaining a custom or vanity URL. I posted on Digitalpoint exactly what the G+ CS said without really thinking, and a moderator on DP told me that ding what the G+ CS said could be considered a violation of the Google Webmaster Guidelines, so I quickly reversed course on that. This is one of a few conversations with G+ CS.[1] I have never once had to contact customer support\u2026.for any other social media services, only G+. The momentum they had is mind-blowing to think about.[2] I really loved thinking that I had a ticket around the \u201csocial\u201d part of social media with G+. It\u2019s fun to listen or read when Matt Cutts explains just how left-brained Google is. The underscores are interesting, the reasoning of why the underscores vs dashes is so simple. That is what I loved to expect from them, because I always knew these guys & gals had a NO-BS route to awesome, I just wish they would have put G+ on those same train tracks. So, as it stands social media is changing so many things\u2026.  Footnotes[1] G+ CS for Businesses & Organizations[2] It's like swimming, the first one out and back wins.",

            "answer_text": "5 Google Products That Failed and What Startups Can Learn From It It\u2019s hard to imagine that a company with lots of resources can fail. With an estimated 172 million uniques every month to their homepage, Google can (and often do) promote their products. To put it into perspective, advertisers paid an estimated $3.5 million for a 30 second spot in Super Bowl XLVI, which got 111.3 million pairs of eyeballs. So how can any of their products possibly fail? In this post i\u2019ll lay out five products Google made that have flopped. The ones I\u2019ve included here have officially been discontinued by Google. I\u2019ll also give my opinion as to why they failed, and what we can learn from them. Google Video Player  It would be unfair to call Google Video a failure. Google Video launched in late January 2005 and 22 months later Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion, prompting some to call it a bad acquisition. Now YouTube may be worth $45.7 billion. Any video you want to find on Google Video can be found on YouTube, all the videos have transferred over. So Google Video is not necessarily a failure, but Google Video Player failed. It was kept around for 10 months after the YouTube acquisition, and then discontinued. It lasted two years in total. What Startups Can Learn From It: Google Video wasn\u2019t a bad concept. It allowed people to download videos from Google Video and watch videos in full screen, something a little more difficult back in 2007. The problem was that nobody needed another video player. It was a nice to have, instead of something that people needed. Bottom line: it didn\u2019t solve any problems. Google Buzz  Google Buzz was essentially Google\u2019s clone to Twitter. It integrated right into Gmail and allowed users to posts links, photos, status updates and videos. Generally Google doesn\u2019t do well if they\u2019re not first to market, and this was one of those products. Google Buzz lasted 22 months. What Startups Can Learn From It: There wasn\u2019t any major improvement over Twitter. The Buzz interface was more crowded, didn\u2019t have a character limit and had major privacy concerns from the very beginning. People had no reason to move from Twitter to Buzz and it didn\u2019t have enough advantage over Twitter. Simply integrating Buzz into Gmail wasn\u2019t enough. The privacy concerns surrounding Buzz and Gmail didn\u2019t help. While Google did address these concerns, the lack of competitive advantage over Twitter lead to low user adoption, forcing Google to shut down Buzz. Google Answers  The Google Answers concept is good \u2013 a user pays a researcher for an answer to a question they have, the researcher gets paid and Google gets a cut of it. It works for all parties. It seemed, however, that most people chose to ask their questions on forums or Yahoo! Answers, opting for the free route and trusting that the responses are valid. With the addition of Quora, where users select the response that they find most valid and sufficient, it makes it difficult to give a person a reason to pay for an answer. While Yahoo! Answers appears more like a teenage chat room and declines in traffic, people are turning to search, Quora (early adopters) and asking friends on Facebook\u2014all for free. Google Answers lasted 4 years and 8 months. What Startups Can Learn From It: If there are alternatives to your product that are free, you may have a difficult time getting traction. If it\u2019s possible for a company to profitably offer a product similar to yours for free, you may be in deep water. Any successful company will get a competitor that will undercut your prices. Google Answers faced a free competitor like Yahoo! Answers, forums and even Google search itself, all of which are free. Most people don\u2019t want to pay if they don\u2019t have to. It may be helpful to offer a freemium service. Google Notebook  As an avid note taker, I was thrilled when Google began offering Google Notebook. I wasn\u2019t happy with the outdated Microsoft Notepad. I was using Yahoo! Notepad and found Google Notebook to be a downgrade. The design was a major disappointment and I found it much more difficult to use. Google did offer a few features such as clipping of web pages with a browser extension and the sharing of notes. It\u2019s tough to say how popular a note taking application could have gotten. Google made a smooth transition from Notebook into the now popular Google Docs. Google Notebook lasted 5 years and 4 months. What Startups Can Learn From It: Why is Google Notebook a failure while Evernote is a success? Evernote has had consistent growth in traffic due to their support of multiple platforms-much like Dropbox. You can access your notes from almost any device. Additionally, Evernote\u2019s interface is much more user friendly. They also allow for voice recordings. They\u2019ve streamlined nicely with the rise of smart phones and tablets. Evernote filled a need that people had. Operating System apps like Windows Notepad or Apple Notes couldn\u2019t sync to any device. Windows Notepad or Google Notebook is great if you\u2019re only by your computer all the time. Most people aren\u2019t anymore and need to access their notes from anywhere. Evernote has taken that problem and many others and is now profiting from it. Google Notebook wasn\u2019t a bad concept; it just didn\u2019t go far enough in helping the user in their day-to-day life. Google Wave  It\u2019s tough to explain in a sentence what Google Wave was. Google explained it as \u201cA wave is a live, shared space on the web where people can discuss and work together using richly formatted text, photos, videos, maps, and more.\u201d One of Wave\u2019s developers said, \u201cWave is what email would look like if it were invented today.\u201d Google had high hopes for Wave, but it failed to cross the chasm. Google Wave lasted 15 months. What Startups Can Learn From It: Wave didn\u2019t launch as an MVP. It was filled with lots of features that Google assumed people wanted. It was a complex product that required an investment of a user\u2019s time just to understand how it works. Hyped launches do not matter, and it some cases can be a detriment to the product. For almost any business, it\u2019s better to start small and launch as an MVP. Wave might have worked for the tech crowd, but beyond that it left users with a collective yawn. ",
