            "answer_text": "I would suggest as a rule of thumb go for the payment gateway that has an office in your country. That way the service has to comply with local laws and if the service blocks your account without reason you can always take the legal route to recover your money. From my experience, I would not ever recommend 2CheckOut to anyone in India. 2CheckOut has blocked my company account from India without assigning a reason, that too with cash still stuck with them which they obviously pocketed. They also did not offer any way to communicate with them to understand why they blocked account access inspite of not being in the prohibited business list, following all their rules, and running a legit business. Since they do not have an office or company in India there was no other way of reaching out to them or recovering money stuck in the account. I have worked with PayPal personal account for 19 years, and my company has had a PayPal business account for 6 years. PayPal is a registered company in India, follows the directives laid down by the RBI, and their support team has always been accessible. ",
