            "answer_text": "In pure number of positions, no. But if we look at the long term effect, we might be surprised how close the numbers are. Here is a made up example. A manufacturer buys a piece of technology that replaces 5 workers. First if all, someone has to run the technology. So it is only 4 workers, net. And the technician probably makes more.Someone has to train the technician.Someone has to service the equipment.Someone has to install the equipment.Someone has to sell it.Someone else delivered it.Someone invented it, designed it and designed specific consumable supplies for it.Some loan officer financed it.It was made by 5 guys at some other factory.So this piece of equipment was actually part of dozens of other jobs. The initial loss of employment is easy to see, but unless we have a depression or population decrease, the net results may be close to zero. The key to this is for us to increase technological education. ",

            "answer_text": "Global population was just around one billion, in the year 1800, when the Industrial revolution was in full swing. The machines destroyed many farming jobs and many artisans. But it created dozens more. Those machines do not run on their own. They need repairmen, operators, and entire supply chains to function and be built. There is going to be eight billion of us in give or take two years. And most of those people have jobs. I remember seeing a graphic on the job market. How most children in elementary school will work in jobs that don\u2019t exist yet.  There it is So, yes\u2026 Technology, by simple numbers, creates more jobs than it destroys. ",
