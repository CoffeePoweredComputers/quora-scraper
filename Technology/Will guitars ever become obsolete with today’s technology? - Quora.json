            "answer_text": "Wow..that is kind of scary and I hope it would not happen, ever (lol). Anyway, technology these days are fantastic. We have groundbreaking music softwares today which literally can replace the actual musicians by punching in either a midi keyboard or simply with your own computer keyboard yes. Then, there are also softwares which require you to just moving the cursor and several clicks later you have yourself a polished instrument track; from guitars to drums, to pianos, to trumpets and everything else. I believe that the guitar will not become obsolete (as with other musical instruments) because playing and learning the actual instruments is another experience altogether. As with myself, the main reason I picked up the guitar was pretty much a choice which comes from deep within. I fell in love with rock n\u2019 roll and felt that the guitar is the voice of the genre; a symbolic thing. I believe that there are many others in the world shared the same feeling. Moreover, having an electric guitar strapped onto your shoulder is just so cool! Nothing beats the satisfaction of playing an actual guitar compared to something else designed mainly to imitates the real thing; even with the best technology available today or in the future to come, unlikely. I have this phrase all the time, \u201cYou don\u2019t choose to love the guitar, it chose you!\u201d Hope I did provide a decent explanation to this question. ",
