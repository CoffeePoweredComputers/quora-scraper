            "answer_text": "Well this can be three things. Either your system has a leak and low on refrigerant, the thermostat is stuck, or it is maxed out. Believe it or not if it is maxed out it is operating at its peak efficiency. So if it is keeping you comfortable it doing the best it can do. Your best indicator is the temperature. If it is holding a certain temperature with little change it is probably maxed out. Systems are designed to maintain temperature in an average heat condition for your climate zone. When the heat exceeds this average you will find it stays on during that high heat condition. It simply wasn\u2019t designed for these brief temperature anomalies. But even when this happens you normally will be comfortable and not heated because you get excellent humidity control when it is on. ",

            "answer_text": "What happens if the air conditioner never turns off ? Two possibilities. 1. The air conditioner is undersized and unable to remove enough heat to satisfy the thermostat. If this is the case, you need to add more air conditioning, or set your thermostat higher so eventually it will turn off at a higher temperature while still providing some cooling. 2. The thermostat is defective. In this case, the air conditioner cools down to the setpoint and continues to cool until you turn it off manually. ",
