The iPhone should start, show the Apple, then a USB cable on the screen which means \u201cconnect to iTunes;\u201dRelease the button. On iTunes, you should see \u201ciPhone detected in recovery mode - Restore or Update.\u201d Click on Update.iTunes will now download the latest iOS version for your iPhone and install it on your iPhone. Depending on the speed of your internet connection, this may take anything from 10 minutes to a few hours.Once updated, the iPhone MAY give you the option to enter your passcode one time. Possibly after a 60 minutes countdown. If not, and it is still disabled, repeat from the beginning; except at step 5, choose \u201cRestore.\u201d And now the iOS firmware is already available on your computer so it will not be downloaded again. The device this time will restart without requesting the passcode but will be completely wiped clean of all data.If you have a previous iCloud or iTunes back-up of your device, you can now restore it to the device after step 7.If you don\u2019t remember your passcode, simply follow the same steps and choose \u201cRestore\u201d in step 5.
