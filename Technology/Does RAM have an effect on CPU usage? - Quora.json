            "answer_text": "I'm not up to date on how the latest computer hardware is designed, so this may no longer be 100% accurate. But here's how it worked when I learned it. To optimize performance, CPUs have cache memory, essentially hyperfast RAM built right into the CPU itself. The purpose of the cache is to keep a running list of the most relevant data on hand to minimize reading from the slower computer RAM. The L1 cache is the right there with the processor. Any time the CPU can execute an instruction using the data in the L1 cache, you get a big performance boost. L1 cache costs a lot of money, so it's really, really small. To increase the size of the cache while keeping performance high and costs reasonable, CPUs have multiple levels of cache memory, each one sightly larger and slower than the last. In simple processors, there's just one more layer called the L2 cache. Another component in the CPU has the sole purpose of moving data between L1 and L2. It's trying to maximize the number of reads from L1 and keep data that it thinks might be read again later in L2. RAM plays into this because the data in the caches comes from what's available in RAM. Just as it's trying to optimize what to keep in L1 vs. in L2, the CPU has to decide what the bring into the cache and what to just leave in RAM. So, the read speed of your RAM determines two things. First, it dictates how fast your CPU can load data into its cache if it decides it's worth loading. Second, it sets how much of a performance drop happens when the CPU is forced to read from RAM instead of from its cache. If your RAM is really slow, then your cache is going to take a big performance hit whenever it encounters new data not in the cache that will likely be needed again soon. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s use an analogy: Imagine you asked me to hang a few pictures on your wall. You will need to point me out where you want each pictured placed (the instructions), and I\u2019ll need to get each picture in order to hang them (the data). Now I ask you: no matter how quickly I\u2019m able to hang a single picture on a wall, in which of the two following situations do you think the pictures will be all placed and the whole task will be finished first? Situation 1: the pictures are all stored in a box in another room. I must (for some reason) take them one by one, going back and forth all the way to said room. You, on the other hand, is on a third room, sending me your instructions through some videochat app, using a crappy Wi-Fi internet. Situation 2: you kindly took the box of pictures out of the other room, placed them beside me, and, while pointing out each desired spot in person, hands me each picture in a orderly fashion. \u2014\u2014\u2014 I hope you see how Situation 2 greatly increased my performance in the task of hanging pictures on walls. Well, that\u2019s exactly what RAM accomplishes with the CPU. The processor needs instructions and data to perform its tasks, and no matter how fast it can internally compute sums or logical operations, if he needs to fetch those bits from \u201canother room\u201d (say, a hard disk or any slowish device), its performance will be greatly affected.
