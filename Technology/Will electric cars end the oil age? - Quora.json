As others mentioned, there will always be plastics and other things to make as well. We have enough oil alone in the oil sands in Canada to switch off imports in North America for sonething like 300 years, and we aren't looking at much beyond 450\u2013600. We won't run out in time before humanities demise. This years marks another in a consecutive series America's exports of oil were greater than it's imports. The whole world isn't going to magically turn into a Tesla factory with trees on top. There will always be gas powered engines, generators, and things like this, unless we totally enslave ourselves to learning and adapting new processes likely not to occur before the wells run dry, if they do.

            "answer_text": "Will electric cars end the oil age? If we can only convince American Big Oil that\u2019s not the case. . . The answer is no, anyway. It may end the burning of it aspects eventually, at least as fuel for transportation, but nothing else really. There are so many good things we can do with petroleum; all we need to do is stop burning it. And if you are a petroleum exporter or producer then you need to follow Saudi Arabia\u2019s lead. The Saudis have always been pragmatic about their resource to know that contrary to how some of their regional and global peers are handling their resources and how some consumers consume them as if there\u2019s an endless supply, it won\u2019t last forever and it\u2019s killing the environment if not the planet itself. They too wish for a greener future. So the Saudis are investing their wealth to find other ways and industries to maximize their liquid product that does the least damage to the environment. This is one of the reasons lately why of all people, the Saudis are trying to find their way in the eco self-consciousness of climate change, and why they are trying to stake a claim in the electromobility industry. This is why you\u2019ll find them either as individual or fund investors or even as board members of car companies like Lucid, Faraday, Nio, even Tesla. People want to be remembered not for their responsibility in damaging the environment, but what they did to help it and preserve it. I believe the Saudis are attempting to exercise leadership in trying to help the environment, keenly aware of where they are that participated in destroying it. That\u2019s not an easy thing to do. There are no angels in the Industrial Revolution. But it\u2019s much easier to just sell the oil and do nothing. As we commit ourselves to electromobiity to already see unusual electric cars of different shapes, styles, and designs coming out, we also must commit ourselves to making these vehicles lighter so that they can retain and use energy more effectively. This is where the Saudis, petroleum, and the plastics industry will become awfully handy to help us with sustainable energy. Contrary to what environmental activists will tell you, and unfortunately, we still need the oil industry for sustainable energy. I agree with them that we shouldn\u2019t be burning it anymore. So I\u2019m afraid we are not done with oil. We are going to need every drop we can spare. In fact, if we can find a way to suck up all that plastic we\u2019re feeding the wild life in the oceans to make that an industry, that would help the cause. These electric cars are currently designed like gasoline ones and are too heavy. We need light weight durable high impact plastic to replace key parts and components to retain their safety margins, but make them even more efficient at using energy. By doing this we can build electric cars that can withstand a collision but give us more range by carrying less weight. I really don\u2019t think Big Oil realizes this, as they throw lobbyists at Washington trying to stop electromobility while there is money to be made for them in the emerging growth industry of high tech plastics. If orange is the new black, then the petroleum industry is the new steel industry. The concept of the oil tycoon is not dead yet for the 21st century. In fact what\u2019s needed here is a plastics tycoon who can manufacture the stuff that\u2019s as strong as concrete and on the cheap. And as much as I\u2019ve embraced eco-consciousness, until there are more efficient ways to stay warm, I don't want to go freezing when I\u2019m cold. But we better worry first about it getting way too hot. As soon as we resolve the issue of the burning of it to get somewhere, I\u2019m sure our greatest minds will work on better ways to stay warm. If it\u2019s not too late by then . . . I hope this answers your question. ",

            "answer_text": "Electric cars will not end the oil age. The only thing that will end the oil age is changed human behavior on a grand scale. Electric cars are one of the options to enable a shift in the mode of transportation. It's only a small part of what would need to happen to end the oil age. And it does not matter if you are thinking that climate change is real or not. The one thing that is very real is that we (as the human race) are exhausting the resources on our home world at an alarming pace.  No matter what you look at: metals, water, oil, breathable air, food, fertile soil to name a few. Once we, as a collective, as a race understand that we are destroying or basis of existence, then you have the starting point for a shift in behavior in the grand scale we need. Then there is a chance for prolonged human existence. The electric car will not end the oil age. But the idea the electric car is being associated with and folks making decisions because of the context might be big enough that the oil age goes extinct as collateral damage. (I intentionally disregarded the option of expanding into space for this question)  ",

            "answer_text": "Charles, I work in Oil and Gas and I ponder the question as well. I haven\u2019t done much research on this yet, but one of the things that I believe a lot of people at the moment think is that by driving an electric car they are reducing the amount of oil used, which I guess is correct, but it is not necessarily reducing the usage of fossil fuels because a lot of the electricity being used to power the electric cars is generated by coal and I\u2019m not sure that is a positive outcome. The major benefit at the moment is that pollution is removed from urban areas (and wherever else) where cars are converted to electric motors. Personally I believe that coal should be phased out with natural gas at least as a transitional fuel until all electricity can be generated fossil-free and who long that will take is a question that I\u2019d like to understand the answer to. So electric cars will reduce the usage of oil, but there are so many other areas where oil, currently, is critical. For instance in the production of plastics, jet fuel, bitumen and many other areas. I think that people underestimate their reliance on fossil fuels and how we will transition from them. Despite being in the oil and gas industry I\u2019ve long held the belief that we abuse the abundant supply of our resources and should be looking to minimise and replace the usage of them. One area that also makes me wonder about the longevity of oil is the war machine because a lot of oil is required to power tanks, jets etc. etc. and I don\u2019t see countries giving up on oil just yet as that is something that requires a lot of oil. I\u2019m just putting some thoughts out there and just like you I wonder what will end the oil age, sadly I think it will take longer than it should because we are as a creature generally selfish and concerned too much about our own convenience, for instance driving cars instead of walking, using central heating to hear the entire house instead of putting on an extra layer of clothing and airconditioning our houses and cars so that we don\u2019t sweat. I recall as a kid we used to sweat out the summers, but now I can\u2019t imagine a life without air-conditioning having become so used to it. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question or muddies the water or even helps as I think it turned into a ramble of questions that I have as well. Cheers Anastasis ",

            "answer_text": "No, not even close to killing the oil industry, because hydrocarbons will still be needed for jet fuel, long distance railroads,  long haul trucks, bulldozers, ocean going ships, and other transportation.  Oil and gas are also needed for plastics and fertilizer. The wide adoption of electric vehicles over the next 20-30 yearswill eventually cut oil demand by 60 to 80 percent, however,  which will cause the price of oil to stay low compared to price of five years ago, when oil was over $120 USD ( in 2011. Dollars). Oil will still remain an important industry, but it will be much harder to base an entire  nation's economy on oil, as Venezuela and a number of nations around the Persian Gulf did.   Electric cars will represent the vast majority of vehicle kilometers driven is most developed nations, but people and businesses will still have gasoline, diesel and hybrid vehicles, such as heavy trucks, off road vehicles, agricultural harvesters, construction equipment, vans, and buses.  People who live in remote or mountain areas where the electrical power is expensive or fails frequently will also continue without pure electric vehicles.  And I expect that people who take long trips which may occur at the same time as major holidays will also avoid pure electric vehicles, because charging stations on freeways will tend to saturate on holidays.  If we look at these technology trends from the viewpoint of a nation like Venezuela, then Electrification will effectively kill off the oil industry as a major source of nation wealth. ",

The thing is, end of use of gasoline in no way means end of oil use.  Oil fuels not just cars. Oil is burned to produce electricity, heat homes, move ships and airplanes.  Electricity production can be switched to other means, and heat can be changed to electric, but a battery that could power a freighter across an ocean is a long way off. Electric airplanes also aren't quite there, mostly because of batteries being heavy.  At any rate, even if all use of oil as fuel stopped, there will still be all the other stuff oil does.  What are the products and uses of petroleum?  It is true that for now we burn a lot if it. However, there is also \"asphalt and road oil, and the feedstocks used to make chemicals, plastics, and synthetic materials found in nearly everything we use today\".  Asphalt - that would be the roads those electric cars drive on.  Plastics and synthetic materials - that's tires, body panels, battery casings.    So, no. Electric cars alone will not end the oil age.  ",

            "answer_text": "I think it's reasonable to expect a shift away from oil wherever electricity can be substituted at a competitive cost. Bear in mind, though, that as people start to replace oil as a fuel source, the price of oil will fall which will in turn encourage more consumption. It seems like a paradox, but it's basic economics... when the price of a good falls, demand rises. Oil will find a new equilibrium, less expensive but possibly in no less demand at the new price. If oil becomes much cheaper, people will want to use more of it. Maybe more oil-burning home heaters, maybe more diesel powered trains, or gasoline-powered cars in areas of the world where electricity is expensive. It is not inconceivable that we'll burn oil to power our electricity plants to power our electric cars. (Bear in mind that electricity is a form of energy, not a source. The energy still has to come from somewhere.) Oil is an energy source, and this planet is always looking for more energy. Somebody will figure out a use for it. That's not to say the \"oil economy\" won't change. Oil producers will be expected to continue to produce oil (a progressively more expensive undertaking as time goes on) for less money. Basic economics says that this will continue until the cost of pulling a gallon of oil from the ground is more than the price the producer can sell it for. Until then, nobody's going to let oil sit in the ground if they can dig it up and sell it for a profit. ",

            "answer_text": "Even if all gasoline consuming ICE autos were to vanish tomorrow, only about half a barrel of oil of each barrel produced is used to make gasoline. That would leave half of 90 million barrels consumed per day, or about 45 million barrels per day, still being used for jet fuel, heating oil, fuel oil, diesel fuel, lubricants, and chemicals (including plastics). There would be some major upset in the way refineries break down crude oil, because they are very much tuned to the percentages used for the different purposes. That would all have to be changed.  If we still need 50% of the oil, that would be a drastic drop in production but I think it won't \"END\" the oil age. Halving the demand, however, and leaving billions in infrastructure behind will push oil prices to a low not seen for 100 years and spur its use for other things rather than reducing it. So oil usage will be much less than halved... its the law of economics.   ",

            "answer_text": " If we look at China, the second biggest global consumer of oil, we find that its oil consumption rate constitutes about one third the world\u2019s total consumption rates and shows no signs of slowing. In fact, EIA even predicts steady growth of China\u2019s oil production reaching 4.6 million barrels per day in 2020 and 5.6 million barrels per day in 2040.  China has also invested heavily in building its strategic petroleum reserves and plans to expand them to 500 million barrels by 2020. Now take India. India has been investing heavily in building its own strategic petroleum reserves and its public sector undertaking, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) is planning to invest about $62 billion on its discoveries in Krishna Godavari Basin block KG-D5. These are two of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies that are investing heavily in renewables but also safeguarding their oil and gas aspirations. Moreover, when we analyze past oil price trends, we find that volatility related to geopolitical equations, speculations, wars, economic sanctions and climate change have always kept the global energy markets guessing about the future. The world is still myopic when it comes to energy. Yes, it wants to embrace EVs, but not at the cost of oil. Whatever happens to oil prices in the coming years, one thing is certain: that the age of oil isn\u2019t ending anytime soon, at least not in the next 30 years. ",

            "answer_text": "The use of 'oil' is not restricted to passenger cars only. It is still quite a popular choice for commercial vehicles, fixed power generation, agricultural pumps, heating in colder climates and last but not the least, aviation. So technically, electric cars can end oil age only in their sector and market segments. Overall, I think the availability and price of oil stand a better chance of ending the oil age. Till oil is available cheap, it is too convenient - particularly for the masses who don't comprehend its effects on environment or are too preoccupied to pay attention. ",

Transmissions, transfer cases (where needed), and differentials do require lubricating oil, but that oil requires changing much less often than motor oil, as no combustion takes place in such components; both engine heat and blow-by byproducts of combustion degrade motor oil.
