            "answer_text": "Cell Phones are Radio Devices they communicate by transmitting and receiving voice over an area. All cell phones have special codes associated with them. These codes are used to identify the phone, the phone's owner and the service provider. Let's say you have a cell phone, you turn it on and someone tries to call you. Here is what happens to the call.What happens when we make a call? When we switch on the mobile phone, it tries for an SID on the Control channel. The Control channel is a special frequency that the phone and base station use to talk to one another. If the Mobile phone finds difficulty to get link with the control channel, it displays a \u201cno service\u201d message.If the Mobile phone gets the SID, it compares the SID with the SID programmed in the phone. If both SID match, the phone identifies that the cell it is communicating is the part of its home system.The phone also transmits a registration request along with the SID and the MTSO keeps track of your phone\u2019s location in a database. MTSO knows in which cell you are  when it wants to ring the phone.The MTSO then gets the signal, it tries to find the phone. The MTSO looks in its database to find the cell in which the phone is present. The MTSO then picks a frequency pair  to take the call.The MTSO communicates with the Mobile phone over the control channel to tell it what frequencies to use. Once the Mobile phone and the tower switch on those frequencies, the call is connected.When the Mobile phone move toward the edge of the cell, the cell\u2019s base station will note that the signal strength is diminishing. At the same time, the base station in the cell in which the phone is moving will be able to see the phone\u2019s signal strength increasing.The two base stations coordinate themselves through the MTSO. At some point, the Mobile phone gets a signal on a control channel and directs it to change frequencies. This will switch the phone to the new cell.  sources: Mobile Phone Communication.

            "answer_text": "From Cell to Cell All cell phones have special codes associated with them. These codes are used to identify the phone, the phone's owner and the service provider. Let's say you have a cell phone, you turn it on and someone tries to call you. Here is what happens to the call:  When you first power up the phone, it listens for an SID (see sidebar) on the control channel. The control channel is a special frequency that the phone and base station use to talk to one another about things like call set-up and channel changing. If the phone cannot find any control channels to listen to, it knows it is out of range and displays a \"no service\" message. When it receives the SID, the phone compares it to the SID programmed into the phone. If the SIDs match, the phone knows that the cell it is communicating with is part of its home system. Along with the SID, the phone also transmits a registration request, and the MTSO keeps track of your phone's location in a database -- this way, the MTSO knows which cell you are in when it wants to ring your phone. The MTSO gets the call, and it tries to find you. It looks in its database to see which cell you are in. The MTSO picks a frequency pair that your phone will use in that cell to take the call. The MTSO communicates with your phone over the control channel to tell it which frequencies to use, and once your phone and the tower switch on those frequencies, the call is connected. You are talking by two-way radio to a friend! As you move toward the edge of your cell, your cell's base station notes that your signal strength is diminishing. Meanwhile, the base station in the cell you are moving toward (which is listening and measuring signal strength on all frequencies, not just its own one-seventh) sees your phone's signal strength increasing. The two base stations coordinate with each other through the MTSO, and at some point, your phone gets a signal on a control channel telling it to change frequencies. This hand off switches your phone to the new cell.  ",
