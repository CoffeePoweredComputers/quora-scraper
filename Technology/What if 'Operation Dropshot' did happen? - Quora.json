Millions of casualties within a few weeks/months. The west would have some problems to make the case for being morally superior, especially after a world war that was essentially won by Soviet effort.  The threshold for use of nuclear weapons would have become ridiculously low. (Remember during the whole of the cold war not a single nuclear bomb was actually dropped on anyone.) The main adversary would not have had a chance to balance out a West that had evidently gone completely insane. I am not sure such an American hegemony would have been good for anyone.   Not that a Soviet Union with nuclear weapons was a good thing. But a U.S. with no inhibition to use the weapons would not be either.  ",
