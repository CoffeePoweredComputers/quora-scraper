            "answer_text": "Assuming we're talking tech, if you're very ambitious, and you're looking to build a multimillion dollar/pound company fast or lose it all (while having way more fun than your US counterparts), book a ticket to London if you're not already there. Things are a bit slower in the rest of England, but so is possibly \"losing it all\". England in general isn't cheap, and London is the priciest city in Europe. Long story short, you'll need either a lot of money off the bat, or a good amount coming in every month from day one to make a startup work in England.  If you're not in England already, and you're thinking of relocating internationally, here are some other cool ideas... If you have a bit less money, are a bit more risk averse, or you just want something different, think about starting up in:-Romania, a country with a booming tech scene and a very reasonable cost of living.-Spain or Argentina, if you want to have some startup-life fun on a fairly modest budget.-India, Bangalore is arguably the world leader in startups after Silicon Valley, and if you really don't have much money, you can live fairly well for under $500 per month in India. If you have a good amount of money, some great alternatives to England to also think about are:-Canada, Vancouver and Toronto are really great cities for startups as well as for living in (but very expensive), and Montreal is a lot cheaper, more fun, but a bit harder to start up in. -Australia or New Zealand, just replace Vancouver with Auckland, Toronto with Sydney.-Germany, especially Berlin. It's becoming a major startup hub, and while it isn't by any means cheap, it's not London either.-Ireland, more of a tech hub than England, and a neat place to live in. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. England is a good place but I would recommend you to start your startup in London because the city has been chosen as one of the best startup cities in the world. Many students are coming to England to study, and then some of them open their own company. The city has a good startup ecosystem but the future is not really bright. It depends on what happens with Brexit. Because English is a simple language to learn, there are many internationals entrepreneurs coming to London. Of course, now the companies want to move their HQ to Berlin because of Brexit but then the market will regulate itself. Even after the Brexit, many opportunities will rise. ",
