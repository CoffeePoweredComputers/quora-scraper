            "answer_text": "Because of Armenian separatists\u2019 occupation of Azeri territory sandwiched between the break away Nagorno Karabakh/ Artsakh province and Armenia to the West (aka the Lachin corridor) as well as with friendly Iran to the South. Azerbaijan does not recognise any autonomous status of its Nagorno Karabakh province and wants to recover the occupied territories it lost in 1990, in order to be able to encircle the break away province. On the ground, NK amounts to a mountainous redoubt, its northern borders with Azerbaijan being an impassable 3000 m tall mountain range stretching all the way west into Armenia proper and sealing the Northern end of the Lachin corridor.  Nikol Pashinyan\u2019s 2018 \u201cvelvet revolution\u201d was the last to occur in a post Soviet state, assuming the recent events in Belarus come to nothing. In effect the Kremlin finds the likes of Pashinyan, extremely destabilising, as warranted by its reactions in Ukraine, Georgia and Belarus or its violent neutralisation of Boris Nemtsov, Alexy Navalny and recently of Sergei Furgal inside Russia. Therefore Russia which doesn\u2019t recognise NK nor the annexed territories west of it, via its spokesperson, declared it will not intervene in the NK conflict unless the Republic of Armenia proper is under attack. Russia\u2019s Security Guarantees for Armenia Don\u2019t Extend to Karabakh, Putin Says - The Moscow Times Furthermore, Pashinyan\u2019s party had indicated its willingness to shut down the Russian 102nd Military Base in Gyumri -Western Armenia- under the command of the Southern Military District of the Russian Armed Forces, in order to curry favours from the USA.  Therefore the Kremlin has had every reason to encourage Ilham Aliyev, as an Armenian defeat at the South Eastern extension of the Lachin corridor occupied by Nagorno Karabakh separatists, would mark Pashinian\u2019s end at the hands of pro-Russian nationalists. Since the Turkish economy started contracting and entered a deflationary spiral with high inflation, high unemployment and soaring deficits, increasingly autocratic President Erdogan started last year his \u201ccrisis of the month show\u201d to deflect criticism and rally the opposition, agitating the flag of nationalist sentiment. How does the \u2018crisis-of-the-month\u2019 strategy work for Ankara? Every month the leadership chooses either a new invasion of Iraq, Libya or Syria, or to push up against Greece or Egypt or Cyprus, to stir the pot. Now its Armenia\u2019s turn. How Erdogan is testing bond with Putin, or 'his patience', in Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict Apparently autocrat Azeri President Aliyev suffered from similar issues as revenue from oil and gas sales collapsed. As a result, like his Turkish colleague, he cracked down on the opposition and the press, while also agitating nationalist sentiment. Azebaijani economy needs oil prices above $ 55 bbl to function, meaning they are currently selling at a loss while deficits are rising. The Azerbaijani economy is shrinking under three-way pressure due to untimely reforms, the pandemic, and the drop of oil prices in the world markets. Economic Crisis in Azerbaijan: Delayed Reforms, Fluctuating Oil Prices, and the Pandemic \u201cThe government\u2019s failure to fulfil its commitment to economic reform over the years has increased the cost of further reforms and made it impossible in the current situation. The government\u2019s unsystematic and incomplete measures to neutralize the effects of the pandemic on the economy significantly reduce the ability of economic agents to operate and limit their chances to recover what they have lost. Analysis 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict - Wikipedia \u201cIn a 27 September interview, regional expert Thomas de Waal stated that it was highly unlikely that hostilities were initiated by the Armenian side. \"Basically, Armenians won the war of the 1990s, they have all the territory they want\", de Waal said. \"Their incentive is to normalize the status quo\", while \"for various reasons, Azerbaijan calculates that military action will win it something\". The suspected immediate goal of the Azerbaijani attack is to capture the districts of Fuzuli and Jabrayil in southern Nagorno-Karabakh, where the terrain is less mountainous and more favorable for offensive operations. Russian military expert Mikhail Khodarenok stated that Azerbaijan had planned and prepared the offensive operation in Karabakh in advance; he added that the Azerbaijani army did not appear to complete its initial objectives during the first five days of the clashes, taking neither Fizuli nor Mardakert, and that the offensive could stall. Similarly, political scientist Arkady Dubnov, an expert at the Carnegie Moscow Center and for the Russia in Global Affairs magazine, believes that Azerbaijan launched the offensive, for lham Aliyev to improve Azerbaijan's position in a suitable season for hostilities in the terrain. One commentator in the journal Foreign Policy predicted that Azerbaijan would have great difficulty in trying to occupy the entire area of Nagorno-Karabakh due to the extremely inaccessible mountainous terrain controlled by Armenian troops. In addition, he opined that the readiness of the Azerbaijani army was very poor, with morale low, its structure corrupt and inefficient, and a desertion rate as high as 20 percent. Furthermore, despite large investments in the purchase of military equipment from oil profits, the Azerbaijani army was said to lack adequate training for the use of new equipment. Analysts such as Carlotta Gall have argued that Turkey appears to be using the conflict to attempt to leverage its influence in the South Caucasus along its eastern border, using both military and diplomatic resources to extend its sphere of influence in the Middle East, and to marginalise the influence of Russia, another regional power. Russia is part of a military alliance with Armenia, but has historically pursued a policy of maintaining neutrality in the conflict, and Armenia has yet to request aid. According to Michael Kofman, director of the Russia studies program at the CNA, Russia is unlikely to intervene unless Armenia incurs drastic losses. The Economist cited Azerbaijan's highly effective use of drones as indicating the future of warfare. Noting that it had previously been assumed that drones would not play a major role in conflicts between nations due to their vulnerability to anti-aircraft fire, it suggested that while this might be true for major powers with air defences, it was less true for minor powers. It noted Azerbaijani tactics and Turkey's use of drones in the Syrian civil war as indicating a \"new, more affordable type of air power\". It also noted that the ability of drones to record their kills enabled a highly effective Azerbaijani propaganda campaign.\u201d <end quote>. Finally as to how things may turn out, was best described in a Japan Times article by the former supreme allied commander of NATO and current dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University: War in the Caucasus will spread to Russia and Turkey \u201cThe \u201cfrozen conflict\u201d between Armenia and Azerbaijan has turned very hot. What may seem to many Westerners a minor clash in a remote corner of the world actually has significant implications for regional security, energy markets and the ambitions of two problematic strongmen: Vladimir Putin of Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. The fighting, which goes back to the collapse of the Soviet Union, centers on a small enclave of ethnic Armenians inside Azerbaijan called Nagorno-Karabakh. The mountainous self-declared republic (which is not even formally recognized by its patron, Armenia) has a population of 150,000 but is highly militarized. The Azeris lost control of the area in a conflict in the 1990s that cost 30,000 lives, and despite much saber-rattling have been unable to get it back though diplomatic or military means. In my time at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, I visited both countries several times. Dislike and distrust permeated the environment. The two defense chiefs at the time hated each other, and although both nations were nonmember partners with NATO (and had small troop contingents in Afghanistan), all that either man wanted to talk about was the duplicity and venality of the other. Unfortunately, each was accurately channelling the national view toward their neighbour in the Caucasus. Neither side seemed willing to give an inch, either literally and figuratively. Over the four years I was at NATO, there were a number of half-hearted military thrusts by the Azeris, which were easily stopped by the Armenians. Our intelligence assessments found that the Armenians were almost certain to win if things came seriously to blows. The Russian Federation was supplying arms and training to both sides, and the Russians actually had a somewhat calming effect. You know things are bad when Putin is playing peacemaker. In this latest escalation, as usual, both sides are claiming that the other attacked first; there were exchanges of fire in July leading to about a dozen Azeris killed (most of them soldiers). Casualties are now approaching 100. On Sunday, each side mobilized troops and declared martial law. On Tuesday, Armenia reported that one of its jets had been shot down by a Turkish F-16; Turkey denies the accusation. There is a lack of any real push from outside nations to step in and negotiate a new cease-fire, something that has helped calm matters in the past, at least temporarily. The most recent effort was mediated by the so-called Minsk Group, with France, Russia and the U.S. in the lead, but collapsed in 2010. What is particularly dangerous in this latest flare-up is that Turkey and Russia are strongly backing different horses. The Turks dislike the Armenians and support their fellow Muslims in Azerbaijan. (In Armenia, memories of massacres by the Ottoman Turks over a century ago remain a significant factor in national thinking.) Russia has a formal defense treaty and warm military-to-military relations with Armenia. Bear in mind that the other nations adjacent to the fighting are ever-unstable Georgia and one of America\u2019s most determined enemies, Iran. And that oil-rich Azerbaijan \u2014 with 7 billion barrels of proven reserves and large amounts of natural gas \u2014 has vulnerable pipelines that run as close as 10 miles from the Armenian border. While I\u2019ve been in the region several times when tensions were high, this time feels dangerously different. Washington is utterly distracted by the upcoming election. Turkey and Russia are on opposite sides (as they are in Syria and Libya as well). And the European Union is absorbed by the Brexit endgame and tensions at sea in the eastern Mediterranean between Greece and Turkey. NATO, which still has partnerships with Armenia and Azerbaijan, says \u201cboth sides should immediately cease hostilities\u201d and there is \u201cno military solution to this conflict,\u201d but offers no concrete proposal. The chances of a peaceful settlement seem bleak. A new version of the Minsk group that would include Turkey could build confidence for a deal. Putin is close to the leaders of both countries, although Russia tilts strongly to fellow Christian Armenia. Perhaps the U.S., Russia and Turkey, working together, could convince the two sides to turn away from the catastrophic path they are headed down. An approach might begin with some symbolic return of land to the Azeris; a commitment by both nations to forswear use of firearms and explosives (just as China and India did after their recent small conflict at the \u201cline of control\u201d in the Himalayas); and a step-by-step approach on new border openings. Admittedly, none of that feels promising. \u201cThe Black Garden,\u201d a brilliant 2003 book by Thomas de Waal, traces the roots of the conflict. In the concluding pages, he says, \u201cAny just solution to the [Nagorno-Karabakh] dispute will entail painful compromises on both sides, and it will have to balance radically opposing principles.\u201d At the moment, such compromises seem far less likely than a small war with potentially large consequences.\u201d <end quote> ",
