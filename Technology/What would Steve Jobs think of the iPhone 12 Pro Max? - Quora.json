Yet another lame perennial \u201cWhat would Steve Jobs do\u201d question\u2026 The only reason people ask questions like this is because they want to suggest that Steve wouldn\u2019t like Apple\u2019s current direction - despite the FACT that he hand-picked and groomed Tim Cook and the rest of the Apple executive team, and Apple has been more successful than ever as a result of their direction. Meanwhile: Apple director says Steve Jobs told team not to ask \"What would Steve do?\" Honor the man\u2019s dying wishes, please. Stop it with these faux \u201cconcern\u201d \u201cquestions\u201d.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion if Steve jobs looks iPhone 12 pro max now he feel like bad because steve jobs is a not fan of big smartphones and steve jobs loves small smartphones due he released many iPhones in small form factor. And in my thought iPhone 12 pro max is less innovative as compared to many android smartphones in terms of display, camera, battery and fast charging tech and steve jobs is best inventor of all times in smartphone design and smartphone technology and between 2007 to 2011 he make more amount of innovations in iPhones.
