            "answer_text": "The intelligent mind separates human from other species which is so evident and simple. This mind many times take human in much lower ladder from animals or other species. Other species keep following to live in nature and maintain harmony with nature. The nature is summation of lives or any living species and includes other life component like, vegetation, water, environment, earth and every natural resources. The greatest quality of human be humanity but presently we generally are quite far from such spirit as on the present state of evolution. We live in selfish world and find satisfaction within our known set of people or community or nationality and so on but this equation is changing rapidly with expansion of technology and global connectivity for economical reason at personal level and national level. Yet one thing that makes human is the knowledge of immortal spirit we possess within and same is present in every other human and the spirit in its pure form has same quality. So it is love and compassion we have in nature tries to see all equal; Giving due respect and humility enables to build mutual trust and so Ethical way of living is always spreading fragrance the feeling of HUMANITY.

Unlike other beings who don\u2019t have consciousness. We know past and determine future on the base of observations, we did in past or doing in present. We think logically because we have reason but other beings don\u2019t have any logical thoughts. We have a priori as well as aposteriori knowledge but other beings can\u2019t conclude from logical premises, because it need reason to check whether the premises are correct or not. We are trying to understand the Universe and govern it and this credit goes to our reason. We feel subjective things like beauty and we also believe in morality. Religion defines our ethics and morality, that how we ought to act in a society, and besides religion, Philosphers also tried to eastiblish ethics for harmony society. For other beings there is no morality and ethics. Perhaps they have some apriori knowledge for their survival but they don\u2019t know the a posteriori knowledge and perhaps for they feel the emotion but not the beauty, the aesthetic pleasures. That\u2019s why we are human. Our reason and cinsciousness make us human. ",

            "answer_text": "Our ability to make a conscious choice, to set a standard, and be able to justify it, is what separates human beings from other animals. Many higher animals do show compassion, so the suggestions I've seen in other answers don't seem completely right to me. But what separates us, is a consciousness, the ability to be aware of what one is doing, and to adjudge whether it is correct or not, yet still choose to continue doing what we believe is wrong. This last point, the dilution of standards, and refusal to recognise when something is wrong, is what is leading the world into chaos, and is what is destroying humanity. We have the power of will, though I don't mean sacrifice, for even a mother dog will starve herself for her puppies. But we can choose to ruin our lives, to succeed, whatever. It is entirely upto is how we choose to make our lives and in which direction we go, while being fully aware of the choices we make. This self-awareness, the ability to know, is what makes us human.

            "answer_text": "Certain basic distinctive characteristic help us to qualify to the supreme degree of HUMAN BEINGS.  Firstly, there are some common characteristics that we share with other living organisms but they do help us in qualifying for the basic post of human beings.  7 of them are listed below. I urge that exceptions such as handicapped people must be ignored in these 7 points.   Movement - Known as the displacement of an organism from one place to another. We can move,run,jump and do all sorts of stupendous tasks with the help our legs. Respiration - Known to be the basic essentiality, it is the process by which we breakdown glucose to obtain valuable energy. Sensitivity - We are able to detect changes in the surroundings and respond to them. Growth - The permanent increase in one's size upto a certain age. Reproduction - Ability of an organism to produce offsprings of the same kind. Excretion - Removal of metabolic toxic waste products and products which are in excess. Nutrition - Taking in nutrients from the environment to feed onself in order to provide energy.  Apart from this, SOCIAL BEHAVIORAL SKILLS,  TASK MANAGING SKILLS,  COMPUTING SKILLS,  EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, EFFICIENCY TO USE OUR BRAIN EFFECTIVELY and OUR CRITICAL AND LOGICAL THINKING CAPABILITIES make us different from other living beings.  The so called community is therefore known as HUMAN BEINGS for the vast use of our brain that we have done on day to day basis in order to improve and make our lives easy.  Consider another point here, were the early humans as advanced as the present ones? The answer is certainly a NO. We didn't have enough thinking capabilities to make use of our surroundings at that time. As time gradually passed, humans have advanced a lot. This is evident in today's world.  In one line to answer this tricky question, I would say that HUMANS ARE PROBABLY THE ONLY BEINGS WHO HAVE ATTACHED A MATERIALISTIC VALUE TO EVERYTHING.  And yes! That makes us different! Absolutely different! ",

He just wants to know what I want to buy. Only humans want to buy stuff, right? If I came in and just stood there, he'd have a problem. He'd have to call somebody, maybe the manager or security. I'd be escorted out. \"Sorry, you can't be here. Only humans allowed.\" But I'm not, so I must be human. You've made me curious, so I just asked my wife if I'm human. She gave me her \"What the hell are you on about now?\" look and said, \"Yup, as far as I know. What are you doing, horsing around on Quora again?\" I told her no, nothing of the kind, I'm doing important research online. She said, \"Oh, right.\" But just between you and me, sometimes Quora makes me question my very existence. Never mind am I human. Do I even exist? Do you? What the hell is this, some kind of skit?

Doesn't matter in whatever position you are in, how much you earn, if you can't feel the pain of a creature at front, a lame dog, a hungry person asking for a morsel of food, a small kid sweeping the floor in a train, asking for a penny or even just a stranger who doesn't seem in a good mood, you can never be entitled to be a human being. Buddha was the epitome of true compassion. He did not have to experience all the realities of life himself to get into the path of vairagya. Seeing other's suffering he used to feel so much pain, that he vowed to find an end to all this, left all the relationships, oppulency behind and walk on the path of soul search. Compassion is at the core of spirituality. Unless you are able to see the same source in every living being around, realising it within which is the sole purpose of every human life, is next to impossible. ",

It show their family culture and sanskar they got from their parents. They treat other girl like a slut but for their sister they don't want to hear any single words. They made jokes on rape cases and laugh like a Shaitan. I saw many man who always said that it was girl mistake for any rape case. Just see the movie PINK You have to think that all human being are God creation and all should have right to live. Many people treat animal in very bad manner like street dog or \u2026\u2026..

            "answer_text": "First of all, I think the use of word \u201chuman\u201d needs to be seen from two perspectives - first as common noun and second as adjective. As a common noun, I think humans are no different from other species - rodents, apes, cats, etc - anatomical changes notwithstanding, as no two species are supposed to be similar and hence these differences are not what you can say the real differences. The adjective 'human' is also not very different from other species. How can we claim that only humans have love and compassion without getting into the skin of other animals? There are umpteen examples of presence of emotions in animals, some of which we keep watching on TV or read in newspapers. So I think even these emotions are not clear differentiating factors - though one can always debate on level of emotional feeling we humans exhibit. As per my understanding, the only difference, I could think of is the ability to use brain ( and not just presence of brain). Animals have brain and use it to survive. Humans certainly have superior level of brain, and use this not just to survive, but also to grow and develop. Or else we could have just lived in caves till now. Animals have also developed, but these changes are more evolutionary and not human-like - from caves to skyscrapers, from feet to aircrafts, and many more. ",
