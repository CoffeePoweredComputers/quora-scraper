            "answer_text": "STABLE BUDGET LANIER 1930s VACUPLANES HAD ULTRA-SHORT SLATWINGS. Since early 1970s I have studied & published re ultra-stable ultra reliable LANIER micro-wing 1929 planes. This fascinating micro-wing plane was patented 1929, the year that Graff Zeppelin Airship did a world cruise! Eradicate weekly airline crashes & stalled car traffic on fossil-covered roads with Prof.Lanier's 1930s budget mini-slatwing Vacuplanes (1/3 to 1/2 usual wingspan & formerly student built-flown), as in author's 1979 book Eco-Logistics (Griffith, Q\u2019land, Macquarie & Sydney Unis should still have copies. These quiet ultra stable Lanier planes have \"great safety... almost fly themselves\" avoiding traditional lethal dangers of vortex loss, flutter, rigidity, fatigue, stall & spin, lateral slip-off, dive at stall & skid in turns. Wing should inspire short Wind-Turbine blades as well as wind or water propellers. His son's 1950-60s steep-climber (of many) was retitled Paraplane. Slatwing closes for high speed. Given wide body lift or Lanier Ram-wings, PV, solar \u2018steam\u2019, alcohol or hydrogen are feasible emissionless fuels. STOL takeoff distance can be a mere 20m, & slow speed equals that of a runner; hence convert un-needed airports (see early fuselage logos \"Every Field an Airport\") into giant city Public Edible Parks + solar or wind farms where plane sugar alcohol fuel can be grown, thereby saving & making $billions- - - Lanier principals involve a slatted wing or wide-body top like this side-view shown moving left: wind -> (/ / / / / / / > with flat underneath & lifting forces close to centre of gravity - like Venetian blinds lying on a table. As wind gushes over the presumably wide-body wing, each trough experiences reduced air pressure = lift. Modern balsa models have flown for years with amazing full-scale characteristics & self-recovery. Happy to freely provide much more by E-mail + stunning photos. Google Lanier. ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking for me, I can\u2019t wait to see what happens to the scientific community and people in general, specifically those sceptic types when free energy devices are revealed. I can only hope the understanding behind it will also be revealed but there will be plenty of people taking it apart regardless. Even though the science wont be understood by many because it defies our popular understanding of physics. People will have to start diving into metaphysics with a passion. After that, replicators, which will be very similar in principle to the ideas behind free energy, they will just change how that energy is collected. These things will change the world forever and usher in new everything. Resonance based anti gravity though, that will likely be the most fun. Extremely advanced hover boards will come soon after, and probably even before this technology removes the need for cars and trucks teleporters will start popping up. It\u2019s set to be a fun century. ",
