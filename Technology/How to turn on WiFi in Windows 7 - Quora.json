            "answer_text": "A2A If you're still using Windows 7 then you really shouldn't be turning on WiFi nor connecting that computer to a network - much more so if said network will grant you access to the internet. Windows 7 has reached it's end of life sometime ago and is therefore a security risk for yourself (and everything you keep in your computer) and for everyone in your network or connected to the internet. Besides the obvious malware infections that can corrupt your data and/or your system, connecting a famous insecure operating system online can get it infected with a bot control malware so that perpetrators can use your computer to execute illegal activities without your knowledge. Upgrade your system! ",
