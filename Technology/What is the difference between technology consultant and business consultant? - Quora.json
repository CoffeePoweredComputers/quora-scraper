            "answer_text": "Good question and a difference that many companies fail to comprehend. From our practice, business consultants work in the software world along with technology consultants - you can extrapolate how different business consultants might function in other areas of focus. The technology or software technology consultant is going to come in and help set up software (or hardware as needed). For example, a software technology consultant will help implement the Inventory Module, creating inventory items, defining the attributes of those items, setting the reorder points, tracking actual sales of each item, linking the PO\u2019s to the Receiving Dock scans so we measure real lead times - all the technical setups, configuration, training and everything to make the users adequate at using the software. He\u2019ll know how to tie items to cost codes, sales and the underlying GL accounts. The business consultant is going to come in and say \u2018why do we have so much inventory in the warehouse\u2019 and find out the owner blows his stack when a sale is lost due to stockouts of one or another item, so the purchasing agent has bought double of everything needed. The business consultant compiles the cost of capital needed to maintain this $20m in inventory, suggests it would be cheaper to purchase software to manage this issue, and helps users rank and track inventory items to discover that there\u2019s only 15 of the 15,000 items that ever really \u2018stockout\u2019 - so we don\u2019t need $20m in inventory, really only $3m, with emphasis on those 15 items and an accurate demand forecast that shows we really only run out seasonally, during Easter break and back to school periods. So the business consultant comes up with the \u2018why\u2019 we need some software solution to address an issue, the technology consultant has the \u2018how\u2019 we deploy the software. The technology consultant makes sure the software works, the business consultant makes sure the company is using the software to make the business work. Many ERP companies talk about ROI and how companies using their software profit. However, that\u2019s not due to the software, it\u2019s due to how managers use the software. Every ERP implementation is a technical project and a business management project Companies that do the technical project well spend a lot of money. Companies that do the business management project well make a lot of money. ",

            "answer_text": "To give you a sense, a similar question is what is the difference between Opthalmologist and Cardiologist? They both are doctors but look at different functional parts of the body. Similarly, a technology consultant will consult you on decisions related to technology selection, application and execution across the life cycle of that decision making process. A business consultant on the other hand will consult on decisions that affect the business of a company - They could be decisions on marketing, pricing, operations, finances etc There could be some overlap between the business and technology consultant but broadly that is the difference among the two.
