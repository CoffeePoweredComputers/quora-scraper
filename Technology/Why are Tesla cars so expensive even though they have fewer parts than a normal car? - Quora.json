            "answer_text": "The Tesla Model 3 is not terribly expensive compared to a full battery car (BEV) of similar range, such as a Chevy Bolt, perhaps $5\u201310K more. All are expensive because Li batteries are expensive and many are needed to give acceptable range (200+ miles). They also need a complicated liquid cooling system to protect the batteries and electronic management of their charging and output. The disappointment is that the Model 3 was never available for $35K w/ full $7.5K federal tax credit (plus state credits), as most of the ~400k people who left a $1k reservation expected. Many buyers feel the extra price of a Model 3 is worth it, considering Tesla\u2019s better charging network, more extensive touch screen, and faster acceleration. They were also known for convenient service with mobile rangers, though once Model 3\u2019s were out in volume, many owners have become frustrated with service. The Model S & X are more custom-made, with aluminum frames, and have some expensive parts found in luxury vehicles such as air suspension. Tesla claims the total cost of ownership is competitive with a similar gas car, even stating their prices \u201cwith fuel savings\u201d on their website. Fueling (charging) at home will cost ~50% of gasoline (hybrid like Prius), but using Tesla superchargers will cost ~2x gasoline, both depending upon where you live. Also, if you don\u2019t drive often, the batteries and electronics will decay away charge as it sits (~6 mi range per day). If parked in a cold garage or outdoors, it will use even more to keep the battery warm so keep it plugged in. Indeed, in 32 F weather, it will use all the output of a 120 VAC home circuit just to keep the batteries warm (won\u2019t even add charge). ",

            "answer_text": "DISCLAIMER: I don't own a Tesla - I have three friends who do. I've ridden in them many times and they have no complaints so far. This is the reason I will be getting one someday. Tesla cars are expensive for three reasons: Tesla cars require batteries. As previous answers have covered well, these are expensive.Tesla uses different techniques for producing cars, compared to legacy car makers. Building gigafactories with robot and conveyor belt production lines is an expensive endeavor.Tesla cars rely on great programming to run well. Yes, build quality is one thing (and technicians who work on other car makes rave over the build quality of Teslas - sorry Tesla haters!) but quality programming is where Teslas stand out. Paying top programmers is not cheap, and updates are needed very often to fix bugs and counter ever increasing cyber threats.A previous answer to this question stated that \"Tesla is becoming obsolete\". Now I've stopped laughing, I'd like to address this rather hilarious claim. What most people don't seem to realise is that Tesla is a very young car company, and is having to make it's way through the minefield of the 21st century. Legacy car makers did not have this issue! They didn't have to deal with the internet, and therefore were not subject to howls of abuse by people who don't even own the car in question (looking at you, Jared Fox)Reviews back then were made by the companies, and were, of course, glowing with positive praise with hardly an utterance for how inefficient, unsafe and ugly they wereAnyone who says Tesla is obsolete, going bankrupt, makes shitty products, is run by a moron, etc, is ignoring these facts: Jeep cars had an issue with bursting into flames due to a poorly placed gas tank - did I mention that this issue goes back to 1970 with the Ford Pinto? You would think they would have learned?Fires in ICE cars are far more common than the media would have you know. Tesla fires are much more interesting (and profitable!) because they act like clickbait. The hate is real.VW was run by a corrupt CEO who promptly resigned when Dieselgate erupted. What leadership!GM was bailed out by the Federal government before becoming the vastly successful business it is todayAny CEO you care to mention is weird in some way. But they are all geniuses in some way, and deserve our respect.Tesla cars have the best safety ratings in the car industryTesla cars have the best range in the EV industryTesla has one of the best service setups in the car industryTesla is setting the standard in the industry for what an electric car should beAnd finally, no company is perfect. Every company ever created so far was created by humans and is run by humans. Expecting Tesla, or any other car maker, to be perfect is frankly ludicrous (pun intended).",

So, since supply is low and the demographic which purchases Teslas average 250% of the median American income, tends to be older, do not have children in the home they can afford to overpay and Tesla has no surplus of vehicles simply because it can\u2019t produce enough vehicles - or replacement parts. So sufficient demand for low supply and enough people with disposable income to buy the hype to buy the car. Charging station today at Bear Mtn. State Park in upstate NY near middle class and upper class visitors. 4 charging stations. We watched to see if there was a single Tesla being charged or in the parking lot of about 500 cars. Not one. We saw 6 cars getting charged over a period of 5 hours, 2 Chevy Bolts, 2 Hyundais and a Jaguar i pace and one Nissan Leaf. No Teslas. All except the Jaugar are far cheaper to buy, insure and service than any Tesla. ",

Mirrors? etc, etc. The only thing missing is about 6-800lbs worth of Engine/Transmission (and maybe driveshaft)\u2026 which has been replaced with 1,300lbs worth of batteries and 1,100lb worth of electrical motors, chargers, and inverters (in the case of the dual motor P100D). In fact, the drivetrain/battery in a Tesla is so heavy that Tesla had to resort to more exotic materials to lighten up the body, suspension, and interior. The battery, alone is about $12,000. Each powered axle subassembly is probably worth $2\u20134k each. There\u2019s a lot of copper involved, too. Did I mention Teslas are super advanced? They have sensors all over them allowing them to be semi-autonomous and safe. If anything, Teslas are remarkably cheap, and they did so by making themselves into a luxury brand. It\u2019s easier to absorb EV costs into a package that can be marketed alongside a BMW or Mercedes. ",

            "answer_text": "Essentially it\u2019s the cost of the battery. Li-ion cells are a relatively new component (at least compared to something like a spark plug that has been around for 100 years) that until now has not been manufactured in quantities required for EVs. Therefore high volume manufacturing facilities and supply chains need to be set up to bring the cost down due to economies of scale. In addition, there is some technology learning at play here as well as a lot of research is being conducted to optimize the cell chemistry. All that is to say that at the moment, the battery is the main cost driver of EVs (including Teslas). However, the cost of Li-ion cells has been falling dramatically over the years, about 19% per year. That may not sound significant, but it adds up. In 2010 Li-ion cells cost $1000/kWh, meaning the 24 kWh battery in a Nissan LEAF of that time would have had $24,000 in Li-ion cells in it! Today, Tesla is at $100/kWh, meaning that the 75 kWh battery in the Tesla Model 3 Long Range (that can go about 4 times as far as that original Nissan LEAF) only has $7500 in cells! In another 4 years, we will start achieving cost parity with ICE cars, and it will only improve from there. ",

            "answer_text": "The cost of batteries, of course. But the simplicity of an electric motor and drive train compared to its ICE counterpart is monumental. Has anyone ever dissected an automatic transmission? The complexity is almost unbelievable. Ditto for the engine, now that they have introduced variable valve timing and a ton of other exotic improvements to the ancient design. An ICE drivetrain by now is so Rube Goldbergian that if the parts were spread out on the floor you would need a basketball court to contain them. And all of this just to squeeze another 1/2 mpg or a couple of horsepower or slightly lower emissions out of the old classic. In aviation we went from an 852-feet powered flight TO THE MOON in 66 years while pistons just keep chugging along as they did in Karl Benz\u2019s day twice as long ago. I marvel that any manufacturer keeps spending money and increasingly complex engineering on a design that outlived its practical usefulness. At this point improvements to the ICE design are like doing a heart transplant on a terminal cancer patient. It\u2019s an obsolete, dying technology. Why bother? Electrics are simpler, faster, and more economical to run. When the purchase price goes down \u2014 as it will, remember the Texas Instruments calculator? \u2014 ICE will be mercifully defunct. Oh, and why do I hate ICE so much? Because I have long done my own mechanical work on cars and motorcycles, and if I never rebuild another carburetor or replace a timing belt I will die a happy man with clean fingernails. (LOL) ",

But the main thing is normal cars don't have a 28k battery!!! Even the gas motor in most cars don't cost that. But also, they haven't sold enough cars yet, why do you think the model T was so successful? Because they could crank them out, 45 minutes to assemble one, and they sold like crazy. Development costs were way cheaper back then. They haven't sold enough yet to recuperate the costs. And unlike Ford, who could sell just one model, they are trying to increase their sales with more models. Ford didn't even sell the cars in different colors!!! ",

Comparing them with cars from the same segment (such as BMW, Audi, Mercedes) with the same performance, they are usually cheaper or are not so much expensive. You can compare a Model 3 with a BMW 3-series or a Audi A4 ou a Mercedes C-class and a Model S with a 5-series, an A6 our a E-Class. Do not forget to add all the possible comparable extras, such as electric seats, heated seats, automatic driving options etc, and choose an engine that gives the same performance as the Teslas. If you take in account the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), with the savings in gas and maintenance, a Tesla is a lot cheaper. ",

To create these vehicles, that was of course a feat, but to create the storage capability for range is what boggles the minds of the inventors. And these \u201cinventor-creators\u201d guys are not coming cheap, trying to come up with workable solutions. They [TESLA] certainly have come far in range, from barely 200 miles range to a reasonable 400 mile. And what is really brilliant: bringing down the charge times from like weeeeeks into less than 1 hour for decent range. Now when you buy one new, you will have to pay for all that [and all their misses and near misses]. ",
