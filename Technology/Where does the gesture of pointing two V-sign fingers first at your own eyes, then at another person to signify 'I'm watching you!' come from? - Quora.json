            "answer_text": "I wasn't able to locate a likely origin for this gesture that Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren popularized in the Netflix Original Series, \"Orange is the New Black.\"   The most common hypothesis floating around is that it originated as a military signal that meant \"enemy in sight.\" However I reviewed a lot of military signal images and uncovered no formal signals like this. The correct military signal for Enemy In Sight is pointing the rifle in the enemy's direction. No soldier who stayed alive would have time to do the two-step point to eyes, then point at enemy signal and at the same time be prepared for enemy fire. Actual \"Enemy In Sight\" signal:  Other possibilities include American Sign Language, a 2011 rage cartoon called \"I'm Watching You\" (most likely is named after the meme, not vice versa). This is Robert De Niro doing it in the Little Fockers:   But no doubt De Niro did not invent the signal, he was simply doing an already-popular and understandable gesture.  The origin is likely in the US, because the gesture below is listed as the \"I'm watching you\" and the seventh most-annoying gesture in the UK, according to the Daily Mail:  I also searched librarian, teacher and parent gestures but could not find a satisfactory origin. Hopefully somebody else can take it from here. ",

            "answer_text": " See it used here. It signifies to look, usually followed by a direction indicating an area of attention. Now figure an NCO using the look and then pointing at a subordinate, this would indicate non-verbally that they should watch themselves. I remember in childhood this being a symbol meaning distrust or heightened awareness; or just purely humorous or threatening. I can not answer the origin, but it likely comes from military hand signs\u2026 and is far older than we can reliably prove outside some dusty musty field manuals. ",
