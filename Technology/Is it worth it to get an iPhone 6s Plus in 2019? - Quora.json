            "answer_text": "The 6s runs the current iOS, and will almost certainly get at least one more upgrade, and possibly no update(IOS 13). It will run most current apps (minus a few games and things that rely on newer features like AR). It\u2019s a thin, light, quick little phone with a great camera. It has TouchID and will work with ApplePay. If you have an older phone or no iPhone at all, it\u2019s worth it. ",

In this price range you can get a wonderful phone like one plus 6 T which is blazing fast,latest software,very good camera and in screen fingerprint sensor.There are other options too.I think it is not worth it at this price.
