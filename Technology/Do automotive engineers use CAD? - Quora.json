            "answer_text": "Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is an effective software tool for designing and modeling products in the automotive industry. The software has helped the industry with ease and precision to revolutionize their work processes and to improve their product designs for business growth. Uses of CAD for the automotive industry include the process of creating, analyzing, modifying, optimizing, and drafting product data, so as to achieve its design goal efficiently and effectively. We take input data for use of graphics product design, product model, and drives the peripherals for product presentation. CAD is extensively applied in automotive engineering processes and 3D designs. It offers a widespread working field for geometry creation as well as for the linkage of numerous simulation procedures, customer demands, and legislation tasks. CAD designing and modeling are broadly segmented to the passenger vehicle industry and commercial vehicle industry. In the passenger vehicle industry, it is further segmented to two/three-wheeler and four-wheelers. Whereas the commercial vehicle industry is segmented into truck, van, bus, and trailer. We used CAD to create, modify, analyze, and optimize product design, to drive innovation, slash costs, and get incredible new products. ",
