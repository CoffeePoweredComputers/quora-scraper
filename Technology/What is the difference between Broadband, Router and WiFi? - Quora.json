            "answer_text": "Broadband is a high-capacity transmission technique used to send large quantities of data quickly. DSL, Cable, Fiber Optic, and Satellite are all considered Broadband Internet services. In layman\u2019s terms, broadband is any Internet connection that\u2019s faster than dial-up. A Router is a piece of hardware that routes data through your home network. The most common form of router looks something like this:  A small box with blinking lights and several various ports on the back for things like ethernet, a phone line (if you\u2019re using DSL) or a coax jack (for cable internet), and most likely a USB port for things like printers or storage. If it\u2019s also a Wireless Router, it\u2019ll have antennas sticking out of it. Nowadays, Internet Service Providers will provide you with a modem that also has a router and Wi-Fi capabilities integrated all integrated into a single unit. Wi-Fi is a type of wireless communication technology that provides high speed Internet access to portable devices like laptops, smartphones, gaming systems, and so on. ",
