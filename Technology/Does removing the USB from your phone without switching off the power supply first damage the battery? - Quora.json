            "answer_text": "No. If ever there is any issue with making and breaking contacts then the engineers already thought of that. If you look closely at various plugs or circuit cards with sliding contacts, you may notice that sometimes a contact is shortened compared to others. This is to make sure that if necessary, certain circuits are powered up before others, usually the ground, then power then signals. Powering down can cause sparking so for circuit cards it is always a good idea to power off before changing these. In the case of USB the only conceivable danger is to electronics, not the battery, but power protection devices are already included in circuits because it is a consumer device. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The pins are arranged to disconnect in the correct order and the phone charging circuitry designed for the plug to be withdrawn without damage to the electronics.Physical disconnection is no problem as long as you don\u2019t bend or twist the connector excessively when doing so. What is the difference between pulling the connector, and disconnecting the power to the charger and then pulling the connector ? Nothing. The only really thing at risk is the charger and it is also designed to cope with this. ",
