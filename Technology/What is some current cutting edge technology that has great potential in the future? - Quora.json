            "answer_text": "You may find it more useful to think about new applications of technology which are infeasible now, but which will become possible in the future. I could tell you about various applications of nuclear fusion that look promising, about breakthroughs in artificial photosynthesis, much more efficient solar cells employing quantum dots, insanely good batteries using graphene\u2026 but it is hard to pick winners. However, with some certainty I can predict that energy is going to get much, much more abundant in the not too distant future. Super cheap energy (and AI) opens up a lot of possibilities for expanding our environment, both up and down. It becomes possible to bore tunnels extensively, take our entire transportation infrastructure underground. Also our living space. Cheap energy and nano-tech will bring the long imagined Space Elevator within reach and allow us to take the excess carbon out of the atmosphere. ",
