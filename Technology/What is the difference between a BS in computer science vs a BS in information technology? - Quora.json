            "answer_text": "Information technology and computer science are both hot degrees for the tech-savvy. Both degrees signal a good deal of computer know-how. Graduates sometimes compete for similar positions. However, there are significant differences both in coursework and in typical career paths. If the school offers only one of the two-degree options, the program may be something of a hybrid. When a single university offers both degree options, there is likely to be a good deal of contrast. A computer science program tends to be more science-heavy while an IT program includes more coursework in fields like business, communications, and management. ",

            "answer_text": "They have a lot of similarities, particularly in the basic foundation and some applications -- our first-year subjects are the same. In fact, CS majors take some IT subjects and IT majors take some CS subjects. However, the ultimate focus of the programs are different. CS is more inclined towards the more mathematical and software side of the field, solving the problems in artificial intelligence, operating systems, programming languages. On the other hand, IT is more inclined towards the business and people side of the field, like databases, project management, quality assurance. The computer engineering program has both CS and IT subjects, but the ultimate focus is hardware. ",
