            "answer_text": "Waze is the GPS navigation app with elements of social networking. It provides drivers with the latest and most accurate data gathered from other users in the area (it\u2019s the most important point!). There are 2 ways which Waze uses to collect and share information: Passive, when the app analyzes cars\u2019 speed to indicate traffic jams and suggest you the shortest and fastest way to your destination.Active, when users themselves report about anything that may turn your ride into an unpleasant adventure \u2013 car accidents, road closures and even police posts.Finally, you get the most up-to-date traffic information from the same drivers as you are.  Just the example (by Paul Van den Wyngaer) Google doesn\u2019t have this \u201csocial element\u201d, so its data is not so fresh and accurate. For example, it has already been a month since there is repair work on one of the bridges in my hometown, so only public transport is allowed to pass. However, Google Maps app shows that you can cross the bridge on your own car, which is false. If you are interested in the more deep research about Waze navigation app, you can check out this article on the blog of my company! ",

            "answer_text": "In addition to what Guy Suffer wrote, Waze is better than google maps in most of the countries due the quality of the maps. While Google Maps looks cleaner and fancier, Waze has, in average, better maps. This is true because Waze has a huge community that edits, update and improve the Maps everyday. Well, Google Maps has it as well, but it's different. The difference between Waze\u2019s and GM\u2019s community is that waze\u2019s is entirely local. This means that the people in charge of keeping the map updated in Toronto, are people that live in Toronto, work in Toronto, commute in Toronto, drive in a daily basis in Toronto. They know the place, and if don\u2019t, they research. This applies worldwide. On the other hand, if I want to update an incorrect segment from Mexico City in google maps (because I drove there yesterday), I have to ask for permission for a lad in India which will ask a dude in USA which will request permission to a dude in Australia to finally tell me -No, of course you are wrong, that street isn't incorrect, we will leave it like that!* *I might have exaggerated, but you get my point ",
