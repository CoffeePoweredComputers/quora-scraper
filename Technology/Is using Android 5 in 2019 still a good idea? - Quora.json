            "answer_text": "Yes nothing wrong to use Android 5 in 2019 but it's better if users update at least Android 6 because of the few major changes. Android 5 doesn't support runtime permission like location, camera, read/write contacts, read/write external storage, calendar, etc but in Android 6 onwards users are having the power to grant/decline these permissions at runtime. Generally whenever any app asks for any permission they mention why they needed so based on the app context user can decide, like WhatsApp needs read contacts that is fine but suppose any app requesting for reading contacts permission that doesn\u2019t have any feature related to contacts then why to grant that permission.Andriod 6 supports Doze and App Standby power-saving optimization for idle devices and apps.Android 8 Android 8(Oreo) restricted background services, It means apps can\u2019t run in the background silently if Apps are doing something in the background then the user will be aware of it through notification. it helps in power-saving. Android 10 Background activity restrictions \u2014 With Android 10, apps can no longer launch activities in the background without user interaction. This is intended to minimize screen interruptions for users and give them more control over what happens on their device. Apps will now need to seek permission from users to launch background activities by sending them a notification. In some cases, for instance, an alarm app, the app will be able to alert users of the alarm, but will not be able to use the whole phone screen to do so. Apart from these restrictions, new versions provide many new features, better battery performance and better control on the device. ",

            "answer_text": "Even Android Marshmallow 6.0 got its last security update in August 2018. So, while in a sense, software never stops existing, it stopped getting \u201cmaintained\u201d (with new minor versions, you may still get major versions upgrades to in the case, newer than Lollipop and Marshmallow 6.0), or is \u201cunsupported\u201d. It\u2019s not a good idea to use such software or older (also neither e.g. Windows XP), even if it still \u201cworks\u201d as security bugs/holes get known, and will NOT get fixed. As with Windows XP, that has such known holes, they are a recipe for hackers to hack your device. I do not want to alarm you too much, possibly the security holes in Android are not too well known or already much exploited. If I wanted to alarm you, I would warn against ALL mobile phones for privacy reasons, regardless of how new the software is\u2026 ",
