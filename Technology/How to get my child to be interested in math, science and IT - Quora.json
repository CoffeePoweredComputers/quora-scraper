            "answer_text": "Show him how interesting they are! And do it before school makes them seem like a chore. There\u2019s nothing to interest a boy in science like looking at a drop of pond water under a microscope, and discovering a whole world of microsocopic creatures in it. Or peering through a telescope at Saturn\u2019s rings. There are wonderful math enrichment books for kids that emphasize the fun and interesting nature of mathematics, something that\u2019s sadly overlooked in the typical elementary and high school curricula, with its emphasis on basic skills and algorithms. Too many students never have an opportunity to take a university-level course in higher math, and discover just how fascinating it is. And don\u2019t forget museums like the American Museum of Natural History \u2014 there\u2019s nothing to interest a boy in science like standing face-to-face with Tyrannosaurus rex! And most of all, show him how interesting this stuff is by example. My father was always fascinated by science, and my grandfather as well. A gifted naturalist, Dad could show you the ancient creatures hiding under a rock, and explain that the lichens were a symbiosis of fungus and algae, and that the soil of New England was rocky because the topsoil had been carried away by glaciers in the last ice age. And I was early exposed to interesting and exciting scientists as well \u2014 I\u2019m told I was particularly taken with the astronomer Fred Hoyle, being shown different kinds of clouds from a meteorologist, seeing a mainframe computer for the first time courtesy of a family friend who worked in IT.

            "answer_text": "Assuming your child is below 10. This period is a very crucial period where the curiosity of every child is either killed or nourished. Follow the steps below Nourish your child's curiosity.Answer or try to answer or help your child in finding the answer to the questions he has.And the most important part - even if your area of concentration is only on the three subjects you mentioned in the question, don't limit your attention to the questions of your child from those areas only. If you do it in the right manner, your child as well as you will figure out what is his area of interest.Last but not the least, remember this - your child is an individual. That means he has his own identity. That intern means that he has his likes and dislikes as well. Please don't impose your wishes/likes on him. Let him explore things and experiment. He will surely find the right path.",
