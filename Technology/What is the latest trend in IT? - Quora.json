Research firm Markets and markets reports, the AI market will grow to a $190 billion industry by 2025. There will be major and advanced AI innovations that could change how businesses interact and communicate with customers. Machine learning is one of the most exciting emerging technologies. With the help of machine learning, computer devices analyze the repeated patterns and process it. It works on particular algorithms codes which start running when you search for certain content and, as a result, you come across the suggestions of similar content on your social media platforms. Internet of Things (IoT) The Internet of things is another best innovation of new technology. IoT (Internet of things) help companies to convert any object into a digital device. IoT is where everyday items get chips or sensors, and apps, and join the internet The idea behind this is helping companies to know how customers are using and interacting with their product. By tracking these digital devices, companies can garner data which can be used to cater to customer demands in a much better way. Virtual Reality While AI will infuse everything, from cloud services to IOT, there's one area that will really develop and grow intelligent in 2019: virtual assistants. While Siri, Cortana, and Google Now are not exactly new, such services are being sewed into more areas. For example, Apple finally opened Siri up to third-party developers in 2016, so you can now tell Siri to send a payment to someone via Venmo. You can use Cortana (via Windows 10) with many Microsoft Office apps, too. The Global Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA) market size is expected to reach USD 12.28 billion by 2024, according to Grand View Research.

            "answer_text": "Current Trends in Information Technology Nowadays : The Internet of Things (IoT) Industry experts say that while the Internet of Things (IoT) had a false start particularly in regard to the augmented technology, in 2018, we should expect to see it improve our ways of doing things at home, work and even during leisure activities. This is why we expect to see it be among the biggest IT trends of 2018. The IoT is usually driven by the industry and will succeed the most if it focuses on getting solutions for some specified problems. The industry focuses on firmware and software that is hardware centric and suits those who love creating solutions and meets the demands of the engineering field.  Big data The technologies that are related to the big data will continue rising in importance in 2018. Due to its great return on investment, impact speed and measurability, digital marketing are now more popular as compared to the traditional marketing. This means that big data is now applied to the big business as many of the digital marketing campaigns can rely on the huge data quantities to ensure effectiveness and a greater reach. This is why companies are now relying on the data management to ensure conversions from online connections.  Mobile web performance A website that hasn\u2019t been optimized for the mobile devices is now getting penalized by the search engines. Nowadays, more users are expecting a better online performance from mobile devices. This has resulted in a race for the improvement of the mobile performance. This means that the 2018 web trends will include user-triggered animations, mobile-only development, secured apps and pages and natural language processing. There will also be an increased usage of white or negative spaces.  Artificial intelligence According to a leading essay writing service, Artificial intelligence (AI) is definitely among the biggest hits when it comes to IT trends that has impacted creativity in the online space. AI can be manifested through different algorithms for machine learning. This can be manifested not only in the amount of funding that AI receives but also the wide range of applications where it is being incorporated. Instead of focusing on a single goal such as communicating with humans or mastering a certain game, AI has now started to get into new platforms, device or app and we will continue to see this trend accelerating in the future. This is why AI is a trend that will affect human resources development.  Cloud computing A key IT concept that is commonly talked about is cloud computing. This involves the use of computer services like hardware and software over the internet. There are 3 various benefits of cloud computing. These include:\u2013 Minimizing the cost of IT infrastructure to a company\u2013 Promoting the virtualization concept which can enable storage devices and servers to be used across different organizations\u2013 It makes it easier to maintain hardware and software and there is no need for installation on each of the end-users computers. However, there are also certain concerns regarding cloud computing such as compliance, IT governance, privacy, legal abuse and many more.  User interface The user interface is one area that has undergone massive revolution since the touch screen was introduced. The capability of the touchscreen has revolutionized how the end users are able to interact with the application. With the touchscreen capability, the way users are able to interact with the application. Users are now able to interact freely with what is being displayed without the need for an intermediate device such as a mouse.  Mobile application The mobile application is another trend that has become popular in the recent past. Mobile apps are designed to run on mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. These can be downloaded from different operating systems such as Blackberry, Apple, Nokia etc. Some of these are available for free while others come at a cost. Any revenue collected is usually between the app developer and distributor.  5 Technology Trends That Will Make Or Break Many Careers In 2018 Data is everywhere, and growing at an ever-increasing rate We are creating an unprecedented amount of data as we live our lives. From social media to the digital footprint we leave as we use services like Netflix or Fitbit or connected systems at work. Every second, 900,000 people hit Facebook, 452,000 of us post to Twitter, and 3.5 million of us search for something on Google. Smart things In what now seems like the \u201colden days\u201d, only computers could connect to the internet. Maybe, if they were very advanced, some phones could to. Today you can buy lightbulbs, refrigerators, cars, watches, kettles, thermostats and many other \u201csmart\u201d, and therefore connected, objects. In industry, machines are increasingly being built to communicate with each other with less need for human input, in order to more efficiently carry out tasks. Collectively this trend is known as \u201cInternet of Things\u201d, because it isn\u2019t just an internet of computers and phones any more! Artificial Intelligence will rule our lives Not literally as in take over the world (yet). But they will certainly have our attention. The field of cognitive computing revolves around machines which are capable of \u201cthinking\u201d in a similar way humans do \u2013 particularly when it comes to learning. Of course, being computers they have certain advantages \u2013 in other words, teach them to learn, and they will do so at an incredibly fast rate, with a greater degree of accuracy than any human would be capable of. The result is that they will inevitably become more knowledgeable, capable and able to match solutions (data) to problems. Talking to machines is becoming second nature The way we interact with machines has evolved from operating levers and valves, to control panels, keyboards and touchscreen interfaces. Thanks (again) to the amount of data we have, we are now at a point where voice controlling machines feels natural and is often the most intuitive option we have. Blockchain will transform the way we record and access certain types of data Blockchain \u2013 the distributed, encrypted and public ledger behind virtual currency Bitcoin \u2013 has uses beyond making early adopters in virtual currencies filthy stinking rich. Experts say that it represents a leap forward in information storage and security. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is a topic thumbnail of how these trends are shaping our industry, and what to expect in 2016 and beyond. 1. 5GAs the next step in the continuous innovation and evolution of the mobile industry, 5G will not only be about a new air interface with faster speeds, but it will also address network congestion, energy efficiency, cost, reliability, and connection to billions of people and devices. In 2014 we heard of new antenna/RF technologies (Massive MIMO, wider bandwidths), proposed deployment of small cells in higher mmWave frequencies, shorter transmission time intervals, reduced latency, and possibly new modulation methods beyond OFDM. With a 2020 commercialization horizon, 2015 be the year when we move from these concepts to technology trials and standards development. And we shall see if/how this year\u2019s ITU World Radio Conference (WRC-15) tackles 5G\u2019s spectrum aspects. 2. FIBER EVERYWHERE2014 was the year of \u201cfiber everywhere\u201d propelled by efforts to improve connectivity and address demand increases from the use of high definition video, 3G/4G, streaming, podcast and other broadband services. This increased demand exposed existing bottlenecks in the communications infrastructure, and the solution that the doctor prescribed was a fresh new round of investments and activity in fiber (FTTx). In developed markets, FTTH/FTTC dominated deployments, and will continue to do so into 2015. In the backbone network, Carrier Ethernet is well underway and it will continue to make inroads towards 100/400G switching hardware deployments, and around Tb/s of bandwidth. 3. VIRTUALIZATION, SDN & NFVThe \u201csoftware-ization\u201d of Telco continued throughout 2014. The year saw open source going main stream with the news that Midokura and Microsoft, the last two major players with closed source solutions, released their source code and went open. In 2015, the adoption of OpenStack, OpenDaylight, OpNFV for software and services, and Open Compute for hardware will support more virtualized, more open source network computing platforms and architecture. 4. EVERYWHERE CONNECTIVITY FOR IoT & IoEOver the last year we have seen heightened interest in the Internet of Things (IoT) and of Everything (IoE) including several acquisitions by major players such as Google\u2019s purchase of Nest Labs for $3.2 billion. Bob Metcalfe, inventor of the Ethernet, said that the power of a network increases proportionally by the square of the number of users (Metcalfe's Law) which puts IoT \u2013forecasted to be 50 billion connections by 2020- in a powerful and strategic position. The challenge that IoT faces is that everything sits in isolation thus an IoT standard is a must, and many see this happening in 2015. 5. COGNITIVE NETWORKS, BIG DATACommunication systems handle volumes of data generated by embedded devices, mobile users, enterprises, contextual information, network protocols, location information and such. It is a vast amount of information: A global IP backbone generates over 20 billion records per day, amounting to over 1 TB per day! Processing and analyzing this \u201cbig data\u201d and presenting insights in a timely fashion are becoming a reality with advanced analytics to understand the environment, to interpret events, and to act on them. This is a positive development that helps unleash the intelligence in communication systems where networks are no longer labeled \u201cdumb pipes\u201d but as smart cognitive networks. 6. CYBERSECURITY2014 was most remarkable for demonstrating that everything connected to the Internet can, and will be hacked. On daily basis we heard of retailers (Target, Home Depot, Neiman Marcus), financial institutions (Chase), technology companies (Snapchat, eBay, Sony) being hacked. No one is cyber-safe, and the road to the future leads through new cybersecurity technologies beyond current perimeter firewall-like defenses. The coming year will bring significant changes in the industry as it responds to recent increases and sophistication of cyberattacks. We will see better solutions to protect devices and endpoints, advances in the default use of encryption, in authentication schemes, and in BYOD solutions. 7. GREEN COMMUNICATIONSIt is being reported that communications technologies are responsible for about 2-4% of all of carbon footprint generated by human activity. This highlights the need to focus on managing these numbers, and Green communications is doing just that. The trend is tackling first mobile networks because of their high energy use. Basestations and switching centers could count for between 60% and 85% of the energy used by an entire communication system. Environmentally friendly batteries, renewable energy sources, and intelligent management of the power systems are some of the proposed solutions. Besides this mobile network focus, there is a 2015 and beyond trend to manage total energy usage, compute-to-consumption ratios and performance KPIs for best in class green operations. 8. SMARTER SMARTPHONES, CONNECTED SENSORSThe indisputable rock-start of devices is the smartphone, and its future can\u2019t be brighter. In 2014 we saw that only a few days after the iPhone 6 was released, there are already articles being written about the next-generation iPhone 7. Size, shape, and capabilities of these ubiquitous communication devices continue evolving, and so are prices which, driven by cost and performance improvements in digital technologies, are falling rapidly. The average selling price of a smartphone went down in 2014, and we expect this to continue in 2015 with low-cost OEMs such as Xiaomi and Lenovo leading the trend. Beyond smartphones, tablets, connected sensors and body-worn wearables will also make headlines. Connected sensors will find their way into vehicles (smartcards), into urban areas (smartcies) and into our infrastructure (smartgrid). 9. NETWORK NEUTRALITY, INTERNET GOVERNANCEThe Internet has been operating since its inception under \u201copen\u201d principles, i.e. an open standards-based network that treats all traffic in roughly the same way, i.e. no connection blocking, bandwidth transparency, universal connectivity, and best effort service. Can these principles be sustained in a new word of data-hungry applications and services? Is regulation needed to prevent traffic throttling, unfair raise of fees, and construction of preferential high-speed Internet lanes? In 2014, Network Neutrality (NetNeutrality) discussions covered these questions in the context of ISPs transit and peering, and CDNs. Governments and institutions around the world will continue working on it during 2015. They will also be working on the Internet governance transition plan as current ICANN framework is set to expire in October. 10. MOLECULAR COMMUNICATIONSMolecular communication is an emerging paradigm where bio-nanomachines (e.g., artificial cells, genetically engineered cells) communicate to perform coordinated actions. Unlike traditional communication systems which utilize electromagnetic waves, molecular communications utilize biological molecules both as carriers and as information. The advantages provided by this \u201cmolecular\u201d approach to communications are size, biocompatibility, and biostability. Examples of applications are drug delivery system (DDS), bio-hybrid implants, and lab-on-a-chip (LoC) systems. This trend is not ready for mass market but with an approach so radically different to Today\u2019s communications, following its developments is a must. ",

IoT becomes BIoT The biggest mistake most prognosticators make is underestimating the potential for fast growth in our hyper-connected worldAutomobiles took time to catch on because would-be drivers had to wait for roads and gas stations to be built. But today\u2019s disruptive innovations rely on existing infrastructure for mobile devices that puts most companies just a few clicks from billions of consumers. One of those is the Internet of things (IoT), which involves adding smart sensors to connected devices so that users can do things like ask Amazon\u2019s Alexa digital assistant to turn off the lights or order a pizza. But blockchain, one of the underlying technologies for the hot cryptocurrency bitcoin, can make IoT devices even more useful. It creates a digital record across hundreds or thousands of computers, vastly reducing the risk of hacking. Combining IoT with blockchain \u2014or BIoT\u2014ushers in a whole host of new services and businesses. For example, BIoT can be used to track shipments of pharmaceuticals and to create smart cities in which connected heating systems better controls energy use and connected traffic lights better manage rush hour. In 2018, companies will begin to use Application Programming Interfaces, or software used to connect different databases and computer services. Combined with the blockchain Internet of things, it will be as easy to get data from sensors in a warehouse as accessing websites on our mobile phones. When manufacturers, retailers, regulators, and transportation companies have real-time data from sensors imbedded on products, trucks and ships, everyone in the distribution chain can benefit from insights that they were previously unable to get. With BIoT, companies and consumers can also be assured that their most valuable data on the blockchain cannot be hacked. 2. The fintech renaissance While bitcoin and blockchain were grabbing the headlines in 2017, social and mobile payments have fundamentally changed the financial markets. In China, mobile payment volumes now exceed $5 trillion annually. All aspects of the payments chain are open to disruption as blockchain speeds clearing house functions while smart contracts handle settlements. In 2018, look for biometrics such as facial recognition, voice ID, and fingerprints to help make shopping far quicker \u2014by eliminating the need to swipe a credit card at checkout, for instance. Instead, you will be able to verify your identity for a merchant scanning your eyes with your smartphone, in what\u2019s known as a retinal payment. A bold clairvoyant could even predict that some major retailers will hop on the cryptocurrency bandwagon and issue their own secure currency next year. Fintech will likely also become greener in 2018. With cryptocurrencies reaching over $300 billion in total value, there is now a financial incentive for investments into quantum computing, which involves using the behavior of energy at a subatomic level to process computing functions at a billion times faster than today\u2019s microprocessors.

By saying \u201cData information is the oil, some state the gold, of the 21st century Joe Kaeser (Siemens CEO), summarized it superbly \u201c. 4. IoT (Internet Of Things) To remain competitive in the of Digitial Transformation, major companies developing advanced technology-based products. There is high growth we see for IoT based applications and software. Internet of Things (IoT) market of Australia caters to various applications such as connected logistics, smart retail, smart mobility & transportation, building & home automation and others. Let\u2019s understand the position of IoT Applications in 2020 \u2013 8.4 billion Internet of things IoT Solutions were used in 2017 which is determined by Gartner and up to 31 % from 2016 it is assumed to reach 20.4 billion by 2020. Gartner anticipates that technological budget spending plans should be developed by 2.1% in corporate and legislative parts across Australia which is slightly below the worldwide average that is 2.8%. 5. AR / VR Applications AR/VR applications are on the boom as per Australia Survey. AR/VR based software and tools are increasingly providing comprehensive, interactive and engaging learning options to support skills acquisition and transfer. Let\u2019s have an example, Pok\u00e9mon Go presumably raised enormous attention to the capability of Augmented Reality(AR) and has made the establishment over $2.45 Billion simultaneously. In 2017, 46% of Americans utilized AR/VR Apps and by 2020, specialists are anticipating that there will be more than 1 Billion Augmented Reality clients all around. 6. Quantum Computing Richard Feynman proposed QC in the 1980s and it has charmed individuals from that point onward. Quantum Computing utilizes sub-nuclear particles to speak to data and guarantees preparing power higher than the quickest of the present semiconductor-based supercomputers. Notable improvements in this field are occurring directly here in Australia as well, with UNSW as of late structure the initial two-qubit door, which can work complex issues at 0.8 nanoseconds or multiple times quicker than past research. 7. Expanded Data Governance GDPR has set the bar high and it is conceived that this will currently set the standard. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) will become effective in 2020 which again will prepare for more grounded information administration and assurances. Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft have all turned out and are empowering progressive guidelines here too. I believe this is most likely a reasonable shielding procedure since they would prefer not to follow Mark Zuckerberg and need to sit before congress protecting themselves. 8. Xaas This is certifiably not another term, in 2020 we will see it being utilized all the more broadly. With expanded globalization and the pace at which innovation advancement moves, organizations are currently reclassifying their item and services contributions continually. 9. Voice Recognition Technology Voice Recognition has developed enormously as of late and it will just keep on developing. Financial speculators, Kleiner Perkins expressed that in June 2015 Siri dealt with more than 1 billion solicitations each week; and in May 2016, 1 out of 5 pursuits on Android were voice-looked. Andrew Ng, Chief Scientist at Baidu, predicts that come 2020, half of the searches will be through voice. 10. Edge Computing Edge Computing is a distributed processing framework that brings calculation and information stockpiling nearer to the area where it is required. The purpose of this is to improve reaction time and spare transmission capacity. The expansion of the Internet of things (IoT) devices at the edge of the system is creating a monstrous measure of information to be registered to server farms in this way stretching the data transfer system as far as necessary. With the inexhaustible increment in the measure of IoT devices expected in 2020 \u2018Edge Computing\u2019 will be standard. All in all, technology is boundless, and we are setting out on an unparalleled time ahead. Talking about: AR/VR applications, AI & Machine Learning solutions, IoT Softwares and Applications, and Blockchain Development appears to be something from a science fiction film, and this is our current innovative scene. It will be a fascinating year ahead yet technology won\u2019t supplant every human asset\u2026 for now in any event. For more upcoming updates on IT trend you can click here: Blog ",
