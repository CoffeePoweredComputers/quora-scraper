            "answer_text": "The tech that humans master is too young, too simple, too naive. Inefficient use of energy The level of human energy use still stays at the level of \"Boiling the Water,\" and it just rings the changes of \"Method\" garishly. Yes, we convert Energy into Power by \u201dboiling the water,\u201c which has a low energy conversion rate. Today's principle of nuclear fission reactor power generation is not fundamentally different from steam engines hundreds of years ago! Regardless of the current thermal power or nuclear power, it is heating water: heat converts water into steam, and the steam drives the turbine to generate electricity. (Note: The conversion rate of nuclear fission we use today is only 0.135%) It is most likely that human beings will not be able to \"go out\" the solar system, and even be \"trapped\" to die on earth! The nuclear fusion conversion rate is 0.7%. If nuclear fusion power generation is realized, it may alleviate the current energy crisis. It is not enough for interstellar flight. (Note: As science fiction says that \"Positive and Anti-Matter Annihilation\" is the most efficient, can achieve 100% quality conversion, can help us fly out of the solar system. ) Realistically, if we fail to master the controllable nuclear fusion before depleting fossil energy, it is not only \"Civilization Retrogression,\" but the entire human sci and tech civilization will be \"locked out\" until we die. Because in those days we will be unable to \"organize higher-scale industrialization\" and not be able to further test our scientific theory. Human beings are powerless and insignificant. Think of Traveler 1, the man-made object farthest from the Earth, and the fastest man-made object. It takes 40,000 years to fly to the AC+79 3888 star of Ophiuchus. It takes 73,600 to fly to Proxima Centauri of Centaur. The interstellar voyage for it is just a simple fantastic lies. How negligible us? Please be humble~ As for interstellar travel, if the person who does not wear the spacesuit leaves the surface layer, just like \"The deep sea fish leave the deep sea will detonate himself\", yes, in any other environment, the human body will be vulnerable to \"cannot withstand even a single blow\". Hey, we humans are the creatures born in the surface environment. We are destined to be inseparable from such environment, and it is even more difficult to cross the \"space measured by light years.\" The earth is the cradle of humankind and it will surely be our destination and cemetery. Almost all of the Earthian is still bound by gravity, and it is difficult to fly out of it. Humans used to go to the moon with \"The primeval Chemical Rocket,\" but never went to Mars. Most people are trapped in the earth's tiny plot of land, let alone the universe. Although we can now \"observe dozens of billions of light years of the universe\", no matter how influential bigwigs can't leave the earth. They can only be like the common people who feet can't leave the ground. Exhausting the limits of the power of human tech can barely enough landing on the moon, its number can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The natural resources in the universe are inexhaustible, but we can only divide into some hostile factions, scheme against each other, intrigued, mutual suspicion, resorting to deception\u2026 excessive competition for such a little bit of unremarkable resource on earth. The human civilization at this stage is still too primitive. I really want to \"strive for the cause of human civilization in the universe all my lifetime\", but now I can only \"work for the sake of making a living and fortune\", such a life is not reconciled. We even have not been able to explore the earth. In terms of crustal exploration, the deepest borehole that our drilled has just reached more than 10,000 meters depth. Our drill bit with difficulty went to the bottom of the crust for humans and took a look at the edge of the mantle. This depth is only equivalent to \"The worm takes a bite of apple peel.\" This is why we cannot predict earthquakes because even the \"normal state\" of the crust can only be inferred by indirect evidence, and the judgment of its \"abnormal state\" is even more unreliable. \u2026 Summary It seems that some of today inventions of \"redoubtable and formidable\" are mostly the advancement of Applied Science, not the progress of Basic Science. The development of personal computers is only consistently integrated and shrinking smaller, supercomputers are always stacking and piled up, naturally, their computing performance is strengthened\u2026But quantitative change is unlikely to trigger a qualitative change. It won't bring us quantum computers. The so-called \"innovative tide and creative spoondrift\" is just something \"in application-level.\" Basic theory has been stagnant for a long time, and superstring theory has not progressed for many years. In any case, \"Basic Theory\" is the \"source power\" of human sci and tech development. Tomorrow, we may have some room for growth in the application of tech, but the development of the \"fundamental power\" has not been reformed for a long time!

            "answer_text": "To answer this question, we have to compare our level of technology to something else. As I like thinking about the future, I\u2019m just going to compare it to how far it looks like we still have to go before we\u2019ve \u201cfinished\u201d. I\u2019m going to define the finish line with the following phrase: Anything that\u2019s theoretically possible is practically possible. In other words, if we can conceive of an idea, and it\u2019s possible given the laws of physics, we have the technology that makes it a reality. In that sense, we\u2019re just getting started. We\u2019re so far from that point that if we represent that end point today, we\u2019re probably at the point where we invented fire. Let\u2019s look at some possibilities: TRANSPORT Today, the fastest thing we can travel in is a rocket. We do this by burning the remains of old plants and dinosaurs in massive machines that weigh hundreds of tons. If we can \u201ce-mail\u201d our consciousness to an avatar outside of our atmosphere, we can then travel in something that can go nearly the speed of light using something like antimatter as a fuel source, and if it\u2019s possible to circumvent that limit, we will. HEALTH Right now, we\u2019re vulnerable to infectious diseases, we age, and we get a whole lot of diseases that stem from that. Once we\u2019ve mastered nanotechnology and can create things at the same scale that nature does but with more precision and with actual intent rather than random chance, we can come up with an alternate design for the human body that is far less susceptible to these diseases, uses less energy, uses a more efficient and more easily manufactured SOURCE of energy, and has advanced enough repair mechanisms that it doesn\u2019t degrade over time. It\u2019s possible there are an incalculable number of possible designs meeting this criteria so we can switch between them if we like. ENTERTAINMENT Pong was released in 1972. The game consists of 2 numbers, a dotted line, 2 lines and a dot. 45 years later, our games almost look photorealistic. We\u2019re starting to see the first VR and AR that doesn\u2019t make us ill or embarrass us. Eventually our simulations will become so good that we reach Matrix-level: we can\u2019t distinguish it from the real world. There can be any number of these worlds and our participation in them can be as lifelike as we want them to be. As for art, when you boil it down to first principles (not to sound too much like Elon Musk :D), these are ways of using stimuli to manipulate the way we feel and think. We can do this directly in the future by just manipulating the structure of our own brains or the levels of neurotransmitters (assuming we\u2019re still using them). Alternatively, if we want to do it the old fashioned way, we\u2019ll know exactly how stimuli affects the brain in the future so we\u2019ll be able to \u201csolve\u201d art for any combination of senses we might use, including new ones we can\u2019t even describe yet. So as you can see, we\u2019ve still got an enormous amount of development to look forward to. Let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t kill ourselves before we get to enjoy all of this :D ",
