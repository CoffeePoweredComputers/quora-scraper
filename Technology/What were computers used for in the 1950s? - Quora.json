            "answer_text": "Well for two things, accounting and weapons development. I started in computers in 1952 with thousands and thousands of pieces of paper called \u201cpunch cards\u201d. In many respects there were only a few major computers. Mostly, there was IBM and its Card Punch Calculator. It had mechanical memory, a huge printer machine and a card reader. I saw it in the weapons development side of the business. It was later replaced with the 650 and a series of 700 computers. The punch card was a piece of cardboard .007 inches thick with provision for 80 rows capable of indicating, a digit, a capital letter, a lower case letter or a symbol. Input was from these cards created by keypunch operators from devices called key punch machines. There was some activity from Remington Rand, but I was never involved with this side of the business. My work took me all over the United States, wherever there was military development. From the deserts of California (Edwards AFB) to the sands of Florida (Eglin AFB, Tindall AFB or what became Kennedy). I ended up at Alamogordo, NM for a three year stent ending in 1959. After marring, I moved into more general electronics but I have never regretted the early years when computing was a revolution. ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 take this bit from Early Popular Computers, 1950 - 1970 into consideration: By comparison, in the early 1950s, only the largest firms and institutions could afford a computer. Leasing for about $200,000 per month in inflation-adjusted 2010 dollars, a large-scale computer occupied roughly a hundred square meters, used thousands of vacuum tubes, consumed over a hundred kilowatts, and needed a full-time operating and maintenance staff So, all-in monthly expenses were on the order of half a million a month, in a world where it was \u201coverhead\u201d - an alternative to paying people to do the same job albeit much more slowly. There were exceptions - and that\u2019s where you actually found the computers. Defense was always a huge customer. Science and engineering - oil companies were very rapid to introduce both computer use in seismic processing and reservoir modeling, for instance; aerospace companies used them as well for analysis and modeling, shortening engineering turn times by several orders of magnitude. The interesting thing was that computers targeted either science and engineering, or business data processing (which had to that point been done manually, or via punch card systems which sorted and collated data based on \u201cwhere the holes were\u201d!) but not both, until the IBM 1401 appeared in the 1960s, and even it was originally a programmable punch card data processing system that \u201cgrew\u201d a Fortran II compiler and given the price point was seen as a more attractive solution to a number of engineering problems\u2026 ",
