            "answer_text": "I live it a 19ft geodesic dome that I made out of cutting up galvanized conduit pipe, crimping the ends and bolting the pieces together. I covered it with shrink wrap plastic then sprayed papercrete over it. Point is, it was not that hard\u2026. but it was only 19ft. Now I just tried calculating how much lift would be generated by a 10ft sphere with air inside at 100f and outside at 70f at sea level\u2026 so just 30 degrees difference. Unless I totally screwed this up, the sphere would hold 523 ft3. A cubic ft of air at 70f is 0.07492lbs at 100f it is 0.07090lbs according to this chart Air Density and Specific Weight (please note that the values in the chart are multiplied by 100 for some reason) So that works out to be about 2.10lbs of lift for a 10ft sphere with a 30f difference. This scales up quickly with diameter. A 20ft sphere would have ~ 4190 ft3 and would generate ~ 16.84 lbs of lift. 30ft would be 454lbs 40ft would be 1077lbs. So 40ft starts to look interesting. Now I can tell you the weight of all the conduit pipe I used is less than 300lbs\u2026 and my dome is 19ft diameter with an extra 4ft on the bottom. I expect using ligher conduit (1/2 inch instead of 3/4) and using aluminium instead of steel and making a 2v instead of a 3v dome (see here: The 2v Dome Calculator) that 40 ft of lattice would easily be under 400lbs. I suspend a trampoline from the lattice to sleep on and me + the trampoline + all the junk I store up there is easily over 500lbs and the 3v lattice has no problem holding this from \u201cinternal pressure as another commenter mentioned. So.. this seems entirely doable by any idiot with a few days of free time, a several thousand dollars of aluminium tubing and a bunch of palette wrap painted black. I can tell you even my white insulated dome gets really hot inside without AC during the day. Even brief sun exposure would easily heat this more than 30 degrees difference. If you use fiberglass or carbon fiber rods for the lattice it would be even lighter. I would guess even a 35 ft diameter geodesic sphere could lift itself and a few passengers. Another thing to consider would be that besides heating the air, you could use a vacuum pump to pull air out with the geodesic structure maintaining the volume. Can\u2019t do this with a normal hot air balloon. Also I just found this: Why dry air is heavier than humid air So it turns out that humid air is significantly lighter than dry air. Meaning that in dry environments you could increase your lift by pumping steam into the sphere. \u201cWater powered air ship?\u201d EDIT: The first verion of this post I misread the units in the air weight chart\u2026 they specify it as (lb/ft3) x 10^-2., So I was off by 100x. I was just about to build myself an airship\u2026 but I thought \u201cIt can\u2019t be this easy\u201d so I went back and looked at that chart. Still, a 35\u201340ft 2v sphere would not be that difficult. So it still seems entirely doable. EDIT2: I looked up 1/2 OD x .049 wall x .402 ID aluminum tubing. It is about 1lb for a 10ft piece. A 40ft 2d sphere would need about 120 of these (12.36ft * 60 and 10.93ft * 60)\u2026 so about 170lbs of structure after bolts etc. Then whatever the covering weighs. If pallet wrap then probably less than 100lbs. So roughly 300lbs of structure for over 700lbs of lift. It looks like carbon fibre of the same strength would be less than half that weight\u2026 but a lot more expensive. Aluminum would be about $5000\u2026 cheaper if it is thinner or smaller diameter\u2026. not sure what would be needed.  ",

Lets see ...... unless you build scalloped platforms up the sides you could only build on a very small circle at the bottom of the sphere otherwise people and structures would be at an angle.  Oddly this would also be the same area you would have to provide an opening in or you would have an enclosed system (completely dependent on it's internal capacity to recycle air).  Third while a geodesic dome or sphere is highly resistant to external pressure it's resistance to internal pressure (any structures built inside) is much lower. I could go on but that will do for starters. tl;dr  Nice Idea but no current tech would not permit it.  IMPO ",
