            "answer_text": "Internet entrepreneur is a very new age term and getting very popular these days. Internet entrepreneur is typically a person who runs most of his business over the internet and his primary sources of income is from the product or service he sells over the internet. This typically began with the age of blogging where entrepreneurs started blogging about things like travel, food, car reviews, gadget reviews etc. This slowly transformed into video blogging or vlog for similar topics. Social media websites can also be considered a part of this domain. E-commerce is something that I feel is not really to be considered in the segment of internet entrepreneurship because the internet is just a way of selling your products that exist physically. ",

            "answer_text": "An internet entrepreneur is someone who creates an internet-based business. Web design, affiliate marketing, business coaching, or specialized retailers are all examples of internet-based enterprises an internet entrepreneur might start. Tim Seidler is an example of an internet entrepreneur, he makes money online with various products including a blog. There are internet entrepreneurs who make money using affiliate marketing strategies. An internet entrepreneur might have a consulting business that is internet based where people visit their site for a service but makes additional income by endorsing other products from companies that pay the internet entrepreneur to do so. Right now there are many opportunities for internet entrepreneurs in part because everything that can be sold is being sold - online. Additionally, these markets are expanding every day alongside the growing number of people using the internet. Internet entrepreneurs will grow in number too so long as there is space to be filled in these markets. ",
