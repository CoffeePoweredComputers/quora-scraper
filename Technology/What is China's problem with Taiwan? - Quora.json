            "answer_text": "The answer from Z Liu is quite comprehensive, yet inaccurate in certain aspects. As long as these factual bits are made clear, I think his answer basically covers all the key points of the cross-strait situation we have today: Taiwan sees itself as independent. China sees Taiwan as just a province of China. Taiwan sees itself as an independent entity, which may (the RoC) or may not (the \u201cindependent Taiwan state\u201d) include the rest of the RoC\u2019s other (\u201clegitimate\u201d) territories depending on different people\u2019s different political beliefs. Taiwan is where it is today since it had governed mainland China in the past as ROC. CCP defeated ROC in a civil war following WII and Taiwan, under US protection, became the escape for ROC government officials and families. The US protection (which was re-established on the legal basis in the 1970s) was something offered later, as Harry Truman became more hostile towards \u201cCommunist China\u201d in the 1950s. Before that the US basically gave up on the RoC regime. For some, Taiwan was in fact a forced escape as the KMT made them relocate to Taiwan: Students, soldiers and spies - Taipei Times. 1950 became the year when CCP declared control of China as PRC. It wasn\u2019t until 1971 that CCP actually became the representative of China for the United Nations, stripping ROC of that status. 1949 was the more official time (Oct. 1st, 1949), but yes, some battles were still being fought on the mainland in 1950. Taiwan has a different form of government than PRC, and has been able to remain that way under the policy of one china two systems introduced in the 80s by Deng Xiaoping. For the Taiwanese, they would say they have a different form of government because they have been a de-facto independent political entity never governed by the PRC, so Deng\u2019s \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d policy was never applied to them in reality. That said, the PRC has been trying to achieve unification peacefully under the One China, Two Systems principle. Taiwan thus sees China as a threat to its system of government, and China sees Taiwan as a threat to its unification and stability. Indeed. China has a policy that allows for war if Taiwan declares to become independent. Which is called \u53cd\u5206\u88c2\u56fd\u5bb6\u6cd5: Anti-Secession Law. It\u2019s a law, which is kind of more serious than a policy. It serves as a still relatively vague benchmark for Taiwanese actions that may trigger military responses. Pro-Independence has dominated Taiwanese politics under the dismay of China. The overwhelming hope of the Taiwanese people is maintaining the status quo (de-facto independence, plus de-jure unification). This is the trend in all kinds of polls in recent years. Taiwan and China thus exist solely out of conflict, specifically China\u2019s civil war. These conflicts thus are deeply rooted in the relationship between China and Taiwan, and may be difficult or impossible to directly solve: China and Taiwan both are or have been the official government of post-dynastic/imperial China. Bravo.  Bonus fun fact: There are two universities that have the same name: Tsinghua and National Tsing Hua university. The latter is in Taiwan, which was founded after the president and its affiliates escaped to Taiwan following the civil war. The former was the original Tsinghua University that was reinstated by the CCP. Two different Universities, but have the same origin and thus the same name. In fact there are numerous pairs of such universities across the strait: The Jiaotong Universities (in Shanghai, Xi\u2019an, etc.) in Mainland China and National Chiao-Tung University in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The two Soochow Universities (one in Suzhou and one in Taipei). Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, Mainland China and National Sun Yat-Sen University in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Et cetera, et cetera. ",

            "answer_text": "Taiwan, is the island to the Southeast of mainland China, with 23million residents, also known as Republic of China by many. To know the root of Taiwan\u2019s problem, we have to go through the histories. In 1644, the farmer rebels took over Beijing. The last emperor of Ming, ChongZhen, hanged himself which marked the end of Ming Empire. Soon after, Qing took the chance and declared itself the legitimate ruler of China and started its expansion southwards. Because of Qing\u2019s Manchurian identity, it was not widely accepted during its early stages. Round of rebellions were seen throughout China, with an aim to \u201cAnti-Qing, restore Ming\u201d. Among many who were fighting against Qing\u2019s rule, Zheng Chinegong is one the most famous as he expelled the Dutch from Taiwan in 1661, and then used it as a base to resist Qing. At the time, it is believed he had plans to march south to the Philippines, but Zheng died soon after it campaign in Taiwan. After his death, Qing tried to persuade Zheng\u2019s son to accept Qing\u2019s rule but failed. Twenty years later, when Zheng\u2019s family had internal affairs, Shi Lang, a former Zheng\u2019s general who surrendered Qing, led an army attacked and seized control of Taiwan in 1683. Starting then, Taiwan has been under Qing\u2019s rule until 1895. Year 1840 is China\u2019s mark of the division of its modern and ancient history. The Opium war broke out in that year and Qing had to cede Hong Kong island to British empire. This war was iconic as it started China\u2019s 100-year history of humiliation that ceding territory, signing unequal treaties were the main theme throughout. In 1894, Japan declared war against Qing. After Qing was lost, Japan asked for a huge reparation and Taiwan. Starting then, Taiwan was ruled by the Japanese until the end of WWII. In 1945, according to the Potsdam declaration article 8 based on the Cairo Declaration that \u201c\u2026 Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands\u2026.\u201d So after WWII, Taiwan was returned to Qing\u2019s successor, the Republic of China. Peaceful time was short. In 1946, the Chinese Civil War broke out (some call it second as there was a round of fighting from 1927\u20131937). The war was fought between two parties, the Kuomintang (the nationalist representing the Republic of China), and the Communist. After 4 years of fighting, KMT lost to CCP and retreated to Taiwan. In late 1949, the People\u2019s republic of China was established and there was a campaign fought in Jinmen (Battle of Guningtou) where CCP lost around 10,000 men, known to be one of the major defeats CCP had. That\u2019s why you see there are a couple of islands under the rule of ROC today that\u2019s right next to the mainland. So was that single defeat stopped the CCP from liberating the entire country including Taiwan? No. Hainan Island was liberated in 1950 though much more closer to the mainland compared to Taiwan. So was Tibet, the full liberation was achieved in 1951. Why Taiwan was unique? In 1950, Korean War broke out. Then, the US intervened. United States Seventh Fleet sailed to Taiwan straight and declared \u201cneutrality across Taiwan straight\u201d which preserved ROC until today. So starting that day, China\u2019s problem over Taiwan has already been escalated to a problem between China and the US. It\u2019s a card that the US plays whenever Sino-US relationship dips. Fun fact, CCP and KMT never signed any peace treaties, both parties wouldn\u2019t acknowledge the other\u2019s legitimacy. When Xi met with Ma in 2015 in Singapore, they addressed each other using \u201cMr.\u201c, not chairman nor president. Technically speaking, the civil has never ended, except that the mainland now uses \u201cpeaceful unification\u201d strategies prior to a military conflict. So, what is China\u2019s problem with Taiwan, it\u2019s an internal affair that Taiwan claims to be the legitimate ruler of China while mainland China claims to be the legitimate ruler and the previous ruler is \u201cdead\u201d. Internationally, all agrees that there is One China and countries can choose 1 from the 2 but not both, known as \u201cOne China policy\u201d. There are a group of people inside Taiwan think that they should just be itself as an independent country or just claim itself as Taiwan. Sadly speaking, mainland wouldn\u2019t allow this to happen, and quite a lot of mainlanders wouldn\u2019t allow this to happen. It\u2019s a historical carry over, what haven\u2019t been solved has to be solved. If you go to Jinmen or Xiamen, you can see two painted slogans, on the mainland side it says \u201cOne country, two system unifies China.\u201d While on the Jinmen side it is \u201cThree principles of the people unifies China\u201d. So to me, it is sad to see, One country, two system is still in the game, but I don\u2019t hear Three principles of the people any more. ",
