            "answer_text": "In 1964 Nikolai Kardashev, responding to Freeman Dyson\u2019s 1959 paper on the possibility of certain types of very large stars with low surface temperatures equal to room temperature actually being the result of alien intelligences building a sphere around their star (Dyson sphere), developed a Scale of technical civilisations based on energy use. These include; Type 1: Planetary, where they control all the energy on their own planet. Type 2: Stellar, where they control all the energy in their own solar system. Type 3: Galactic, where they control all the energy in their own galaxy.  In 1973 my friend Carl Sagan normalised this scale, putting numbers to it. The sun illuminates the Earth with 1368 Watts/m2 of sunlight and the size of the Earth\u2019s shadow is 127.5 trillion square meters. So, the Earth intercepts 1.744*10^17 Watts. The Earth is 215 solar radii away from the Sun. So, the intensity of sunlight on the surface of the Sun is 1368 W/m2 * 215^2 = 63.24 MW/m2. The surface area of the sun is 6.1*10^18 m2. So the sun\u2019s total output is 3.8*10^26 Watts. The galaxy has 400 billion stars and altogether they put out about 100 billion times what the Sun puts out. 10^26 Watts. So, Sagan normalised Kardashev\u2019s description by noting a factor of 10^10 between each class, and proposed the following figures Type 1: 10^16 Watts, Type 2: 10^26 Watts, Type 3: 10^36 Watts Others have noted that there are about 100 billion galaxies in the observable cosmos and have proposed Type 4: 10^46 watts. Sagan\u2019s formula allows us to interpolate between classes by using a figure K,  which gives K = 0.725527 for humanity today. At 3% growth we will attain K=1 in  213.81 years (2233 AD) We of course will be spread out far from Earth. Otherwise the biosphere and we would be overwhelmed by our waste heat. We will be Kardashev K=2 civilisation in  992.80 years (3013 AD) We of course will be spread out far from the Sun at this time, just as we were far from Earth when we approach K=1. Kardashev K=3 civilisation in  1771.78 years (3792 AD) Now spreading out to the galaxy and the cosmos beyond requires that we move near light speed. When that happens time dilates. That is, time slows down for people and machinery in high speed motion. That means as energy levels increase the speed at which things move increases, and our proper time slows down.  Our reproductive rate slows down as well. What doesn\u2019t slow down is loss rate of star ships with distance. So, at some point the rate of loss equals the rate at which people are born across all of human space, and beyond that range human numbers decline exponentially, and the total region of the cosmos dominated by humanity is fixed and with it energy use. This is an answer to the Fermi Paradox. There are 7.5 billion humans on Earth today and they mass 69 kg each on average. So the total mass of humanity is 5.18 million tons. With 6.9 tonnes per person being the weight of a machine to keep them alive in space indefinitely, total mass is 100x that or 518 million tons. Human population grows at 1% per year. So, in 213.81 years total mass of humanity is 5.18*1.01^213.81 = 43.48 million tons and machinery is 100x that or 4.35 billion tons. Power level is 10^16 Watts. Sufficient to accelerate 100x the mass of all of humanity to 483.7 m/s in a year using reflected light. In 992.8 years we have 5.18*1.01*992.80 = 5.194 billion tons and machinery is 100x that or 51.94 billion tons. Power level is 10^26 Watts. Sufficient to accelerate 100x the mass of all of humanity at a 654.9 g acceleration using photonic rocketry. This is sufficient to travel 100,000 light years in 19.4865 days ship time and at the half way point 50,000 light years in your journey, you are moving at 0.9999999999999996 c. At this speed 1 second aboard the Starship is equal to 13 months of star time. The trip takes 100,000 years star time. Instantaneous Power Power is the time rate of change of energy. Rapid energy release means a lot of power. Kardashev classes civilisations according to power. Power over what period of time? Well continuous power. But nothing is continuous. Humanity did not exist at some point in the past and presumably will cease to exist at some point in the future. That entire period of time what astronomer Frank Drake termed L = lifetime in his famous equation. Against the cosmic scale of time the human epoch will be just a blip. Our usage of energy at any time will seem like an instant. So, there is a strong argument that if Kardashev scale means anything, it means our instantaneous use of power. This means instead of a smoothed scale, we have an irregular scale that bounces around as we turn things on and off. We can smooth and average and to regression analysis of the data, but at least using instantaneous power we don\u2019t throw away any data.  October 30, 1961 - Tsar Bomba So, 18 TW is the average rate at which humanity uses primary fuels today. Does the use of instantaneous power change that? Oh yes. You see humanity at times detonates H-bombs. A big one like Tsar Bomba release the equivalent of 58 megatons of TNT. That\u2019s 242.7*10^15 Joules. How fast? This will give us our instantaneous power rating. Well, Tsar Bomba is primarily Lithium-6 Deuteride exposed to a neutron flux from a smaller atomic bomb used as a detonator. The famous Ulam Teller design. This fusion fuel contains 270.3 TJ/kg. So, 242.7*10^15 Joules is 897.9 kg of the fusion fuel. It has a density of 850 kg/m3. 1056 liters of material. If packed in a sphere around a small atomic bomb detonator it has a radius of 63.2 cm. The neutrons move at about light speed so, the traverse the weapon detonating it all in 2 nanoseconds. So, 242.7*10^15 Joules divided by 2 nanoseconds is a rate of power release of 1.21*10^26 Watts - which is Kardashev 2+. Which makes sense since we\u2019ve mastered the fusion processes in the Sun to create the bomb in the first place. So, we are ALREADY a Kardashev Class II civlisation by this calculation, we just don\u2019t know it yet. Or maybe we do, but our leaders aren\u2019t telling us about it!    ",

            "answer_text": "The Earth's solar input is roughly 173,000 TW (1.73E+17 W), while current human power consumption is roughly 18 TW. So we are approximately 0.01% of the way there. To get to 173,000 TW purely from solar input we'll need to coat the planet in 100% efficient solar cells, which is impossible since the theoretical maximum efficiency is 95%. More likely, we'll need to build a large amount of off-planet energy sources, and Earth itself will never reach Type 1. Instead, Earth might become Type 0.1, while we as a civilization become Type 1 through controlling various energy sources spread throughout our solar system (other planets, spaceships, etc.). How are we going to get this energy? At the moment over 65% of our energy comes from burning dead dinosaurs. There aren't enough of them left to enable us to reach Type 1 for more than an instant.Useable geothermal energy reserves could theoretically provide 2E+24 Joule, which would last a few months at Type 1 consumption levels. The biosphere definitely wouldn't like all that extra energy being released though.Nuclear reserves could provide 2.5E+27 Joule. This is over 1000 times as long as geothermal, but still less than 1000 years. Again, definitely don't want to do that indoors.Forget hydro or wind - not even close.This leaves us with solar or fusion. We could cover 15% of Earth, and hang lots of solar panels in space - maybe as a set of nice photogenic rings. Plus we can coat the inner rocky worlds of Mercury, Mars, our Moon and lots of asteroids in solar panels (Venus is too cloudy). Solar panels are currently in the 20-40% efficiency range, so this might be enough. Mining the rocky worlds should yield enough mineral resource for this to work.If we get fusion working on a massive scale, we are definitely set. We will definitely want to place all of that extra energy off-world or we will become like Venus.So in theory we can do it, via a known technology (solar) or a not-yet-proven technology (fusion). The main problem is finding sustainable business models for it to happen. ",
