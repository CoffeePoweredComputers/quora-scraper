            "answer_text": "\u201cIf an asteroid was heading towards Earth, would it be easier to change its trajectory so that it hits the Moon rather than avoid Earth? \u201c Would it be easier? That all depends on the expected relative motions of the moon, the Earth, and the asteroid if you DON\u2019T do anything. Let\u2019s go through a few scenarios: When the asteroid would arrive without changing its trajectory, the Earth would be BETWEEN the asteroid and the Moon. Answer: Of course it would NOT be easier to cause it to hit the Moon instead of merely missing the Earth, because either it would have to miss the Earth in order to REACH the Moon, or else you would have to slow it down enough that the Moon would come around the Earth in its orbit to be between the Earth and the asteroid. Oh, except that if you do that, then the Earth will have passed the point at which the asteroid would have intersected its orbit by a few million miles by the time it gets there two weeks later than it normally would have.The Moon is off to one side or the other from the path of the asteroid when it arrives. Answer: Again, it would have to be moved enough to completely miss the Earth in order to hit the Moon. Remember that the Moon is 238,000 miles from the Earth, and an asteroid technically only needs to miss the surface of the Earth by a couple of hundred miles to pass by safely (of course, we would feel a whole lot safer if it passed by at least 10,000 miles away, but I\u2019m talking minimum distance here). So causing it to miss by a tiny fraction of the distance between the Earth and the Moon would be far easier.The Moon is going to be nearly between the asteroid and the Earth anyway. THIS is the only scenario in which it would be easier to cause an asteroid to strike the Moon instead of just missing the Earth. And this is a very small window, only about 10,000 miles wide, in an orbit which is almost 1.5 Million miles in circumference.So, there is a tiny chance that your suggestion, because of the timing of the event, would be easier than just causing a miss, but in the vast majority of the cases, it would not.

            "answer_text": "This is not my field of expertise but it seems like a lot of this talk with the experts is \u201ctheory\u201d , and only objective truths. However, I understand pressure(vaccum in space ), mass, combustion, velocity, and metals very well because I'm an HVAC engineer. In also a big fan of astrology, and metaphysics , I understand phases our moon goes through, and it's position . So give me some credit here. I can tell you the answer is relative to how close that thing is. Let's assume you're referring to a doomsday sized astroid the size of Texas, and it's travelling 80,000MPH. Steering something like that into the moon will at least partially shatter the moon and if that happens , then you're going to create inevitable destruction on Earth, and let's just say some miracle happens where all these chunks don't come hurling down to earth, you will have to deal with something else destructive.. If there's one thing that will screw over our economy , and cause chaos, it's going to be wild unpredictable weather patterns, and other natural disasters as the earth struggles to readjust itself to a change in gravitational pull from the Moon. Expect many destructive earthquakes , and deadly tsunamis for many years ahead. That's your best case scenario. But back to your original question, can it be done? Yes, and no. It depends on how big that thing is how fast it's traveling and how far it is. We don't have the technology to completely steer an astroid that size into the moon if it's only 100k miles from the moon. We would have to set off a series of impacts that bump it off course, and that's assuming we hit the right spot..a little too much off spot and it's going too far to the right, or too far to the left of up of down. Our best bet is to utilize laser technology . It's easier to direct a laser than it is to direct missiles at an object travelling 10s of thousands of miles per hour. Our only chance is to either make it explode into tiny pieces or split it so that it veers off course I'm any other direction but us and our moon. So the answer is close to no. We don't have tech . We have to get lucky ",
