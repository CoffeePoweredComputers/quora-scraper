A plane that can fly anywhere in the world in 4 hours  The British aerospace firm Reaction Engines is working on a plane that can fly anywhere in the world for just four hours. The plane will also to fly in outer space. In the video, chief Engineer Alan Bond explained that air entering the new \u201cSabre\u201d engine system could be cooled by more than 1,000 degrees Celsius in .01 seconds. The cooling rate will be at 400 megawatts and will allow the plane to \u201cbreathe\u201d oxygen. That ability would allow a jet engine to run at higher power than what is possible today. More power equals more speed and therefore the plane will be able to fly at 5 times the speed of sound very easily. (Source)  2. Personal assistants  Soon, everyone will have a PA since artificial intelligence assistants will be making a proper entrance. Guile 3D Studio has developed an amazing AI assistant known as Denise. Once you install Denise to your computer, it is able to execute tasks on your behalf by either speaking or typing your request. Denise is able to check and send emails, manage your diary in case of meetings and appointments, draw up itineraries, search the web, give you the day\u2019s weather forecast, call someone on Skype, give you the day\u2019s news, upload videos on YouTube, upload images on Picasa and so much more.

One can play the piano, pick a cup and sip coffee with it. It gives back natural hand movement and weighs as much as a normal arm. It also looks pretty close to the real arm except for the fact that it\u2019s made of metal. The arm is directed by the brain just like a human arm. (Source) 4. Interaction change  Our interaction with people and things has changed over the years due to the internet, smart phones etc. But that\u2019s not all; in the near future a huge change will be made in the way we interact with surroundings. You will be able to look at a building or place and get the information on the subject using just your eyes. Goggles by Google have an early concept of this idea which is an app that allows you to take a picture of an object and immediately receive information about it on your android phone. According to Ray Kurzweil, a top futurist, \u201cby 2020 we\u2019ll routinely have pop ups in our visual field of view that give us background about the people and places that we\u2019re looking at. In other words, your memory will be constantly, instantaneously aided by the information available on the Internet. The two will begin to become indistinguishable.\u201d As the technology improves, you may be able to suggest a move in the chess game and more! (Source) 5. Jetpack technology  Jet pack international has made great strides in their jet pack technology H202 and H202-Z jet packs. This hydrogen peroxide fueled jet packs will allow users to fly at 77 miles per hour and at a maximum height of 250 ft for the H202-Z while the H202 will allow users to fly at a speed of 70 miles per hour at a maximum height of 250ft. (Source) 6. Energy  anotechnology is currently being used to design renewable energy technologies like solar energy. According to Kurzweil, \u201cthe cost per watt of solar energy is coming down rapidly and the total amount of solar energy is growing exponentially. It has in fact been doubling every two years for the past 20 years and is now only eight doublings away from meeting all of the world\u2019s energy needs.\u201d Sandia Solar Cells have come close to achieving this since they are made of 100 times less material than that of the current solar cells, operating at the same efficiency. Current panels are heavy and massive and require large motors to track them when tracking the sun. Sandia\u2019s cell on the other hand only needs to be moved a fraction of a millimeter for it to track the sun efficiently and it weighs close to nothing. (Source) 7. Estimote beacons  Estimote Beacons are small beautifully designed sensors that can be placed anywhere in the world. When you install them, either on a product shelf or next to a door, they start broadcasting tiny radio signals that can be picked up by smart phones. The app then triggers different actions like welcoming customers to a store, helping customers navigate the store and displaying coupons. (Source) 8. Health  Invetech, an Australian engineering firm, has teamed up with Organovo, a medical company, to produce a 3-D bio-printer that can fabricate organs to order. The device builds up organs a layer of cells at a time and uses the different cells based on the recipients own body. This significantly lowers the chances of organ rejection. For the more complex organs, the printer lays the cells over a pre-made scaffold. The printer is still in its early testing phase but the companies believe that within five years, they will be able to print out veins and arteries for bypass surgery and within 10 years for complex organs like the liver and heart. (source) 9. Robots  The 21st century has seen remarkable innovation in robotics. Though we are yet to make them help around the house or do our construction, there have been big strides that point towards a better future. The University of California, San Diego, used the self guided learning process to make a hyper-realistic Einstein robot smile and make facial expressions. Boston Dynamics have a biped robot that dynamically balances using a human-like walking motion. (Source) Also see: How does Elon Musk work? in Futuristic Technology \u2714 10. Amazon Prime Air  Amazon has a project that will have drones fly packages directly to your doorstep in 30 minutes. The plan, according to Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO, requires more safety testing and approvals from the FAA but he estimates the \u2018octocopter\u2019 drones will be available to customers in 4 to 5 years. The drones will deliver your package 30 minutes after you hit \u201cbuy\u201d on Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more. (Source 1, 2) 11. Clothing  Nano technologists are working on making clothes more comfortable to wear. According to Prof Ashwini Agarwal of Delhi IIT, \u201cfibres and filaments are one-dimensional structural materials for textiles. Through nanotechnolgy we can decrease its module value and increase its strength. Not only nanotechnology can be deployed for fibres and filaments and for creating composite nano fibres, but it can also be deployed for surface modifications and finishes of yarns and cloth. By this process the textile products can be made more attractive, strong and responsive to customers\u2019 choice.\u201d (Source) Fiber based nanotechnology is also being used to harvest energy from physical movement. The \u201cpower shirt\u201d will be able to generate electricity that can power small electronic devices for soldiers, hikers and others whose physical motion can be harnessed and converted to electrical energy.

Computers  According to a prediction by Kurzweil computers will have the same intellectual capacity as humans. \u201cPeople are looking to nanotechnology to carry on Moore\u2019s Law, which allows chips to be smaller, faster and consume less energy,\u201d says Jim Tully, the vice president and chief of research at Gartner. \u201cTo this end, semiconductor giants such as Intel, IBM, HP and others are looking to build ever-smaller silicon circuits for use on processors and communications interfaces, paving the way for smaller, faster, more power-efficient computer systems and other devices.\u201d (Source) Intel corp researchers also predict that by the year 2020, you won\u2019t need a keyboard or mouse to control the computer. Users will use brain waves to open documents and surf the Web. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to prove you can do interesting things with brain waves,\u201d said Dean Pomerleau, an Intel research scientiest. \u201cEventually people may be willing to be more committed \u2026 to brain implants. Imagine being able to surf the Web with the power of your thoughts.\u201d (Source) 14. Scanner Cinema Experience  Manchester based animator, Richard Ramchum is the founder of the #Scanners Cinema experience that will allow everyone to watch a film differently. Viewers are supposed to wear a headset that reads brainwaves. The headset then manipulates images one sees according to their subconscious mind. In this way, edit points will be created and the narrative changed when one blinks. It will give people a glimpse into their dream world since the film one sees will be a visual record of your subconscious mind. (Source) .
