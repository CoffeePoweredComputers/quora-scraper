            "answer_text": "What is the exact brand and model number of your TV? If your TV is not a smart TV, you have to connect an external device to gain some smart features, if you don\u2019t want to connect an Android stick, you can opt to connect a Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV box, Chromecast, or a Blu-ray disc player that has streaming apps. Also, as clarification what you are referring to as an LED TV is actually an LCD TV with LED Back or edge light (the correct label should be LED/LCD TV). TV manufacturers and retailers often use the incorrect LED TV label as the LEDs only provide the light source, the LCDs actually contain the image information. Both are needed to display an image on the screen. ",
