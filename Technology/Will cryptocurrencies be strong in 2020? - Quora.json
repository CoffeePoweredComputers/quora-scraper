            "answer_text": "What do you mean by \u201cstrong\u201d? Are you implying that people should buy them with and expectation that they will be worth more? History has shown us that cryptocurrencies are a poor store of value. As more offerings are made, the already small market gets smaller for each coin as people shift their holdings to the new one hoping that THIS WILL BE THE ONE. (Spoiler alert: it won\u2019t) There are 3 kinds of people in the cryptocurrency market: Those that are pushing individual coins because they own them and they are trying to push their value up.\u201cInvestors\u201d getting in because they believe that THIS coin is going to be the next Bitcoin and be worth $20,000 soon.People who are ready to pull out because they have lost a lot of money.Anyone that made money was smart enough to get in early and smarter to get out before it reached its peak. In the stock world they describe that feat as \u201ctrying to catch a falling knife.\u201d It is fitting here. The problem with the cryptocurrency market is that there is a limited number of buyers and an increasing number of offerings. In economics (my formal training) this points to a mismatch that will drop the whole market. The only reason Bitcoin got to its height is because it was the only offering (limited supply) as lots of people were getting into the market (lots of demand) - so prices obviously went up. Until the market reached the point were they had reached equilibrium and it stopped going up. Demand dropped and supply stayed the same, so price started going down. The guy that spent $19K saw the price at $18K and pulled out, losing a grand. That started the panic. When enough people got out of the market (lured by other coins) we landed at ~$3.5K to ~$3.8K, which is where it sits today. Don\u2019t invest, this is gambling, at best. Your odds are better in Vegas. MUCH better. ",

            "answer_text": "Three Altcoin Prospects to Check Out for Now for 2020 The cryptocurrency world has seen many ups and downs, and there are certainly more to come. But now the latest \u201ccrypto winter\u201d is over and a \u201ccrypto spring\u201d has begun. In other words, cryptocurrency markets are heating up again. This makes it a good time to invest in tokens and coins before prices rise too high. Below I discuss three projects I think are great options for investing right now.  How to Choose? First and foremost, I have chosen the altcoins below because I think each project has tremendous potential to be successful. The second consideration is affordability. Each coin or token below is very inexpensive right now. In some cases, several thousand can be bought with just a few dollars. The low price represents a lower barrier to entry for those without much income or who are new to cryptocurrency. In fact, many people first acquire crypto through faucets and microtasks, which results in only a few dollars worth of BTC at best. The great thing about the altcoins discussed below is you do not need much more than that to buy in. BitTorrent (BTT)  In July 2018, TRON acquired BitTorrent, the biggest peer-to-peer file sharing protocol in the world. It currently has over 100+ million users and makes up 33% of the total internet traffic. TRON\u2019s plan is to combine its blockchain network and BitTorrent\u2019s P2P network to create an infrastructure for a decentralized content distribution platform (akin to a new Internet) for a global user base. The partnership between TRON and BitTorrent has been dubbed \u2018Project Atlas.\u2019 The TRON network will infuse the torrent ecosystem with storage and bandwidth. And while BitTorrent has always had an incentive model built into it in that users who upload faster can download more quickly \u2014 with TRON\u2019s blockchain technology BitTorrent will now be able to compensate users with TRX tokens for participating and contributing. Users can use TRX to access special features, such as getting faster downloads by bidding with TRX tokens. BitTorrent peers will also be able to offer TRX as an incentive to other users to run clients on faster networks and to seed torrents for more extended periods of time. Given the strength of TRON and how established BitTorrent already is, it is unlikely Project Atlas is going to fail anytime soon. The BTT token has not been trading for long and it is at a very low price at the time of this writing. With these two factors in mind, I cannot imagine BTT will not rise in value quite a bit in the next crypto bull run. Buy BTT on Binance or Kucoin IoTeX (IOTX)  IoTeX is an open-source project founded in 2017 that is building a new privacy-oriented blockchain platform to enable the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT refers to the possibility of digital communication and interaction beyond computers and personal devices to encompass all of the various devices around us with digital capabilities. The number of IoT devices is expected to surpass 50 billion by 2022. This mass of Internet-connected devices will need secure methods of communication and automation in real-time. This is the niche that IoTex is planning to fill. The architecture of IoTeX is based on a root blockchain that provides security and governance for the network, while also managing various sidechains to carry out specific functions. These sidechains can connect IoT devices based on specific parameters, such as working in similar environments, having similar trust levels, or having a similar function. IoTex is also focussed on privacy. Two of the privacy mechanisms it has developed are ring signatures and a relayable payment code that hides the address of a transaction receiver. IoTeX\u2019s most direct competitor is IOTA. The main difference between the two is that IOTA uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to address scalability. However, this requires global consensus. IoTeX is opting for another solution, called Roll-DPoS, which uses a randomized and scalable variant of the delegated proof of stake framework. The first token to be issued on the IoTex chain is VITA, which is being distributed free through airdrops to those who stake their IOTX. Visit here to learn more about this. Buy IOTX on Binance or Kucoin PundiX (NPXS)  PundiX is a new blockchain project that aims to use cryptocurrency to create a global cashless payment system. Its blockchain-enabled Point-of-Sale (XPoS) devices let shops, cafes and convenience stores sell cryptocurrency and accept cryptocurrency payments. All a merchant has to do is have an XPoS in their store. The device works with a simple mobile wallet (XWallet) that customers use to make payments in physical stores. It has a simple interface for buying and selling BTC, ETH, XEM, and QTUM. It also has a check-out menu to execute purchases with cryptocurrencies. With every transaction, the XPoS prints a receipt for the customer and tracks orders and inventory for the store owner. PundiX is an exciting project because it already delivered its first 500 units to participating businesses in Hong Kong in June 2018. Pundi is now accepting orders from merchants for the XPoS system and plans to deliver 100,000\u2013700,000 devices to at least 12 different countries over the next three years. The PundiX project builds on the success of Pundi-Pundi, which is already a popular (non-blockchain-based) cashless payment app in Indonesia that uses smartphones to make instant payments in retail and restaurant outlets. The price of NPXS is also extremely low at the moment, which is one reason to consider buying some. Buy NPXS on Binance or Kucoin Conclusion There you have it. Three of my top picks for investing small amounts of money in crypto right now. I think each of these altcoins is going to have a strong 2020. Don\u2019t just sit and watch while other makes their own decision, the coming bitcoin halving might be a once in a lifetime opportunity has it has been previously.

How Cryptocurrency can end up being a video game changer in the financial world. The economic globe. The surge of cryptocurrency stands for a seismic shift in the monetary world: since it runs individually of any main financial authority, it represents an avenue which the present economic powers-that-be (such as Wall Street) can not control. It provides shopping companies and traders a degree of freedom hitherto inaccessible. Making use of cryptocurrencies will permit suppliers not to bother with settlement company locking out their money for one factor or one more. Realising that cryptocurrencies and also Blockchain technology are here to stay, financial institutions are wanting to capitalize on them: banks are slowly adjusting to the blockchain technology, using it to trade by-products or perhaps cotton. A consortium of financial institutions is backing IBM in its creation of a Blockchain that will be utilised to help with global trading; in Australia, the stock market \"down under\" will be the globe's first ever blockchain-based stock exchange system. Reducing the risk of frauds & charge card fraud. Making use of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, for obtaining products, lugs a lot less risk than bank card, which today are subject to several kinds of fraud. Combating counterfeit products is an additional area that can take advantage of Blockchain modern technology, as demonstrated by shopping giant Alibaba. Financial. Over two billion people worldwide do not have or can not have an individual savings account. A cryptocurrency account will certainly enable them to transfer and get settlements. Nations with unpredictable or bothersome financial systems, such as Venezuela, have looked to Blockchain or cryptocurrencies for help. A securer currency for lower-income households. In creating nations such as Kenya, over 50% of commerce is negotiated via cellphone credit scores. Solutions like these typically carry high service charge, and switching to electronic money can conserve locals money, plus give them added safety and security. Enhancing shopping. Big shopping merchants have actually already started accepting crypto symbols such as Bitcoin or Ether as settlement.

Making use of cryptocurrencies eliminates the requirement of middleman (such as financial institutions), provides extra safe and secure, much faster transfers, removes the opportunity of credit card fraud and brings smart contracts, escrow and also machine repayment agreements capacities. By using crypto coins such as Bitcoin instead of charge card, both sellers and also customers remove charge fees, which can be as much as 3% of the deal quantity. Compensate programs, a decades staple of credit card companies, are already active, supplying money back in cryptocurrencies. Indeterminate repayments. Crypto coins can be accessed from anywhere there is Web access, and also there are no constraints separating international from regional settlements. A lot more reliable transfers. No longer will people or firms be required to pay significant costs simply to transfer funds between them, which would be too high if it was done cross-country. Third-world travelers who send out residence money every month can save significant amounts of money by utilizing immediate as well as low-fee purchases, even through mobile phone. Personal privacy. While crypto coins such as Bitcoin and Ether are not entirely confidential, other crypto coins, such as Monero, can use tighter anonymity. Verdict. We are currently seeing how cryptocurrencies and also Blockchain technologies are interrupting the globe in even more methods than individuals might have fantasized. And while the majority of the noise and also focus went to initial primarily on crypto coins, such as Bitcoin (BTH), Ethereum (ETH) and also others, increasingly more firms taking a closer look at the Blockchain modern technology itself. This is because the effect of the modern technology might be much more significant than the crypto symbols, which are simply a byproduct. It will certainly take a couple of even more years to see exactly how reliable this innovation can be. ",

            "answer_text": "The granddaddy of all cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was first and is the most well-known cryptocurrency on the market. It also benefits from the largest market cap and is among the most highly traded cryptocurrency, assuring liquidity in the short-term. Bitcoin is the king when it comes to retail adoption, leading all other cryptocurrencies in terms of acceptance as a payment medium. Down significantly from its all-time high of over $20,000 per Bitcoin, BTC may have plenty of room for growth despite an increasingly crowded field of competitors. 2. Ethereum (ETH) As the currency and platform that made \u201csmart contracts\u201d part of the cryptocurrency market\u2019s vocabulary, Ethereum has seen massive gains since its introduction in 2015. Currently trailing only Bitcoin in regard to market capitalization, Ethereum has become one of the most widely discussed cryptocurrency projects in the world. A consortium of some of the beggist name in the business, including Microsoft, Intel, Chase, and J.P. Morgan are building business-ready versions of the software that drives Ethereum. With momentum and market enthusiasm behind the Ethereum project, there\u2019s no reason to think Ethereum has run its course and investors should consider Ethereum as part of a cryptocurrency portfolio. 3. Ripple (XRP) Ripple diverges from much of its cryptocurrency competitors in a number of ways. Ripple is an invention of Ripple Labs, and the Ripple token is being used in high-speed and low-cost money transfers worldwide. Ripple Labs has announced a number of partnerships with leading money transfer services, with more financial market partnerships expected in the future. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that trade on hopes and dreams, Ripple is being used in the real world today, showing signs of future adoption within the financial market community. Ripple rise in value over 36,000% in 2017, but similar gains may not be likely going forward. 4. EOS (EOS) Another cryptocurrency with smart contracts like Ethereum, and which is gaining in popularity is EOS. EOS is credited with being the first blockchain operating system, offering decentralized applications that live on the blockchain and parallel processing, enabling faster transaction speeds and better scalability than some competitors. Transactions on the EOS network are free. Many competitors, including Ethereum, have a transaction fee for transferring coins or tokens from one wallet address to another. EOS concluded its year-long ICO in May of this year, raising a total of $4 billion. The longer-duration ICO was done in an attempt to create an orderly market for EOS without the dramatic run-up and sudden crash common to cryptocurrencies when launched. YTD performance for EOS is flat, with less volatility than has been seen with some competitors. Enthusiasm for the project remains high, and EOS is one of the most actively traded cryptocurrencies on exchanges. 5. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Bitcoin cash a fork of the original Bitcoin project, is one to watch, as it\u2019s the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap. If forced to level criticism against Bitcoin in its current form, slow transaction speeds are among its primary challenges. Bitcoin cash was developed using modified code from the Bitcoin project that allowed larger block sizes, promoting faster transaction times and better scalability. Although not yet as widely accepted or as widely known as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is still a promising alternative to Bitcoin with an enthusiastic market following. 6. Litecoin (LTC) Now accepted as a payment method at bedding furniture Electronices jewelry clothing ND more litecoin may also have a bright future. Long-term investors in LTC have been rewarded with up to 20x returns, although a spike in late December 2017 sent the price of LTC to over $350. Litecoin now trades at around $84 USD, and although showing signs of consolidation remains actively traded and is consistently one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies when measured by market cap. Litecoin boasts a faster transaction time than Bitcoin, largely attributed to its use of a different type of algorithm to add transactions to the blockchain. Increased transaction speed also enhances scalability. Final Thoughts on Best Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies are still in their formative years. If you\u2019re new to cryptocurrencies, you may be better served by investing only risk capital and by building a portfolio of widely traded cryptocurrencies. Initial coin offerings can be tempting, particularly with the parabolic rises common to ICOs. Almost as common is a precipitous fall following the ICO. More established currencies help to prevent some of the volatility and provide better liquidity than found with newly minted cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s important to learn where a cryptocurrency can be traded and how big the market is for that cryptocurrency. Many early investors have found themselves without a viable way to exit the position. If cryptocurrencies are here to stay, some very good opportunities are likely to exist among the most commonly traded currencies, while also minimizing risk due to abandoned projects or lack of liquidity.

There are lot of technical analysis about the price that this year will be a big year for cryptocurrencies as this year will also happen the so called Bitcoin halving where the reward for bitcoin will be cut into its half and when that event occurs, the BTC price tends to go higher or has surging price which might be 2x higher. Alts most of the time follows BTC price so its also good to invest on Altcoins. If you wanna invest on some BTC or other alts, I highly recommend Atomars Exchange as it has good security which make your assets safe and secured on their platform.. Also they do have different offers there which you might also like for example is their free trading fee which will end this 31st of January. ",
