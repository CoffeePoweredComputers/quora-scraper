            "answer_text": "I can only speak for my town, but I will. A few years ago I had to deal with our PD on a client basis. It struck me that the Keystone Cops were better organized and trained. So, I decided to do more than gripe. We had a civilian commission that was advisory to our PD, so I spoke to a few people and got myself appointed. After a few months I realized that the other members of the commission were as frustrated as was I with our PD, so we presented our case to the city council and got the recommendations of the commission elevated to the level of policy and procedure. Our research showed that we had officers who never made night-time traffic stops simply because they were afraid to do so. We had officers who given six months to make a decision couldn\u2019t decide what color to paint their house. We were expecting them to make split second decisions involving life and death. Something had to be done, so here\u2019s the path we took: We now require a serious college degree for applicants. By serious I mean psychology or sociology; a degree that had a rigorous course of study. Existing officers who didn\u2019t have a degree slowly realized that they had to have a degree if they ever wanted to ever get off of a beat. We put a serious program in place to sponsor extant officers who wanted to study for a degree. Several of the Bumble Blues quit. No tears here. Despite what some predicted, our applicant pool didn\u2019t shrink. It stayed about the same, except it was now made up of much more qualified people. Our pay scale starts out equal to that of our neighbors, but it goes up quickly in the right hand columns, compensating officers for the degree.We do extensive testing and background investigation on the applicants that pass the paper vetting. When we get serious about someone our investigation is akin to what you\u2019d get for a high level security clearance. By the time we hire someone we know more about them than they do.Didn\u2019t pass our process and still want to be a cop? In nearby Oakland it\u2019s OK if you have a hard drug conviction as long as you promise not to do it again.We found that our sworn officers spent a good part of their time doing things for which they were way over qualified. We now have technicians that take care of the paperwork and other activities that don\u2019t require a sworn officer. Two of these technicians work nights and are studying days so that they may someday be eligible to apply for a sworn position. This allowed us to reduce the number of sworn officers somewhat. The technicians are also paid quite a lot less than a sworn officer.Technology has made a huge difference. Real time vehicle tracking yielded some amazing statistics. It was amazing how much time officers who were supposed to be on a beat, spent parked someplace shady. Our dispatcher now sees an alarm when a car is parked for n minutes without the officer first dealing with the dispatcher, calling in a 10-something.We stopped self-dispatching. Before, arresting an indigent would draw three cars; one to make the arrest and two lookie-loos who were just bored on their beats. An officer that leaves their beat without being dispatched gets a warning that they have a few minutes to get back on their beat or have their salary docked. This alone allowed us to reduce the size of our force enough (two sworn officers) to pay for the technology.We have current generation dash, rear facing, and body cameras. The dash and rear facing cameras are on continuously. An officer that interfaces with a member of the public without their body camera on gets to go fishing for a week, without pay. In a few months we will have body cameras that have to be turned off by the dispatcher rather than turned on by the officer.Officers also cannot now interface with the public while wearing sun glasses. Put the Aviators in your pocket, or better yet throw them away. Officers no longer jingle when they walk. We worked on it a bit and got most of that stuff off of their belts. We want our officers to appear more like people and less like Robo-Cop.We\u2019ve had two officer-involved shootings in the last few years. When an officer is put on administrative leave pending an investigation for possible bad actions, his or her salary is paid into a trust account for the duration of the investigation. Should the officer be found to have acted in the line of duty, the salary is then paid to the officer with interest. Should the officer be found to not have acted in the line of duty, well, the idea is that the salary then be forfeited, but we\u2019ve never had to test that. We\u2019d probably loose in court. The end result, though, is that investigations that used to take months, that used to drag out until things cooled down, now take days. BTW, in one of those shootings the officer was exonerated. The other he plead guilty to Man II. He didn\u2019t do any time, something that infuriated me personally, but he will spend 10 years on a very short leash, was publicly humiliated, and he\u2019ll never own a gun again. I guess that\u2019s something like justice.A good portion of our officers pay is now based of their performance. An officer is assigned to a beat. We track the change in crime statistics on that beat, the Delta Y. If an officer is being effective, if he or she is making their beat a better place, the officer\u2019s pay reflects their efforts. It works the other way also.Because an officer is tied to a beat, they get to know the people they protect. We give officers and technicians paid time off or overtime to attend birthday parties, christenings, weddings and such. It\u2019s become a very common thing. Not very many weeks go by without an officer or technician attending a wedding in their dress blues (now you know why you have to buy those). In some of the toughest parts of town (smallest beats) officers now constantly get calls from citizens with information that might make their block more peaceful. Most people just want to go home from work, watch television, and play with their kids. If they understand that their co-operation will make that easier, they\u2019ll be glad to help.There\u2019s a lot more detail, but you get the idea; better cops, better policing, a better life for everyone. We just hired an new Chief. He came from a city 10 times our size, and brought a lot of interesting ideas with him. He cost quite a bit, almost twice what we were paying Barney Fife, our old Chief, but we felt that the expense would be worth it. We have a sergeant retiring soon, and will have an opening if you are interested. Of course you do have a Master\u2019s degree? The two top internal candidates do. ",

            "answer_text": "Hard for me to say since I was literally a toddler back then. But I think there's a couple of changes that may have affected the practice of law enforcement: Monitoring equipment, starting with dash cams and including body cams these days are game changers. They provide solid evidence of what happened during an encounter and all but eliminate the whole \u201cHe Said, She Said\u201d BS. They also mean that officers are under even more scrutiny than in the past: no more back-alley \u201ctune-up\u201d on suspects.Forensics science has advanced by leaps and bounds in the past few decades. DNA evidence, crime modeling computer applications (used in \u201cpredictive policing\u201d), mobile data terminals (later replaced by laptops - officers no longer have to wait on dispatch to check for criminal records or warrants, this stuff is at their fingertips now) - now there are a million ways you can be caught.Speaking of forensics, TV shows like \u201cCSI\u201d and \u201cThe First 48\u201d have made the public aware of some of these techniques. Jurists are now asking questions that would have never occurred to the average civilian 20 years ago.Back in the day an officer had few non-lethal alternatives at his disposal. Now they have Tasers, chemical deterrents (pepper spray) and other means to help resolve situations without having to automatically reach for the gun holster.In larger departments many of your officers hold degrees (usually in Criminal Justice), unlike the days of old. These officers are more intelligent and are more cognizant of newer techniques and theories which can be applied to the job.With the various scandals in recent years it's starting to dawn on some in the LE community that there's been too much of a seige mentality on the job, too much \u201cus versus them\u201d. That would explain a lot of the hostility toward the modern police force. Some are taking this as a cue to get to know their communities a little better. I hope it continues because it's much needed.SWAT teams didn't exist all those years ago. They were, and still are, a good idea for dealing with highly-charged and dangerous situations for which standard beat officers are usually ill-prepared. We just have to watch that the police doesn't get too militarized; the job of the police is supposed to be protecting and serving, not maintaining a seige.That's just what I can think of from the top of my head. I'm sure I missed a few things but, as I said, 50 years ago I was able to wear diapers in public without creeping people out. ",
