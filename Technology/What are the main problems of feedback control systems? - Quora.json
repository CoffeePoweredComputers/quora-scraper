            "answer_text": "Given the universal popularity of Feedback Control Systems (FCS) in all kinds of technologies, and the existence of many biological regulatory mechanisms tuned by million of years of evolution which are FCS, it is fair to say that the benefits brought by FCS outplay the \u201cproblems\u201d. But FCS have some problems \u2014 which are serious only when the FCS are poorly designed; if, in a certain setting, the problems cannot be solved by any kind of feedback design techniques, than feedback cannot be used. Those FCS problems are mainly: Applying feedback can drive the closed loop system into instability. Note however that feedback is often used to stabilize an unstable raw plant (a bicycle, an inverted pendulum, a Segway, and some military aircraft, for instance\u2026).FCS have more elements than the raw system, so one incurs into extra costs by using feedback.FCS in the real world are often complex to analyze and design, due to system/plant uncertainties and nonlinear behavior of parts and plant.As already said, FCS are more complex and have more parts than the raw system, and so are more prone to the occurrence of faults.But, as stated in the beginning, FCS are pervasive to both living beings and machines.

            "answer_text": "The main problems of feedback control are, Feedback control cannot achieve perfect control because its effectiveness is limited by the process response to continuous manipulation of the process variable.The feedback control corrects the output deviations by trial and error method which results in the oscillatory response of the feedback loop.The inclusion of feedback control to a process affects stability, sensitivity and overall gain.",
