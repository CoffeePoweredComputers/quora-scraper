            "answer_text": "Technological developments are conceived asthe main facilitator and driving force of mostof the globalization processes. Beforeelaborating on the consequences of severaltechnological developments, we must gothrough the definition of technology as asociological term, so that we can furtherexplore the social and political role oftechnology in the globalization process.Technology can be defined as the socializedknowledge of producing goods and services.We can describe the term technology with fiveimportant elements: production, knowledge,instruments, possession and change. Ourdefinition of technology as a socializedknowledge can be better conceived with theseelements. Now we shall briefly look throughthem:It has something to do with production (ofgoods and services). We need technology toproduce something either goods (ex: clothes,television set, cars etc.) or service (ex:banking, security, teaching etc.) Technologyimproves our capacity to produce.Technology has something to do withknowledge . Technology is a result ofintellectual activities.  Therefore technology istype of intellectual property. Today technologyis developed through research anddevelopment institutions as integral parts ofthe universities.Technology has something to do withinstruments . The instruments are theextensions of the human body, whenever aninstrument is used there is technologyinvolved. The instruments indicate the usage oftechnology by human beings. Instruments aremostly physical such as computers, vacuumcleaners or pencils, but sometimes there areimmaterial instruments too, such as databasesor algorithms in computer programming.Technology has something to do withpossession . Those people who possesstechnology also control it. Controllingtechnology has usually something to do witheconomics and politics. Therefore we canspeak of technologically rich and poorcountries and the struggle among them usuallyin the forms of patents, transfers andprotection of intellectual rights.Technology has something to do with change .With technology, the world has changeddrastically. Most of the innovations from thetechnological advances have very importanteffects on the lives of peoples of the world,which has witnessed radical changes especiallyafter 1960\u2019s revolutions on themicroelectronics technologies. Even there aresome people who argue that the history ismade by technology as a result of their highlycriticized techno-determinist view.All these aspects of technology justify ourdefinition of technology as the socializedknowledge of producing goods and services,and this definition makes a cleardifferentiation between the terms technologyand technique (technics). Therefore if we speakabout the effects of technology onglobalization, instead of techniques ortechnical developments we refer to technologyas a social and political term.One may argue that the commercial activitieson the Mediterranean in the Ancient timeswere to be labeled as globalization. The worldof these ages, although smaller in size thanthat of today, had witnessed a simpler form ofglobalization, after the technologicaldevelopments on navigation andtransportation. The invention of the script canbe considered as the first technology ofcommunication that contributed toglobalization. With the script man couldtransmit and store information that couldspeed up further technological developments.Transportation and communication in theseages were in parallel to each other and therewere couriers, people who specifically carriedand delivered mail and other written materialsby running or riding horse. However thislimited amount of information transmitted,received and stored was not sufficient for alarge-scale state. Later, due to furtherdevelopments in transportation andcommunication it was possible to controllarger areas; and the emergence of largerempires such as Byzantine Empire hadprovided greater globalizations.  Invention ofthe print machine with moving letters byGutenberg was the most importantrevolutionary technological development,which made possible even a larger globalgeography. The emergence of the newspapersmarked an important era of globalization whenthe news both commercial and politicalbecame an indispensable element for thedecision makers. Another milestone in thehistory of globalization is the invention oftelegraph by Samuel Morse. Telegraph made itpossible to communicate with the placeswhere you don\u2019t have to go and separated thepractices of communication from those oftransportation. This aspect of telegraph soondrew the attention of military ranks andtelegraph became both a civilian and militarycommunication technology. However becausethe poles and the copper wires needed for atelegraph and telephone system it was notpossible to set up a properly functioningnetwork in insecure and instable geographies.Cyrus Field\u2019s attempts to lay a transatlanticcable for telegraphy succeeded in 1858 andthis marked the beginning of a global network.Telephone of Graham Bell in 1861 alsocontributed to communication networks.Railways also networked to reach to largerdistances. Invention of radio as a wirelesscommunication technology solved thisproblem and opened a new era ofglobalization. With radio it became possible tocommunicate with places where you cannot goand even with places where no one can travel.Hertz, Maxwell, Marconi, Tesla and severalother people contributed to the invention ofradio, which soon became a militarycommunication tool especially for the navy.Radio of 1920\u2019s however, turned to be acommercial communication technology; and isused as a mass communication technology.Transportation technologies also improvedwith the start of the 20th Century whentransatlantic ships became safer and faster andairplanes were produced. First propeller drivenpassenger plane began service in 1919 betweenLondon and Paris. Jet plane and television of1950\u2019s were also important steps towardgreater globalizations. The first reliabletransatlantic telephone cable TAT-1 was laid in1956. 1957 marked the most important stepin the history of globalization when USSRlaunched its Sputnik as the first man-madesatellite. Satellites made it possible to built afully reliable global network, compensating theradio networks\u2019 ionosphere fading problem.However global networks still requiredstronger global networks with solidconnections. The first transatlantic fibercable TAT-8 was laid in 1988 for faster andreliable networks. ",
