            "answer_text": "I think Poco M2 has all the qualities to be considered a decent and reliable smartphone choice. Poco M2 was announced in September 2020 and it is expected to go on sale on 15th September 2020. It has two variants and is available in three colours - Brick Red, Pitch Black and Slate Blue. I think it is worth buying for users who are looking for a gaming-specific smartphone capable of smooth support for regular functioning as well. In terms of features, Poco M2 has a 6.53-inch IPS LCD capacitative touchscreen with a resolution of 1080*2340 pixels. The phone is powered by the gaming-specific Mediatek Helio G80 chipset. It has two variants - 6GB RAM and 64GB internal storage and 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage. The internal memory can also be expanded with a dedicated card slot.  Poco M2 has a quad-camera setup in the rear with the specs of 13MP wide lends + an 8MP ultrawide lens + a 5MP macro lens + 2MP depth lens. Additional camera features include an LED flash, HDR and Panorama. It also comes with an 8MP wide lens selfie camera at the front with an LED flash. The battery power in the Poco M2 is a massive 5000 mAh and it also supports 18W fast charging. It runs on Android 10 operating system.

In terms of KSPs, the Poco M2 has a strong battery, solid 6GB RAM support and an efficient gaming chipset from Mediatek. This is a good combination to have at the price point of 10k, especially for mobile gamers. Although it does have all the specs to be a good choice for regular users as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Poco M2 is actually a good launch in the budget segment and there are numerous reasons to it. You may think that the smartphone has copied most of its features from Redmi 9 Prime smartphone which was launched a couple of weeks back, but this smartphone from Poco will only benefit the users. If you look at the specs of the smartphone, these are actually quite good at the cost. The smartphone has a good display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. It has a really powerful MediaTek Helio G80 gaming processor which is clocked at 2GHz and is octa-core in nature. Plus, there is a 13MP quad rear camera, an 8MP front camera, 6GB RAM, 128GB internal storage and 5000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. There is also a powerful fingerprint scanner and face unlock feature to keep your smartphone secure.  And launching this smartphone was a great idea because of the fact that people are not actually benefitting by the flash sales that are offered by the online stores in collaboration with the brands. Most of the good smartphone brands only offer a few units in a flash sale and this sale lasts just a few seconds. No doubt, most of the people who look to get these smartphones are always waiting and they choose some different option which is easily available. So when Poco M2 with almost the similar features occurs in the market, people will have this one as an option too. And the ones looking to go for Redmi 9 Prime or Redmi Note 9 can go for this one as there is hardly any difference between these smartphones. So as per me, there is no issue in the launch of Poco M2 and this is a good smartphone at the low cost. It\u2019s just like Redmi 9 Prime, only with a bit high storage and a bit increase in the cost. So you can always go for this one as an option if the most favored smartphone is not available in the market. ",
