            "answer_text": "It seems that they came a long way with the developments of their drone capabilities. More than the term \u2018\u2019advanced\u2019\u2019 which is a very broad word that every military according to his needs defines different, it looks like that the Turkish drone strategy as a whole becomes a new and totally different \u2018\u2019game changer\u2019\u2019 with an actual older strategy and technology. The advantage of the Turks in that matter was to experience the Heron\u2019s bought from Israel during the early 2000s and the difficulties over their problematic parts that after many attempts could not be repaired on time and repeated over and over again and after the problems with Israel and their refusal of the delivery brought the Turks to the point to develop it by themselves and improve \u2018\u2019exactly\u2019\u2019 the parts what was missing on the Israeli ones. They have adapted their own military strategies and after 10 years it became one of the most important military drone powers of the world. Here we have to speak about how effective the Turkish drones are in the conflicts of Lybia, Syria, and recently in the Nagorno Karabakh dispute. There is a report over the impact of Turkish drones in Karabakh:  source It\u2019s reported according to various sources that Azerbaijan has around 11 Turkish military drones right now operating in the Karabakh dispute and the result above is just enormous. 11 Turkish drones, when we consider that these are around only 20 million dollar worth from the material costs point (which they obviously give away to the Azerbaijanis without much profit), destroys military hardware more than a billion-dollar and that is exactly the recipe for many militaries around the world who bomb the hell out with billions of dollars any insurgency groups or militias but have no significant success rather than bringing trouble to their own economy. The problem here is that even when there are many superior technologies, they\u2019re so expensive to use against such cheap but effective materials, and even if you want to target them, which one of them? (The Turks operate them mostly in a horde tactic) and if you decide to shoot some down, the next is on the way, because it is a minimal loss for them, whereas you suffer huge losses financially and mentally when they target your very expensive gadgets before you even can use them. If we see that from that point, then the Turkish drones and their doctrine to use them, their tactics are a true \u2018\u2019game changer\u2019\u2019 which is also spoken in many military circles and they try to copy these tactics. But obviously, Turkey has a very big headstart in this game and will most probably stay for long this way. A million-dollar product makes millions of dollar worth of armored vehicles, offline operating SAM systems totally obsolete, don\u2019t risk their own soldier live\u2019s, destroys targets on the point without the need of much free-falling bombs or missiles that can target only large areas of the conflict with lesser accuracy and removes the need for mercenaries who are paid each month ranging from 2\u201340,000 dollar, changing according to their experience, impact and the organization they belong to. Therefore, Turkish drone capabilities are truly effective and valuable in the new era of warfare and proxy wars. And the new ones as I have seen are on the way with much larger payload, ranges, speed, and technology. Until much cheaper and more effective counter-strategies are found to address this issue, it will be difficult to face this threat on the battlefield. ",

The TAI Aksungur is really known for it\u2019s surveillance abilities, They have also become very advanced in Self Landing and take-off which not many other drones can do in the world. Turkish Drones can do surveillance in any weather and any condition. night,day,snow,rain,hail,sand,etc. The drones can also send the image of the targets immediately to ground forces and it\u2019s location for targeting. The Turkish Aerospace Anka drone is made to carry missiles and hit and strike targets immediately. The TAI Simsek is being made so that it can turn into a cruise missiles if needed. ",

More production of those machines will mean more source and eventually more demand created by outside forces. In long term gun company owners and a few politicians will become billionaires while you suckers praise those destruction devices when millions of innocent people losing their lives for the sake of bloody politicians, CEOs. It\u2019s a cycle. Keep up the good work! Let\u2019s create a militaristic world and start WW3! Let\u2019s sell guns to ISIS or any terrorist group and their enemies at the same time for financial or political gain and then put the blame on weaker one when spotlight turns on yourself at some point.
