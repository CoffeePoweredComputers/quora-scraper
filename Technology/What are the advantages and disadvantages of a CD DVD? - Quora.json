            "answer_text": "Short answer is a CD or DVD is something that you own outright. You can do whatever you wish with it despite what the warning label says. If you want to copy it, tons of software for that. You want to sell it, you can do that, if left in collectable shape, some people will pay heavily for it if it\u2019s popular. No one can take it from you unlike software music and movies. At any time, apple could make all music and movies bought through them disabled. No way to do that with a physical disc. The down sides is they take up space. Portability is an issue if you want to watch or listen to your disc. I mean, not like it was, but a far cry from just having it all on your phone. discs can get scratched and unusable, and frankly they are pissy fragile bastards that probably will get scratched. And to too it off, you have to have a player for either DVD or CD. You can\u2019t really share a DVD over your network to stream or buy the DVD or CD and listen to it instantly on the device you bought it on, while sitting on your couch! So, pros and cons on both sides. Just depends on your preference. Cheers! ",
