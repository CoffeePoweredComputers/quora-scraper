            "answer_text": "I will list for you probable technologies that the major nation states have developed and are developing.  Major nation states being the usa, russia, uk, france, germany, japan, china, india, brazil.  Weather modification and manipulation technology.  The usa and russia have had active research and development programs since ww2 for this type of technology. There is plentiful evidence for its existence and ample motive to harness weather for national security purposes. One circumstancial example is the year 2005 when the usa was hit with so many hurricanes and tropical depressions the noaa ran out of names and was force to use numeric names, with many hurricanes being very strong cat 4 and cat 5. The path of the storms was also unusual and its as if they were steered into populated areas, katrina behaved as though it was drawn to new orleans directly, wilma had the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded by hurricane hunters and had winds over 170 mph but luckily lost a little steam before plowing into south florida.  The next year 2006 hardly a storm happened in this same region. One must ask why and or how the previous season can be so historically active yet the next yr barely have one hurricane and none that made damaging landfalls. Im sure some may be sceptical but examine this between the lines, could have a foriegn adversary developed an effective way to target the continental united states and maintain public secrecy by using weather modification covertly?  And did the usa develop a countermeasure to stop the attacks that worked so well that it completely inhibited nearly all hurricane and tropical storm activity?  Scalar energy and its weaponization. Scalar energy is a complicated subject, i wont drop the equations on here but i suggest you research it on your own. Scientist all agree it exists but no one seems to beleive it can be tapped.  Our normal society does not have the advanced research and unlimited money for development that black budget projects do. It is probable that this sub segment of our world is so advanced that it functions as a breakaway civilization. Scalar weaponry is possible as are exotic propulsion engines for at a minimum manned interplanetary travel and patrol missions. The use of scalar weaponry if they exist would be many magnitudes more destructive than fusion weapons. Active deployment of interplanetary manned spaceship fleets and interplanetary bases.to think mankind has had access to powerful physics technology since the late 19 th century and within these massively funded black budgets that the usa and probably russia have not managed to explore this solar system is more unthinkable than to beleive they have. Humanitys past is very complicated and i have no doubt we have active and thriving off world colonies and bases throughout our solar system. Not just for the resources but for our safety as well, as it is very crucial for earth and humanity to monitor and patrol our solar system just the same as our nation states patrol their exclusive economic zones in the oceans of earth.  Advanced nuclear propulsion and anti gravity propulsion.  If indeed the rumours are true we use these two technologies to power our off world fleet. I firmly beleive anti gravity tech was RE DISCOVERED by german expeditions in the early 20 th century and brought back to life as the germans re built and re armed in the run up to ww2. This technolgy was so complicated the germans were unable to scale it up in time to win the war, obviously both american and russian factions scrambled for as many pieces of the technolgy as they could get, with the usa having a slight advantage since most germans knew surrender to the ussr meant death by execution or a slow laborious death in a siberian work camp.  Over the last 80 plus yrs the kinks have been worked out and many classified deep black projects have commenced.   Nano technology and genetic engineering. It is a distinct possibility that the deep black world has become a breakaway civilization with access to exotic technology we will never be able to use. Use of genetic engineering could and probably has been utilized to build a superior version of homo sapien. Nanotech if funded properly could easily yield vast amd distinct advantages to a faction that manages to develop it. Nanodust could be sent on missions to gather intel and never be recognized as a threat by the target. A specific type of nano machine could be developed to kill human targets or infect computers and would never even be seen by the target.  Manipulation of the time-space. I would be shocked more if it did not exist than if it did. The ability to manipulate time space is probably the key to american domination of this timeline.  How invaluable to be able to access time space for a sneek peak right! Time-space can also be used as transportation, wormhole technology probably allows far greater distances to be covered than even anti gravity or nuclear propulsion technologies do. Mankind may have even been able to communicate with and visit our progenitors many light yrs away. Or colonize earth like planets far away to insure survival of the human race  Mind control and societal control through the use of extreme low frequency waves or elf waves. This technology is most surely being used on a mass scale worldwide. Certain elf frequencies can mock human brain waves within the cranial cavity. Subliminal messages and or just an unpleasant feeling can result from elf wave deployment. Wide scale tumult and rioting could be influenced by elf wave manipulation as can widespread conformity and subdued behaviors.  As i watched the arab spring just happen overnight and mushroom into a large scale regional event i could not help but wonder if covert use of elf waves enabled this action to happen and was used to snowball it to a larger regional widespread disturbance.  I cannot say with 100% certainty that any of this is actually true. I can say using my vast knowledge and intuition i am personally veey much convinced that these technologies do indeed exist and are in fact used on or by mankind for various purposes and reasons. I reccomend that these subjects be studied and researched very carefully and observed in the proper context. Our world is most likely a world of two different sets of rules, the old fashioned set of rules for the useless eaters like us, and a set of rules that transcends our understanding of the physical world and has gone beyond that to the metaphysical.

            "answer_text": "The goal of any battle is to disable your enemy's ability to do something, which is usually the ability to resist.  Disabling an infrastructure, such as communication or power, is very effective.  Cyber warfare capabilities probably exist with the ability to shutdown any component of an enemy's infrastructure.  Want your electricity back?  Send the US 6-billion BitCoins.  Exposing the existence of cyber weapons allows others to develop defenses, so naturally it would be top secret. ",
