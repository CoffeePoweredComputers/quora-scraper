            "answer_text": "I had a hybrid 14 years ago and thought it was impractical for me given that 90% of my driving was highway and it only activated below 30 mph, so my next car was regular internal combustion engine. But, I hear that the newer versions, the plug-in hybrid has conqured that problem, but with added weight for a battery. To me, though, the dollar investment to have two propulsion systems and a larger carbon footprint is not as sophisticated or cost efficient as an all electric. So, I went with all-electric Tesla, partly for the $7,500 tax reduction which was still available in 2018 and partly because of the $250 per month saving from eliminating gasoline. Electric beats Hybrid! Saving the 40 minutes per month I used to spend in filling stations is a nice added bonus, too. But, one of my two favorite things about the Model 3 is the 17 speaker Dolby sound system and the ability to go from 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds when I really want it. ",

            "answer_text": "On a personal level: driving is cheaper and more fun now that my family has replaced our ICE vehicles with a BEV and a PHEV, and we still have the capability to impulsively drive thousands of miles from home in any direction, if the urge strikes. One of our cars has a 250-mile range and fast charging; the other one goes 40 on electrons and 400 on gas, so it earns its keep as a commuter while still being long-haul happy. The extra dollars we paid are coming back to us over time, and we will be net positive long before the vehicles\u2019 likely end of life.The big picture: electric is a more sustainable means of transportation, because it uses much less energy and because it decouples the transport sector from obligate reliance on one basic source and enables us to use any fossil or renewable source that can be processed for electrical energy. Also, just as it is cheaper over time for one person to drive electric, it is also cheaper for a company or a nation to do so (funny how that works). Hybrid technology is a great means to an end, as it enables today\u2019s drivers to get some of the benefits of both technologies, but compared to sufficiently mature BEV models, it will appear needlessly complex and costly. For example: the Volt was a great idea in 2012 when the ICE components meant you could leave out 1,000 pounds of batteries and save $20K\u2026 when those numbers have fallen by 90%, it will be pointless for most applications, and that time is not far off. Gas-electric hybrids like the traditional Prius have arguably already past the peak of their usefulness, as they still rely on 100% fossil energy and their performance has been rapidly surpassed by more advanced hybrids emphasizing electric motors and relegating gas to extra energy storage.",
