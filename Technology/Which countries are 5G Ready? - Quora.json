The surprising global leader for 5G readinessChina is winning the 5G raceChinese company Huawei has achieved 20 Gbps speed in its 5G test. Huawei hits 20 Gbps in 5G testSouth Korean telecom operators built a clever plan to introduce 5G quickly into the country by agreeing to build a single 5G network that would save time and money. South Korean carriers agree to build single 5G network, saving money and timeSouth Korean operators to share 5G network infrastructure costs(If Jio and Airtel had agreed to build together and share 5G network, India could have been in a little better position in 5G readiness.) USA carrier AT&T wants to launch 5G this year itself. AT&T promises blazing-fast 5G in U.S. by end of 2018 |But Verizon wants to be ahead of AT&T in 5G and wants to launch in the second half of 2018.

SK Telcom has acquired spectrum in the 3.5 GHz and 28 GHz frequencies in anticipation of deploying 5G. Meanwhile, Korea Telecom made a splash in early 2017 with its announcement that it would roll out a trial 5G network ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. The trail network is expected to cover events in Bokwang, Gangneung, Jeongseon, PyeongChang, and Seoul.5G Network Countries: ChinaChina is also expected to be a fast-mover in 5G. The GSMA estimates that by 2025 China will represent 40 percent of global 5G connections. According to a study from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, the research arm of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), 5G could account for 3.2 percent of China\u2019s entire GDP in 2025, generate 8 million jobs, and add 2.9 trillion yuan in economic value by 2030. As hungry consumers demand more and more 5G services, the country expects a huge increase in the number of new companies, employment opportunities, and equipment sales.5G Network Countries: JapanJapan is mobilizing its communications industry in the hopes of being among the top 5G network players. According to Nikkei Asian Review, NTT DoCoMo and Sohgo Security Services demonstrated an advanced security service based on a 5G network technology to determine the effectiveness of the service in handling security for the opening ceremonies of the 2020 Olympics. The trial involved the use of artificial intelligence (AI), a drone with an HD 4K camera, and smartphones.5G Network Countries: The United StatesThe United States has some advantages in the 5G network race. Namely, the U.S. already has a lead when it comes to existing 4G networks, thanks to spectrum holdings and the use of unlicensed spectrum. The United States also leads the way in spectrum efficiency, permitting the repurposing of broadcast spectrum for broadband. However, the United States also has disadvantages slowing it down in the 5G network race between countries. Local and municipal governments hold zoning authority over cell towers and base stations, which can slow down authorization \u2014 a potentially bad sign for 5G, which will be characterized by a dense network of small cells.
