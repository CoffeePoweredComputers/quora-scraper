            "answer_text": "What magic? The miracle that humans are intelligent enough to have invented biochemical warfare? The magic that black people have managed to survive in America after all they have endured over the years from racists? (very fortuitous for America!) The magic that some people can still love children even when their own parents hated them? Or the magic that allows people to feel nothing and look the other way while people they don't know get attacked? These things are all \u201cmagical\u201d to me because they defy my comprehension. I don't know what other \u201cmagic\u201d you expect to find in the real world. People sure seem to cling to their illusions of something \u201cbetter out there\u201d. What kind of extrasensory perception would allow one to see such things that show no evidence of being real? I believed in a god for a while. But that was just my mind grasping at straws\u2014 especially when I heard nonsense like: \u201cGive others food and your table will never be empty.\u201d I tested that proposition by doing what comes naturally to me and still went hungry. And those homeless people being ignored and blamed for their own troubles are some of the most generous folks I have ever encountered. Where is their abundance? But they are like me. Most of them still do their best and try to be caring people even as their contributions are devalued. It is real magic to feel hatred but choose to be loving when it is easier to be one of the apathetic masses who pretend the world is full of rosy gates just waiting to be opened. Any \u201cmagic\u201d to be found is in the muck of existence\u2014 the flowers lingering in muddy sidewalk cracks. The plants that manage not to snap off in a hurricane are \u201cmagical\u201d. My son's smile is magical because he has little reason to be happy. If he were a fully able-bodied person with no physical ailments, Harry's smile would be far less \u201cmagical\u201d\u2014 but still beautiful because children are so vulnerable in this world. So, trying to \u201csee magic\u201d would yield me only illusions. I do see hints of \u201cmagic\u201d in the world. I would have ended my life long ago if I saw nothing in the darkness. ",

You cannot dissect every \u201cmagic\" thing, analyze it, question it, criticize it, put it in a neat little mathematical folder, and consider it \u201c magic\" anymore. It becomes a \u201c subject for debate\", a \u201c silly notion\". What exactly is MAGIC anyway? Might as well explain LOVE, because there's magic to that. Might as well try to explain how a man might be mesmerized to watch his wife brush her hair before bed. I've heard men remark how they could watch this for hours. Might as well try to explain the magic feeling at Christmas time ( for many) that makes man be a little kinder to each other. And the seasons \u2026how everything changes not only around us, but even us, as Spring makes us feel \u201c new\" again, with a new energy, after a long sleep. Romantic notions ? I think not. It is real as a brand new day. And that is MAGIC too ! ",

            "answer_text": "Magic is Real - it\u2019s what we consider to be \u2018magic\u2019 that is at question. Magic can be thought of as the sense of awe and wonder we experience when we see nature; magic has been defined by some as a true understanding of the nature of nature. Magic can be thought of as the sense of being a small part of a larger universe yet still being able to recognise changes within and around us. Magic can be thought of as being the creativity of musicians, artists, poets, writers - the very core of what we call our imagination. Magic can be seen as recognition of the limited nature of our perceptions and our own understanding of reality. Magic can be considered as a tendency to subscribe to a pre-Scientific view of the world that is not necessarily primitive or naive. Magic, replete with Warlocks, Wizards, Witches, Dwarves, Elves and Necromancers are part and parcel of the Role Playing Worlds and Mythos\u2026 What someone means by the labels they use can be infinitely more interesting than our own limited definitions\u2026 Alan /|\\ ",
