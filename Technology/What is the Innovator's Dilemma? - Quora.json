            "answer_text": "I'll first agree that you should read Innovator's Dilemma, and Innovator's Solution. Don't skip Solution. I should also point out that the issue is not unique to technology. Steel mills are a perfect example of the innovator's dilemma.  I'll temp fate by attempting to summarize from memory here... The Innovator's Dilemma deals with the fact that an established company, doing what it is supposed to be doing -- better serving its highest revenue and highest margin customers -- sets itself up for getting its butt kicked by new entrants. The setup comes from the pace of change in the product outstripping the true need of the customers. For instance, think of CPUs. Back in the day the difference between a 25mHz and 33mHz CPU was huge. But now, do most people really need a faster, more core, more hyper-threaded CPU? Probably not. That leads room at the bottom of the market to be better served by a new entrant, with a less performant product, at a lower price point (which works for them because they have a more efficient cost structure than the incumbent.) The incumbents are paralyzed by the threat. Should they care about their worst customers, on their lowest cost/margin products fleeing to a competitor? Can they compete without cannibalizing their revenue and margins? Thus, the dilemma... Solution lays out some ways incumbents can and have responded to the threat successfully, but it is a rare thing. HP managed it, for instance. The \"disruption\" mentioned in other answers comes from the means that new entrants use to get into a market. They generally use \"low end disruption\", that is providing a worse product at a lower price point for people already in the market but over served by incumbents, or \"new market disruption\" where a product competes with non-consumption (think minicomputers, back when all computers were centrally managed). Big change does not equal disruptive change. Some big changes aren't disruptive, and some disruptive changes are not considered radical advances. The Law of Conversation of Profits is a key concept worth understanding as well. This is a core component of understanding when integrated systems should be winning and when component-ized systems should be winning based on product performance. When overall performance isn't meeting the minimum standard, integrated systems should be winning -- providing the most profits. When over performance reaches \"good enough\", profits start coming from makers of standardized components. Most people use this to explain the shift of profits from integrated PC builders to PC component makers. But it also explains the recent raise of Apple's OS X, by redefining what \"good enough\" means in home computer performance away from speed and toward integration of software and usability. Let the arrows fly.... ",

Would you vote for any of the top innovators who created the most successful companies in the USA? Not the ones who are simply richbut the ones like Bill Gates who wants to stop malariathe ones who want to spread the internet to the darkest corners of earththe ones who offer free educationthe ones who create the technical manna from heaven to feed the poor Innovation has moved on to become a clearly political sideshowthat will eventually become center stage The car sold on the basis that it is non-pollutingthat is safer to drivethat is harder to stealthat is better to parkrather than 0-60 in a nanosecond In answer to the question of the Innovator's dilemmayour product/service must now carry the notice that it does what it says on the canand contains no artificial baloney , advertising blarney, technical eyewash, or medical gobbledegook, and is suitable for those with political allergies If you have just invented a pocket size nuclear fusion machinetake a course in speech writing before you pitch it ",
