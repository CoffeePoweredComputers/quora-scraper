            "answer_text": "We live in a rapidly progressing world where technology is developing and progressing every single day. It changes and improves at a rate which man could not have once predicted, but one general concept of technology has remained fundamentally the same since the beginning of digital media which is digital technology. Digital technology is essentially the breakdown of messages, signals or forms of communication between the creating device and the receiving device through the use of a string of information known as the binary code. A binary code to a regular individual would appear as a range of ones and zeros rather than a form of digital information but this is what is reassembled once it has been received by the other machine. \u2018Digital Technology\u2019 in binary code is \u201801000100 01101001 01100111 01101001 01110100 01100001 01101100 00100000 01010100 01100101 01100011 01101000 01101110 01101111 01101100 01101111 01100111 01111001\u2019. A simple way to look at digital technology is to take the example of mobile phones which break down a text message or voice call into binary code before reassembling the code at the receiving mobile phone. The benefits of the binary code include the increased speed, effectiveness and general reliability of the process. The main change that has been seen in the area of digital technology over the past decades is the speed in which this process works and that it used to occur with pulses of electricity rather than the binary code. Looking back once again towards the example of phones, the change in technology is not only shown through the obvious changes in size and capability but also the speed and clarity in which the processes work. Technology has entirely modified the way we live life and in years to come the changes will be incredible. While the future of technology is uncertain and unpredictable one thing is certain - Digital technology will always be a part of the transfer of digital information. ",

The given information is usually in the form of binary codes, which are characters representing 0 & 1. The devices used to process and use digital information include calculators, personal computers, traffic light controllers, automobiles, cellular telephones, and so more. Digital technology is known to comprise of working processes, principles, and standards applying to the technology standards. Digital technology is known to enhance the overall creativity level, along with the process of information distribution.  source:Google Some of the leading fields that make use of revolutionary digital technologies are: Telecommunication: Data communication is the technology that is based on using electrical signals for computer systems. Signals tend to be intermittent and make use of the binary number system. Tools in the given digital technology tend to be highly stable while delivering great durability of use.Architecture: In addition to the development of digital technology finding its applications across multiple fields, an architect's profession also gets affected by using revolutionary digital technology. The utilization of digital technology allows architects to develop complex architectural designs.Front-end DeveloperFront-end developers are IT experts who specialize in website interface designs. If you are actively looking for software development career opportunities as a front-end developer and interested in building the \u2018client-side\u2019 of web applications or websites, then this role is perfect for you.
