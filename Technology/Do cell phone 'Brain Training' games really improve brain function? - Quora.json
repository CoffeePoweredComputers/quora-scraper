The Neuroscience of Intelligence, Cambridge University Press for a full discussion. Some businesses have marketed brain training games with the claim that they improve mental performance. Lumosity is one example of a game that was sold for this purpose. The FTC's alleged that Lumos Ads misled customers with false or deceptive advertising, and that the company had failed to disclose that many of its testimonials had been solicited as part of a contest that offered winners prizes such as iPads, lifetime subscriptions to Lumosity, or a free trip to San Francisco. As part of the settlement, Lumos Labs agreed to pay the FTC $50 million but a district court suspended all but $2 million of that amount because the company couldn\u2019t actually afford it. ",

Since if there is far too much of something-then there is an imbalance of sorts that is ensuing. That is why, rather than over expecting-first learn to earnestly accept the actuality/reality of what\u2019s already being and how that could be further strengthened ever more remarkably\u2026\u2026\u2026for then from that/those gradual sets of self awareness will emerge far more unique sets of insights to appropriate identify ever more commendable ways to meritoriously evolve.

            "answer_text": "Thanks RKS for A2A. In a crude way, I think it may improve brain efficiency. These brain exercises draw more blood and in the process nutrients and oxygen is brought to the active brain areas. In addition, pathways that otherwise impede signals get partially cleared of garbage and toxins. I personally do not these games but have seen a few on internet. I have my own ways to achieve the above objectives through recitation and memorization of verses. These are very helpful for me. Despite \u2018sagging intelligence\u2019 I am trying to retain a satisfactory level. Thanks for reading. ",
