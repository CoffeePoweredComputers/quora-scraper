            "answer_text": "A2A This question has come in many forms on Quora: Is the sun coming closer to the Earth?Is the earth moving closer to the sun?Is it true that each year the earth is getting closer to the sun?Since our orbit is an ellipse, we move closer to (147.1 million km), and farther from the sun (152.1 million km), on a repeating cycle each year. We are closer during the winter and further during the summer months (it\u2019s the opposite seasons in the southern hemisphere). The mean orbital radius is increasing ever so gradually as the sun loses mass. There have been many studies, and many scientific papers written on this subject, and the consensus is that as the sun loses mass, it\u2019s gravitational attraction weakens, resulting in all of the planets moving further away from the sun over the entire lifespan of the sun, but it is nearly imperceptible. It has not been observed, rather it has been calculated mathematically. The best estimates suggest that the Earth is currently moving away from the sun by about 15 cm per year. Since our orbital radius is an average of nearly 150 million km, we won\u2019t notice any difference, and it has little to no effect on our climate. Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun experiences many cyclical changes lasting thousands of years. These cyclical changes have a more profound effect than our orbit\u2019s increasing in radius by a mere 15 cm per year.
