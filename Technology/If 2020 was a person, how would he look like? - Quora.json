Since this year started I'm struggling to conquer my goals but when I don't hear something worth my hardwork it disappoints me everyday but in night all my heart tells me that it's okay to fail, I've done my job honestly, I should continue my hardwork and should chase for happiness. Goal shouldn't be career wise but it should be for happy life. ",
