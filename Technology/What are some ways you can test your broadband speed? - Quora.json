            "answer_text": "Just because your ISP advertises certain WiFi speeds doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re actually getting what you\u2019re paying for. Network congestions occur when multiple clients use a single shared Internet connection at the same time, which often happens in apartment buildings and with less reputable ISPs. Of course, your WiFi speed may suffer even when your ISP delivers on its promises. For example, there could be a strong interference caused by other WiFi networks operating on the same WiFi channel as your network. Or your home router may be placed in a bad spot, causing the signal to reach only to certain parts of your home. A simple, quick WiFi speed test is often everything you need to check whether your WiFi is performing as it should. How Do WiFi Speed Test Apps Work? Virtually all WiFi speed test apps test the following components: latency, upload speed, and download speed. From the point of view of regular Internet user, download speed is the most important measurement as it dictates how fast websites load and how long it takes for websites to load, but latency and upload speed are also critical for having an enjoyable web browsing experience. What Is Latency? In computer networking, latency is the time it takes data packets travel from their point of origin to their destination. Let\u2019s say you want to download a file from a remote server. You already have the download link, so you simply paste it into your web browser and press Enter. Depending on your Internet connection, it may take anywhere from several milliseconds to several seconds for the download to begin because it takes a certain time for the server to fulfill the download request. The time it takes for the reply to arrive is latency, and WiFi speed test apps typically test it multiple times before determining the final result. ",

I believe just Google \u201cspeed test\u201d\u2026it's free and you should see other choices, in case you want something else\u2026I believe you an also test your cell phone as well\u2026I actually never have, my cell is pretty much a phone only \u201cStar Trek\u201d flip phone\u2026some people like having a Comm. Center in their pocket\u2026I just need a phone\u2026 Oh sure. the new phones have about a billion pixel, hi-def camera\u2026but I am very sure, if I saw \u201cAliens\u201d or Bigfoot (Sasquatch) the picture would be blurry, or generally out of focus, because that's how things work\u2026. Good Luck..and don\u2019t be surprised the download speed doesn\u2019t match the upload speed\u2026it's called having asymmetrical service\u2026 Good Luck (again) Dave ",
