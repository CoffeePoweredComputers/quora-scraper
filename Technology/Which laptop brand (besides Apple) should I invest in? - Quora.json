            "answer_text": "You can take this question three ways. I\u2019m fairly sure you mean it one way, but the others are more fun to answer. Which laptop brand should I use an an investment. With this you need to find brands (and makes) which are likely to appreciate in value over time. The obvious answer is existing classics like the Commodore SX-64 . While they are desirable and have fixed (if not reducing) supply, however they are already desirable and thus command a fairly high price. The real way to do this would be to take a few risks on unique laptops only a few generations old, where they are being sold off cheap in order to get the next one up. An example of one to have got in too would have been the Sony Vaio UX Micro PC . GPD Win and SMACH Z are likely where I\u2019d start. Few people will hark back to their identical black Dell. Which laptop brand should I get emotionally invested in? None. Really they are all just companies after ya cash. Which laptop brand should I buy for a laptop I\u2019m gonna use? Honestly, not a huge difference between them. But what are you going to do it? That is what really matters. Some (like Apple) make attractive and well build devices, but the many laptops at this price point are also attractive and well built. ",
