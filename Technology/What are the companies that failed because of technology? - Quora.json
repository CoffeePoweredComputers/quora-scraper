            "answer_text": "Rolodex: For those too young to know what a Rolodex is, it was essentially the easiest and most compact tool for storing and organising contact information\u2014especially for businesses. This was before the days of Google Contacts or Microsoft Outlook.But once computers/smartphones became popular, Rolodex became obsolete because you could store all of your contact information in the same device that you use to make calls, texts, and send e-mails.Technically, Rolodex is still alive, but only barely. They were acquired by Rubbermaid, and began selling other office supplies in order to stay alive.Blockbuster: They used to be the most popular video rental chain in the entire world. Nowadays, if you want to watch a movie, why would you physically go to a store to rent a CD or tape when you could simply download the film online?Borders: They were the Blockbuster of literature. Again, why would anybody physically go to a store to buy a book when you can order it on Amazon and have it delivered right to your door? Or better yet, download the e-book or audio book straight onto your phone or tablet?Barnes & Noble managed to stay alive because they had the foresight to come up with the Nook. But with the recent decline in pretty much all tablets except for the iPad, Barnes & Noble is nearing the border to bankruptcy. (See what I did there? Border? Get it? Hahaha. Haha. Hehe. Sorry. I\u2019ll leave now.)",

            "answer_text": "A2A: First, we have to define what we mean by \u201cfailed\u201d. Do you mean companies that were entirely liquidated like WebVan or as is happening now to Toys R Us? Do you include companies that were radically downsized in bankruptcy but still survive today like Kodak? Do you include companies that were sold or merged but returned value to their shareholders like Yahoo? Next, we have to define what we mean by \u201cbecause of technology\u201d. Do you mean because the companies sold obsoleted technologies, like Lear\u2019s 8 track tapes, that became completely superseded by a competitor\u2019s new technologies (like Phillips compact cassettes and CDs)? or Blockbuster Video Rental stores that were replaced by mail order and streaming video services like NetFlix? Do you include companies whose products relied exclusively on technologies that were previously dominant and still survive today, but are now a small portion of the market they used to dominate, like happened to Radio Drama production companies, like Orson Welles\u2019 Mercury Theatre of the Air, after TV became ubiquitous, or Brick and Mortar Retailers like Borders Books and RadioShack whose market has been largely seized by Online Retailers like Amazon? Do you include overly ambitious technologies that came to market too early and were then shutdown due to insufficient adoption like WebTV or Go Corporation\u2019s tablets? ",
