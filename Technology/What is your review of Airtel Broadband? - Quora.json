            "answer_text": "I'm using Airtel broadband for an year exactly. I live in Chandigarh. This is my first ever broadband connection so there were a lot of things i learned. I started with 799 plan in which i got 100gb of Internet at somewhat 2mb/s (torrent speed). I mentioned torrent speed because most of us use torrents nowadays and it would be useless to talk about other tests like speedtest by ookla etc. Later i changed my plan, i had some issues with them and now I'm about to disconnect. Now the connection procedure was simple. I made a request online, within 2 days, someone came and i was asked to fill their registration form and give other documents. My aadhar wasn't updated so my mother filled the form and gave her documents. He took 500 rupees. Next day another person came and did the wiring etc. He later setup the modem it was done. The day was Sunday which surprised me that these guys work even on Sundays. After one month, my first bill came. It was 436. I didn't knew that the 500 i gave during registration was adjusted in it. The Amazon prime subscription was given to me after my first bill. I was happy and everything was good. Now, here comes the bad part. The 799 plan was actually 799+142. 18% gst. I don't have any problem with GST but for my parents surely had. After 4 months, they asked me to downgrade my plan. I reduced my plan to 499. Within seconds my Amazon prime service was disabled. I still remember that day. I was watching Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. After that train scene, the video automatically stopped and they removed that prime service. I immediately called 121 and asked them why it happened. The guy said that i downgraded my plan that's why the company discontinued my prime service. I upgraded my service immediately to 999. But still the service was stopped. Then onwards (January 2019-till today) i was paying 1175 for 200gb. 2 months ago, my friends came to know that I'm having a broadband connection. They called me a fool for paying nearly 1200 for 200gb with just 2mb/s. My parents literally paid my bill from my pocket money. That clearly frustrated me. Now just like Amazon prime, Airtel gives Netflix free for 3 months. Also i had around 500+ gb data. My Netflix plan will end this week. So i decided to consume all of my data and disconnect my broadband before my bill comes. Now I'm downloading around 50+ gb data (games, movies etc.) daily. I will disconnect my Broadband on saturday. I'm thinking about netplus as their plans are cheap and the speed is better. Overall i would say, Airtel is good as long as you don't give a f about money. I don't know about other cities but in Chandigarh, its expensive. I'm a gamer, i personally didn't used my Netflix or Amazon prime that much. 2500 of free services aren't bad. Maybe I'm too harsh on them. But it's up to you to decide. ",

            "answer_text": "I applied for Airtel broadband on July 4, 2020 in the morning. An exec came and checked for feasibility of installation at 4p.m, told me all was well and asked me to pay the bill generated ( ecaf_0401661798). I was having a slight problem with my existing provider, and this was to be an extra connection. He said it would be done in 24 hrs. After that, for a whole week I daily called the person who had generated the bill, then a manager, Mr.Sudhakar L, who kept promising me it would be done in \u201cnext two hours\u201d. I also went to the nearest Airtel outlet thrice in that one week. Finally, after a week, I sent an email to the appellate authority, asking how long it would take. I just received an email from Thanzeem, my \u201cairtel experience advisor\u201d. Oh, I just love their titles. He apologized for my inconvenience, and told me the money had been refunded. Just like that. Airtel says \u201cwe keep talking to you\u201d or some such joke in their ad. That\u2019s all they do. Talk. Keep talking. If this is how their service is in the installation phase, I wonder how it would be once you have a real complaint - internet speed slow or net down etc. Luckily I\u2019m spared that suffering. I still haven\u2019t received the money in my bank account. Fingers crossed. ",
