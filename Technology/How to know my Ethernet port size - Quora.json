            "answer_text": "???? The physical port on computers and routers (called RJ45) has 8 wire conductors and has been the same standard size for decades The physical port used by phone and dsl cords is RJ11 or RJ12. This is smaller than RJ45 and has 4 or 6 conductors inside of it. If you are referring to TCP/IP port numbers (like port 80 for http or port 21 for ftp) well that is just an identification number, it is nothing physical to have any actual size. ",

            "answer_text": "I never knew they had sizes. They do have speeds. 10, 100, 1000. Usually there are indicator lights on the periphery of the port that indicated the speed of the connection established (negotiated), which is at the maximum of what the two parties can handle. You will have to consult your equipment manual to see what lights they used. When I was designing equipment we used green for 100 MB and yellow for 10 MB; my piece of gear did not have 1000 MB capability. ",
