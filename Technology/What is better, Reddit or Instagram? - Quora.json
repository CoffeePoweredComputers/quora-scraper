Granted, it's not GitHub or stackoverflow. But Redditors are very friendly in answering quirky, witty and tricky questions. And you have Instagram which will steal the worst shitposted memes from Reddit and infect itself like a virus. If you want to be trendy with modern teenage girls pop culture, nosedive yourself into the ocean of human excrement, called the Instagram. If you are a millennial, looking for dank memes, suicide jokes, dark jokes, witty answers from someone like you, Reddit is your best friend. ",

For a more personal, friend to friend basis go for Instagram. Instagram does have millions of pages dedicated to specific topics and niches but that is more focused on the social side.
