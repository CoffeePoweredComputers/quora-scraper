            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question bro The OnePlus Nord features a 6.44-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels and pixel density of 408 ppi. There's a 90Hz refresh rate and the aspect ratio of 20:9 makes the 6.44-inch display easy to hold. ... Also, while the 90Hz refresh rate sounds good, note that it drains the battery faster.and it's a pretty good display for the price but if you reduce the brightness top much and use it in dark you will see green tint on the display.
