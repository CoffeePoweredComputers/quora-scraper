            "answer_text": "There is many ways to earn $5000 a month but it wont be easy. Most people think that making $5000 a month whether you have master degree, being entrepreneur or even you get raised to CEO position its easy. You got to think of life like video games, there is level to achieve make $5000 per month which is hard work. For my own experience, I can tell you that building an income source that makes me $3000 per month was a long journey for me. I had to sacrifice a lot of things that i used to do everyday. It was hard but it was worth in the end. So dont get me wrong, it is absolutely possible to make $5000 every month. There is Youtubers making $10000 per month and look how they living right now. My best advice you can start making money right now is Affiliate Marketing. Affiliate marketing is one of the easiest ways to generate a passive income and make money while you sleep. The only way you will actually make $5000 per month on affiliate marketing if you put a big initial effort into a campaign. I started affiliate marketing this year in 2019 and I am generate $3000 per month already but it still felt like long journey for me to make that amount of money. I will definitely advice you look into affiliate marketing, it will change your life. GOOD LUCK, Elijah Campbell ",

            "answer_text": "There are many options. The most common are the sites where you get money for clicking on ads, filling forms, completing surveys, offers, etc. But these methods hardly earn you 1000 a month. I would advice you to start blogging or YouTubing on something you are good at. For example, if you are good at computers, start blogging on that! Or if you like to cook and create new dishes, create a food blog. Or you could make a YouTube channel on computers. You can give tutorials and reviewing electronics and what not. Or start a food channel on YouTube where you show people what you cooked and how and the recipe. I would recommend these two - blog and YouTube. But it can take months to start earning 5000. If you put a lot of effort and interest you can become a millionaire. Many YouTubers make millions and their job is YouTube. You can also start working if you have a degree. That way you can easily get more than 5000. You can contact me thru Quora if you want more tips on Blogging and YouTube and how to earn money thru it. ",
