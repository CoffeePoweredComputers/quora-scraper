            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t. In America at least, politicians can make upwards of $174,000 per year, but teachers average about $40,000 per year. Politicians generally receive gifts or lobbying payments for their votes along with her usual paycheck from the US government. Teachers, on the other hand, typically earn income from one source. They generally don\u2019t except any third-party payments unless they work in separate fields or companies outside of school. The question if they should earn more than politicians is an interesting political discussion to consider. One could make the claim that teachers work longer hours for minimal pay, sometimes in unsafe conditions or in adequately furnished environments. Educating the future of a nation isn\u2019t an easy task. Increasing the pay rate for teachers would make the field competitive, so only the best of the best teachers of their fields would be placed in schools. As a counter, there are so many teachers already that\u2019s an increase in pay would deduct from any extracurricular activities or programs funded by school budgets. There would be too many teachers to pay if this policy was implemented today. It could also lead to a significant tax increase for the parents of students, causing problems in already low-income areas. Politicians, on the other hand, represent their state and nation while making various difficult decisions that can determine the future of their region/district/state. The pay rate for politicians may be well-deserved because of the demanding nature of their career. However, a case could be made that their \u201cdemanding\u201d careers are often negated with lavish lifestyles. The payment from the government seems excessive, along with lobbying payments and briberies common in the labyrinths of legislation. While question of teacher pay increase to rival politicians seems like the \u201cright\u201d thing to do, it would not be economically feasible. Increasing the paycheck for thousands of school teachers wouldn\u2019t be something school districts, especially in low-income areas, could handle. This isn\u2019t to say that teacher should get raises at all; we should reconsider where tax money is going toward. The argument brings attention to a question of philosophical importance: what do we value more, what we want to hear or what we should hear? ",
