            "answer_text": "Indian political system gives same powers and roles to the men and women irrespective of their gender. India had Ms Indira Gandhi as the Prime Minister of the country for around 15 years. Many states had and have women Chief Ministers. The names of External Affairs Minister Shrimati Sushma Swaraj, Lok Sabha Speaker Ms Sumitra Mahajan ,INC President Ms Soniya Gandhi, Late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalitha, West Bengal\u2019s CM Mamta Bannerjee ,former Uttar Pradesh CM Sushri Mayawati , Present Rajasthan\u2019s CM Ms Vasundhara Raje Scindhiya ,don\u2019t need any introduction. They had and have played prominent and decisive role in the politics of modern India. But when we do a reality check in the grassroots of the Indian political system we can easily find the role of women is just restricted to a vote bank. Yes, the government has done various measures towards this . The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act (Statutory provisions for Panchyat Raj as third level of administration in villages) and the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act (Statutory provisions for Local Administrative bodies as third level of administration in urban areas such as towns and cities) provide for 50% reservation in the both the bodies . This has also given rise to the participation of women in the electoral process, but most of the time the elected women representatives are puppets of their husbands or other male member of the family. The above picture seems gloomy, but various good aspects has also came out with the increased participation of women . Last year in UP a 112 year old lady became Gram Pradhan. We have many examples where many women have come forward and chosen a path of development for themselves and the village as a whole. Ms Chavi Rajawat , Sarpanch of Village soda, 60 km from Jaipur, Rajasthan is well known for her development works in the village and especially for women . She left her corporate job to serve the village . And the election of 22 year old jeans clad Ms Pooja Singh Nagar (who is an engineer by profession) in Morena , Madhya Pradesh which is one of the orthodox areas of India. These women are inspirations for the generations to come. India has taken a great leap in the role of women in politics since Independence . But there are still many areas where government and society need to transform and work a lot. The number of women Member of Parliaments and Member of Legislative Assemblies is still low. The Women Resrvation Bill for 33 % reservation for Women in Lok Sabha And State Legislative Assemblies saw an outrage by all the main parties in the Parliament. Women security, Female infanticide , low sex ratio, women illiteracy , higher maternity death rates and many more problems are still a concern in 21st century India . It now depends on the people of India and especially women to work for their upliftment and for taking decisive participation in Indian politics. ",

            "answer_text": "Politics in India today is more about money & muscle power. One is supposed to have really good connections and backup for making a mark here. Heirarchy definitely plays a role. Though women have been given reservations for ensuring their fair participation, still women from mostly influential families, preferably from political families become successful in strengthening their hold. It's unfortunate that like every where even in politics the actual purpose of reservations doesn't hold good. Though statistics show, women turnout during India's 2014 parliamentary general elections was 65.63%, compared to 67.09% turnout for men and that India ranks 20th from the bottom in terms of representation of women in Parliament, which might show a fairly good picture of Women's political involvement, but there is still a lot of misogyny prevailing in Indian politics. No matter that women have held the posts of president and prime minister in India, as well as chief ministers of various states and that Indian voters have elected women to numerous state legislative assemblies and national parliament for many decades, but the distribution still remains biased. Politics in India has become adulterated beyond control, maybe it is this dirt associated with politics with keep away actually talented and deserving women away from politics. Though we have got many female politicians on the topmost strata of Indian politics today, but still even they are more driven by power hunger rather than the selfless will to serve. Hence to actually ensure a fair and unbiased representative political culture, it is important that politics be made free if hooligans and money flaunters. So that not only women from privileged families with backup and patriarchal support get into power play, but actually talented and dedicated women also get a fair chance to raise and shine in political picture of India.
