            "answer_text": "The Dominican republic is a democracy\u2026controlled by a few people. Those same peoples also control the media (and Congress and the judicial system) so up to a few years ago they could manipulate events and news to their hearts content. Now the people are starting to disregards the media outlets the know to be under government control and are opting to the get the news from online independent sources. This have made Facebook and twitter the preferred mediums to get unbiased reports of the situations happening in the country. This was evident a few weeks back when a big citizen protest was totally ignored by all TV channels (most under the control of the government or with ties to it) and news outlet only appearing as a secondary report at the end of most news telecast.  This march blocked all eastbound car routes in the city for most of the day. And nobody reported on it but it blanketed all social media outlets as people promptly uploaded images of the event and did live cast from the site showing the success of the event.  The public outcry made the President acknowledge the protest movement. This would had not being able to occur a few years ago without the massive use we have now of Smartphones and social media. ",

It's making people voices heard, and the cries of citizens tired of corruption rotting a very rich country poorly ruled by corrupt politicians.  It's creating lots of opportunities for people and creating jobs, we were once an economy soley driven by tourism and manufacturing and technology is rapidly changing that. ",
