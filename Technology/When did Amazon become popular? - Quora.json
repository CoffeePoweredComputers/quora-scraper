            "answer_text": "Foreword: I work for Amazon so some of the enthusiasm you see is biased Amazon like many other start ups was a quiet Seattle venture running out of Jeff's garage.  The first few orders were mostly one from his family and when the first public order came, people in Amazon then couldn't believe that someone from external, ordered. Amazon's famous 1997 share holder letter is as famous as it can become.  You can read a copy at 14 Years Ago Jeff Bezos Told You How To Take Over The World and few other places made investors turn and look at the company that had a different view of running business.  The long term vision. Jeff had this vision of just focusing on customers and leaving aside everything, including competition, which would help in eventually winning more and more customers, that drive more demand that would require more inventory that would in turn increase the items that customers can buy.  The famous flywheel theory that Jeff introduced is hugely popular and is available in public videos. By 1999, after two years of IPO Amazon was still doing well although the dotcom bust was around the corner and with increased inventory, new businesses, Amazon was growing year on year but yet to see a profit. Frankly, no one envisioned that internet speeds would grow multi fold and people would need the convenience of ordering from home as against walking to a shop.  Jeff had this vision. Amazon also ventured into Cloud business around late 2006 whereby they consolidated all the extra hardware they used for the Holiday season sales (which would become redundant during rest of the year) and exposing it as services to the world, again a pioneering effort in Cloud Services. By 2010, Amazon was the company that investors looked upon for being both visionary in new businesses as well as aggressive and ever expanding in its core e-Commerce business. Amazon does have its equal amount of challenges that it needs to resolve for the current decade. ",

            "answer_text": "Started first as an eBook store.Launched Amazon Web Services (AWS)Expansion of it's e-commerce store.Launched Kindle.Prime Video, Music etc.Launched Smart speakers.As you see, all of the above mentioned points are unique and amazon did these first before it got popular. All of their products and services were launched and expanded before their market competition got too much higher. So for example, if you are about to launch an online shopping website now, you will be having a tough competition as there are too many competitors. Moreover this concept of online shopping has become old, there must be something creative if you want to sustain in this field at least. This is why Amazon got popular because it caught the market at the right time with the right things which were most needed at that time. Since it has already become popular now, they are doing more innovative things like Amazon Air, Prime, Echo, Video Streaming etc so that they can maintain their level while gaining advancements. ",
