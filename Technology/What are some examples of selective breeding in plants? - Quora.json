            "answer_text": "There are so many different types of apples, ergo apple trees! Think about how many are sold at your local grocery store. There are Fuji, Pink Lady, McIntosh,Granny Smiths, etc.Farmers, for many years, have been selecting traits they find most delicious in an apple; wether it's crisp/softness, sweet/tartness, size, color, and so much more. I recommend you do some research into this example of plant selective breeding, it's pretty crazy how long the whole process is as it takes years just for one generation to mature. side bar: I remember reading something a while back about a guy who journeyed to find the original apple growing in the middle of the jungle somewhere. It was pretty awesome. ",

It started out as wild cabbage, native to coastal and Western Europe. Through thousands of years of selective breeding, we\u2019ve turned that one plant in to half the greens people in the west eat in any given week. ",
