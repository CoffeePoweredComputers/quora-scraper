            "answer_text": "To get a useful answer, you need to define \u201cportable\u201d, and you need to define \u201canywhere\u201d. There is no device that gives you internet everywhere for expansive definitions of everywhere. Smartphones, Cellular dongles, and Cellular \u201chotspot\u201d devices work a lot of places, but they don\u2019t work: Far out in the ocean. Most of the planet is covered in water, so they don\u2019t work in most places.Deep underground in caves and mines.Many rural locations.Satellite devices can be made small enough to fit onto a vehicle, but they aren\u2019t as portable as a smartphone. If \u201cmounted to an RV\u201d is small enough, you have more choices. Satellite systems don\u2019t work if you don\u2019t have a clear view of the correct portion of the sky. Legacy satellite internet services in the US require a clear view of the Southern sky because the satellites are in geosynchronous orbit over the equator. Starlink may be the first service to be available in ALMOST all places, but for now it is only available as a Beta in the northern US. The satellites will eventually cover most of the globe, but you will need permission from the local authorities to use it from various countries. Starlink will not cover the poles (at least at first), and until they build NEW satellites that can talk to each other, you will need to be within a few hundred miles of a base station. (The signal will go from your device to the satellite, and then from that satellite down to a base station the same satellite can see.) So, while it may eventually allow service in the middle of the ocean, that will be a long time coming. You will also need a clear enough view of the sky. Even if they blanket the earth in satellites, service will still be impossible from the ground in areas with tall buildings, down in canyons, in forests, and underground. Some countries will refuse to allow service, or will impose service requirements that Starlink will refuse. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s options. Virtually any smartphone can provide internet access for not only the phone itself, but devices in its immediate vicinity. A SIM-USB dongle is specifically designed to put online any laptop or desktop it is plugged in to. Some newer vehicles have WiFi capability built right into them. Satellite phones can also have internet access, for an astronomical fee of course. All of these do cost money but with them you can have internet access virtually everywhere you go. ",
