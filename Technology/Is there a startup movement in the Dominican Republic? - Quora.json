            "answer_text": "It is true that there are a lot of programs available. However, even if you get the aid you need consider that a) people dont like to pay you so they will either wait several months with an excuse so you give in and accept less money (even the big companies do this) and b) everything is socially based meaning that if someone doesnt like you because you wouldnt say hi then they make it their mission to create obstacles. It is extremely difficult to do business unless you are a multinational and/or have a lot of cash and are willing to put yourself in debt in order to maintain your business. That said any and all foreign \u201cstartup movement\u201d that may be available (not that i am aware of) is more likely to actually provide the proper assistance and support to startups. There is no reliable way at the moment other than keeping in mind that you may have to struggle and deal with a lot of things for 5\u201310 years. After that it may be a profitable endeavor. It is not impossible but you should know the reality of it and create your own opportunities. This culture does not follow the entrepreneur spirit of a lot of countries, it is a different culture and should be approached accordingly. You could also approach companies that might be interested in investing in your ideas or project but keep in mind they might use it without your permission (it happens a lot). Best of luck ",
