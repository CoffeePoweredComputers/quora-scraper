            "answer_text": "The immediate future of video game consoles is that at a high level nothing is changing yet, just moving forward as usual. Consoles will still be boxes that plug into TVs to play games and media, and will be a primary mode of gaming for at least the next few years. Games will be rendered locally.Despite the hype, cloud rendering/game streaming doesn\u2019t look like it will get a foothold for at least the next few years. Local render rules!Nobody\u2019s been able to pull off \u201cessential\u201d VR that can have mass market appeal. Out of everyone, Nintendo has probably come the closest with a cheap all-in solution. I can see this changing soon with PS5 and XBSX being capable of ultra-high frame rates.There\u2019s nobody in a good position to enter the console market. Sega\u2019s hardware division is wrapped up in arcade systems and probably won\u2019t venture into massive scale production, and nobody else has the capital it would take to push into it.Never discount Nintendo\u2019s ability to pull something quirky yet game-changingly fulfilling to the table.The specific things moving forward: Storage is getting a massive speed boost, removing some of the old level design constrictions and changing the way people play games.Ray traced lighting makes great-looking graphics possible for smaller teamsOn the Nintendo low-end front, it\u2019s interesting to see how much would have been possible on last-gen hardware (PS3/Xbox 360) if it had a lot more RAM but not more compute power.And some wild-ass predictions: Nintendo won\u2019t ditch the \u2018console wars.\u2019 Switch is the handheld, a \u2018real\u2019 home console is coming soon. They may go for a 3D Vision gimmick with hardware based on the Nvidia Drive AGX, and it may end up underpowered but it\u2019ll be enough to stay relevant when the others are pushing 4k visuals. But that\u2019s just pulled out of my butt, from rumors that devs are saying Nintendo is asking them to make things 4k ready, and that there\u2019s no possible portable form factor that can produce 4k visuals.In the middle of the next generation Amazon could plop out something to try and conquer the gaming space, addressing whatever deficits devs end up noticing in the XBSX/PS5. If 3DXPoint NVRAM becomes economically viable, that\u2019ll be its selling point \u2014 what Mark Cerny pretended the PS5\u2019s SSD could do, a 3DXPoint NVRAM can actually do. But that\u2019s a completely far-fetched thing based on pretty much nothing.Mobile games will burn out. As it is, most of them are effectively Ponzi schemes, making money from ads . . . for games that make money from ads . . . for games that make money from ads. Hooking \u201cwhales\u201d isn\u2019t going to be enough for the likes of games like Candy Crush. They\u2019ll still make money, but there will be a partial market return to consoles for \u2018casual\u2019 gamers again, provided someone can produce something interesting enough and cheap enough for it.",

            "answer_text": "With microsoft and sony developing the rumoured new Xbox and ps5 respectivily.I think in 10\u201315 years consoles will no longer be produced. The estimated power of the ps5 is rumoured to be almost as strong as the Nvidia 2080XT graphics card. If the console designers continue to proceed this way of upgrading every generation of consoles they will eventually end up producing a computer. The gaming community is a demanding one and will always seek improvements for gaming options. As they will, companies will produce cheaper products and will sell them for less so more people will buy theirs. So eventually consoles will become more or less tiny computers if not actual ones. As well as the price of a regular computer and/or even computer parts will decrease in price. Given all this, the future of console gaming will be very promising and exciting. I can\u2019t wait to see the new consoles! ",

            "answer_text": "No I don\u2019t think death I know a few gamers who really prefer the consoles because of its simplicity. When you put a disc on consoles you know the game will work you don\u2019t have to check your specs or update drivers. As well a good gaming pc will set you back a couple of grand the ps5 will be a few hundred pounds. You might be better off with the pc in the long run I don\u2019t know but people don\u2019t see that. I know there\u2019s advantages to pc gaming I have a laptop it\u2019s low tier but I can still play a few total war games with mods which you cannot do on console. However again most people I know don\u2019t see that they are casual gamers who want to play call of duty or grand theft auto and the consoles are better for them. I don\u2019t see consoles going anywhere anytime see in the future I see possible more VR advances shinier graphics maybe cross platform play. We will just have to wait see but consoles aren\u2019t going to die anytime soon they might start making them modular for you to upgrade stuff then we get into weird half pc half console territory. They would have to make it incredibly simple though literally just plug it in or I will get constant phone calls from my friends asking me to upgrade there console so they can play call of duty 12.
