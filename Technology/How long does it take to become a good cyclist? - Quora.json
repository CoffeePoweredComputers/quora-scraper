            "answer_text": "How long does it take to become a strong cyclist? A lifetime. That\u2019s because \u201cstrong\u201d is a term we cyclists apply relative to our ambitions. Most of us will ride our entire lives and never have quite to the level of conditioning and ability that we want, to accomplish our cycling goals. (For example, I have long been trying to build the legs and conditioning to ascend Alpe d\u2019hues in sixty minutes; as yet, I\u2019m nowhere near that. On the other hand, I have accomplished my goals of tackling more than one century ride in a season, and \u201cstage\u201d rides of several days.) I believe that even the pros have a similar mindset. For example, I wonder if, last Sunday in Paris, Primoz Roglic would have considered himself a \u201cstrong\u201d rider. I wonder if even Tadej Pogacar, looking ahead, would have considered himself a \u201cstrong\u201d rider. (Obviously, Lance Armstrong never considered himself a strong rider because he never competed without doping.) Read Peter Sagan\u2019s daily feed during the races, and it\u2019s clear that he does not consider himself \u201cstrong\u201d on given days. So \u201cstrong\u201d is all relative. That said, there\u2019s clearly an objective standard for strong: The ability to pedal one\u2019s preferred rides in reasonable times for the distances, and completing the rides with a reserve of energy such that we can proceed to the next ride or goal. But to answer the question specifically. Suppose you are an amateur rider\u2014 a club rider\u2014 in average good health, and some experience riding, it shouldn\u2019t take you more than a season to become strong. Start early and establish a conditioning baseline, then start training for specific goals. For example, Bicycling Magazine has an eight-week plan to train for a century: The 8-Week Training Plan to Ride a Century. Naturally, if you are racing, or aspire to the ranks of the pros, it will take you longer\u2014 and more intense training\u2014 to become strong. In all, becoming a strong rider really depends on your cycling goals. But the important point is, you can work towards those goals your whole life, and in doing so, enjoy your life on the bike. ",

            "answer_text": "That is a \u201chow long is a piece of string?\u201d type question. A good professional cyclist, a good club cyclist or a good recreational cyclist? Which do you aspire to? If you are out of your teens, I\u2019d suggest you forget the Professional. As for club riders, most have age group standards, so you won\u2019t be competing against youngster (although, I find it satisfying beating the times of those half my age). First off you need a bike that fits you and that\u2019s not as easy as some would have you believe. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that not all road bikes are the same. I know they look the same but there are subtle differences that means you might have spent thousands on a bike but you\u2019ll never get it to fit you as well as one by a different manufacturer that\u2019s half the price. Once you have a bike that fits you, you\u2019ll need to put in the hard hours in the saddle. Prepare for a sore rear for many weeks as you slowly increase your time in the saddle and get your rear used to it. NB there is no short-cut. Then find yourself a training plan you can stick to and within a few months you\u2019ll find you are completing routes quicker than when you started. Then you\u2019ll join Strava and realise you are already quicker than others near you. After that it\u2019s a slippery slope, as you push yourself harder to complete sections quicker and work yourself up the leader board. I\u2019d say that when you are in the top half for your age group on Strava, you should call yourself a \u201cgood cyclist\u201d. ",
