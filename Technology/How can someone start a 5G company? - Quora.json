You can\u2019t start a \u201c5G company\u201d if you are asking how to do that on Quora. Perhaps you are meaning to ask \u201chow can I start a company to take advantage of 5G?\u201d In this case, again, you may not understand. 5G is just the next generation of mobile cellular communication. So if you want to take advantage of 5G (which will not be prevalent until 2021 or beyond), start by thinking about 4G today. ",
