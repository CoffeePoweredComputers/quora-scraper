            "answer_text": "To get the air in your home cleanopen as many windows as possible at times of low air pollution [eg at night],and open all interior doors when doing so to facilitate cross ventilation.    To keep it clean, do not let anyone smoke or wear shoes indoors, always open a kitchen window when cooking, and if you have a forced air heating or cooling system, by the highest quality air filter you can afford and tape over the open edge to reduce leakage.  Finally, if you have an attached garage, do not use it to store motor vehicles unless you first install a continuous exhaust fan in the garage. The intl mechanical code requires 100 cfm/bay in single family home garages but builders ignore this. ",

            "answer_text": "Get the ductwork and vents cleaned.  I recently bought a house and was a little physically irritated by the air quality.  I had the ductwork cleaned for less than $400, and they pulled out 14 pounds of gunk.  It's a small house (900 ft sq with basement) that was built in 1919 and I doubt the ductwork had ever been cleaned.  The price depends on your location and the square footage of your place. ",
