            "answer_text": "Since the late 1980s I\u2019ve been studying, researching and writing about all aspects of hair growth, loss and growing long, luscious, beautiful, all natural hair. Over the course of those many years I have written literally thousands of articles which have been published on Hairboutique, the first ever consumer focused hair and beauty website on the Internet in the mid-1990s and in many magazines. I\u2019ve also attended two cosmetology schools (Paul Mitchell and Velma B\u2019s African American Hairstyling College). During the course of the last 30+ years I\u2019ve interviewed a long list of hair care experts, hair loss researchers, celebrity and fashion hairstylists and long hair specialists. The overwhelming consensus from the vast majority of hair professionals, experts and gurus is that castor oil does not help to regrow hair. Personally I tried castor oil on my own hair after so many people swore to me that it helped them regrow hair. I lost approximately 50% of my own hair due to extreme dieting and my eating disorder. My lack of proper nutrition triggered a type of alopecia known as telogen effluvium which caused temporary hair fall. Did the castor oil help in any measurable way on my hair to trigger regrowth? No. It simply made my hair oily, greasy and difficult to get out. The oil was so heavy on my scalp and roots that it clogged up my hair follicles. If anything, it slowed my hair re-growth. It was also so difficult to remove from my scalp and hair, that I had to wet wash my hair much more intensively than if I hadn\u2019t used the castor oil. My experience will not be the same for everyone else, but I do not personally believe that castor oil has any benefit as a product to help regrow lost hair. Unfortunately the media and the Internet is chock full of hair misinformation which is a combination of click bait designed to capture eyeballs or hard core faux hair news. It\u2019s also partially old wives tales, urban myths and confusion about what really helps to regrow hair which has been lost. It\u2019s also important to note that some hair may never grow back if the loss is due to male or female pattern hair loss, or a type of alopecia, which is genetic. Once pattern hair loss begins and some of the hair roots shrink and become permanently inactive, only surgical intervention can make a different. I always encourage everyone to try any type of Do-It-Yourself (DIY) hair growth product they wish, but to have reasonable expectations that they may not see any benefits whatsoever. Yes, castor oil is used in many cosmetic ingredients for a number of reasons, but to use it as a DIY hair regrowth aide may net only disappointing results. Best wishes to all. ",

            "answer_text": "In most cases, castor oil is used for hair growth. For this oil should be applied on dry hair roots and scalp, put a shower cap on, cover the head with a towel and let the oil work on hair for 30 minutes. Since castor oil is quite viscous consistency and is not so easy to wash it away, you can first wash your hair with any hair conditioner, and only apply shampoo. This greatly simplifies the process. To enhance the properties of the mask in the castor oil you can add ground chilli pepper. But this mask should be kept on the scalp to 30 minutes. If a strong burning came first, the oil should be washed off to prevent burns. The thermal effect that gives red pepper, enhances blood flow to the scalp and improves absorption of castor oil. For moistening the hair over the entire length and treatment of split ends castor oil is applied to the hair and is kept for 2 hours. In the most severe cases, you can keep the cator oil on hair for the whole night. After these procedures, the hair will be soft, silky and shiny. Do not think that castor oil is not suitable for oily hair and scalp. On the contrary, it moisturizes the skin and reduce sebum production. That hair does not weigh down and not look greasy and unkempt, it is only necessary to wash off the oil carefully. To strengthen the hair growth should be carefully rubbed the oil into the scalp and wrap a towel. A few hours later you can wash your hair with shampoo. Repeat this procedure three times a week, while improving the condition of the hair will not be noticeable. Later, castor oil is desirable to rub into the scalp 2 times a month, it is necessary to maintain a healthy condition of your hair. While rubbing oil all its nutritional properties are absorbed by the scalp and nourish the hair follicle. ",
