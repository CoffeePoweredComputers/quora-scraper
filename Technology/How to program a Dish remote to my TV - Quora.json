            "answer_text": "My answer is based on programming an Airtel DTH remote to an LG LED TV (2020) Step 1: Reset the remote. To reset your DTH remote, press the \u2018ok\u2019 button and the red colour button simultaneously for a few seconds and then press the keys \u20189\u2019 , \u20188\u2019 and \u20180\u2019 respectively. The LED in your DTH remote should blink twice indicating success. Otherwise, repeat the step again. Step 2: To turn on learning mode. For your DTH remote to be on learning mode, long-press the \u2018OK\u2019 button and numeric key \u20182\u2019 till the LED in your remote blinks twice. If it doesn\u2019t blink or blinks more than two times, then repeat the step. Step 3: Programming the DTH remote. The following are steps are to be followed immediately after you turn on \u2018learning mode\u2019. Any delay in the following steps will result in no effect of the programming and therefore you will have to repeat the steps again from Step 2. To begin the programming, place the DTH remote and TV remote 3 to 6 cm apart facing their LEDs to each other. Now, remember, the following steps are to be followed quickly and precisely otherwise you will have to repeat again from Step 2. After placing the two remotes in position and turning the DTH remote into learning mode, press the desired keys you wish to access on your DTH remote first followed by pressing the same key on your TV remote. Eg: Power key (DTH remote) + power key (TV remote), Volume \u2018up\u2019 key (DTH remote) + volume \u2018up\u2019 key (TV remote), similarly do it for volume down key and then Mute key (DTH remote) + mute key (TV remote). As soon as you finish paring, press the \u2018OK\u2019 key once and if the LED in your DTH remote blinks twice, the pairing is successful. If it blinks more than two times, do it again from Step 2. NOTE: All the process after turning into learning mode must be done quickly. If the LED blinks more than two times during the process, it means the pairing was a failure and hence you\u2019ve to repeat the steps again. Thank you. Hope this was useful. Let me know if it worked or if you have any queries. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on the type of remote you have but on mine you simply press and hold the TV power button for about three seconds, then type in the code (found here: How to Program Remote to TV or Other Device - press the first remote and a blue link saying \u201cthree-digit remote control code\u201d will pop up. Select it and a menu asking for tv brand will pop up and display codes) and it will flash. After that you test it and it hopefully works. Happy trails! ",
