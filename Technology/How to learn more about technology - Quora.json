            "answer_text": "For knowing new technology and keep yourself updated, you must daily visit a tech website or tech app and know about what is going on. Some of the best websites for tech are TechCrunch.com, Mashable , The Verge . Technology is a tool for easier living, so be ready to take advantage of it. Learning the ins and outs of a new technology can be confusing, frustrating, and can take a long time. Be patient and learn to simply take a moment and take a deep breath if you get annoyed. Patience is key because without it you cannot sufficiently understand the technology, and your view and memory of the experience will always be negative in your mind and will turn you off from using the technology again on your own. Give yourself plenty of breaks to digest the information. Your brain tends to lay down new understandings when you're not actively working on the problem. Avoid focusing constantly on the learning but intersperse it with doing completely different things.Take it one day at a time. There is no need to learn it all at once, so be patient and learn one new thing per day. This ensures that you understand every concept.One last but important step to enjoying the learning experience when it comes to new technology is to ensure that you're using the equipment and systems that are optimized your own needs. For example, if your eyesight is poor, increase the size of the text in the browser, online documents and anything else read on screen\u2013\u2013learn how to do this for each device, as it varies across computers, phones, eReaders, etc. And if you want to text but you find it hard to press the tiny buttons on a cellphone, purchase one with bigger keys or get one with large on-screen touch keys. There is usually a solution to anything that makes it easier for you to use the technology, so don't let your own special needs stand in the way of using technology. Thank you. ",
