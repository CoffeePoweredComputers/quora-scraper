            "answer_text": "Long answer: I use a Fitbit, a Garmin GPS watch, a Timex Ironman watch with heart rate monitor function, and a Cateye bicycle computer. They have different functions, and uses. The Fibit is a good casual fitness tool, and monitors heart rate 24/7, but it is not very accurate. The GPS is a good training tool for athletes, is fairly accurate, and provides charts of fitness functions. The Timex HRM provides instant easy to view HR, and time functions. The bike computer is an excellent tool for training, and is very accurate. - Short answer: Yes they have helped me in fitness, and competition. ",
