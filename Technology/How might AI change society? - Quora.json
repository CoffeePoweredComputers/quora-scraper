            "answer_text": "Wow. This is a broad question.AI already has affected society majorly and will continue to do so in an exponential rate. So where do I begin? First of all, AI is inevitable. The more we progress, the more we need \u2018smart brains\u2019 that can think millions of times faster than we can and thus make us more dependent of AI. AI will happen and you and I will most likely get to live when that happens, whether you want it or not.  There are two scenarios we will be heading. A doom scenario or an abundant scenario. When we won\u2019t be careful in the creation of a computer that can really think for itself, a doom scenario is most likely to occur.I realised how dangerous this could be when I finished my videogame yesterday. While I created the videogame myself, I couldn\u2019t beat it. So I quite literally created something better than myself. There is a certain vulnerable side on the process of creating. Who knows, maybe God (if he exists of course) created the universe and at the same time created something above himself. No wonder we can\u2019t find him when he is overpowered by his own creation. With nonchalanty during the creation of AI, we will be God and the machine we create our universe. So how might AI change society in this scenario? Completely. There won\u2019t be a single thing left of us when a doom scenario has occured. \u2014 If, and only if, we start paying a lot more attention to AI and be careful during the process, we might successfully create an extremely intelligent machine that is willing to be on our side. When this happens, something will occur called an \u2018intelligence explosion\u2019. The term quite literally means and explosion in the gain of knowledge. We now have a machine that can progress humanity as much as we have since the beginning of human history (which is 140,000 years) within a couple of years. In no time we can make this AI think about topics as philosophy, space exploration, technology, innovation etc. and be cruising around in our flying cars on an exoplanet that could possibly lay thousands of light years away from \u2018Earth 1.0\u2019. So how might AI change society in this scenario? Nearly completely. From this day forward we will have to get used to change as it will be right around the corner, every week.  My point is made. AI will happen and it will have a nearly complete impact on us in any way. I would like to end this with my favourite quote about AI:\u201cAnd\u2014whether we succeed or fail\u2014it is probably the last challenge we will ever face.\u201d ",
