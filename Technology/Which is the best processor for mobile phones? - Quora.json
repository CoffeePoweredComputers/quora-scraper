            "answer_text": "Before we jump to the conclusion and establish which processor is the best among the ones which are powering extremely high-end smartphone these days, it\u2019s important to identify the most important attributes of a smartphone processor which contribute in making it the best. This is an era in human history that is primarily dominated by technology. Before we have adapted ourselves to specific functionality, a new one is already available in the market and it\u2019s humanly impossible to keep an end-to-end track of these upgrades. The fact is that technological transformations are inevitable and at a given moment one specific product might come across as the best option and then suddenly the next moment, it might just become outdated. Hence. What\u2019s important is to be aware that you are choosing the best one according to your requirements. The primary attributes of any smartphone processor which contribute to the smartness of your phone are as follows: Power-Efficiency: The efficient power management of a chipset is one of the most essential aspects that should be at the top of your checklist. This is indirectly proportional to the fabrication process of the System on Chip. This means that lower the fabrication process higher will be the chipset\u2019s capability to save power consumption. In this regard, Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 855 has been regarded among the finest because it is probably the only 4G chipset that functions on TSMC\u2019s 7nm FinFET technology.  However, MediaTek is also not far behind in the race with the launch of its first 5G chipset: MediaTek Dimensity 1000 last year which is equally power effective and has gathered much appreciation in the telecom industry. The chipset seems promising, though the smartphones powered by it are yet to become available in the market for end-consumers.  Number of Cores: The number of cores in a system on chip defines its performance parameters. One SoC is built with a combination of multiple micro-processors or cores which are set on a particular frequency and are responsible for executing tasks being performed by the user on the smartphone. The clock speed of cores is responsible for the swift processing. Most of the latest processors like MediaTek Helio G90T, Snapdragon 730, and MediaTek Dimensity 1000 are octa-core chipsets that have 8 different cores to process the commands. However, MediaTek also launched a deca-core chipset, Helio X20 which was one of its kind, but could not make its mark in the smartphone market.  The Number of Core Clusters: The multi-core chipsets are tactfully combined into multiple clusters. For instance, the 10 cores in MediaTek Helio X20 are compartmentalized into 3 clusters. Cluster 1 has ARM Cortex-A72 clocked at 2.1GHz, Cluster 2 has ARM Cortex-A53 clocked at 1.85GHz and Cluster 3 has ARM Cortex-A53 clocked at 1.4GHz. So by fixing different core clusters at variable clock speeds, the multitasking capabilities of the processors are being strengthened. In this case, during a heavy task that has to be executed, only the core clusters capable of completing it will be performing the task because the others are meant to execute light tasks. Hence, this strategy saves energy and makes the processor more efficient. AI Power: AI is one of the most significant capabilities which is a must-have in any smartphone because the entire Android user interface is designed to harness the AI power of the processors to deliver the best user experience. Not only this, even smartphone cameras demand a high AI performance from the smartphone. MediaTek Helio P90 comes to my mind as being one of the best AI powerhouses to have powered any smartphone. The picture outputs on OPPO Reno2 Z were regarded as phenomenal by users because of the chipset AI efficiency.  Other features that can be taken into consideration while you are identifying the best processor for yourself are Benchmark Scores, Camera Support, Memory Type and Connectivity parameters. However, I feel that these factors are still secondary because they tend to give variable results when clubbed with other features of the smartphone. For example, a 48MP camera support versus a 32MP camera support in different smartphones where the output by the latter comes across as much better. ",
