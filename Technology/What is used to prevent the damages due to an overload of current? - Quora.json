            "answer_text": "Putting too much pressure on a water hose can make it burst. The principle is similar for electric wires: if too great a current flow is required by several items of equipment connected to the same line, this produces overload. An \u201covercurrent protective device\u201d at the main panel will automatically shut off the power before damage occurs. In most cases, the device will be a circuit breaker that trips open. In older systems a fuse will \u201cblow\u201d (burn out). Circuit-breakers: your protection against overloads A circuit-breaker is a small item located at the start of every electric line. It can detect an abnormally intense current flow and cut the current in the line to prevent overheating. Circuit-breakers are calibrated based on the diameter of the wires they are protecting. The thicker the wires (in a house: 1.5 mm2, 2.5 mm2, 4 mm2 and 6 mm2 section), the more they allow intense current through. Operating Principle: A Circuit Breaker consists of two contacts namely \u2018fixed\u2019 and \u2018moving contacts\u2019 which touches each other at normal condition i.e when circuit breaker is closed.Whenever a fault occurs,the trip coils get energized,the moving contacts get pulled by some mechanism and therefore,the circuit breaker is opened and the circuit is broken. Circuit breakers (or fuses) in your main panel limit the power to a level that your wiring system can safely handle and funnel that power through branch circuits, the wires that run to various parts of your house. If you turn on too much stuff and the power demand on any one circuit exceeds the limits of the circuit breaker (or fuse), the breaker snaps open and shuts down the entire circuit, serving you notice that you have an overload or some other problem.

            "answer_text": "What is used to prevent the damages due to an overload of current? Generically known as \u201cprotection\u201d. Fuses, (circuit) breakers, electronic devices. Fuses merely \u201cfuse\u201d. Ie heat up and melt, sometimes in spectacular fashion if they are greatly overloaded. Circuit breakers are typically mechanical switches that are tripped to turn off by either thermal or magnetic means. The latter may have a coil that senses the current directly in the sense of a solenoid that actuates the switch, or the solenoid may be energised in an overload by some external circuit. Large circuit breakers often need to have some sort of arc extinguishing apparatus, such as horns, air blast, or SF6 gas. ",
