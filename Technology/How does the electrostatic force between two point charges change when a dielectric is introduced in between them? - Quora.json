            "answer_text": "The electrostatic force will increase. When a dielectric with some relative permittivity greater than 1 is introduced between two charges, the electrically polar molecules in the dielectric act to oppose the applied electric field. In effect they swivel around to align their ploar charge in the direction of the applied field and cancel it out somewhat within the dielectric. The electric field between the two charges still adds up to the original number of volts though, what has happened is that the electric field (E-field) outside the dielectric has increased to compensate for the decrease inside the dielectric. A higher E-field acting on a charge means a higher force on it (I believe force = q.E where q = charge and E is the E-field in V/m). Really it\u2019s a bit like the two charges have been brought closer together, in effect. If we had a material with a permittivity of infinity and put that between two charges, the E-field inside it would be cancelled to almost zero and reappear outside either surface, effectively being expelled from inside the dielectric, thus increasing the external E-field considerably and thus the force on the charges causing the E-field.

            "answer_text": "The electrons in the dielectric will be attracted toward the positive point charge and a positive charge will be induced near the negative point charge. The result is an electric field through the dielectric which partially counters the electric field from one of the point charges. This results in a weaker electric field from either charge at the location of the other charge, and thus a smaller coulomb force on either charge. Why are dielectrics useful? They make it possible for a capacitor to store a great deal more charge than it would in otherwise identical circumstances. ",
