Or wood stoves for our cooking? I know that appeals to some people, not most. The only alternative I can thing of that comes close is natural gas. Then there is manufacturing. Today\u2019s aluminum wouldn\u2019t be possible without electricity to refine it. Before that process was invented, aluminum was very valuable. ",

            "answer_text": "One minute represents 0.07% of any given 24-hour day, i.e. not much. Imagine the whole world suddenly being told that from now on electricity will not be available for one minute per day. That minute happens randomly but is guaranteed. \u2018No electricity\u2019 means no mains, no batteries, no back-up generators, no dynamos, nothing. Anything running on electricity goes dead for one unpredictable minute every 24 hours. What would happen? We would need to restart many billions of machines once every 24 hours. We would need to restart every timing device, including the timing device in our PCs and apps that runs on a separate battery. Think about life-saving devices and other critical medical devices. Think of vehicles on the move. And think of our electricity-driven brains and bodies. For a baby a one-minute stoppage is a long time. And anyway who or what would restart every single human being that doesn\u2019t itself need to be restarted? ",
