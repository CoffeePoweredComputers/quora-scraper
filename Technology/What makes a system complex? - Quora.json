            "answer_text": "Complexity pervades pretty near every discipline and they all have their own ideas of what it is. Complexity is a measure of our ability or otherwise to understand. The Universe does not suffer complexity. It is our models of it that are complex . The brain has a limit to what it can handle, this varies according to our ability to understand and, yes , it is a function of intelligence. So the time model (polynomial/non polynomial time) of complexity as used in the world of computing are probably one of the more dubious models. Better models in which the number of ingredient is required. But this varies as we resolve to understand more deeply. So a model of domain extent versus resolution could be made . Some people think a system is complex but others understand it clearly . So the degree of understanding that a brain is capable of determines whether the system is complex (relative to them) . Absolute versions mean that we need to quantify the domain extent and resolution for that model . This then can be compare to other models . The easest way is a trade-off graph of domain extent against the resolution , then we can draw on equivalent complex domains connecting to form a contour. It will tend to be hyperbolic, with asymptotes to both X (increasing) and Y (increasing) ie as the domain increases and as the resolution increases. Turning this into a sentence: a system becomes more complex as its domain extent increases (number of ingredients) or as it resolution (level of detail) increases. It requires intelligence to to do either of those. To change the model you must understand it. ",
