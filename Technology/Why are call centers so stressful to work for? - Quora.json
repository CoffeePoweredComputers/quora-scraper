            "answer_text": "I worked at a call center for over 5 years. It was high stress for many reasons. The first, and maybe most obvious, was pressure to answer or place a high number of calls. Bonuses were paid based on \u201ccall stats\" Call center employees may be stressed by the number of calls they are processing at a time. It requires a good amount of multitasking to toggle between 4 callers and get their information to further assist them. No one wants to be on hold for a long time. But no one wants to be repeatedly put on hold after someone answers either. So it is a balancing act. Customer service jobs are not easy! You will most likely get yelled at by grumpy people. I spent a few years working as a call center supervisor. I cant even count the number of times I was chewed out and called every name in the book. A lot of call centers are open 24 hrs a day 365 days per year. Which means you usually work holidays and weekends. This can take a toll on social or family life. I have said a lot of bad about my years at a call center due to the question. But I do want to say, it was not all bad. There were some really amazing parts\u2026one of them being I met my husband there! ",

            "answer_text": "Cold calling and telemarketing rely on quotas and high volume. Workers understand this and they know they will encounter rude people in the process. Rejection is very difficult when taken personally. Hence, not everyone is tough, thick-skinned and able to handle insults from that job pressure daily. Not meeting quotas can and will result in termination. ",

You are interacting (calling or receiving calls) from different people some of which are there to unload on you and you have to maintain professionalism even while they are getting your hackles up. Imagine having this on repeat every hour for days on end and you have stress, aggression, frustration transferred to you. Yes, it is stressful. ",
