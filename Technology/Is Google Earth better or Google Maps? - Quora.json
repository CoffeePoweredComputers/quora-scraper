            "answer_text": "I think it really depends on what you are trying to do.  If you are just trying to see a quick and easy location, the Google Maps website is more than sufficien.  But it also offers a wide variety of options for programmers and database folk, via the API. Google Earth program is really more of a simple GIS program, through the system of layers that can be turned on and off, waypoints and points of interest, and also the whole 3D point of view, but also the whole dynamic angle and direction of viewing, you get a much better understanding of a location and situation.  However it requires a little bit of computing power to run fast and well and smooth. ",

            "answer_text": "the merging of two questions has made it necessary for me to add to my answer so it still makes sense. to ask which is better google earth or google maps, is not really a valid question because they are completely different products for different purposes, to compare them as to which is best is therefore entirely a result of what you are using them for, by this i mean they are not really interchangeable products, you need to use the product best suited to your purpose. the best way to define the difference is to go to google and see, but google maps is about maps though they also include some other features and google earth allows you to see places in a sort of virtual reality but with saved images not live then you also have street view which i think is self explanatory, but 10 minutes on google is better than pages of trying to explain ",
