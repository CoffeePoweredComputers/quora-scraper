            "answer_text": "An Apple TV is well worth it for some people and not for others. If you have a Smart TV that\u2019s reasonably recent, you might be able to get the majority of things you\u2019re interested in on your TV without a separate streaming box. If you primarily watch TV using a Cable box and have no interest in streaming media, then it\u2019s not worth it. Additionally some cable boxes are adding services like Netflix. If you have an android phone and windows PC, then the added benefits of a Apple TV are likely not worth the difference. You can however get software like AirParrot 2 that will put you in the \u201cmaybe worth it\u201d category. AirParrot 2 | Mirror & stream content from your Mac, PC or Chromebook to Apple TV, Chromecast & more. If you have an Apple product of any sort (iPhone, iPad, Mac) and want to get the content onto a TV, then the Apple TV is pretty much the only game in town. You can use alternative software and tricks to stream your content to Chromecast and other TV services however it\u2019s nothing like the simplicity of AirPlay. If you want to cut the cord with your Cable TV provider or want to sign up for streaming services, the Apple TV 3, 4, 5 are all amazing options. The speed and simplicity is worth the cost difference. The new software also recently added Amazon Prime Video, and they also offer access to a bunch of the new TV streaming services like Youtube TV, SlingTV, etc. Streaming music from iTunes and other streaming services works perfectly. Purchasing/renting movies, and TV shows works fantastically easy. On a personal note, we have an Apple TV as our only source of watching stuff on our TV. Throughout the day we\u2019ll play music from iTunes through to a few TVs in the home (cheap home speaker setup). Then at night we\u2019ll watch our shows on Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Prime Video. Sometimes we\u2019ll play a slideshow of photos off our shared photo library. So for me the Apple TV is invaluable and no other product I have found makes it as seamless and easy. ",

            "answer_text": "If you have other Apple devices (iPhone, Mac, etc), the Apple TV makes a lot of sense. Firstly it\u2019s not expensive, so adding one to your home TV/Stereo/Theatre system isn\u2019t a big financial decision. Secondly, it allows you to very quickly push video or audio from any other device to your TV/Stereo. This is great for showing others something without all crowding around a tiny screen. Thirdly, if you have a big music collection already digitised, for example an iTunes library, the Apple TV can pull that library in and play it. This used to be a much bigger deal than it is now, especially as pushing stuff to the TV is super easy. Audio streaming is synched on all devices so that you can have multiple Apple TVs and/or computers and use it like a Sonos home stereocasting system. Fourthly, the Apple TV has loads of apps in its own right, such as Spotify, YouTube and pretty much any TV channel you can name. Other streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Netflix or Disney+ have Apple TV apps, so integrating those services is easy without yet another set-top box. Lots of games too, though personally not a big deal for me. Finally, there is Apple\u2019s own music, TV, and movie streaming services. These are not bad at all, and for TV and movies, are a pay-per-view or pay-to-own model, not a subscription. That suits people like me who just don\u2019t watch enough to justify a subscription. But for music I do listen enough to justify a subscription, so for that I use Spotify and use the Apple TV app for that so it\u2019s played on my main stereo system. The main negatives are a rather difficult to use touch-sensitive remote control (you get used to it, but different apps interpret the gestures differently, and in a lot of cases it\u2019s not very intuitive. For a company that prides itself on ease-of-use, it\u2019s not their best effort. Typing stuff in is excruciating, but if you have an iPhone, the Apple TV can use its screen keyboard which is much better). Another negative is that the Apple TV can be a bit buggy depending on what other stuff you have in your system. I have an Onkyo home theater receiver, and the power on/auto input selection only works sometimes with the Apple TV. I reported these issues 5 years ago but they\u2019re still broken. YMMV. There are other features, such as the ability for it to act as a home automation hub \u2014 I don\u2019t use that. Unlike Alexa for example it\u2019s not always listening to you \u2014 that also means it doesn\u2019t act as a way to quickly google something by voice for example (Apple\u2019s Homepod is for that, the Apple TV not). It has lots of value if you already use Apple stuff. If not, it\u2019s less useful, but at the price really still worth checking out. As a kind of \u201calso ran\u201d in the TV/Movie platform world, it actually works quite hard to play nice with all those other services. Would recommend. ",
