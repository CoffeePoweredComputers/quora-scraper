            "answer_text": "Also in the early \u201990s, I saved maybe $20 by refilling cartridges. I bought my printer the moment the price dropped a few dollars below $1,000. It took a couple of months but the third party ink slowly killed the printer. It became totally unusable. In a printer-specific forum, there was the usual bitching about the cost of ink, and people wondering why some third party did not make ink comparable to Epson but for pennies on the dollar. Interestingly, a dealer in third party inks responded. He said he could manage to produce ink as archival and accurate as Epson. However, he would have to price it at several times what Epson does. They produce it in vast enough quantities to take advantage of bulk pricing and price the product as low as possible. No one can compete with them. On the other hand, you know what you are buying. A colour testing lab does accelerated fading tests on all industry dyes, pigments and so on and can accurately estimate the time until the colour begins to fade. This is critical to print collectors, museum curators and art dealers. No such data exists for third party inks. The makers of printers supply highly accurate drivers for their own papers and third-party paper suppliers also supply them based upon the absolutely accurate colours of proprietary ink cartridges. This is impossible for unknown inks. So if you do not care about your work, by all means, refill your cartridges. Or instead, buy a laser printer. Very cheap to operate, uses plain copy paper and produces really awful results. ",

            "answer_text": "Back in the 90 I had a Canon \u201cbubblejet\u201d printer. The cartridges cost $25 but I could refill them for $2.50. I got usually three or four refills out of a cartridge before the print quality degraded. I haven\u2019t had luck refilling cartridges since then, and I\u2019ve had terrible luck with commercially-refilled cartridges. Does anyone know a cartridge well-suited for refilling at home? ",
