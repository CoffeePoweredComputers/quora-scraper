            "answer_text": "How do you pronounce <often>? . Should it be pronounced as spelled? The spelling of English does not always have to have a strong connection to the way it is spoken.

Reformers usually augment the alphabet with digraphs and diacritics. It is possibleto have more than enough symbols to represent the phonemes of speech. The phonemes of speech can be represented over a dozen different ways (on the average). Fortunately, about 4 ways is sufficient for 85% of the words in the dictionary. The answer to your question is usually found in a dictionary, pronunciation guide, or on-line dictionary.

Either way is OK, while I abhor changes to English that have no rational explanation, I prefer intelligent change. Next comes why we went from Pepeing, to Peking, to Beijing\u2026all with no change [apparently] in China. Also, why we use a German pronunciation of the capital city of Russia, instead of the way Russians say it. ",
