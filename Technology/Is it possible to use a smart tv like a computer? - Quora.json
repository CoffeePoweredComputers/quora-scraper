            "answer_text": "I use mine as a computer. It's my only computer too! I own no tablet or laptop. I use a Fire TV. The Fire TV is as close to a computer you can get. There are sets made with Fire Stick built-in. You can also buy a Fire Stick for any modern TV with HDMI. They cost under $100 bucks! What makes it so cool is it has Fire OS like a tablet. And same apps can be downloaded and installed like on your tablet. The apps are Android based apps. There is a browser called Silk Browser. Also there are other browsers like Fire Fox for the Fire TV. It works great and you can search with your voice and post with your voice to Facebook and Twitter!!! Voice features make Fire TV the best at being a computer and TV. You can even order a pizza and check the weather on a Fire TV. Gaming on a Fire TV is cool but not like on a big console. There is a ton of games and most suit the average Joe. Most use the remote but some require a gamepad like Xbox or PS4 controller. Amazon makes its own controller as well for $35. If you can get used to using Amazon and the voice remote,then you don't need a computer with a Fire TV. Specially for gaming,browsing the web,music playing,and of course binge watching TV shows. I have no regular computer. I use my smartphone and my fire TV. I can get on most sites and post to Facebook and Twitter via voice or using my phone. I can edit photos,ECT. When people ask what computer I use or for computer help,I say \u201cI use Android on my desktop computer. It's a smart TV. It's my desktop computer. I love it!\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on what functions of a computer you are wanting. Some smart TVs now include browsers and other applications that accommodate some of the more everyday usage for which people would use a computer but, TV\u2019s are trying to get slimmer, add features, improve visual quality, and stay affordable all at the same time. So, to answer the question directly: You can use some computer like functions on a Smart TV, but for any more advanced processing or applications, you would have to rely on someone developing the application for the Smart TV, if it is possible to run it on the TV in the first place. You could always get a device which connects to the TV to fill some of these other needs, but at that point, you are really just connecting a computer (of some sort) to the TV. Could someone develop a Smart TV that could stand up to a computer at a single point in time? Absolutely. Would that work for a good number of users? For sure. Would it have a chance at competing with current-gen PCs moving forward? Very unlikely, especially since you don\u2019t see hardware upgrade capable TVs. ",
