            "answer_text": "The ability to communicate, sharing thoughts and feelings by uttering words is extremely important, in fact, it is among those things that make us, humans, special. People can lose the power of speech to different degrees, due to many disorders - from \u2018mere\u2019 stuttering or apraxia, in which syllables are scrambled; to motor neurone disease and cerebral palsy, which leave people unable to use muscle control in order to articulate; to traumatic brain injury; stroke; anatomical excisions required by the presence of malignant tumours; multiple sclerosis, or autism. This wide range of disorders makes many in need of digital adaptive alternative communication (AAC) methods. If before losing their voice people bank it, then it can be used and recreated via voice cloning with AI. The (re)creation of a digital voice is based on splitting two elements of the human voice that typically function as one: the source (the vocal cords, larynx and throat muscles) and the filter (the muscles - tongue, lips, pharynx, etc. - that articulate words). Speech synthesis software using speech-to-speech technologies underpinned by machine learning can bring back to people the capacity for vocal communication. Additionally, crowdsourced speech and vocalization samples captured from people who can\u2019t speak normally, can be matched with nonverbal people that are likely to sound similar. This way, even people who were born without the ability to speak can eventually utter words. ",
