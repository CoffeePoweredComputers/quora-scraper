            "answer_text": "Since we are talking about pixel and an iphone. Let's just talk about their current flagships. And i will give you 7 reasons why the Pixel 2 is better than the iPhoneX. I've been using Google's Pixel 2 XL for a few weeks, and, for the first time, I'm finding it harder to convince myself that it's that much better than an iPhone. The iPhone X makes a serious case for itself purely based on design. It's thatpretty, especially when you see it in person. But once I snapped out of the iPhone X spell, I remembered there are several key reasons why the Pixel 2 phones are better. 1. Both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are cheaper than the iPhone X. Right off the bat, Google's new Pixel 2 phones have a huge advantage over the iPhone X: Price. The Pixel 2 starts at $650, which is $350 less than the iPhone X's $1,000 starting price tag. The larger Pixel 2 XL costs $850, which is still $150 less than the iPhone X starting price. 2. The Pixel 2 phones come included with a fast charger, whereas the iPhone X doesn't. Apple finally added support for fast charging on the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, a genuinely meaningful feature that Android phones have had for years. It lets you get hours of battery life from just a few minutes of charging, which is incredibly useful when you're in a pinch. However, you'll find a standard iPhone charger when you unbox the iPhone X, and you'll have to buy separate accessories if you want to fast charge the new iPhones. Meanwhile, Google's Pixel 2 phones come with a fast charger included in the box. So, not only are the Pixel 2 phones cheaper, they don't require you to spend more to take advantage of core features. 3. The Pixel 2 XL has a bigger screen than the iPhone X, even though both phones are roughly the same weight. The 175-gram Pixel 2 XL and the 174-gram iPhone X are almost identical in weight, but the Pixel 2 XL has larger 6-inch screen compared to the iPhone X's 5.8-inch display. You get more screen for the same weight with the Pixel 2 XL. The smaller Pixel 2 weighs in at 143 grams, but it's not exactly a fair comparison considering its smaller 5-inch display compared to the iPhone X. 4. The Pixel 2 phones are less expensive to repair, and there's less glass to break. The iPhone X is being touted as the most expensive iphone to repair. Without AppleCare+, it'll cost you $280 to repair the iPhone X's screen, and $550 for \"other damage,\" which can include the iPhone X's glass back. Meanwhile, it'll cost you $130 to repair the pixel2\u2032s screen. To repair the small glass panel on the back, it'll cost an estimated $170, which is expensive, but still cheaper than the iPhone X's repair cost. For the Pixel 2 XL, it'll cost you $220 to repair a broken screen. To repair the small glass panel on the back, it'll cost an estimated $160. That's also expensive for a rear glass panel, but again, it's cheaper than the iPhone X repair. 5. I can work faster using Android on the Pixel 2 phones than iOS on the iPhone X I can adjust Android to make it feel faster than iOS by cutting down, or removing altogether, the animations when I open apps and swipe between screens. Apple's iOS has a \"Reduce Motion\" option, but it seems to only change the default zoom-in and zoom-out animations when opening and closing apps to fade-in and fade-out animations. Apps don't appear to open or close any faster. 6. The Pixel 2 is a cheaper phone, and its camera is just as good, if not better, than the iPhone X. I've had a few iPhone-toting colleagues and friends who were curious about the Pixel 2's camera, which is widely reported as one of the best cameras on a smartphone. Some even expressed interest in switching to the Pixel 2 for its camera instead of upgrading to another iPhone. The truth is that both the iPhone and Pixel 2 phones take excellent photos, and they're among the best smartphone cameras you can buy. But the Pixel 2 has a great proposition that makes it more tempting than the iPhone X: Again, it's the price. You can get one of the best smartphone cameras in the world starting at $650 versus the iPhone X's $1,000 price tag. Also, when you're looking at the photos above, notice how the iPhone X tends to make certain details more yellow than the Pixel 2 XL's photo. It's especially noticeable on the street and buildings in iPhone X photo. It's a common theme with the iPhone camera, where it wants to make photos appear \"warmer\" than they actually are by adding a yellow-ish tint to the photo. Technically, making a photo warmer means that the iPhone X takes photos with less color accuracy, which some may not appreciate compared to the Pixel's more accurate colors. 7. Overall, Android is more customizable than iOS. One of the main things that draws me to Android over iOS is the fact you can hide your apps in the Android app drawer. And for the apps you want to keep on your home screen, you can rearrange them anywhere on the screen. It's an age-old Android benefit that's been touted for years in the ongoing \"iPhone vs Android\" fan wars. But with the iPhone X, it's never been more relevant. Wouldn't it be nice to hide all your app icons on the iPhone X and make its gorgeous edge-to-edge OLED screen shine with your home screen wallpaper? The signature Android notifications shade is also a main selling point for the Android operating system. When you swipe down from the top of the Pixel 2's screen to bring up the notifications shade, you find everything you need in one place to manage your notifications and the core settings of the phone. Quite simply, notifications on Android are a lot easier to manage and more useful compared to their iOS counterparts. And you can quickly manage settings like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, battery settings, airplane mode, and even the flashlight straight from the notification shade, too. I've rarely ever needed to go into the Pixel 2's settings menu as a result, and it's a lot more efficient than iOS. There are a lot of ways that Android is more customizable and efficient than iOS, like the app icons and the notifications shade, but at the end of the day, it all boils down to personal preference. If you care about customization and general efficiency, the Pixel 2 offers the best experience. ",

            "answer_text": "There's no answer to that as both iphone and pixel are good in their own areas . For example - iphone in performance , software support . Cameras - pixel (yes the photos still out a bit better in colours in comparison to 11 pro) Practicality- pixel with its unlimited photo/video cloud drive in orginal quality (trust me I've uploaded few 4k movies and they're same quality and uploaded in the cloud) and it's feature drop ( you get set of new features every 3 months , like this month pixel got safety check in which the phone will check on you at scheduled time , if you don't respond , it automatically calls the police and it's working in almost every country pixel is available) I know some android haven't had good experiences on their android phone but that was because earlier companies used to put skin on top of stock android but with pixel you get pure stock android which results in good ui . Repairing costs- again , pixel cause except the screen(still cheaper screen than apple but same quality) the phone is easily repairable and costs less to do so . On the other hand if your back glass is broken in phones above iphone 8 you'll have to pay approximately 199+ dollars and then i hope you can get the idea of the other parts . Both phones are good at their own ways , if you want a good performing phone with top notch camera and the best video camera and if you take good care of your phone then go for iphone (preferably iphone 11 ) or if you want the best overall camera with much more practicality then go for pixel ( I'd say wait for 4a and 5 to launch then choose ) . I have used both and i can say that if you're into using your voice assistant then siri is a big no no , whereas on the pixel you get the Google assistant , you can squeeze the phone to activate it (from pixel 2/xl to 4/xl) it's a nice feature and then you'll get new features every 3 months unlike what apple did with iphone 8 , not updating the portrait mode even tho xr got it with similar camera . But do make sure if you buy a pixel that your phone is good and working normally before the warranty expires as i have seen few phones had manufacturing defects and google obviously replaced them but do make sure . Hope this helps :) ",
