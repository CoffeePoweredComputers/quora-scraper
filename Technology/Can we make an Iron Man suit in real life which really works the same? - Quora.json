            "answer_text": "IMHO I\u2019m afraid not. We lack two crucial elements of Tony Stark\u2019s iconic armor, and it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll always lack them because they don\u2019t seem to be physically possible. The first is the repulsor ray. This is essentially a reactionless drive: it produces thrust without throwing mass out the rear as a rocket would, which violates Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion (which actually goes, per Wikipedia: \u201cWhen one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body\u201d). While it\u2019s said that researchers from NASA on down are working on a space drive that appears to do what Iron Man\u2019s repulsor ray does, this is very, very far from proven \u2014 and even if it were the drive in question is nowhere nearly as powerful as the hero\u2019s tank-busting, SSTO (single stage to orbit) and back repulsor ray. The second is the ARC reactor. This is the glowing dingus in Iron Man\u2019s chest that somehow generates enough power to charge the batteries that in turn power his battle armor, an output on the order of so many gigajoules per second. That\u2019s the performance you\u2019d expect of a small nuclear reactor, but Iron Man\u2019s ARC reactor is far too small to be any such thing and no other physical process we know of (short of a matter/antimatter reaction, which Iron Man explicitly does not use) could generate such phenomenal power from such a tiny source. The closest thing to such a process in real life would be cold fusion, which purports to generate nuclear reactor-level power from a tabletop setup with none of the muss or fuss of the full-size reactor. Alas, cold fusion doesn\u2019t seem to work; initial claims for it were quickly disproven, and to date it doesn\u2019t actually exist outside of rumored work on LENR (lower-energy nuclear reactions) at the fringes of modern science. Everything else in Iron Man\u2019s armor can be physically realized, but in nothing like as sleek, versatile or independent a form as the hero\u2019s iconic battle suits. ",
