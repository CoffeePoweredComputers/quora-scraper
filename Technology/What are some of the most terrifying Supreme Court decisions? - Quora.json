            "answer_text": "What are some of the most terrifying Supreme Court decisions? When I read the question, the following quote immediately floated to the top of my mind: Three generations of imbeciles is enough. This gem was penned by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and author of the 1927 decision in the case of Buck v. Bell. Carrie Buck, an 18-year-old patient at the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded, was selected by the colony\u2019s superintendent, Albert Priddy, as the legal test case for model legislation drafted by the State\u2019s Eugenics Record Office, allowing for the forced sterilization of intellectually disabled persons in the State of Virginia. Carrie was described by Priddy in his petition as having a mental age of nine years, and the child of a woman with a similar mental age of eight and a history of prostitution, including three children (including Carrie) of unknown parentage. Carrie herself had given birth to her own illegitimate child at the age of 17, prompting her adopted parents to commit her as feebleminded, and Priddy to describe Carrie as \u201csexually incorrigible\u201d. What was not mentioned in Priddy\u2019s petition for sterilization was that the pregnancy did not happen with Carrie\u2019s consent; in 1923, her adopted mother\u2019s nephew had raped her, and it is generally accepted in current studies of the case that the family had Carrie committed to avoid the shame to the family. As Buck was under the guardianship of her adversary in the legal proceedings, her legal counsel, Irving Whitehead, was appointed temporary guardianship as the case made its way up the courts, though she remained in the custody of the colony. By most accounts, Whitehead handled the case poorly, even at times appearing unclear which side he was arguing for. This may have been a deliberate move by the State in assigning Whitehead to the case as public defender, to ensure the sterilization order (and the underlying law) met minimal resistance. In any case, the law and order were found constitutional at every level of the State system, leading Whitehead to appeal Buck\u2019s case to the Supreme Court. By this time, Priddy had died, and was replaced in court filings by the new superintendent, John Bell. In an 8\u20131 opinion, Holmes led the Court in agreeing that Buck was both feeble-minded and promiscuous, and that therefore the State had an interest in sterilizing her. Holmes weighed on the doctrine of \u201cpublic welfare\u201d, under which the government can issue mandates to preserve public health and safety, even at the cost of individuals\u2019 rights to autonomy (sound familiar?). Holmes carried that to an extreme end, stating that this doctrine has been used even to call upon a citizens\u2019 life for the greater good (i.e. first responders ordered into deadly situations to save others\u2019 lives): \u2026 It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, to prevent our being swamped with incompetence. It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes. Holmes concluded the Opinion of the Court with the infamous words at the beginning of my answer. Thus it was that a young woman, whose only crimes were being born to a prostitute, abandoned for adoption, being raped by her adoptive family, and then committed to a mental institution, forever lost her control over her own ability to procreate. Her only child, Vivian, also pronounced \u201cfeebleminded\u201d by an ERO field caseworker, was by other accounts a bright student in the two years she attended school, even making the honor roll. However, she died of measles in 1932. Carrie\u2019s sister Doris was also ordered sterilized, which was performed in clandestine fashion during surgery for appendicitis, and neither Doris nor her future husband were made aware of her being sterilized until 1980. Thus, the Buck bloodline died out under State order. Carrie herself was released from the institution shortly after the procedure, married twice and raised six children from her first husband. She was an avid reader her entire life, until she died in a nursing home in 1983. All that is terrifying enough; that a government within the United States could violate the very basic human right to procreate, and order a family\u2019s bloodline to end, all on the word of a doctor that a person is \u201cmentally undesirable\u201d, and that it is therefore in the greater interest of society at large that this person never become a parent. We now know that \u201cfeeblemindedness\u201d as a mental diagnosis was very often used as political cover for a variety of parental, societal and/or government failings, much as Buck\u2019s case was alleged to have been. Psychology, despite still being in relative infancy at the time, was given great weight by the courts, and to this day, PsychDs and psychiatry MDs are expert witnesses for both sides of a legal question of mental competence. That makes the idea of any government agent, however well-credentialed, having the power to sterilize anyone they could first declare mentally disabled a very fraught one, that should give pause to anyone who still thinks there may be any value in it. As with most things we consider rights, we can always find anecdotal examples where it might have been a good idea to pre-emptively restrict said right in that case. However, when you formulate a hypothetical law to allow it, and then imagine giving control over the enforcement of that law to a politician that you personally wouldn\u2019t vote to be the local dog catcher, you hopefully start seeing the problem with laws that are dependent on a benevolent, competent subject-matter expert having final say on applying it. But that\u2019s not the end of it. Here\u2019s what\u2019s really terrifying; the Opinion of the Court in Buck v. Bell has never been explicitly overturned. There have been Court decisions whose opinions on what\u2019s legal can shock us today (Dred Scott, Plessy v. Ferguson, Korematsu, etc.), but most such examples have been reversed by more recent rulings or by legislation. Not so with Buck. Eugenics as public policy fell out of favor hard in the late 1940s, for reasons which should be painfully obvious to anyone familiar with the history of Europe around that time, and while the U.S. continued forced sterilizations among the institutionalized into the 1960s, the Virginia law at issue in the case was quietly repealed in 1974, largely the result of a more general challenge to the status quo of mental healthcare brought by the ACLU in cases like Wyatt v. Stickney. Perhaps because of this social move away from the idea that the mentally ill need to be locked up indefinitely, no direct challenge has ever had standing to be heard all the way up to SCOTUS. Therefore, Buck v. Bell remains in legal force as national precedent, that the forced reproductive sterilization of people deemed by the State to be mentally unfit to be parents is constitutional, should a State ever wish to start doing it again. And that\u2019s terrifying. ",

            "answer_text": "The Kelo decision was pretty bad. Not as bad as Dred Scott or Plessey or Buck vs Bell, but in recent times, it was a horrible decision. Susette Kelo lived in New London, CT. The city of New London, CT wanted Pfizer to build a research facility in town. The problem was, people were living in houses where Pfizer was to go, and Susette Kelo lived in one such house. So the city used its eminent domain powers to take the land from the homeowners so Pfizer could occupy it. The ruling was that Pfizer would provide jobs and would pay more in property taxes. This wasn\u2019t a matter of using eminent domain to build a school or highway or even a power line, it was simply to transfer ownership from some parties to another because of economic development. Susette Kelo didn\u2019t want to sell. The town of New London tried to force her to sell. The case made its way through the CT court system and then to the US Supreme Court which ruled in favor of the City of New London. Kelo had to sell her house. Her house was razed so Pfizer could build its facility. But the developer couldn\u2019t get financing, so the project was abandoned. Even if the facility had been built, it\u2019s a horrible precedent to have politically connected parties able to force others to sell because they want the land. Kelo v.
