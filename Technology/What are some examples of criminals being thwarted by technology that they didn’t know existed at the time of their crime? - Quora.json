People with limited education often think that any crime that is not witnessed by another is one that will never be prosecuted. In point of fact, this hasn\u2019t been true for at least the last 300+ years \u2014 the first legitimate use of \u201cforensics\u201d in a criminal trial was in the early 1600\u2019s, albeit not a sort that would stand up to legal review today. The first use of fingerprints is a criminal case was in the late 1800\u2019s. Since then almost anything can be used for forensic purposes; unique wear patterns on shoes, pants, tires, tools, bullets, you name it. Add to that skin cells, blood, semen, hair and almost any deep tissue, the list is endless. Somewhere in the world an idiot is performing a crime this very instant, secure in the knowledge that no one will find him or her out. And they will be proven wrong. ",

Well there's an awesome show on there called \u201cSee No Evil\u201d This program is about homicide defectives who use any or all video surveillance cameras that they can find to catch the murderer of a person They track down the person who got murdered and also are available to track down the person who murdered them Usually right on camera murdering the person And they do this with little or no forensic evidence left behind It's a really neat show ",
