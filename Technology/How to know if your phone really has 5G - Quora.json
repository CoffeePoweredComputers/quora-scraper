            "answer_text": "Presumably you have purchased a 5G enabled phone fairy recently, then you will know it\u2019s 5G ready. Even now 5G coverage is not fantastic When the possible list of frequencies that 5G was proposing to use , engineers warned about bigger phones because Inside the phone there will be an extra antenna that works on unknown hitherto now, the initial Ofcom allotted frequency of 5G which is initially 3.4Ghz UK C band spectrum. Ofcom also is looking at 1Ghz to 3.4Ghz-6Ghz trying to bring us into line with European allocations including the 700Mhz band of frequencies in future. 1Ghz upward are microwave frequencies An antenna printed on a circuit board, would have been far too small to get any decent signal for handheld devices. Remember the higher the frequency the shorter the antenna is required in order to resonate at the frequencies required, but a phone will have to work in a few different frequency bands simultaneously ; this wasn\u2019t as much as a problem with 2G,3G or 4G however 5G is far from simple. The 1Ghz to 6Ghz frequency is much higher than the 3G/4G apx 800 Mhz so they were trying to come up with a suitable antenna, the first one stopped working if your hand was in the way..wah wah wah \ud83d\ude29 so back to the drawing board. Next up Tiny Antenna arrays in one solid design inside the phone were heavily discussed. Thats why you require a 5G enabled phone. Personally I don\u2019t know how the engineers & designers solved the issue, but obviously they have. Bearing that in mind, I think the only way you could check wether you\u2019re receiving it, is to download a Network App that includes 5G , it visually demonstrates all the actual Networks currently available 3G,4G , LTE etc . Some of these apps are great for working out where the nearest cell towers are, it displays the measurements of the uplink & downlink speeds. Apart from that you have to trust retailers in exactly the same way when you upgraded from 3G to a 4G phone. ",

            "answer_text": "You really cannot. For broadband phone users it is the same as LTE 4G, just a bit faster. And at the moment the 5G build-out is not very advanced, to put it mildly. So 99% probability, that you don't have 5G access. You cannot trust the operator labeling on your phone display. In particular US operators have been caught a number of times for fake network indications (what your read as network description on the top of your screen is not what the phone senses, but is what the operator network you are signed on to tells your phone to show). Don't expect revolutionary things from a 5G phone at present. For many features a 5G core network is required, and that is far from being even planned by most. I propose you repeat your question in 2025. Then we may have a meaningful response. ",
