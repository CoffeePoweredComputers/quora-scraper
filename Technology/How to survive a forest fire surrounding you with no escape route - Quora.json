            "answer_text": "Depending on the fire you have a number of options. Most forest fires do not burn so hot that being near the leading edge constitutes a serious threat. Commonly flames are 1\u20136 feet high and only the forest floor and brush will burn. It won\u2019t reach the canopy and certainly won\u2019t survive there very long. More often then not wildfires only consume what is convenient and dry. because they\u2019re boring this isn\u2019t the image we think of when we think of wildfires. If you\u2019re threatened by a common wild fire and have no tools you should look for a Meadow, an area with less vegetation, or a low spot that looks wet. Your best bet however will be an area the fire has already burned through, which you can get to by walking through an area where fire activity is minimal, a rock scree or meadow. If you\u2019re unfortunate enough to be threatened by an extreme fire, a honkin gobbler as they say in the biz, your options are limited. In Wildland firefighter training they tell you to not jump into lakes and especially not streams because you will be very likely to die of hypothermia (this has happened but I didn\u2019t look for a reference). An ironic death for sure but dead is dead. However, this is situational. If you are around a pond that happens to be 80 degrees I would definitely go for it. Some people hid from a fire in a pool last year (2017) and survived. Keep in mind most wildfires occur in mountainous terrain and water in these environments is normally runoff and cold. The standard for Wildland firefighters involves \u201csafety zones\u201d which are areas devoid of fuel. Sometimes firefighters will construct a safety zone but often there is a natural option nearby. Safety zone size is calculated based on fire activity (torching, group torching, crown fire, spoting, etc.), types of fuel (brush, grass, forest), slope of the terrain, wind speed and direction, and flame length. Sometimes this calculation will call for 1000\u2019 radius or more but on many of the fires I was on it wasn\u2019t an issue because the safety zone was a meadow or rock scree and they were plenty big enough. Most wildfires are nothing like the ones we have been hearing about in California. The climate is so dry and the area is so populated it is truly a recipe for disaster. Recently (I especially remember one last year but can\u2019t recall the name or location) fires have been starting up and rolling through towns killing dozens of people in a few hours. Unfortunately if you can\u2019t get out and far away in time you can\u2019t really do anything. While most fires are pretty chill some are terrifying, unfathomably loud, and so hot exposed skin will burn hundreds of feet away. They will burn everything in their path no matter what you do or where you hide. ",

            "answer_text": "That varies a lot. There are fires where there is literally nothing you can do. If you can find a lake or river, go in there and stay there. If you can find somehow a large open area, go there. That's tricky in a forest, but if you find one you might have a chance. See grass doesn't burn long. It's shorter and has a lot less material than shrubs or trees. So if you are at a large grassy area go to the other side from where the fire is. Watch it closely when it starts to burn through the grass. A grassfire burns quick, but often (though not always) has a very short actual burning area. Like this if you're lucky  If you see this, you have a chance (no guarantee) to run through it. It's maybe a meter wide. Cover yourself in everything you have if that's possible, large blanket is ideal. Then run for your life. Literally. It will be hot, and you will get first degree burns, maybe second, maybe even third depending on how much you covered yourself, but it won't last long. Judge the distance before you run so you know when to stop. Then get rid of your covering blanket, it might be on fire. The ground will be hot, so keep going as far away from the fire as you can, where the ground is cooler again so won't melt your shoes, but not back into the forest, trees burn longer. The good news is that a burned up grassy area won't burn again. If you have just shorts and tshirt this might not work, and it will be a hell of a lot more painful. Like i said this is no guarantee. It's a last ditch effort if you are literally surrounded by fire and there is really no other means of escaping. But it's better than nothing. It gives you a little chance at least. ",
