            "answer_text": "We remember how much time our phones used to take to get fully charged in the past, but nowadays the scenario has completely changed. Earlier there was a time when it took 3,4 hours for a phone to get fully charged & now we are able to charge our phones fully in just some minutes. From slow charging at 2.5W to fast charging at 50W charging speeds have drastically changed.This all is possible due to the various fast charging technologies that manufacturers are using currently so as to boost charging speeds. Some of them are: - OPPO Super VOOC Charge: - Voltage=10V, Current=5A, Max Power=50W. Currently used in OPPO Find X Lamborghini Edition.OPPO VOOC Charge: - Voltage=5V, Current=4A, Max Power=20W. Currently used in OPPO Find X.OnePlus Dash Charge: - Voltage=5V, Current=4A, Max Power=20W Currently used in OnePlus 6T.OnePlus Warp Charge: - Voltage=5V, Current=6A, Max Power=30W Currently used in OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition.Huawei Super Charge: - Max Power=40W. Currently used in Huawei Mate 20 Pro.Apple Fast Charge (USB-PD Fast Charge): - Voltage=14.5V, Current=2A, Max Power=29W. Currently used in iPhone XS Max.Samsung Adaptive Fast Charge: -  Voltage=5/9V, Current=2A, Max Power=18W. Currently used in Galaxy Note 9.Qualcomm Quick Charge: - Quick Charge 4.0+ Fastest as of now by Qualcomm. Voltage=3.6-20V, Max Power=1 W. Currently used in Pixel 3 XL.Motorola Turbo Charge: - TurboPower 30 fastest as of now by Motorola. Voltage=5V, Current=5.7A, Max Power=28.5W. Currently used in Moto G6 Plus.MediaTek Pump Express: - MediaTek Pump Express 4.0 latest as of now by MediaTek.VIVO Dual Engine Fast Charge: - Currently used in Vivo V11.Now let\u2019s see which phone charges first: -  i). After 14 Min 44 Sec (screen off): -  1. OPPO R17 Pro - 50%. 2. Huawei Mate 20 Pro - 40%. 3. OnePlus 6T McLaren - 30%. 4. OnePlus 6T - 25%. 5. Pixel 3 XL - 23%. 6. Galaxy Note 9 - 19%. 7. POCO F1 - 17%. 8. iPhone XS Max - 8%.  ii). For 0 to 100 % full charge time taken (screen off): - 1. OPPO R17 Pro \u2013 40 Min 20 Sec. 2. OnePlus 6T McLaren \u2013 1 Hour 4 Min. 3. Huawei Mate 20 Pro \u2013 1 Hour 6 Min. 4. OnePlus 6T \u2013 1 Hour 21 Min. 5. Galaxy Note 9 \u2013 1 Hour 54 Min. 6. POCO F1 -1 Hour 54 Min. 7. Pixel 3 XL \u2013 2 Hour. 8. iPhone XS Max \u2013 3 Hour 38 Min. *All the phones are charged using the chargers provided out of the box. iPhone XS Max is performing so poor because Apple provides a 5W charger out of the box.(Readings Credits- Beebom) Super VOOC charging: -OPPO first introduced VOOC charging in OPPO R5 after Qualcomm announced Quick Charge 2 in the year 2014. VOOC stands for Voltage Open Loop Multi-Step Constant-Current Charging. Super VOOC is advanced version of VOOC charger. Using super VOOC we can charge our phone from 0-100 % in just 35 Min considering a battery capacity of 3400mAh & in just 10 Mins the battery capacity reaches from 0-40 %. Here the power output is 50W(10V-5A). One interesting point to be noted is that by using this technology the phone gets less heated as compared to other charging technologies available with us because the whole circuitry is built inside the charger itself & not the phone. To charge the phone fast the whole battery of 3400mAh is divided into two physically separate batteries of 1700mAh each & charged simultaneously. This same technology is also used in OPPO R17 Pro having a battery capacity of 3700mAh & can charge it fully in just 35 Min. Now lets discuss about some of most FAQ\u2019s about charging: - Is it safe to charge a smartphone overnight?This question arises many a times, many people say that it\u2019s not safe to charge your phone overnight as it overcharges your battery & can lead to explosion of the battery. This thing used to happen in the past when there was not a circuit for Over Charge Protection in Mobile Phones the charger used to supply current to the battery even after it got charged which lead to overcharging & hence sometimes explosion of the battery, but nowadays scenario has changed every phone comes with a over charge circuit protection & cuts off power supply once the phone gets fully charged thus preventing the battery from overcharging. So, it\u2019s safe to charge phone overnight.Is charging through Power Bank harmful for your phone?The answer to this question is also NO. When you charge your phone by connecting it in a circuit point it gets charged through AC current while charging using Power Bank uses DC current and that\u2019s the only difference here & it\u2019s totally safe.Can you fast charge a phone using fast charger even if it doesn\u2019t supports fast charging?No, you can't charge a phone using a fast charger if it doesn't supports fast charging. It'll be similar to eating more food than our diet capacity. If we are giving more power to the phone than it's prescribed one then it won't accept it, it happens because of the handshaking mechanism between the charger & charging circuit present in phone, the charger will check if the circuit can handle that much of power if it can then it'll deliver the power but if it can't it won't deliver that much power to the circuit so as to protect the battery.Before fast charging any phone we need to make sure the quality of the cable is good enough so that it can allow such high currents to flow through it.Can we charge our phone with other charger rather than the one provided with our phone?The answer is Yes! You can surely charge your phone using other charger too but you need to make sure that the voltage rating of the charger is same as that of the phone. For ex. You have charger of 5 V-2 A & your phone supports 5 V-1 A charging, then you can surely charge your phone using that charger the charger will allow only 1 A current to the phone so as to charge it safely. Now consider other situation you have charger of 9 V-2 A & your phone supports 5 V-2 A charging, in this case too the phone will charge but it'll get heated because of the voltage conversion it has to make from 9 V to 5 V so as to charge your phone leading to power losses & reducing battery life if done regularly.One thing to be noted is that the charging speed for 50-100% is slow as compared to charging speed for 0-50% & that's the reason why companies advertise their chargers as 0-50% in XYZ minutes.Before fast charging any phone we need to make sure the quality of the cable is good enough so that it can allow such high currents to flow through it.Meizu Super mCharge: - Meizu claims its new 55W Super mCharge technology can fully charge a phone in 20 minutes. Super mCharge is rated at 55W(11V-5A). Meizu hasn\u2019t announced any phone supporting Super mCharge yet, but it\u2019s expected to be seen soon in upcoming Meizu devices.

            "answer_text": "A smartphone\u2019s battery capacity is a deal-breaker aspect for many  potential buyers. Some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) place  huge battery units in the device to get prolonged battery life. Others  settle for modest battery units -- and make compromises like reducing  the screen resolution to sustain the battery life. And in some other  cases, the in-built software is tweaked to get the desired result. In  any case, the retention of the battery life depends on the configuration  of the handset.According to Phone Arena,  Qualcomm was reportedly the first chipmaker to bring in the  quick-charging capability to smartphones with the help of QuickCharge  1.0 technology. Apparently, the first-generation technology rolled out  in 2012 reduced the charging time by nearly 40 percent. Then came  Qualcomm's QuickCharge 2.0 technology and this was reportedly part of  the Snapdragon 800 SoC. Following the path set by Qualcomm, Chinese OEM  Oppo came up with the VOOC chargers seen in the Oppo Find 7 smartphones.  Notably, the Find 7 is one of the quickest-charging high-end phones  available today.  Meanwhile, the Oppo Find 7 takes about 1 hour, 22 minutes to get a  full recharge. Plus, the new device to get added to the list of top 5  smartphones of 2015/2014 is Samsung\u2019s 2015 flagship Galaxy S6. Notably,  the Galaxy S6 comes with \u201cFast Adaptive Charging\u201d technology. This  handset has trumped all other devices in the custom test conducted by  Phone Arena. The Samsung Galaxy S6 reportedly goes from 0 percent to 100  percent in 1 hour, 18 minutes. Interestingly, this Fast Adaptive  Charging option was first introduced by Samsung in the 2014 phablet  Galaxy Note 4. Here is the list of the top 5 smartphones of 2015/2014  that can be charged rapidly.1. Samsung Galaxy S6 (1 Hour, 18 Minutes)The Galaxy S6 comes equipped with a modest 2,550 mAh battery unit.  However, the aforementioned Fast Adaptive Charging aspect helps the  device get a full charge within 1 hour and 18 minutes. Reportedly, the  handset can sustain the charge for 7 hours and 14 minutes.2. Oppo Find 7a (1 Hour, 22 Minutes)The underdog Oppo Find 7a features a 2,800 mAh battery unit. The  charging time taken by the handset from 0 percent to 100 percent is only  1 hour and 22 minutes. Notably, this device uses VOOC technology. As a  result, the battery charge can be retained for reportedly 6 hours and 6  minutes.3. Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (1 Hour, 35 Minutes)A humongous 3,220 mAh battery unit is housed in the behemoth Samsung  Galaxy Note 4. Similar to the Galaxy S6, the Note 4 also comes with the  Fast Adaptive Charging feature. Therefore, the device can be fully  charged within 1 hour and 35 minutes. And the battery life can be  maintained for apparently 8 hours and 43 minutes.4. Motorola Nexus 6 (1 Hour, 38 Minutes)The Nexus 6 also comes with the same battery capacity seen in the  Note 4 i.e. 3,220 mAh unit, but the technology used is Motorola Turbo  Charger, according to Phone Arena. But then, the charging time reportedly is 1 hour and 38 minutes and the battery life retention time is 7 hours and 53 minutes.5. HTC One M9 (1 Hour, 46 Minutes)The battery capacity of the 2015 flagship HTC One M9 is only a modest  2,840 mAh unit. Nevertheless, the QuickCharge 2.0 technology on the  device charges the battery from 0 percent to 100 percent within 1 hour  and 46 minutes. Plus, the One M9 apparently retains the charge for up to  6 hours and 25 minutes. ",

            "answer_text": "In terms of fast charging technology, the Chinese internet giant LeEco seems to have taken the egde with its type-C fast charging technology, outsmarting even Apple.  I Own a LeEco Le 1s and must tell you its really fast when it comes to charging. Being a gaming addict, I\u2019ve often run out of charge on myphone until I bought the new LeEco Le 1s smartphone. While the Le 1s is quite apackage for gaming in terms of it\u2019s tech specs and overall build quality, it\u2019sfast charging capability is what attracts me the most.  The Le 1s comes with a dust-and-short circuit proof USBType-C charging port that allows higher data transfer rates and power deliverycapabilities in one multi-conductor port. Since the Type-C plugs arereversible, they are a lot easier to plug in irrespective of the way you plugthem. [IMG]  The built-in high density 3000mAh battery and 24W FastCharger allows me to get 3.5 hours of charge just by plugging in my phone for 5minutes. As per the phone manual, the fast charging is apparently achieved byits additional sealing and PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) protection inbetween wires.   [IMG]  The Le 1s also has different battery saving modes. While the\u2018Smart Power Saving\u2019 mode controls vibration and network sync to limit unwantedbackground activity, the \u2018Super Power Saving\u2019 mode limits dynamic visuals. Thethird mode \u2018Ultra-long Standby Time\u2019 allows only basic applications such ascalling and messaging to run to save power. In short, I can say that users can definitely rely on the Le1s\u2019 fast charger to provide the battery with adequate juice in a very shorttime in order to keep the phone going even under adverse conditions.

            "answer_text": "Hi there. If you are in search for smartphone which charges fast then let me make it clear to you that charging speed depend on two factors i.e. charger and battery. Other two factors are data cable and smartphone capacity. So, if you have a dash charger with data cable 3.0 or something and a fast charging capable battery , then it will charge fast within an hour. Now, if you have a normal charger with dash charging supported mobile then it will not charge at normal speed. So, if you want to charge a phone quickly then make sure that you have a fast charger i.e. dash or turbo..and a smartphone capable of charging at that speed. Don't use ordinary battery with fast charger ,it may cause damage to battery and in some case it may also blast. ",

The Dash charger is a 4 amps and 5 volts and the charger package comes with a Dash Cable which is capable of handling this current. OnePlus claims that you get 63% charge in 30 mins (which means it gets 2200 mAH in 30 mins).
