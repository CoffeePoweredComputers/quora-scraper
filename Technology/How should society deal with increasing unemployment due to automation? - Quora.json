            "answer_text": "Universal Basic income - Wikipedia is the path forward. Universal Basic income - Wikipedia is an unconditional yearly income provided by the state to all citizens with no means testing or similar state bureaucratic overhead. Universal Basic income - Wikipedia will replace the existing means-tested costly welfare programs eliminating the inefficiency of government overhead and enforcement. The Minimum wage - Wikipedia will be frozen or ideally eliminated as it destroys jobs for human workers by making ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines even more profitable than the increasingly expensive human workers they permanently replace. Please read on for the discussion of what is happening and why Universal Basic income is a credible solution. The reality is that every profession without exception is being increasingly automated. The automation of work performed by human workers is the most profitable business on the planet. Those humans that are fortunate to still have work will be typically be compensated less. For instance, Artificial intelligence - Wikipedia automation of existing human workers today fuels the current trend of growing wealth inequality with an ever-decreasing number of well-paying jobs available for human workers. The first step is the reality check of rechecking if past assumptions are still valid such as most humans can work for a decent living. assume = to make an 'ass' out of 'u nd 'me' The reality is the past is gone forever as things have changed whether people accept this or not. Just as people resisted the notion of the Earth going around the Sun because it was \u201cobvious\u201d for all of history that the Sun goes around the Earth as the Earth was the center of existence. \"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself \u2014 and you are the easiest person to fool.\" Richard Feynman - Wikipedia The current reality is that ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines make more economically productive workers than an increasingly large number of human workers. The cost of retraining workers is economically pointless as the enormous cost greatly outweighs the total value of their future work. Ever cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines are educated and trained at zero cost. No sick time, no vacations, no health care costs as the work 24 hours a day without complaint of error. The simple unavoidable fact is that era of most humans working for a decent living has ended forever. I realize that I was fortunate that I made great living permanently replacing human workers with ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines. I feel that it is my personal responsibility to raise awareness that this time it is different. History demonstrates that most people live in the past, live in denial and fail to adapt to change and new concepts. The upside is that the requirement of humans working for a living is ending in the foreseeable future. The robot revolution is irreversibly changing the world for all human workers permanently replacing them with ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines. The reality is * the first step in fixing a problem is realizing that you have a problem * the second step in fixing the problem is correctly identifying what the problem is The first step is by and large complete as we know we have a problem with growing wealth inequality. The second step is a failure as we incorrectly blame illegal immigrants, rich elites, government bureaucrats, etc \u2026 for the growing wealth inequality, This ignores the true reality that as a society we do not acknowledge and accept the unavoidable fact that the vast majority of humanity will no longer be able to work for a decent living. The only thing certain is that the last job standing will be the job of automating other jobs. What is key is that automation killing all jobs is only a matter of when not if. The core issue is an ever-increasing majority of human workers will become permanently unemployed as ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines inevitably replace more expensive human workers. Economic growth now and in the future requires that fewer jobs are created for human workers. This is the desirable inevitable consequence of the capitalist system So as a global society we need to have a plan to deal with this inevitable change. Automation has been, is and will always be a friend to human society if human society on a global basis is prepared to deal with the inevitable consequences. I spent my working career increasing automation and increasing efficiency. This consequently reduces the hours worked by humans while increasing the output economic goods and services at an ever-decreasing price. Why not have ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines create the vast majority of required economic goods and services as opposed to human workers? Why not have most human workers working less and retiring earlier? There is much more to life than working forever. Fortunately, automation has been going on for decades and will continue as an irreversible process as ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines permanently replace more costly human workers. I write this answer for the people that have an open mind and are not living in the past this is what I feel most effectively deals with the tractable issues that automation creates. The question at hand is how we deal with automation going forward as a society. Automation is only a threat because society has yet to acknowledge automation is happening let alone effectively having a plan to address it. This short video describes the future.  Investment capital is deployed to reduce the number of increasingly expensive human workers with ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines to permanently replace these workers. The most profitable businesses succeed in the marketplace which are those businesses with ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines and fewer increasingly expensive human workers. The contradiction is that rising wages leads to widespread pervasive job destruction. Most jobs if not all jobs, in the end, will become automated. This is only a question of when not if. Furthermore, while many people can recognize the problem of growing global wealth inequality they incorrectly assess blame and propose counterproductive solutions such as living wages and an ever-higher Minimum wage in fact only increases the growing global wealth inequality. Higher wages only accelerates the rate at which Capital Investment: Need to Know is used to replace human jobs with ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines. A higher minimum wage and an expected future minimum higher wage increase the expected return for the Capital Investment making it more profitable and lower risk. The economic goal for Venture capital in Silicon Valley is to use Capital Investment to replace human jobs. I greatly prefer the following which I will extensively argue is inevitable 1. the elimination of most government means-tested Welfare - Wikipedia 2. the implementation of a substantial level of Universal Basic Income that starts at a level that equals existing welfare benefits and minimum wage levels Universal Basic Income is a conservative-libertarian free-market idea where individuals choose what economic goods and services are produced in the free market as the free market supply will respond to free-market demand. This is not a centrally planned communist economy. Universal Basic income is funded by the taxing the corporations that increasingly employ less human workers rationally preferring the more profitable ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines. Ever cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines have no healthcare costs, no sick leave, no vacations, no employee turnover, no employee dissatisfaction, far fewer errors than humans, declining costs over time as these machines become cheaper, etc \u2026 I could easily list over 100 reasons why ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines will always be vastly superior to human workers for the vast majority of jobs. The key point is that in the past machines automated human muscles. We are now well underway in the process of automating the human brain and the human senses. Ever cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines have senses that are superior to humans in many respects, as they can see, touch and hear in multiple directions simultaneously - as well as to detect infrared radiation (heat), ultrasonic energy, etc \u2026 These machines are and will be superior to human workers in the long run in almost every aspect. When was the last time any human answered more questions correctly than Google - Wikipedia? Intelligent automated machines are now essentially automating the human brain as these machines learn faster and more precisely than most humans with regard to required job skills for performing work in a growing number of fields. Furthermore, these intelligent automated machines are less prone to error and far cheaper than their human counterparts. These intelligent automated machines simply represent more efficient and economic workers with regards to producing less costly economic goods and services compared to the vast majority of human workers. The incremental cost of growing a business is very low as the incremental cost of replicating a machine is very low. Adding an additional human worker is very high in comparison involving training costs and the uncertainty of employee retention. While many incorrectly argue that automation has been going on for centuries and humans have and will always find other means of making a living by creating new jobs in new fields, these same people also incorrectly argue that nothing ever changes. This is known as the Luddite Fallacy Technological unemployment - Wikipedia which has now been proven false. The STEM Fallacy is a sound refutation of the Luddite Fallacy. For instance, automated systems will self diagnose, self-correct and self-repair at least 90% of the time trending well above that over time. It is a fairytale myth that human workers in any substantial number will be required to run these systems. The design and implementation goal of these automated systems is to remove as many error-prone costly human workers from the process. The end goal is always fewer human workers not more human workers. So we have a permanent growing excess of displaced human workers that are increasingly not economically competitive. This means fewer jobs and declining wages for the median human worker as time progresses. As a person that has made a very good living in Silicon Valley by permanently eliminating the jobs of others for 32 years, this issue is real for me. Silicon Valley employs and will always employ a small minority of humans. The specific intellectual demands required only suit a minority of humans. It is analogous to the issue of why the majority of humans will never win a Nobel Prize like my physics professor Hugh David Politzer did. All humans are equal in value but have vastly different skills and intrinsic abilities. So here we are as ever-increasing levels of economic goods and services are produced by ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines coupled with permanently declining human jobs and declining wages. What is likely required is that universal Basic Income needs to be phased in gradually over the coming decades at ever-increasing levels as an ever-increasing share of economic goods and services are produced by ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines. This creates a permanent growing excess of human workers with a sustained permanent deflationary trend in the inflation-adjusted median wage for all human workers. As intelligent automated machines get more proficient and cheaper by the year, businesses that replace human workers with ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines are the inevitable longterm economic winners. The naive wishful thinking that humans can economically compete with this ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines is just that wishful thinking not grounded in reality. Any new jobs created will be also automated at an ever-increasing rate. The upside in the future is that in that humans are not predestined to work for a living as that is precisely why we have ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines. Technology will continue to advance at an increasing rate but the real change is that an increasing fraction of humans will no longer need and/or be able to work for a decent living. The economic details and rationale of why this will happen are as follows: There is and will continue to be fewer well-paying jobs and rising wealth inequality as positive GDP growth occurs with declining employment as the rate of worker productivity increases exceeds the underlying rates of business and GDP growth. The existing economic framework of exponentially rising worker productivity creates rising wealth inequality as ever cheaper, ever more capable intelligent automated machines continue to inevitably replace the majority of low and medium skill workers. The majority of remaining jobs are lower-paying service jobs which may keep unemployment temporarily low but only increases the issue of rising wealth inequality and underemployment. Capital Investment seeks the greatest Return on investment. The greatest return on capital investment is achieved by investing in ever cheaper, ever more capable intelligent automated machines as opposed to creating jobs for ever more expensive humans. As time passes human workers have rising costs whereas these intelligent automated machines that replace them have decreasing costs. What Silicon Valley has been, is, and will be doing in the future is reducing the cost of and increasing the supply of an ever-increasing array of economic goods and services. The most efficient use of Venture capital is to use Capital Investment to replace human jobs with ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines. Society should learn to accept this inevitable economic process as the vast majority of jobs, in the end, will be automated over time. This automation process has been well underway for over 3 decades. This is the business model of Silicon Valley, the home of the largest most profitable corporations on Earth, where the goal is more profits, more sales, more productive employees and fewer employees. Amazon now has 45,000 robots in its warehouses. Wal-Mart's new robots scan shelves to restock items faster as\"Walmart Replaced Me with a Robot\". This scenario of permanently replacing human workers plays out on Sand Hill Road - Wikipedia on a daily basis where Venture capital Venture capital - Wikipedia is deployed to fund Startup companies with the goal of replacing workers with intelligent automated machines to increase economic efficiency. There is a growing ocean of Venture capital that seeks this destination as the future earnings are safely protected by United States patent law which reduces investment risk. Higher rewards coupled with reduced capital risk is optimal. Estimating potential future cash flow is always uncertain to a degree, but the United States patent law is deliberately constructed to precisely mitigate this economic obstacle by protecting Intellectual property - Wikipedia rights which are the sole property of the Startup company. As a Silicon Valley worker at many early-stage startups, I am quite familiar with this process. The venture capitalists understand this as well so the risk is quite manageable now and indefinitely into the future which is why I am positive that many diverse industries will be increasingly automated within a few decades. The first jobs to be replaced are the jobs with the greatest Return on investment that are low skilled, reasonably paid and repetitive. For instance, manufacturing and transportation will likely be fully automated over the next few decades. As time progresses, all higher-paying jobs with a lower degree of difficulty will be partially automated and then fully automated. The last jobs to be automated in the end will be the jobs that create the automation process. As far as whether Universal Basic income is adopted it is only a question of when - not if - for the USA. The advent of ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines will likely force the world to adopt a Universal Basic Income in the coming decades as many of the existing assumptions of Capitalism will no longer hold as the vast majority of people can no longer work for a living without government assistance. In a global economy, there is no way to stop the increasing use of ever-cheaper, ever more capable intelligent automated machines replacing a growing number of human workers. On a global basis, corporations that use humans lose while corporations that use ever cheaper, ever more capable intelligent automated machines win. In the end, increasing economic efficiency is unstoppable. Universal Basic income is a free market idea where citizens and consumers can decide how to spend their money in the Free Market Definition of economic goods and services. It is far better than the government picking economic winners and losers, or worse yet, directly providing economic goods and services. Economic_liberalism is a better model than government-directed Socialism. Universal Basic income will allow consumers to purchase ever-cheaper goods and services as most humans will be either unemployed or working in jobs with ever-decreasing wages. Again raising the minimum wage is a spectacularly bad idea as it only accelerates the rate at whichever cheaper intelligent automated machines permanently replace human workers as investment capital is focused on replacing the ever more expensive human workers. We need to transition to a society where work is optional as most people likely do not work to sustain themselves and instead rely on universal Basic income. Europe is waking up to this new reality and the rest of the world needs to do the same. Universal Basic income is unconditional in that it is received by all citizens at the same amount regardless of income, wealth or assets. It does not depend on employment, lack thereof or age. The level/amount of Universal Basic income will likely be phased in over many decades increasing as time passes. The initial level will be minimal at best. Universal Basic income replaces most existing public assistance programs such as the existing regrettable welfare program that reduces benefits as income rises (an absurd negative economic incentive). Universal Basic income is funded by taxing corporations which indirectly taxes the work of the ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines that work autonomously 24 x 7. Humans workers will be the exception going forward as the vast majority of economic goods and services will be produced by ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines that work autonomously 24 x 7. These robotic workers do not care if their work is taxed by the way. As time marches on, an ever-decreasing fraction of human workers will be highly economically productive. This fact is independent of whether or not universal Basic income is implemented. This is pretty obvious from observing Silicon Valley where the most highly valued successful companies focus on employee productivity, intentionally not hiring more workers and instead only hiring the absolute best workers. The median human worker simply will never be valuable enough to contribute meaningfully to the required innovation that is Silicon Valley. I have worked over 30 years at over 20 companies making a great living permanently destroying the jobs of others thru automation and productivity software. Often times it comes in the form of productivity software which allows 1 worker to do the job of what previously would require N workers to do, reducing the number of jobs by (N-1). It's time for most to wake up and intellectually digest what has been, is and will be happening in Silicon Valley. Positive economic growth requires fewer human workers not more human workers as these ever cheaper, intelligent automated machines are essentially unpaid slave labor. Unfortunately, there will be a growing excess of human labor which will cause the wages for the remaining jobs (nannies, painters, musicians, artists, etc \u2026) to plummet as the supply of workers greatly exceeds demand. This makes the idea of Universal Basic income an attractive solution to this issue because the possibility of working for a decent living is disappearing rapidly for the vast majority of human workers. This is the direct result of the unstoppable inevitable rise of ever-cheaper, ever more capable intelligent automated machines. The companies using robots to produce economic goods and services will win in the marketplace while the companies using human workers will lose. This is an optimal desirable economic result. These ever-cheaper intelligent automated machines are more economically productive than the average low-to-medium skilled human worker. The long-term economic race has already been lost forever for all these low to medium skill workers despite the fact that most humans are in denial, for obvious reasons, as losing to a machine is embarrassing. The key issue to resolve is the political-economic transition as machines, not humans, increasingly generate the majority of economic output. The economic gains will not be distributed evenly causing a growing wealth disparity. Intellectual property holders will reap a growing share of wealth as is happening today. On the whole, the world will get richer, but the average worker will likely get poorer as the wage deflation rate will exceed the deflation rate of produced economic goods and services. Traditionally the wages of human workers have been taxed to fund governments. Going forward, the robotic workers will need to be increasingly taxed somehow to account for this revenue shortfall. So much for the wisdom of reducing corporate tax rates since taxing corporations is likely the only way to tax robotic workers. What is happening, and will happen, is a massive deflationary continuous event both in terms of human wages and produced economic goods and services. Ironically any minimum wage, or even worse, a rising minimum wage, will ensure that the vast majority of human workers will lose at a faster rate as the intelligent automated machine becomes ever cheaper while the human worker becomes more expensive. A sample of current articles documents that this process has been well underway for years. This is not news to anyone who has been paying attention in the last several decades.

            "answer_text": "Would you really prefer to be a cog in the wheel, rather than let a cog be the cog??? Like other answerers, I'll start with the obvious: you can't really prevent it and that may not be such a terrible thing. However, I might shed some light an the real question being asked... because things can, in fact, be done. There may be various strategies to mitigate the short-term turmoil and strife attributed to this process. There may even be ways to keep most people gainfully employed, even if not full time, for many decades to come. At the end of it all, we'll either have annihilated our own race, or emerge from our laborious cocoon as some new supreme beings of leisure with a completely different perspective. I personally feel good about doing things and being productive but by no means does this imply that I want a steady job. Here are a few big ideas to mull over... Change the definition of \"unemployment\"... We're already seeing a dramatic shift in major industries from full-time salaried workers to intermittent contract workers being the norm. I've been in the job market for about 6 years now and probably accumulated about 3.5 years of employment and 2.5 years of \"unemployment\". It's mostly been at places like Nike, Intel, and Stanley Black & Decker. At first, I found this process frightening and stressful, envious of salaried employees with medical benefits and a 401k. Eventually, I started to embrace my time off as well as the excitement of getting to work in so many interesting companies. I'm unemployed right now, for instance, and working about 60 hours a week on expanding my mind, learning new skills, and tinkering with some entrepreneurial ventures. It's fun. I literally automated myself out of my last two jobs without batting an eye. I'm in no rush to nab my next contract because I saved up a lot of cash, having grown accustom to the pattern, and I find my work more rewarding when I choose to do it \"just because\"... Why else would I expend my cognitive faculties writing this detailed answer on Quora? There's the key to happiness in an automated future where gainful employment is no longer the norm. People get depressed doing nothing. Who wants to be a rat in the proverbial cage, pressing the lever so some machine can give us nutrients and warmth? People will fill their time with things they choose to do. Many will do so with no suppositions about wealth and glory, though the glory seeker will never die out. Alter our economic system Back in college I dreamed up a dual currency system where one currency would be allocated to the population with only a bit of variation - kind of communistic. Your \"basic income\" would come from this, and some people could earn a little extra for perks and creature comforts if they worked hard. The other would be a resource traded for resources - the stuff of investment and industrial allocation. Most of the people who earned a little extra of the communistic currency would also deal in large volumes of this entrepreneurial currency, but not with the expectation of fancy cars and mansions on cliffs. It would just be something they're passionate about. I'm older now and, unfortunately, more practical. I've come do doubt the efficacy of that approach, but it gives you an idea of the sort of dramatic restructuring I'm talking about. Focus on innovation and entrepreneurship Innovators can find a comfortable home in large corporations or small, lean organizations alike. You can already find countless encouraging stories of individuals plagued by unemployment who eventually start a small (or sometimes big) business, digging themselves out of the hole while creating jobs for countless others. The less-told story is probably just as common: people innovating their way into job security within a large corporation. If you play a major role in some new development, the company will want to keep you on because you're the expert. This started to happen to me at the end of my last contract, but I didn't even want the security. How boring! This will slowly become the de facto means of attaining an income. If your job is taken by a machine, don't fret. Learn a new skill or create something of value. Either way, you're probably better off not doing the lame thing that a machine could do better. ",
