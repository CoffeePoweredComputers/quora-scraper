            "answer_text": "No one owns tha Internet. Internet is not like the switch of the fan that can be on and off. Basically all countries are connected each other through submarine cable (fiber optic cable) and that cables are passed through the oceans and connects each countries and this work has been done by tier 1 companies such as :- AT & T , Tata telecommunications etc. This is the one time investment for tier 1 companies, only expense comes of maintenance for those cables. In India there is mainly 3\u20134 cities from which traffic goes out of india mainly - Mumbai, Chennai, Coachin. These is the network created by tier 1 companies.   The internal structure of the cable show below. This one thin wire contains 100 Gbps of speed.  Now suppose we have a submarine cable in mumbai. Now the thing is how that cables are connected to our operator and how we use that internet from our home?? Operators in india such as Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone etc also have their optic fibre cable all over in india and these cable are undergrounded. They provide their bandwidth on the particular tower. We get conneted to our nearest substation (tower) of your operator. now they pays some money to take use of optical cable that is established by tier 1 and these companies (Jio,\u2026..) takes some more money from end customer. We are paying for internet to tier 2 companies or either tier 3 companies. the tier 3 companies are local ISP such as Trikona, TP-Link etc. They charged some money to tier 2 companies to take use of their network. For example :- if you surf a page google.com then your ISP suppose Trikona (tier 3 company) it sends that request to tier 2 company whatever. And suppose the google server is situated ay California then this request goes California either from Mumbai, Coachin, Chennai (nearest from your location) through fibre optic cable that is spreaded by tier 1 company(shown above picture). I hope you got your answer what you want. ",
