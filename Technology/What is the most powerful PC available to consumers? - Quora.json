            "answer_text": "That depends on how much the consumers are willing to spend on their computer. When I purchased my hexcore AlienWare Aurora desktop (gaming) computer with 2x2TB disk space, 32 GB RAM and a lot of other powerful features, I paid over \u20ac5,500 for it. (Roughly $6,000 back then.) That\u2019s not a price the average consumer is willing to pay, though. If you have the cash, I think you can actually buy an IBM zEnterprise BC12 mainframe for around $75,000. Chances are that you can purchase them for even lower prices as second-hands hardware or at auctions. It\u2019s not really a consumer computer anymore but then again, neither is my desktop which I need for software development and for making CGI artwork. I had a colleague who actually managed to buy three of those systems from a company that had recently upgraded their hardware and wanted to get rid of his old stuff. He paid a few hundred euros for them and had to find some additional hardware components to use with them but he got them all to work just fine. There are likely many more mainframes available for sale if you know where to look. Also, modern computers are still getting more powerful every day. Question is more like: how much power do you need? ",

            "answer_text": "Well the most expensive is the 8Pack OrionX. It is probably one of the most powerful available to consumers. It is technically two separate computers in the one case but it is a beast. Its insanely fast and more than anyone would need. It costs a whopping $30, 000 and it makes sense if you look at the specs: X99 Primary System Z270 Secondary System CPU Intel Core i7-6950X10C/20TOC to 4.4+ GHz25 MB L3 Cache140 W Intel Core i7-7700K4C/8TOC to 5.1+ GHz8 MB L3 Cache91 W PCH Intel X99 Intel Z270 Motherboard ASUS Rampage V Edition 10 ASUS ROG Strix Z270I Gaming Graphics 3 \u00d7 NVIDIA TITAN Xor4 \u00d7 NVIDIA TITAN X GPU overclocked to 2 GHz NVIDIA TITAN X Unknown OC Memory 8 \u00d7 8 GB DDR4-2666Corsair Dominator Platinum 2 \u00d7 8 GB DDR4-3200Corsair Dominator Platinum Storage Primary SSD Intel 750 1.2 TBPCIe NVMe 2 \u00d7 Samsung 960 Pro 512 GBRAID 0 Secondary SSD 2 \u00d7 Samsung 850 Pro 1 TBRAID 0 - HDD Seagate BarraCuda Pro 10 TB Seagate BarraCuda Pro 10 TB Bays 13 \u00d7 3.5\" drives, 6 \u00d7 2.5\" drives Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11ac Wi-Fi + BT 4.0 IEEE 802.11ac Wi-Fi + BT 4.1 Ethernet Intel I218V GbEIntel I211-AT GbE Intel I219V GbE Display Outputs Front HDMI 2.0 MB - 1 \u00d7 HDMI1 \u00d7 DP Graphics Card Every card:1 \u00d7 HDMI 2.0b3 \u00d7 DisplayPort 1.41 \u00d7 DVI-I 1 \u00d7 HDMI 2.0b3 \u00d7 DisplayPort 1.41 \u00d7 DVI-I Audio 7.1-channelRealtek ALC1150SupremeFX ShieldingSonic software enhancements 7.1-channelRealtek ALC1220ASupremeFX ShieldingSonic software enhancements USB Front 2 \u00d7 USB 3.0 Type-A1 \u00d7 USB 3.1 Type-C (shared) 2 \u00d7 USB 3.0 Type-A1 \u00d7 USB 3.0 Type-C (shared) Rear 2 \u00d7 USB 3.1 Type-C2 \u00d7 USB 3.1 Type-A4 \u00d7 USB 3.0 Type-A2 \u00d7 USB 2.0 Type-A 1 \u00d7 USB 3.0 Type-C3 \u00d7 USB 3.0 Type-A4 \u00d7 USB 2.0 Type-A Other I/O Earphone, microphone 3.5-mm jacks on the front panelSPDIF, PS/2 on the back panels Dimensions W\u00d7H\u00d7D 270 \u00d7 750 \u00d7 615 mm10.6 \u00d7 29.5 \u00d7 24.2 inch Volume 123 L Chassis Phanteks Enthoo Elite (PHES916E) PSU Super Flower Leadex \u20188Pack Edition\u2019 2000 W PSU OS Windows 10 Pro Windows 10 Pro There you go. Also, I know that there are more powerful computers out there but most of them are not available to consumers, which is the question. ",
