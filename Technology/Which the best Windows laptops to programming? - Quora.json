I would recommend this laptop for everyday users as it will suit your needs and then some for some time to come. A couple of things to note... This laptop will only use DDR3L memory. Regular DDR3 memory could end up shortening the lifespan of this processor, because the voltage on regular DDR3 memory is higher then what this processors IMC accepts ",

            "answer_text": "Buy a Windows machine and install Linux, you will thank me in the future.  There're so many limitations of a Windows machine (unless you're programming for Microsoft).  For any computer, look at the specs and don't worry too much about the brand although I've had bad experiences when I was younger with HP laptops. Try to get a fast processor (i7) and as much RAM as possible (16 GB is fine for 99% of users). Hard Drive storage is up to you (I personally have a 1 TB and it's too much, 512 Gb would have been fine).  ",
