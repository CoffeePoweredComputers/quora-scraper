A quick Google search is probably the best way to go, as there\u2019s no way you could fit them all into one concise answer. list of all things apple has copied from samsung Just ignore all the ones saying what Samsung has copied from Apple. While it\u2019s true that Samsung did extensively copy from Apple in the past, in recent years, things seem to be the other way around. ",

            "answer_text": "You can't call it copying if they make something a bit late but it's 10 Times better because they have perfected it. Look at the fingerprint scanner for example. Samsung had it in their phone but you had to swipe to unlock instead of making it so you just rest your finger for another second on the home botton to unlock the phone. Apple also just released face ID and that is much much better than the iris scanner that Samsung uses. It's not like Samsung doesn't copy either. Heck they copyied the iPhone. Literally the iPhone. Apple introduced a smartphone and Samsung followed. So literally Samsung also copyied Apple. So both companies have cooties each other and that is how advancements happen, since everything can't just be made from the ground up, there has to be a starting point, and in business copying is not a bad thing, unless you don't modify it to make it better.
