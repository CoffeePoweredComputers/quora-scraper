            "answer_text": "This is a very good question , I'll tell you why. Have a look at this phone,  The name of the above phone is Qiku Q5, and was launched in China last year. Most of you would already know this, that Qiku is a phone brand which is owned by Coolpad and a phone called Qiku Terra was also launched in India as well. Why am I talking about Qiku or Coolpad when the question is about Micromax? Take a look at the latest smartphone launched by Micromax in India, the Dual \u20185\u2019, more emphasis on the number 5 here, it is common with Qiku Q '5\u2032.  Trust me, apart from the Micromax logo at the bottom, there is absolutely nothing which is different from the Qiku Q5. So how would you price a device which is just a rebranded phone from last year? I think people at Micromax were intoxicated when they priced the device @ \u20b925,000/-. This is crazy expensive for what the features it offers, would you buy a rip off for \u20b925,000 or get something like a researched and developed Oneplus 3T by paying a little extra? So to answer your question, Yes! almost all the phones launched by Micromax are rebranded, and the worst part is that they have been doing so since many years bringing in lower quality products and ripping the customers off. PS: The subsidiary of Micromax, YU televentures also pulled off the same \u2018trick\u2019 with their widely popular YU Yureka which was again 'borrowed' from Coolpad which went by the name F2 in China. I used to own Yureka and trust me it was the worst phone that I ever owned. It just proves that without research and development you just can't deliver a good product! ",

The phone has Snapdragon 652 processor with 4GB RAM and a good 13 MP dual vertical camera.The phone also has a unique feature called Secure Vault which opens a second interface within the phone\u2019s main interface.The biggest highlight is the phone\u2019s separate security chip with encrypted storage for passwords built in the phone\u2019s hardware. It is equivalent to military grade EAL 5+ security standard which makes it harder for anyone to hack or unlock the phone without the user\u2019s authorisation. Yup, It seemed like Micromax has done something amazing. They have spent a hell lot in R&D and designed an amazing phone. But this is not the case..This is a rebranded phone.The original phone is qiku 360 Q5.  Yes..There\u2019s not a single difference between these phone..The UI is also same.Micromax has just changed the logo, rebranded it and launched it. And they also call it- \u201cMade in India\u201d.
