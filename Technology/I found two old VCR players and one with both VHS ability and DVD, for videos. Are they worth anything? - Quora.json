            "answer_text": "It really depends on your VCR Make and Model. Sony often is the most desirable. Ballpark estimate, knowing nothing about what you have: $10-$50+, in working condition. Some things to consider: 1) VCRs are no longer being manufactured, yet, a collector\u2019s market for VHS still exists. So, if you can determine that your stand-alone VCR works and doesn\u2019t eat tapes, you could sell it to the right person. eBay is a good place to sell it, or at least check it market value by searching sold listings. Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Facebook VHS collector forums, VHS swaps (yes they still exist, I attended one 07/2019 in Louisville, KY) or even a horror convention would be other places to sell a VCR. 2) If your VCR has a working remote included, its desirability goes up. If it turns out the VCR is a dud, as long as the remote doesn\u2019t look badly beaten up, or of it doesn\u2019t rattle when you shake it, then it\u2019s safe to say it probably works, and you could sell that on eBay for $5-$20, depending on the model. 3) If your VCR is a multi-scan/multi-system/multi-zone, then its value goes up considerably; like.. hundreds of dollars. US and Japan videos use NTSC format, but Multi-scans allow you to play PAL and SECAM VHS tapes (European formats)  4) Vintage, top-loading VCRs have a niche collector\u2019s market. But they\u2019re behemoths, really heavy, expensive to ship. Not ideal for eBay.  5) As for DVD-VCR combos, there are two types: Ones that\u2019s play VHS and DVD, and allow you to copy DVDs onto a VHS only, and ones that are cross-compatible, and allow you to rip video from VHS and burn it onto a DVD-R. The later ones are worth money, you could sell a used one for maybe $50-$100+, depending on brand and if a remote is included. The remote would be ideal, because you lose a lot of functionality if you don\u2019t have it. 6) If the stand alone VCR doesn\u2019t work, you could possibly sell it for a few bucks on eBay. Again, It depends on the Make / Model. Don\u2019t bother with the other above mentioned places. You could put it up as a Parts & Repair auction, starting at $5.99-$9.99 + shipping, and see if someone bites. As for the DVD-VCR combo.. chances are if one side doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s a paperweight, and no one will buy it for parts. When you combine multiple functions into single-unit electronics, the quality of parts and workmanship often suffers. 7) If you determine these decks work, but you don\u2019t feel like putting any time into trying to sell them, take them to Goodwill, you can get a tax-deductible receipt, and the proceeds from the sales go back into the community. If the decks don\u2019t work, don\u2019t take them Goodwill, because they\u2019ll just pay some employee to unload it from your vehicle, another employee to sort it, a third employee to to test them to figure out they don\u2019t work, and a fourth employee to scrap them.

            "answer_text": "I feel like I\u2019ve been answering variations on this question for years, but the answer is \u201cnot much of anything\u201d unless you could confirm that they\u2019re in good working order with clean heads and can record and playback a VHS tape cleanly, or at least play a DVD; they\u2019re complex electrically and mechanically, and difficult to repair. Parts are almost certainly unavailable, unfortunately, by this time, though service manuals might be found online. The problem (besides the tight tolerances necessary for a VCR or DVD to work in the first place) is the gradual environmental deterioration of any rubber belts or idler wheels, coupled with the typical difficulty of replacing them, even if you could find replacement parts. The mechanisms are multi-layered and difficult to disassemble, let alone put back together properly. Many of the integrated circuits were custom made and went out of production long ago. Frankly, there are so many used machines out there that their used value (with the obsolescence of VHS as a format) is almost nothing, though I would encourage you to look for a good home for them, rather than sending them to the e-waste IF everything\u2019s working properly. Re-use rather than recycle where possible. Especially if you have the remotes, which are sometimes necessary to access some functions. ",
