            "answer_text": " In theory, unemployment in one market sector will shift labor to another. In practice, there are barriers to that such as training, certification, and experience gaps that slow the labor transition. Also in theory, unemployment in a bunch of market segments simultaneously will shift labor to Universal Basic Income. In practice, what will happen is first widespread unemployment, followed by a backlash surge of localism and a trend away from centralized \u201cefficiency\u201d. Sorry, but if it comes down to a choice between fast, cheap robot delivery or paying a bit more so that a human driver can feed their family, then I\u2019ll be spending money to help the person. THAT is the backlash. You already see this starting with local growing and organic foods. This is an industry that went from non-existence to being quite popular and culturally VERY trendy out here on the west coast. Economically, this works by redefining hand-made & locally grown items as premium goods, which command a higher price than mass-produced items shipped in to box stores like Costco & Wal-Mart. Sure, you CAN buy 10 pounds of Apples for a buck down at Wal-Mart, but wouldn\u2019t you rather avoid the chemicals, support local farmers, and put something healthier into your body by spending $5 for locally grown apples? The answer is yes: nearly all of our local supermarkets are big chains, but they all have organic & healthy foods sections carrying local goods. Cost-conscious shoppers are still able to buy mass produced items, health & environmentally conscious shoppers will opt for organic & locally made. As robots begin to put more people out of jobs, the mass-produced items they make & distribute will end up being purchased by cost-conscious shoppers only. Everybody else will spend money to support locally made goods, because of higher-quality, community support, and cultural prestige as well. It\u2019s already happening, and this trend will increase.

            "answer_text": "Because nearly every economic model in use or once practiced all rely on a human being as the crux or linchpin to production, technological unemployment is becoming a real threat to the individual and society as a whole. Long term there are two main scenarios. One requires a socialized sphere of effect bordering on communism or possibly Marxism. Those theory is good as a concept but has problems with real world application. The second option, popularized and then trivialized by the Venus Project and the Zeitgeist Movement, involves abandoning currency altogether and focusing on developing the most intelligent and efficient use of our resources (aka a resource based economy) up to and including abandonment of most individual investments like vehicles (since the system in place will provide a vehicle when you need it and then someone else will utilize it when you are not). Unfortunately change only comes when there is discomfort, and the concept of a world without money is only thought of in star trek. Even the thought of sharing a vehicle with total strangers and not having one to own is so foreign it barely computes. Even though it costs nothing and is available whenever it is needed, the pride of ownership and perceived prestige and status we often demonstrate through our belongings will not be am easy instinct to overcome.
