            "answer_text": "You can't. It's the hard truth but not just for IT and other tech sector jobs but pretty much any job you can get off of any of these 3 things. Now it goes without saying that if you don't have the knowledge in your field you won't get the job and if you do your lack of knowledge will be exposed and you will be fired pretty quickly. 1) Education, a degree or professional program goes a long way. Don't bother with things like A+ certification unless the job you are looking at requires it. 2) Experience, if you have a portfolio or other professional references that are good enough to show that you know what you are doing without a degree it can get you the job. 3) Connections, if you know someone or know someone who knows someone who can get your application past the filter and they have some power in the decision making it will be good. Ideally someone in management or just look for any managers who have vacancies to fill. These things apply to most fields but connections are the big one. If you have either Education or Experience combined with Connections your chance goes up significantly. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are asking how to get a technical job in an IT company then you need to build up tech skills like coding, testing, IT support etc. Many people have already answered on how do you build up these skills in order to get a job so I'll focus on how to get the non-tech jobs in an IT company.There are many non-tech jobs in an IT company such as 1. HR - its not very difficult to get into entry-level HR jobs as the demand is great but supply is short. If you have no HR experience, enroll in a college asap and work as a freelancing subcontractor  to build experience. There are many people who work this way independently and its quite cool.2. Technical Writing - if you have good writing skills, build your portfolio and apply for a tech writing position. Every IT company needs such people but there's short supply in the market.3. Marketing4. Management5. Sales6. Business Analysis 7. Administrative tasks etc.  So pick the area you have skills and the desire to work in and start your job search. Good luck! ",
