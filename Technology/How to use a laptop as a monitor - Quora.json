            "answer_text": "This answer assumes you want to use the laptop as your only monitor. If you want a dual monitor setup, this may not be the best advice. If you are happy with controlling the other computer with the laptop's built-in mouse and keyboard, or plugging your mouse / keyboard / other input device into the laptop, any general-purpose remote desktop / remote administration / teleworking software should do the trick. That is, unless you are doing something involving video or video gaming (which might be too demanding for remote desktop software to handle, unless you're playing a retro video game from the 1980s or something). For that kind of use, you'd probably need to try something else. If you don't have a monitor that your other computer can use, you'd probably need to borrow someone else's monitor temporarily, in order to set up the remote desktop software. There are several free pieces of software for remote desktop based around VNC technology. My standard advice for all software: always go for open source software if you can, because then it won't contain spyware. P.S. On Linux (the major alternative to Windows on PCs) you may also be able to use ssh or even just the X DISPLAY variable, although neither of those techniques are as user-friendly as a simple remote desktop program.

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t in the sense that you can\u2019t plug your laptop as you would with an external monitor, e.g. via a VGA or HDMI cable plugged into the other computer. There\u2019s one thing you can do if you manage to get your hand on a monitor even for a short time, maybe by borrowing it from a friend. Connect said monitor to the other computer, and configure it to login into the user account at boot. Then, configure some remote desktop software to start automatically and accept connections. It could be TeamViewer, or Remote Desktop (on Linux), or some other option. Then you only have to use a remote desktop client on your laptop to connect to the other computer after you turned it on. In all effects you\u2019ll be using the laptop as a monitor, mouse and keyboard for the other computer. ",
