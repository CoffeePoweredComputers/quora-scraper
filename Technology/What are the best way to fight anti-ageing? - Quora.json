            "answer_text": "There are several factors that contribute to slowing down aging. Do regular daily exercises. This elongates your telomeres, the caps of the chromosomes in each body cell. Longer telomeres have been associated with living longer.Eat a Mediterranean diet. It is an anti-inflammatory diet and has been associated with longer telomeres as well. Do you think lengthening the telomeres in our cells would decrease the rate of aging in humans?Self-hypnosis, yoga, meditation and Tai Chi have been shown to produce anti-inflammatory markers in the blood and are associated with longer life and better health: relaxation reduces inflammation.A lack of hormones at any age is bad news. When we age, we naturally tend to lose thyroid hormones (we get hypothyroidism), sex hormones (menopause and andropause), but also human growth hormone (lack of energy, muscle aches and pains). Here are links to what to do with testosterone deficiency: what\u2019s new about testosterone or what to do in menopause: hormone replacement therapy in menopause.Perhaps the least understood hormone deficiency with aging is a lack of human growth hormone; effects of hormones on the heart. But along with growth hormone you need to replace melatonin in the older person and watch vitamin D3 levels and the other things mentioned in the last link. Without all of these hormones and supplements you cannot delay aging as your metabolism would not be optimal and your heart would run out of energy in the mitochondria.Here you have it in a nutshell: the best anti-aging tips. Previously published here: Ray Schilling's answer to What are the best anti-aging tips? Here is my answer to your question: \u201cWhich treatment is the best for anti-aging?\u201d It is important to recognize that there is no ONE method of slowing down aging. There are several factors that you need to use simultaneously. That\u2019s when the magic happens. This is when your telomeres don\u2019t prematurely shorten, your DNA in the cells experiences less mutations and your mitochondria, the energy packages inside the cells, are preserved. The person who does anti-aging treatments will have more energy, maintain muscle strength, avoid getting heart attacks, type 2 diabetes, strokes, Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer. You will have less diseases and live longer because there is no disease that kills you. ",

            "answer_text": "Staying out of the sun and loading up on antioxidants - Amla (indian gooseberry) is the most potent antioxidant known to man. You can find this in powdered form and drink in the morning (just mix it with water) once a week. Eat berries, broccoli etc. Exercise is also very important. Sugar is very bad for ageing, particularly fructose. Learn about the different types of sugars and how to identify them. Salt is also bad. Anything that will dehydrate you is bad (especially the sun). Drink plenty fresh filtered water. If you mean photoageing (visible ageing like wrinkles and fine lines), then you really absolutely must stay out of the sun - it\u2019s the number 1 culprit - ask any dermatologist. the UV rays will damage DNA. Sun lotion is good and will help protect against skin cancer, but it\u2019s not enough alone. Cover up in the sun, and wear a wide brimmed hat. Avoid the sun completely during peak hours - usually between 11 and 16:00. Don\u2019t exagerate though - 10 minutes of sun exposure on unprotected skin is important for your body. 10 minutes for white skin and I think it\u2019s around 20 minutes for darker skin. Find out how long you need - ask a dermatologist. Edit: One more tip - Natural hyaluronic acid serum/cream is excellent too - but it will depend on your age. You can start in your mid 20s - again, ask a dermatologist. Always do a patch test before you use any product on your skin. ",
