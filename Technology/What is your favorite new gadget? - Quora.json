            "answer_text": "I like the term \u201cgadget\u201d! There are so many things that this covers. So, here is my favorite new gadget. It\u2019s a compact pair of binoculars. The pen (A Parker \u201cJotter\u201d, which is another favorite gadget and also one of the best writing instruments on the planet) is just in the picture for scale. They are 2X54 meaning 2x magnification with a 54mm diameter objective lens. 2x isn\u2019t much but this combo give a massive 36 degree field of view! It\u2019s excellent for star gazing. The wide field of view is perfect for looking at star clusters, satellites, the ISS, etc. It is also good for sporting games. You get a little closer but still see a ton of the action. They\u2019re small, easy to carry, and simple to use. I use them several times a week to look at the sky.   Now, compare those to this monster. It\u2019s significantly bigger, almost impossible to use for long without a tripod, and takes a little while to set up. However, it does give 25x magnification, so that\u2019s nice. I\u2019ve included a picture with the smaller pair (circled) for reference.   ",
