            "answer_text": "32-bit applications usually use less memory than equivalent 64-bit applications, but the performance of 64-bit applications can win up to 20%. It is well known, that 32-bit system has a memory limit, and if you look at the percentage of occupied memory from the total available program memory, this advantage is not such a big plus. 64-bit application takes much memory, because it requires much stack memory. You can read here about the reasons why much memory is required \u201cThe reasons why 64-bit programs require more stack memory\u201d. To take advantage of 64-bit architecture, it is possible to port a 32-bit application. The only thing that has to be taken into account is that there is a number of nuances when porting code to 64-bit environment. More details on porting the code base on the 64-bit environment can be found here \u201cLesson 3. Porting code to 64-bit systems. The pros and cons\u201d and here \u201c20 issues of porting C++ code to the 64-bit platform\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they take up much less space. Many instructions require only 32 bits, and the standard data size is half the size. Programs may reside in about 40% less space, and require far less memory to run. Overall, since your system runs numerous programs at once, it could be more responsive if most of the programs are 32 bit. ",
