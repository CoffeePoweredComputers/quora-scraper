How does a 5G antenna work? \u201c5G will use 'massive' MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) antennas that have very large numbers of antenna elements or connections to send and receive more data simultaneously. ... The overall physical size of the 5G base station antenna is expected to be similar to a 4G base station antenna.\u201d 5G Explained - How 5G Works ",

            "answer_text": "The Sub 3GHz antennas look very much like the rectangular antennas used for 2G, 3G, and 4G. The antennas for millimeter wave 5G are integrated into the relatively small sealed cases along with the radio keeping the feed line cable as short as possible to reduce loss between the radio and the antenna. The packages look like smoke alarms on the small end, and long rectangular boxes on the high end. Pictures of Huawei, Nokia, and Ericsson 5G radios are available on their web sites. ",
