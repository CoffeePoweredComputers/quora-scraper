            "answer_text": "Contact your phone company IMMEDIATELY. Explain to them your suspicion that your SIM card has been cloned and, disregarding if it indeed has been cloned or not, request a new substitute SIM card. You may have to pay a little fee for this new SIM. Your number will be migrated to the new SIM, and the old one will become useless trash...as well as the cloned-one in consequence. DO it NOW !... stop waiting for more answers to your question in Quora ! Good luck ! ",
