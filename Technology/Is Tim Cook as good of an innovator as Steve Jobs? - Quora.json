            "answer_text": "Tim\u2019s a great guy but he\u2019s NOT a \u201ccreative\u201d. It\u2019s an \u201caccountant\u201d. In general corporations have a life cycle just like biological plants and animals. In the early stages, corporations are led by and dominated in the operations by creatives. Obviously Steve Jobs was an early stage creative as founder of Apple itself. The next stage of company life are dominated by sales and marketing - the technology adoption curve is rising with massive opportunity and only aggressive and able sales and marketing people can take advantage of this stage. After this stage the company no longer has the same exponential growth potential and controlling costs becomes a challenge. This is when companies are led and dominated by accountants and operations specialists who can squeeze profits out of a flattened revenue curve. The final stage of a company is senescence, rigidity and senility. At this stage the company no longer is creative enough nor agile enough to come out with new products, to jump up profit margins or generally address the market because of bad choices, exhaustion and failed corporate culture. The value proposition given by marketing can no longer be delivered upon by any efforts. So then the company becomes dominated by lawyers (to vet marketing claims without breaking the law, and to handle the funeral inevitably coming as M&A or bankruptcy) and other vulture professions to pick over the bones as the body decays. So Steve Jobs was from the 1st phase and it also did a great job of sales and marketing as part of the 2nd phase. Tim was the operations manager under Steve Jobs so he\u2019s clearly 3rd phase. We haven\u2019t reach the 4th stage with Apple. ",

            "answer_text": "Steve Jobs wasn\u2019t an innovator. He had a vision, he had intuition, and he had a hands on approach to being a CEO, with a very critical look. And he knew where to look for innovators and talents and make them thrive to release great products. But he didn\u2019t come up with the iPod, iPhone or iPad in a \u201ceureka\u201d moment. Tim Cook is probably much more of a traditional CEO. He runs Apple and he\u2019s good at running his company. He\u2019s probably one of the best CEOs from any active company these days. And I do believe he has a vision and some intuition, otherwise Apple would have run to the ground in ten years. They\u2019re far from it and they have pushed some great innovation forward (along with some arguably bad choices). What I believe he lacks is the intuition and the critical eye. But it\u2019s also difficult to answer this as Steve Jobs is no longer with us. \u201cWhat would Steve do\u201d is a phrase often thrown around thinking he would have magically found the right thing to do, but Steve Jobs was human, and he was already in his 50s. Would his vision persist today ? Would he be as out of touch as Apple sometimes is these days ? Hard to find a satisfying answer. ",
