            "answer_text": "HaikuJam is definitely my favorite app right now. It has a sleek UI and it\u2019s pretty easy and awesome to use. Once you sign up you can edit your profile info and there you are , SET! What is an haiku? It is a Japanese poem of seventeen syllables, in three lines of five, seven, and five, traditionally evoking images of the natural world. So what is a jam ? Jamming is where you collaborate with people to write/sing/play music without any prior preparation. How do you jam haiku on HaikuJam? It\u2019s simple. There\u2019s a button in the middle of the app that says JAM. Click on it and you can see Title or you see an incomplete haiku with some lines. All you gotta do is write One line and click on publish. So a Haiku with 3 sentences has 3 people who have written one line each. Awesome right?? After using the App for a while you will realise that Featured tab means the handpicked and popular haikus thats jammed from people all over the world, Live tab features haikus that\u2019s been published just now. While you are exploring you see something called Circles. So what are these Circles? A circle is just a group of people you can jam. You can create a circle and add your favorite jammers from the world and jam with them. So you can start a new jam inside the circles or when you start a JAM from the main icon you can choose to publish to one particular circle and your fellow jammers can see that and so on. The idea is brilliant. And its a wonderful stress buster. It\u2019s quick and trust me if you love poetry/haikus this is the perfect place to be! What are you waiting for? Go on and rock it! Thanks for Dhrupad Karwa, the co-founder and CEO of HaikuJAM for such a brilliant idea and for allowing us to be a part of this wonderful journey! P.S : Hope to JAM with you soon! ",
