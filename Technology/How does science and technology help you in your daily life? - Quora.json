            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s cake  Here are biscuits  Here\u2019s inside a cake  Here\u2019s inside biscuits  Cake and biscuits are scientific inventions in deed. Sodium bicarbonate is a substance which is an ingredient of cake and biscuits. We call it baking soda. Sodium bicarbonate decomposition happens during the heating process. The substance breaks down and produce carbon dioxide gas. The gas continue to expand due to heat and it caused halls inside the cake and biscuits. But if too much baking soda is added to biscuit it becomes fragile and breaks into pieces easily. If less baking soda is added to cake it becomes so hard that you\u2019ll need this to eat them.  And you can murder someone by hitting them with that cake. So baking soda decomposition helps me not to commit murder, and it prevents me from going to jail. That is an one simple fact that most people don\u2019t know about science of cookery and imprisonment. (Of course this answer is dripping in sarcasm) Thanks for reading fellas ",

            "answer_text": "Technology is taken for granted these days. For instance, imagine life without cell phones, the internet, cars and the microwave. Now let's go further and imagine life without antibiotics, birth control, pain medication, cloth diapers and washing machines. Imagine you had to walk everywhere and clean clothes by hand. On top of this, you didn't have any toys for your kids that took electricity including batteries. Even worse, no electricity means no refrigerator or stove either. How would you keep food fresh? How would you keep your kids from getting sick? Do we want to go back to the ages when people had large numbers of kids because roughly half didn't make it past the age of 6? I don't know about you, but I have a deep appreciation for science and technology! ",
