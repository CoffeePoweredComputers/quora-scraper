            "answer_text": "Depends on the build quality.. I've noticed Smartphone manufacturers have made the cable wires thinner and cheaper on build quality.. Samsung used to give you pretty thick cables, I still have them and they are from 2013 or 2014 and they work perfectly fine.. but their newer cables are thinner and I had issues with the phone not really charging correctly or recognizing the cable. Apple iPhone cables, I've replaced a dozen of them or so.. not sure if Apple designed it that way on purpose or they didn't intentionally do it, but the trendy thin cable and cable ends are thin.. they look cool I guess but it's not durable and it breaks very frequently.. mostly because the ends of the cable are easily bent and over a period of time, the wire inside the cable stops working (especially true with the 30 pin cable.. the lightning cable also too but not as bad I guess). But if the cable is thick and durable, so far it's been lasting for a decade almost, and probably longer than that and probably will last a lifetime. Cables usually break because the wire inside gets bent back and forth too much.. the electric cable eventually weakens and breaks. I've had the most issues with Apple iPhone cables (30 pin and lighting).. they last a few months or so until it breaks and I have to replace them. Not very convenient really.. yes the design looks \"cool\" and minimalistic, but it's a poor design in terms of structural integrity.. so you would need to look for a better aftermarket one because the original ones break because it gets bent too easily and too often since the end tips of the cables are skinny and short.. often not giving you enough grip. A good aftermarket charging cable brand is Anker and Aukey.. I have both of their USB C cables and they are built sturdy and tough.. the cable wire is thicker so they don't get bent too easily and the tips have better grip. The number one reason why cable breaks is because it gets bent too frequent and over time, the wire inside breaks\u2026 anyone who has owned electronics with cables in the past may have experienced broken cables due to being bent too much.. if you can keep the wire straight as much as possible and only roll the cable up in a big circle when you put it away, then the cable should last a long time. This also applies to wired headphones too which happens to break over time when the cables get bent too much. One special trick I do to make my cables last longer (especially my iPhone cables), I tape up the end tips of the USB with thick and strong tape to keep the wire straight at the end tips.. the end tips is the spot where it gets bent frequently from when you handle it and that's where it breaks. The tape also adds structural integrity and more space for your fingers to grip and pull the cable without damaging the wire. You can also buy aftermarket 3rd party accessories which help keep the end tips straight, but duck tape or grafting tape works. ",

            "answer_text": "They almost never break on me. The short ones that come with the phone, I'll use those in places where I'll set the phone down and leave it. I order good quality cables that aren't expensive from Amazon. I like the ones with the cloth outer jacket. 6 ft or 2m long. So if I'm using the phone or tablet while it's plugged in I'm not putting any stress on it but it going too far and yanking it. I also ordered extra so that I've got them in a few places and don't have to keep unplugging it and moving the cable around. The cable and power adapter stay stationary, one by my bed, one in the kitchen, two in the living room., etc. Now that I have devices with both the old style and the new style micro USB, I ordered all of one kind in blue and all of the other kind in red cloth braid.
