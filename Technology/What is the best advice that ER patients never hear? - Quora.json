            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t go to the ER unless you are having a medical emergency. ERs are not places to go for colds, flu, or even Covid unless you are ill enough that you might need hospitalization. ERs are also not for 2 weeks of back pain, ankle sprains, or a knee that\u2019s been sore for 5 weeks. ERs are especially not for symptoms that have been worked up by other doctors without a diagnosis despite numerous lab tests and scans over a 6 month timeframe. If you are medically stable, even when you get to see the ER physician, you will be discharged home to followup with your treatment team. ER systems use triage. They don\u2019t take appointments. It\u2019s not first come, first serve. If you are in the ER for 6 hours because you have a bladder or prostate infection but you couldn\u2019t get a hold of your treating physician and decided to try the ER, you are going to wait, and wait, and wait. You are never next in line to be seen. If there is a gunshot, a traffic accident, a heart attack, a stroke or similar emergency, you will continue waiting until those other patients are stabilized and/or treated even if they got there just 5 minutes ago. Also getting to the ER by ambulance doesn\u2019t jump you ahead of the line. ERs are for emergencies. Everything else should be seen in urgent care centers or the appropriate treating physician. If you go to the ER for something that is not an emergency, by the time you leave you will be very upset with the waste of your time. ",

            "answer_text": "Hearing is the key word here. I believe patients hear very good advice particular to their situation/complaint. It is difficult to pick a \u201cbest advice\u201d when the \u201cbest advice\u201d is given to each patient in accordance with their treatment. Listening, on the other hand, implies (at least to me) an attempt to internalize and understand what is being heard. Hopefully, the advice effects change- for the better. I find that patients are very selective in what the listen to. If it\u2019s not what they wish to hear they just reject the advice and, well, status quo. Every Emergency Department at which I\u2019ve worked has \u201cregulars.\u201d Regulars are patients who frequent the Emergency Department usually with the same or similar complaint(s). Explaining to them that their situation is not an emergency falls on deaf ears. They hear it but don\u2019t listen to it. The behavior continues. This is not always the case as there are patients who heed a physician\u2019s advice. But I find these individuals to be rare creatures. Cheers. ",
