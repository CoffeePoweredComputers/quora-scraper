            "answer_text": "The MAC address is an univocal hexadecimal code hardcoded in every network interface (ethernet adapters embeded in motherboards, PCIe wifi cards, bluetooth dongles, LTE modems in smartphones, etc). You can\u2019t change it in any way except, maybe, flashing a modified firmware on the network interface. That said, you don\u2019t need change it. When your computer needs to tell someone its MAC, it reads it on the network adapter\u2019s chip and then use the same network adapter to send it. One can simply tell the computer to use a MAC address that\u2019s different from the one written on the network adapter.
