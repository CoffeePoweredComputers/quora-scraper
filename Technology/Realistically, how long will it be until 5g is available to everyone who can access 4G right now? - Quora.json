At the 4G frequencies, there are only minor improvements in capability. THAT \u201c5G\u2019 can be installed almost overnight, since it is little more than a software upgrade. However,for 5G to provide super high bandwidth, it must operate on a high frequency that requires all new radio hardware. It also has a range of about 100ft. THAT \u201c5G\u201d will take decades before there are enough access points installed to cover the areas now covered by 4G, if ever. And since there are no existing applications that require the high bandwidth, there is little incentive to spend billions of dollars installing them. ",

            "answer_text": "Years. I\u2019d guess about 5 or so if this is limited to the US. If the whole world, more like 10 years, as some countries are just ramping up 4G now. Remember that there are a lot of base stations to upgrade (over 100 thousand in the US, millions in China). The big cities will get coverage pretty quickly\u2014maybe 2 years for all US cities over say 100k, maybe less. But there are places that are on the fringes of 4G coverage that have barely any customers. It will be some time before anyone bothers. One could argue that they won\u2019t get 5G until something breaks, and it\u2019s cheaper to put in 5G than repair the 4G. Around 5 years or so seems about right for that, maybe a few years longer.
