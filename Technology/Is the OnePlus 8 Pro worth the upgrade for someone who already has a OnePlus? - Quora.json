            "answer_text": "It depends on which Oneplus device is the person using currently, but regardless the OnePlus 8 Pro has got some major upgrades in terms of Processor ( Snapdragon 865)Display ( 120 Hz refresh rate which is insanely smooth, also OnePlus has claimed that it has broken 13 records n has received A+ rating for the display where the nits, etc. have been increased)Camera ( Quad camera setup which comes with latest Sony IMX689 sensors which can capture amazing pictures)Screen size ( If you're into bigger screens, this device is 6.78 inches)Water n dust resistant ( IP67 rating)Coming to your question, if you're using OnePlus 7, 7 Pro, 7T or 7T Pro, I'd recommend waiting for the 8T version since leaks have already started coming n it'll be worth witnessing which of the 8 Pro features are being used in the 8T version which might be more affordable than the 8 Pro But if you're using a version previous than those mentioned above or if you want to buy 8 Pro anyways, then just go for it. Coming to prices, you can get the Oneplus 8 Pro(MRP Rs. 54,999) for Rs. 51,999 with SBI card offers ",

            "answer_text": "OnePlus 8 Pro is great phone with all the best features in the it's class like the Flagship 865 5G, A good camera setup, IP68, wireless charging etc. Yes it's worth the upgrade but only if you're having an older OnePlus Model, like 1+5, 5T, 6 but if you have latter models like the 6T/ 7, or latter then I won't suggest you to upgrade since there's no much change other than a bit of design, or camera and If you care too much about IP68 or wireless charging you can upgrade. Otherwise there no need to upgrade to 8 Pro rather wait for the 9 Pro instead as 1+ has said there won't any 8T Pro this year. though if there's a 8T pro this year then better buy that than 8 Pro since T models are more refined than the main flagship models.
