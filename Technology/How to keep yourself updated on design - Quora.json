            "answer_text": "Keeping up with the latest design trend is as simple as drawing inspiration from common sites you visit. I used a very robust style for my graphic and web designs when iOS 6 was around. Then iOS 7 went flat. I liked it and changed my designs from detailed and 3-d to a flatter and sharper design. My sites were never mobile responsive until I began to use my iPod a lot more. To actually learn these skills is a harder task, but with online research and tinkering around, you can keep updated with design quite easily. ",
