If you are using the phone mostly to use up your boring free time, then you would benefit from not using your phone. It is a great thing to get bored. Then you can go and find some useful activities for yourself. ",

I suppose if you wanted to talk to someone you\u2019d either have to do it in person or over a computer, or by letter if you\u2019d like. Your phone plan might be cheaper depending on how you were billed for usage. Other than that not a lot of would change. ",
