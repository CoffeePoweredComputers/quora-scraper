            "answer_text": "Microwave the oven, or microwave the phenomenon in the form of radio waves? The microwave oven, keeps all it\u2019s \u201cwaves\u201d inside itself, else it would easily interfere with a lot of cellphones, WiFi, Bluetooth, ANT+, some of the wireless alarm, some of the cordless phones, and whatnot; all of these things tend to use something called the unlicensed 2GHz IMS band. Bluetooth and WiFi use the exact same RF band, they just sort of speak two different languages. Under the right scenario, a strong WiFi signal is much more likely to affect Bluetooth than the microwave. In the RF world, a Faraday cage is any sort of box that blocks all RF waveforms. Those people that put aluminum foil on their windows \u2026 they\u2019re trying to create Faraday cages. The microwave oven is a sort of inverse Faraday cage, it is designed to keep its own waves inside, the RF waves in a certain portion of the RF band, the very portion that it uses to cook the food. Yes, you might be able to cook food with cellphones, but thy\u2019d have to be the right phones, and you might need several hundred phones clustered together to equal a microwave oven. Put you phone inside a microwave oven, close the door, DO NOT TURN ON the microwave, and try calling that phone, you will likely find that the phone will find itself in a hermitage. Both the WiFi and phone band itself are highly likely to be completely blocked. If your phone receives a strong WiFi signal near the microwave, and you are faster than the phone takes to go into power saving mode, there\u2019s an easy test; place the phone in the microwave so that the WiFi strength indicator is visible after the door is closed, and wait several seconds, within, say, 5 seconds the WiFi will have completely lost the signal. Normally, microwave are not supposed to operate with the door open, and with the door closed any relevant electronic devices should not be effected so long as they are a few inches away from the microwave. Microwave ovens are fairly safe \u2026 mostly \u2026 sort of \u2026. just kidding. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on the frequency your microwave is iterating on and the frequency your phone is operating on at the time simultaneously. Yes the microwave could interfere with your phone if the microwave leaked microwave oven direct their 1000watt energy to a contained and confined space. However leaks do and can happen in which case the device needs to be repaired or replaced. Your phone opperates at less than 1 watt energy. A microwave energy would distroy the delicate electronics inside your phone if your phone was directly subject to the microwave ovens full energy. Even though they are on the same frequency. The intense energy would distroy everything that was not protected from the energy before the antenna could determine if the data(if there was any) was valid. You can use the unpluged oven as a blocking chamber(faraway cage) to block all WiFi and 3G 4G 5G (any radio) transmissions. (includes blutooth). The oven chamber was designed to keep radio signals in via a via it will keep radio signals out. I would keep unplugged (SEE. ABOVE). ",
