            "answer_text": "There are many online ID verification systems that offer competitive rates. Such as Shufti Pro, Trulio, miicard, etc. The thing one needs to check for is value for money. You might be able to get a cheap ID verification system, but the services might be so poor that it\u2019ll make your clients/customers run away. As nobody likes a complex and time consuming process. Then another thing you need to take into consideration is the company up-to-date with the latest rules and regulations in the industry. As non compliance to certain policies can result in heavy fines for both the online verifier as well as the company that is utilising their services. A company offering extremely cheap services might not have the resources to upgrade its systems and processes according to the changes in different policies. ",
