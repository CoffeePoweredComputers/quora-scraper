For instance, If human morality is not not coded in AI in positive terms, it might not hesitate to \u2018overcome\u2019 everything that stops it from executing the task however AI has not advanced to that level yetAI growth acceleration is going to cause panic in humans, for instance the incident of humans attacking tesla carsHumans would become too dependent on AI, relinquishing control even in situations where they ought to be careful for instance a lot of people seem to be sleeping while driving tesla cars even when it is highly unwise as told by its creatorsAI\u2019s advancement would discard previous models too quickly and if the previous models are exported to developing countries, the labor market gets affected everywhereAI advancement in certain corporations is a very unfair advantage as compared to manual labor oriented market competitionAI has access to all the data it is being fed, for example SIRI and Alexa have been shown responding when not activated, expressing laughter or derision randomly. AI learns from human data and might incorporate human tendencies and enact them better.If AI is incorporated into political decision making in advanced levels, it could potentially be fed personality data of opposition leaders and predict to near accuracy all the opposition\u2019s possible decisions. With big data, if accessed, personality profiling could be way more extensive then can be imagined.",

            "answer_text": "Joseph Weizenbaum argued in 1976 that AI technology should not be used to replace people in positions that require respect and care, such as a customer service representative, a nursemaid for the elderly, a soldier, a judge or a police officer. Weizenbaum explained that we require authentic feelings of empathy from people in such positions. If machines replace them, we will find ourselves alienated, devalued and frustrated, for the artificially intelligent system would not be able to simulate empathy. Artificial intelligence, if used in this way, represents a threat to human dignity. One of the primary concerns people have with AI is future loss of jobs. According to the new McKinsey Global Institute report, by the year 2030, about 800 million people will lose their jobs to AI-driven robots.  AIs are not immune to making mistakes and machine learning takes time to become useful. If trained well, using good data, then AIs can perform well. If there is a chance that intelligent machines can make mistakes, then it is within the realm of possibility that an AI can go rogue, or create unintended consequences from its actions in pursuing seemingly harmless goals. AI has become increasingly inherent in facial and voice recognition systems, some of which have real business implications and directly impact people. These systems are vulnerable to biases and errors introduced by its human makers. Also, the data used to train these AI systems itself can have biases. The thought of increasingly present AI systems that surpass human intelligence is scary and the ethical issues that come with AI adoption are complex. The key will be to keep these issues in mind in order to analyze the broader societal issues at play. Whether AI is good or bad can be examined from many different angles with no one theory or framework being the best. We need to keep learning and stay informed in order to make good decisions for our future. Some ethical questions are about mitigating suffering, some about risking negative outcomes. While we consider these risks, we should also keep in mind that, on the whole, this technological progress means better lives for everyone. Artificial intelligence has vast potential, and its responsible implementation is up to us. To conclude, it is certain that AI will have a profound effect on humanity and therefore AI developers are representatives of future humanity and thus have an ethical obligation to be transparent in their efforts.
