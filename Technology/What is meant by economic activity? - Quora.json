Gross domestic product or GDP is one way of assessing economic activity, and the degree of current economic activity and forecasts for its future level can significantly impact business activity and profits, as well as inflation and interest rates. Production takes resources and produces products, including goods and services. \u00a0Distribution is the process by which all goods and services are shared. Markets are places where exchange takes place. Unlike exchanges, transfers are distributions given with no expectation of return.\u00a0Consumption is the final use of the good or service.\u00a0All the best! Surabhi Patel :) ",
