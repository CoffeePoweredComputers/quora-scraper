            "answer_text": "Some good answers here already but I\u2019ll give it a shot. This question is like asking if the future of computer use is smart phones or desktop. I fully believe that AR will have a much larger market. Once it\u2019s down to a set of stylish glasses or even contact lenses (not to mention future cybernetic options), AR will be huge. Many science fiction authors, movie and television writers believe it will not only be \u201cthe future\u201d but it will be ubiquitous. Something that meshes into our day to day life as much or more so than our smart phones do now. BUT, that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a place for VR. Despite some of the scenes in the recent future VR imaginings film adaption of \u201cReady Player One\u201d, you will NOT see people attempting to fully immerse themselves in virtual landscapes as they stand on a street corner. You don\u2019t try to lose yourself entirely, doing full sensory replacement for visual, audio (and maybe even tactile) inputs while wandering, or even stationary out in public. The whole concept is ridiculous. AR is a digital layer meshing with what is really going on around you. It could be for entertainment, for information, or for assistance in completing a task. VR is for interacting with a virtual (or possibly remote) environment. Visit somewhere real you cannot (easily) get to. Visit somewhere made up. Participate in scenarios that are too dangerous or too expensive to test in reality. Each technology is offering something different. The only thing tipping the scales further towards \u201cAR\u201d being a definitive yes answer, is that it is entirely plausible that the hardware and software used for AR could go from a layer over actual reality, to blocking out that input and replacing it. Such as AR glasses that can \u201cblack out\u201d entirely so you ONLY see the digital input. That makes it function like VR displays. But that\u2019s more of a product doing both, rather than AR rendering (see what I did there?) VR obsolete. ",

            "answer_text": "I think both are really promising and here is why. Emergence of Augmented Reality will Fuel Virtual Reality Augmented reality is VR\u2019s sister industry. Based on statistics the augmented/mixed reality industry will be MUCH larger than VR by 2023. Virtual reality\u2019s reboot started in 2012 with Oculus\u2019 Kickstarter being successfully funded and purchased by Facebook. Why? VR from a time standpoint is much more time-consuming than augmented reality. Additionally, Magic Leap is one of the most funded startups in history. ML promises a mixed reality device that is coming soon for creators this year. Many speculate and say VR won\u2019t take off because it can\u2019t be used in public or in tandem with other activities. I believe this is a narrow point of view and doesn\u2019t address all of the uses that VR will mostly be used in entertainment, and other completely immersive scenarios. Common usage of augmented reality will lead people to fully immersive virtual reality experiences. By the time AR picks up in the coming years, VR content and experiences will be much better and appeal more to mainstream audiences rather than the current niche uses.  Limitless Unfathomable Experiences I interviewed Jay Samit on the Humans 2.0 Podcast. Jay is a major influencer in the world of mixed reality technology. He brought up a very interesting point during our conversation. He said when the iPhone came out, nobody had any idea what kind of mobile applications we could use. The early app store was filled with fart and gun apps with no real utility or purpose. Point being, even if VR / AR is being used for mundane trivial applications today, it doesn\u2019t mean it will look that way in 5 years. Due to limited processing power virtual reality experiences are quite limited. Imagine the future metaverse as a limitless world of intention and thought. Virtual Reality is an idea of fully immersive technology-mediated dream worlds. Rendered mind spaces where the only limit is your imagination. My favorite example of an unfathomable VR experience today is GE Healthcare\u2019s virtual reality speciality software. It can help radiologists, doctors, and surgeons better read the human body, perform diagnoses and make their decisions. The VR app lets Doctors step inside internal organs and navigate, travel forward from side to side, and even search for polyps and other tumors. . 5G Networks Are the Gateway Today, VR/AR developers are limited by various factors like thermal efficiency, sensor, multimedia technologies and other technical factors. Slowly but surely computer architecture innovations, such as heterogeneous computing, have improved power and thermal efficiency. Integration efficiency has improved due to better transistors and Moore\u2019s Law. Optimized algorithms, such as motion tracking, run better on the hardware. However, the real gateway for amazing unlimited experiences for VR/AR in an increasingly mobile world\u2026is 5G networks. According to NBC news, 5G networks are projected to bring three benefits to the masses. Faster speed: Data transfer speeds are projected to be about 10 times higher with 5G than is possible with 4G. Expect significantly faster transmission of images, videos and immersive content. With 4G/LTE, downloading a high-definition movie might take about 10 minutes. With 5G, it is reported to take less than a second.Shorter delays: Though it\u2019s not always noticeable, there is often a brief lag in time from when data is sent to when it\u2019s received. 5G should reduce this so-called latency, making it possible, for example, to watch high-speed virtual reality video with no delays or glitches.Increased connectivity: Cell towers equipped with 5G technology would have greatly increased capacity over 4G/LTE. Which means more people with devices should be able to communicate at the same time without any volume lag errors.5G is the fuel that will lead to extraordinary innovation in not just virtual and augmented reality, but also broader technologies like IoT and how we connect with each other on the internet.  Industry will Develop Universal Protocols and Frameworks Virtual reality can be a bit confusing and even intimidating for newcomers looking to join. Most frequently, I hear issues about compatibility and how content is distributed and even how VR games look and feel with controls. Just like the Web has brought out API\u2019s SDKs, OS, virtual reality is converging into a collected and unified platform. Voluntary guidelines and standards are sure to improve the industry for consumers and developers. Organizations are on the move to achieve this future goal like the VRARA, IEEE, VRSB, and the Virtual Reality Industry Forum (VRIF). IEEE announced that a working group will establish definitions, categories of VR and AR devices, and standards for quality, user interfaces, and file formats.  What are your predictions for VR & AR in the coming years? If you are a 360 VR creator, feel free to follow and request me any 360 or/and VR relevant questions! :) ",

            "answer_text": "We probably discussed a lot about the impact of augmented and virtual reality on the world. But do you know what this technique is? Are your basics clear? Well, if you want to change the world and improve your life with technology, it is important to clarify a concept. It is time to upgrade the knowledge base to the next level.  Augmented Reality, mostly known as AR, is a technique in which objects are in the real world and augmented by computer information. In short, it is an interactive real-world experience.  VR or Virtual Reality is an excruciating experience that may be different from or resembling the real world. It takes the user to another reality, where he can touch, feel, or move objects. For his abilities, AR and his cousin Virtual Reality have been praised from all over the world. But if you do not know the reason for their sempiternal and huge popularity, very soon you will discover a completely new dimension. These technologies are evolving due to the impact that they have on every person's life and on their daily routine. Now the question arises if mankind is indeed ready for its deep, priceless, unsurpassable transformational impact. It is time to try and understand them a little better. Continuous progress has been made in penetrating, discovering, and understanding continuous computing environments (VR). Attempts to be strict when it comes to overlaying computer graphics over actual installation (AR) representation. Both AR and VR will soon experience increased levels of complexity, and there is no doubt. The reason is that, over time, equipment will become more capable, advanced, and effective in developing advanced visual elements. Better efficiency will definitely generate curiosity in the world. This will not only improve interaction, but also navigation in virtual and augmented reality. Take A Look At The Main Trends That May Affect The Development Of Both These Technologies. 1. Artificial Intelligence, AR and VRDevelopers are trying to create smart applications that are filled with multiple cognitive functions, making continuous efforts. The technology that allows computers to understand precisely what we see through a camera. This is very important for successful AR processing. The reason is that it allows objects in the viewer's visibility range. This helps identify them. By using the ML algorithm, you can gradually improve complexity and features. Instagram is the best example of applications developed by integrating Snapchat - hands, AI, and AR. The full combination of smart, intelligent, effective techniques used to improve the image will develop further. VR places the viewer in a reality that does not even exist, and the development in this area is remarkable. 2. AR and VR In Training And Education These technologies excel in education, and the reason for the development is the resolve that BP gives to students. This helps students practice anything from training to historical tourism and wildlife tourism. Real training, with the help of live tasks. Information can be easily delivered to students in real-time. For example, information about popular dangerous practices, goals, and more. Companies are moving to a better platform to improve the skills of their employees. Learning cannot be neglected, and it is very essential for retailers. Technology can help create a virtual environment in which employees can learn and operate machines. It is an asset to the military, as it helps soldiers to evaluate any situation in real-time. 3. Automotive Industry With AR Autonomous cars are, of course, many years away from reality. Nevertheless, carmakers are working with AI to astound the world of their capabilities. There are two upcoming trends in the automotive industry; Voice assistantCar augmented realityAren't these trends attractive? The above points clearly describe that these regions will dominate in the future. If you want your process to meet the level of development, then you should try to work on projects based on AR & VR. It will be interesting to observe the progress made in this field. If you still have confusion, contact TECHUGO, a major AR and VR application development company, and learn about different ways to develop VR and AR applications for Android and iOS. ",

            "answer_text": "The most plausible option right now seems to be AR. This technique allows us to still interact with the real world, which at the moment seems to be really important. However, in many science fiction books, movies and games, the whole world seems to be in VR. We can\u2019t see the future, but there\u2019s one thing we know: the near future has both techniques, where AR seems to be more useful for daily life. Before we go completely virtual, many steps will have to be taken. Virtual reality is usefull for some cases, but lacks the (haptic, smell, etc) feedback options to be useful in most situations. #edit: Answer to Erik Martins\u2019 question: In order to make VR a technique that can be used in more situations, we have to overcome some problems we have now, for example: Motion sickness. A really serious problem with current VR devices is the fact that most, if not all people experience motion sickness after using a VR device for a while. This is, because our balance is built with three of our senses: sight, feeling and the vestibular system. The vestibular system and our skin notice we are sitting on a chair and not moving, while our eyes see something completely different. This creates an imbalance our brain doesn\u2019t understand. The only reason for the brain there is for such an imbalance is eating something poisonous, which makes us hallucinate, so the brain makes us want to vomit. That\u2019s not something we want to experience every day. Some people say they trained it away by using VR for long periods of time, I don\u2019t really believe that\u2019s healthy since you\u2019d be training your brain to forget how balance should work. For children, this could lead to even bigger problems: Virtual reality headsets could put children\u2019s health at riskHaptic feedback. Next problem is the haptic input, the input of touching something. At the moment, the only things that seem to come close are haptic suits ( )(big and cumbersome), using a TENS machine (  ) (hurts the skin more than it provides feedback in my opinion.) Olfactory, or digital scent. At this moment, we are unable to digitalize scent in a way that is useful in our daily lives or even on a smaller scale, for demonstrations. Someone has to invent a tool to digitalize a scent and \u2018play\u2019 it in the real world again without having to buy refills every week. Besides the fact we need refills at the moment, we just don\u2019t know everything about the olfactory system yet. We just don\u2019t know how all those scents you smell every day influence your brain and which are good and which are bad.We just need to move. according to a report some time ago, sitting is the new smoking(Yes, sitting too long can kill you, even if you exercise). Virtual reality most of the time means sitting or lying down for long amounts of time, which might lead to health problems if used too often.If we are able to solve all these problems, virtual reality might one day become the most used reality. That is, if a lot of software developers are born in the coming century. Such a game would cost a shitload of development and maintenance time. ",

So, future will be more driven by AR compared to VR AR is an overlay of various content on top of the real world, So user can have presence in real world with overlaying content, recently to augment this, many glasses are appearing in market with AR solution to push this more far.AR can be easily adapted to mobile devices and can be used on the go compare to VR and in terms of application, there are tons of AR application with real world solutions, So it will keep expanding as time fliesSince the real world already out there, Developers need to create overlaying content to augment the reality which is way immersive experience and easier in terms of adaptability over VR.With that being said, it doesn't mean VR will vanish in thin air, VR has potential as well, but in terms of solutions and adaptability it is very new and need lot of work to make it very functional in the market. VR at the moment is expensive in terms of hardware (HTC Vive, Occulus etc) and focused on specific markets (simulations is the best example!)

This distinction is currently only indicative of very early stages of development. In the future there will be one headset which will do both. Extreme AR mode will show mostly our reality with slight augmentations; possibly a little light filtering, or maybe an emoji inserted. Extreme VR mode will show a fully artificial environment which will not have much in common with our world. The true power of this technology will be achieved through the seamless transition between the two, filtering varying degrees of our reality to fit the users\u2019 need. Sometimes it might be necessary to see our world with just GPS directions, while other times it might be necessary to fully transition into something different, such as examining the inside of a volcano. It is silly to have the two separate, as they fulfill the same need with varying degrees of filtering and augmentation for the user. ",

No problem, facial recognition software comes to the rescue which will pull up their twitter feed and give the required details.

            "answer_text": "Very much yes. I was actually discussing the history and potential future of VR and AR with a co-worker the other day. We currently have some VR and AR but it is very primitive. The hardware is big, heavy, blocky, and not all that pleasant to use. It\u2019s significantly better than what we had a decade ago, but we\u2019ve had more of an incremental set of improvements rather than something revolutionary. It is simply physically difficult to make something: High-resolution enough to fool the eyesCapable of updating the screen fast and clearly enough to avoid motion sicknessAccurate and timely enough to be usefulThat runs coolly enough to wear on your body comfortablyThat can last at least 8 hours on a single charge with moderate useLight enough that you don\u2019t get a crick in your neck or arm or wherever from using it all daySexy enough that you don\u2019t shrivel in shame from using it out in publicBecause of the requirement to provide timely information, you can\u2019t trust waiting for the cloud to do the computation for you and sending you back what your AR should do. There must be some heavy local computation so that people get fast, snappy UI. Because we have heavy local computation, we need to use a lot of power to keep things running. This means we must have a powerful (big and heavy, potentially explosive) battery. It also means that the thing will be hot. Computers can easily get up to 70 C which is more than enough to be uncomfortable. Because we are displaying information, we need to hang something in front of your face. This something will need to have enough hardware to do its job which means that you\u2019re going to have something fairly heavy hanging off the front of your face. That\u2019s uncomfortable and unfashionable. It also means that the hardware must be customizable or flexible enough to comfortably fit onto most people\u2019s face, which adds logistical and industrial complexity to your product. Once we solve all of these problems, VR and AR seem destined to rock our world just as much as the smartphone did. Assuming we had \u201csufficiently\u201d good VR and AR, we could get rid of TVs, movie theaters, artistic theaters, physical concerts, etc\u2026 Our day-to-day experiences where we used to have to go to a special location to enjoy an event can now reasonably be replaced with a stay-at-home experience that, due to the immersiveness of realistic VR, would be quite compelling. On the topic of AR, can you imagine a better educational tool than this? You can have an expert anywhere in the world literally draw guides in your vision to help you learn things. Want to put together that IKEA sofa? Never fear, they have catalogued every single instruction and will guide you in where to put every single screw, nut, and bolt in the right place in the right order. In a magical world where we got the tech to work, then I think the benefits of such a technology would be quite obvious. The difficulty is the step where we somehow shrink a cubic foot of computer hardware into something 10% the weight, which generates 1% of the heat, and consumes less power than modern smart phones. We\u2019ve still got a long way to go until passably good AR becomes possible. ",

As I would like to think, in three years we will see new AR glasses with LTE capacities that will end up being an option to the cell phone. With improved vivid innovation and AR abilities, the structure factor of our preferred shopper gadgets will change and we'll never think back. In the following barely any years, we might be utilizing increased reality innovation to check our instant messages and keen glasses to look through Instagram. Augmented Reality is one of the advancements with the most elevated extended potential for development. As per the most recent figures from IDC Research (2018), interest in VR and AR will increase 21-crease throughout the following four years, arriving at 15.5 billion euros by 2022. ",

AR gives us the ability to augment and improve daily tasks and can give us new abilities in things such as studies, crafting, conferencing, shopping, navigating, and more. Similar to how the mobile phone has already improved our ability to access knowledge from the internet anywhere and at any time, AR broadens that horizon. VR, meanwhile, won\u2019t integrate as smoothly and seamlessly into our lives, but can go even further because it isn\u2019t as restricted by reality. As technology improves, what we can do and experience will continue to evolve. When VR stops being low-resolution headsets and buggy tracking sensors, and evolves to neural interfaces and implants, the things we see in Ready, Player One or Tad Williams\u2019 Otherland series can come to pass (for better or worse). I\u2019m excited for both, and hoping that a good chunk of that evolution of both happens within my lifetime. ",

It is totally possible to make a VR or an AR headset that can't do the other, but the future of headsets of either will be able to do both. Whether something is more VR or AR or somewhere in the middle will be a matter of the software. Itll be like asking is the future in Windows or an Apple OS? One of these might be bigger, but it's unlikely either will disappear. I suspect AR will be bigger, once it's all figured out. ",
