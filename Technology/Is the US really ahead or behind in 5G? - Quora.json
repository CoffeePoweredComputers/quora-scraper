            "answer_text": "It depends, behind who? The 5G rollouts are being tested and is on the road map. Sprint and T-Mobile are deploying 5G in 2019 for mobile systems. They have the spectrum to do so and it is on the road map now that the 5G NR format is approved for mobility. As for Verizon and AT&T they plan to start with 5G fixed wireless to break into the FWA ISP market. Chine, South Korea and other countries are testing 5G, but until someone has an operational system with live customers on it, it won\u2019t matter much. It took a long time to get the format approved and now, in the USA, the FCC has to release more spectrum to make it viable for Verizon and AT&T. ",

            "answer_text": "It is about the same level. In both countries new equipment is being tested in the field. With 5G, if you actually want to support the huge ammount of bandwidth increase, you need to use mmWave technology 6GHz to 60GHz. The problem with it is you need direct line of sigth. Thus actual 5G implementation in metropolitan areas will be small basestations on pretty much every other utility pole. How fast the telcos can setup such a solution\u2026 we will have to see. It all boils down to cost. Ericsson has a portfolio from small basestations similar to a router (small BW, small range) to huge ones that you deploy at stadiums (huge BW, small range). ",
