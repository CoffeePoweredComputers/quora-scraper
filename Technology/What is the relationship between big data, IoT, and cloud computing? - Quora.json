            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s use Tesla as an example. They sell IoT devices. Big, very expensive IoT devices called cars, but they are still technically IoT devices! These IoT devices - cars - will collect terabytes of data about the roads they travel on, their handling during different kinds of weather, and many other things. Where does this data go? Into Tesla\u2019s own cloud? Nope. Tesla still sees itself as a startup who need to focus on developing their product. They do not want to spend resources on running their own data centres. So all that data goes into a public cloud. Once there, they need to analyse the data. For example, they would need to crunch all that data about the roads their cars are driving on to help their semi-autonomous driving aid, Auto Pilot. This is the big data part - they need to ingest and process ridiculous amounts of data and then make sense of it. Here too they will use a cloud solution, as then they do not have to worry about adding capacity as things scale. The more cars people buy, the more data comes in, and the more the cloud-based big data solutions scale up by themselves without Tesla having to manually add more hardware to any data centre. So that is the relationship between them - IoT devices are very numerous and generate loads of data. The cloud helps you scale up automatically to ingest this data, and then helps you scale up automatically to process it. All without you having to manage your own hardware. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me reorder & add like this, IoT, Big Data, Cloud Computing, and AI  IoT: IoT is a network of Smart devices which collect and exchange the data between them. The number of connected devices will be 30.7 billion devices in 2020 and 75.4 billion in 2025. It will create Trillions of Data Every hour. How will you handle such a huge data? Here comes Big Data BigData: Big data is a term for data sets that are so large or complex. Hadoop is not a type of database, but rather a software ecosystem. So, using Big Data we can manage those huge data which we got from IoT devices and other sources. But, how will you cope up with scaling and rapidly increasing the volume, centralization and infrastructure? Here comes Cloud Computing. Cloud Computing: Cloud Computing gives the centralized platform to access the data from anywhere in the world with the shared infrastructure. Thus, you can save a lot of money. OK. Now, everything works seamlessly. But, What will you do with those Trillions of data? Here comes the AI AI: Artificial Intelligence can use those data and learn from those data. It will predict or take decisions from those trillions of data. So, we can get usual information and predict our future from our past. There are a lot AI offers. So, the real power comes when we use all the technologies together for our better future. :) ",
