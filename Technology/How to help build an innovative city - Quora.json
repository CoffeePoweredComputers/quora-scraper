And certainly encourage it at the college level. Build a unique selling proposition into what it means to be a citizen of your community which capitalizes on your strengths and your various communities of practice.   By the way, if you google \"innovative cities\" the first 5 responses are on fire good--unusually so.  For instance here is a list: http://www.innovation-cities.com/ If you look at Boston--MIT is a great example of a university connecting itself to the business community and really leaving a positive foot print in the area.  The entrepreneurial ecosystem on the campus as well as with I believe a half mile radius of the campus is quite impressive.  This article by Brad Feld is a short description of MITs Entrepreneurial Ecosystem:http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2005/08/mits-entrepreneurial-ecosystem.html Also check out this article from Kaufmann which emphasizes the need to leverage the MIT model elsewhere:http://www.kauffman.org/research-and-policy/mit-entrepreneurs.aspx My guess the white paper itself breaks down the model, so it can be replicated (unfortunately, I'll have to read it later).  Here is the summary, from MITs own entrepreneurship website:  The unmatched record of achievement of MIT-educated entrepreneurs is described in a recent study, \"Entrepreneurial Impact: The Role of MIT\". It estimates that 25,600 companies founded or co-founded by living MIT alumni were still in existence in 2006, employing 3.3 million people worldwide and generating revenues of close to $2 trillion. That would make the ensemble of MIT-alumni companies the equivalent in GDP of the 11th largest economy in the world. And MIT's impact extends far beyond the borders of Massachusetts, which headquarters MIT-alumni companies that employ about one million women and men. The report estimates that California firms started by MIT alumni employ over 500 thousand people, and twenty states have over 10,000 people employed by MIT entrepreneurs. This impact is global as well, with half of the foreign-student MIT-alumni entrepreneurs likely to return to their home countries. http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/about/history-entrepreneurship-mit Innovation in what area?  Innovation, to what end or with what goal in mind?  Perhaps courageous and bold risk taking for building a productive city? ",
