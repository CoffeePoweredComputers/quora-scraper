            "answer_text": "I work at a job where I do budgets for clients. I like to know how old their children are. The budget of a family with a toddler has different expenses than that of a teenager. Recently, a client told me that her son had been born in 1998 and would be turning 20 this year. I froze. 1998 was 20 years ago. I could not believe it. I remember 1998 fairly well: I was shuffling through the awkwardness of middle school. Brittany Spears was everywhere. Nintendo 64 was all the rage. It had felt like the recent past to me, not very long ago. However, since that time had passed this client's son had been born, lived his entire childhood, and was now in college and nearly old enough to drink. I am only 33, but only part of my time on earth has encompassed another person's entire life. I expressed this to the client who agreed with me. I am sure the client, who was older than me, had felt this way many times. However, this was my first experience with, \u201cI felt like it was only yesterday\u201d and I doubt it will be my last. I don't know if this answers your question, but I can definitely relate to how you feel about 1998. I am amazed how time, which inches along when you are a child, accelerates as you get older. 20 years to someone in their 30s must feel the same as a day to a six year old. The longer you live, the more time you experience and the faster it all seems to go. It makes me think about how precious it truly is. ",

            "answer_text": "Heh. I was driving last year and the thought suddenly came to me, like taking a slug in the gut, in sixteen years I will be 60 years old. ~60~ years old. 16 years ago was\u2014-2002. I almost went over the yellow line on the busy road, an intersection no less, at rush hour. I can remember and actually \u201cfeel\u201d 2002 with a startling vividness. I can remember whole, specific days with weather, smells, outfits. I can do this for any year until around 1986. Although a few pieces stick out here and there with surprising clarity. I was 12 in 1986. Anyhow, 2002 seems much, much too close for comfort for me to be, gasp!, 60? Obviously 1998 feels close, but not as close as the aughts or especially 10 years ago (09), now that indeed feels like four years if we are getting rid of hyperbole or exaggeration. Maybe you're like me and have a very good, detailed autobiographical memory? I complained to my therapist that time went too quick for me. I quit my job exactly one year ago and remember sitting in my car, crying that there was no distance between me quitting (it was a horrible day). But now that it is a full year it still seems freakishly like a mere three months. Also time goes far quicker with age. My dad, 76, says it's \u201cterrifying\u201d. ",
