            "answer_text": "The overall cost for a US patent - software or otherwise - totals about $50\u201360K. Your mileage may vary, but these are industry average numbers across the US. The industry average (taken from the AIPLA Bi-annual Economic Survey) is as follows: Drafting and filing the patent application: $12,000. USPTO fees are approx $720 (small entity). The patent drafting and filing is only about 20% of the total costs. For each rejection, you will file a response, which will be $4000. The average is somewhere near 4.2 rejections/patent application, but it can range from first action allowance to a dozen or more rejections/responses. This part is highly variable, but averages 30\u201350% of the total cost of the patent. This part, known as \u201cprosecution\u201d should cost around $20\u201325K on average. There are other fees, such as issue fees and maintenance fees - some of which are paid after the patent issues - which bring the total fees paid to the USPTO to be $12\u201316K over the life of the patent. Most attorneys will tell you a price to draft the patent application, but will be uncomfortable telling you how much it will cost during prosecution. There are two reasons for this. First is that they honestly do not know how much it will cost, but second is that patents in the prosecution stage are a huge money maker. In fact, the last thing the attorney wants is for the patent to issue, because that cuts off his/her stream of money. Be careful that your attorney is not just kicking the can down the road with the examiner and keeping the prosecution alive, while draining your bank account. ",

            "answer_text": "To determine the cost of a patent, it is first important to identify the different areas where you will incur costs and fees: Patent Search Fees: Before proceeding with a patent, it is important to conduct a thorough patent search to ensure that your technology is not infringing on the patent rights of others. You can do this yourself, but a trained patent attorney will be able to do this efficiently and provide you an opinion letter on your patent. Fees: none if done yourself; attorney fees vary with who you hire.Patent Application Preparation Fees: Next you will need to prepare the patent application. This includes drafting the claims and the technical specifications. Again, this is something you can do yourself, but involving a patent attorney will increase the likelihood of your application being successful. Fees: none if done yourself; attorney fees vary with who you hire, but typically in the thousands depending on the complexity of the patent.USPTO Filing Fees: When filing the application, you will have to pay the current USPTO filing fees for your application. Fees: filing fees whether you file yourself or using an attorney - you can see a schedule of the fees here.Examination Related Representation: During the USPTO\u2019s review of the patent, they may come back with questions or require additional information. You can either choose to defend this yourself or have your patent attorney handle this on your behalf.
