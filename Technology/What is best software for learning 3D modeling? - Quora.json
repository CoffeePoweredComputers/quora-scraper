            "answer_text": "Every 3D modeling software was designed for a specific purpose and each is meant for a particular group of people, either beginners, professionals, hobbyist, etc. So the best 3D modeling software, in my opinion, should be the one that has the features for 3D modeling, sculpting and maybe even slicing while still in the program and also it should be friendly to the beginners but should not be too basic for advanced users. Professionals should also be able to create advanced models in the software easily. The best 3D Modeling software for sculpting so far is Zbrush. Blender is best for 3D modeling and May is perfect for animation. TinkerCAD, on the other hand, is the best 3D modeling tool for kids. If you need the best tool in terms of what they can do the above can be of help. But the overall best 3D Modeling software, in my opinion, is SelfCAD. It\u2019s the best because one model, sculpt professionals and also slice without the need for additional software or extension. Additionally, SelfCAD is much easier to use just like TinkerCAD, but the only difference is, SelfCAD is much powerful and one can design complicated models too. Hence it\u2019s an idea for both beginners and professionals. Many people aren\u2019t aware of this software as it was released just a few years ago. There are many tutorials on their Youtube channel (SelfCAD ) to help you get started. This vide can be of help too.  ",

            "answer_text": "If you have no prior experience in 3d modelling at all, I would recommend blender. Mostly because it's open source and free, meaning that you don't have to worry about not learning quick enough (other software mostly have monthly subscription plans), as well as enjoying a ton of new updates in the future as anyone who knows how to code can contribute to blender functionalities. However, be aware that blender's learning curve is quite steep due to lack of default tutorials. You will have to figure out the UI yourself. Expect to get overwhelmed by the controls all over the screen. Just keep in mind that you don't have to, and never will, be familiar with ALL options on the screen. I doubt even professionals have to use half of all functionalities. Go for online tutorials to familiarize yourself with the UI of blender(which is considered quite unique in the industry if you have tried other 3D software). I would recommend you following structured courses that required some payments rather than random YouTube tutorials. Even though free tutorials seems better at first glance, you will be easily distracted and may learn the wrong workflow, ultimately wasting your time, which is consider is much more valuable than the small payments you spent on structured tutorials like those on CGcookies. As a final note, blender is a lot more than just a 3d modelling software, it's compositor, animator, and renderer etc. are quite good and even comparable with stand-alone software's. If you had mastered certain aspect of blender and find blender not powerful enough, you can always purchase other software to help speed up your working pace, for instance I have used substance painter 2 to take care of the material and bake different maps for my models. But in the meanwhile, just use blender first as most of its functions are more than powerful for beginners. Good luck and have fun, cheers! ",
