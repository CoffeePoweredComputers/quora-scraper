            "answer_text": "It is hard to say, but good city driving should be a reality in two years time. The technology will be ready in months, but it will take a couple of years to mature. The other caveat is the tech will not mature for the road not taken. If you are out and about in some rural neighborhood, chances are your Tesla might mow down a farmer crossing a dirt road. Level-5 autonomy, in its true form is atleast 5 years ahead if not more. Some say it might require all vehicles and humans to identify themselves to vehicles so that routes can be better planned and accidents avoided. My prediction is autonomous routing protocol will be developed and deployed first over the next 5 years. This will identify vehicles, people and buildings to facilitate identification of hazards and routes. Humans would be encouraged to drive through all these routes so operational aspects of routing can be mapped out. Then autonomy becomes easy. I think it will take 20 years or more for your car to drive you around the back roads of Alaska or Tibet. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a safe answer to this question: \u201cnext year.\u201d Tesla has been pretty consistent with this answer for quite some time now. Musk says self-driving should be \u201cfeature complete\u201d by the end of 2019 (which probably means sometime around the end of 2020). \u201cFeature complete\u201d means that the car drives it self in all situations, except when it doesn\u2019t and the human driver has to take over. I\u2019m really wondering how that\u2019s going to work, second guessing everything the car does. Then Musk said that all the corner cases would be worked out and maybe there would be regulatory approval for autonomous driving maybe by \u201cnext year.\u201d So just hold that \u201cnext year\u201d thought and whenever you wonder when Tesla will achieve fully autonomous capability, take it out and look at it. When it actually comes, enjoy the surprise with the rest of us. ",
