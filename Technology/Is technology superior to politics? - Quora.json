            "answer_text": "A set of questions that the average person can\u2019t easily be persuaded into changing his mind about. If you accept this definition of politics, statements such as \u201cpolitics is overrated\u201d and \u201cthe modern world did not come about because of politics\u201d (both of which I\u2019ve been guilty of uttering myself) become rather ridiculous. It is in the same category of lazy thinking as: \u201cif it wasn\u2019t for religion, we would have permanent world peace by now\u201d. And it\u2019s not that these statements are necessarily false. They\u2019re just not very helpful. They\u2019re basically saying \u201cif it wasn\u2019t for HUMANS, we wouldn\u2019t have any problems\u201d. Thing is; humans are pretty neat and we are not disappearing any time soon. Maybe that\u2019ll change when we invent artificial general intelligence and become obsolete. But in the meantime, we\u2019re just gonna have to accept the facts: That humans are irrational. Especially those who delude themselves into thinking that they\u2019re notThat humans are emotional and ideological. We start wars over insults and shiny objectsThat Humans dislike change. Especially regarding their own beliefs, opinions and meta-beliefs (like, that we\u2019re even ideological to begin with)The best we can do is try to raise our self-awareness. That for the most part, we\u2019re all just stupid monkeys trying to do our best about this whole \u201cwaking up on a floating rock\u201d-thing.  So take a deep breath and say it with me: \u201cI\u2019m a clueless ape who doesn't know what\u2019s going on, and that\u2019s okay\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Both are tools humankind uses to get things done. Technology can be divided by purpose, but the level we\u2019ve come to causes advancement to be done by teams of individuals, not single doctors or mathematicians working without aid (by computer or by other community members). Politics can exist on a micro level, so even among a small group of researchers, some order and division of labor should exist, and despite current dysfunctions, that is the goal of politics. Technology can replace some of the labor, reducing but not eliminating the need for politics. So since they\u2019re interrelated, neither is superior. ",
