            "answer_text": "Hacking is not a Topic. Its a field ,there are 100's of type in this field.You might have heard about Grey hat, White hat, Black Hat hacker .These are the type of hackers categorized by the way they work and their intention.If you are good in any one language you can do little bit of hacking, But you should know what you wanna do actually.Some of hacking pattern are Pentesting : an attack on a computer system with the intention of finding security weaknesses, potentially gaining access to itSniffing: Sniffing is a data interception technology. Sniffer is a program that monitor or reading all network traffic passing in and out over a network. Telnet, Relogin, FTP, NNTP, SMTP, HTTP, IMAP that all protocol are vulnerable for sniffing because it send data and password in clear text. Sniffing can be use both the ways legally or illegally like for monitor network traffic, network security and for stealing information like password, files .Computer network exploitation (CNE) is a technique through which computer networks are used to infiltrate target computers' networks to extract and gather intelligence data. It enables the exploitation of the individual computers and computer networks of an external organization or country in order to collect any sensitive or confidential data, which is typically kept hidden and protected from the general public.There are a number of languages used for hacking depending upon your requirements.For web exploitation you need to know PHP , .NET , JS ,JQuery , SQL and many more. For OS hacking your concept should be strong about OS and its shell,kernel etc. For Electronic Guys Like you:- You people have a much more better area . You can master yourself in Assembly languages, and Tiny C , Matlab , Scada and with that you can hack any electronic gadgets .We people from Computer Science are having a serious problem regarding learning of electric circuits and their processing.You got an advantage their. JAVA and C are also highly used for coding electronic circuits and after compiling they changed to machine code.Dude don't let this thing go from you. Its a hacking field only.Hope it helped ",

            "answer_text": "*sigh* The first place to start is to learn some vocabulary. I am a hacker, but I do not infiltrate systems, nor do I try to steal confidential information, nor do I type feverishly at a keyboard in order to impress my friends. A hacker is an individual who loves to take things apart and see how they work. A hacker is an individual with boundless curiosity and an insatiable desire to ever expand their knowledge of the world, or at least a certain portion of it. Now, individuals who have this mindset can apply it in different ways. I apply it in the art of troubleshooting and building. I make a living at fixing complex problems and by making diverse and complicated systems internetwork. I find this very satisfying and it scratches the itch of my hacking tendencies. Others apply it to the \"art\" of infiltration, sabotage, and the circumvention of people's rights and liberties. It is these types that have been popularized in modern media and give individuals like myself a bad name. The professionals are generally paid by the mafia or by foreign governments to break the law for profit. Some do it purely out of curiosity and the need to prove superiority, while others do it because of base greed. I prefer to call these individuals \"Crackers\", a divergent sect of the Hacker culture. While I of course encourage you to pick the noble path of the hacker, you may be set on the course of becoming a cracker instead. Regardless, first ask yourself this question: Am I curious and stubborn to a fault? If yes, then you have a chance. As has been already stated by others, to \"hack\" you must learn. Spend your time reading RFCs, installing, configuring and operating every operating system out there, programming in as many languages as possible, building networks, and above all else... Never do anything the easy way. If there is a prepackaged software program, try to find the source and compile it for yourself. If an application has a GUI, try to find a command line alternative. If a programming problem can be solved by an API, write it from scratch yourself. If a software program has pre-built configuration files, delete them and build the config from scratch. It is not enough to know how to use a computer, network device, or piece of hardware, you must rather \"know\" it. Open it up, look at the working gears, compare it to other similar systems and draw parallels, figure out how it fits in the \"big\" picture. You get the idea. This almost always takes time. So much time that most give up. But if you train yourself to take the hard way, to spend the time to know, it will become easier. You'll have past knowledge that you can use to detect patterns, new systems will become transparent, and ultimately you'll learn the inspired axiom \"there is no new thing under the sun.\" ",
