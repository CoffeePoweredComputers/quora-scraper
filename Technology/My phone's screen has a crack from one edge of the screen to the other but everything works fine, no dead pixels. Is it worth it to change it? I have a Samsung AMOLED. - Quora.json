            "answer_text": "I What smartphone makes all the difference to the answer; If it is a $199 Android phone like the M10s or J2 Pro from 2018 no it is cheaper/smarter to buy a new one or put up with the crack.If it is a midrange phone less then 18 months old get a quote then decide if the crack annoys you more than spending that much to fix it now if it is older just put up with the crack.If it is a 3-year-old flagship device its very likely to also need a battery very soon so get a quote for both then decide.A newer flagship device under 2 years old would generally be worth repairing even an iPhone but again if the crack doesn't concern you just use it as is.This is my personal opinion, not based on anything more scientific, than knowing the price of replacement displays for a number of phones and knowing the cost of a lot of phones. I have a friend whos S7 edges screen has more cracks than you can imagine and a pink line he has been using it like that for going on a year I would have changed phones 11 months ago if that was mine what annoys us is different.

            "answer_text": "According to your decription about your phone, what is cracked is the digitizer, not the display screen. The digitizer is a replaceable part, not too expensive, and is not that difficult to replace (by a trained repair tech of course). Take it to a repair shop, and they repair it in less than one hour. Compare the price of repair versus a new one. ",
