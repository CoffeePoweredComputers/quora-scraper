            "answer_text": "I agree with Eric that Estonia is a very nice place. Having been born 10,000 km. from here, I think I qualify as different, maybe even very different. Let's take them one by one: Estonia is tiny. No disagreement there. I can take my car and in less than 4 hours I can get to any point in the whole country. The main towns such as P\u00e4rnu, Tartu or Narva can be reached in much less than that.But yes, if you like to move a lot, you will need to cross the sea to Finland, take a plane to Sweden soon, or go on a long drive south to Latvia.Estonia doesn't like change. I disagree on this one a bit. On the one side, you will always find typically old people who like things done the same way. You will find people who tend to be more conservative about any influence that can come from outside. That's their nature especially concerning national symbols such as their music or their language.However, I have never lived in a country that has managed essentially to reinvent itself in just 20 years. Just take a book or the wikipedia page of Estonia and compare what happened in the last three decades to anything in any other country and you will see what I mean. Economically and technologically, this is another land from what it used to be in 1990. I wish my own country was 10% as dynamic as this one.The dichotomy here is that yes, they do like change, but they like only the change they make on their own terms and this is a huge difference. And people here take change seriously.In Estonia, people look down on you if you are different. I can say than in almost six years living here, I cannot feel that someone has looked down on me just because of my appearance or behavior. The opposite actually, as I find people going out of their way to try to help me. Yes, I think there is always crazy, racist people who make an enemy of anyone who is not like them, but they would make an enemy out of anyone or anything (and yes, I have ran into a couple of them here too, but also in other countries, even my own).Is it a nice place? For sure. Even if it's tiny, it still offers a breathtaking amount of nature. It is safe or safer than most places. It offers beautiful cities and beautiful people. It lacks pollution and traffic jams. There is water everywhere. It has four seasons. Dark days in the winter and white nights in the summer. Technology for geeks like me. Beautiful forests. Should I continue?Having said all of the above, not two people are created the same. Not everybody was born on the place they are compatible with. Maybe your friend is destined to travel the world and miss home without being able to live there. It takes one to know one. ",

            "answer_text": "Estonia is a really good place if you like the life in the North. Estonia is not for everybody because of the same reason. There are continuosly people arriving here from abroad saying surprised in February that \u201cIt is cold :-S I didn\u2019t expect it to be as cold as minus 2 degrees!\u201d - literally. Although then they should avoid most of Europe in general. ( I remember I met tourists in Troms\u00f8, 70 degrees North, who didn\u2019t bring a Winter jacket and complained that \u201cIt is so cold!\u201d). So, if you are not surprised that in Winter it is cold and the days are shorter just like in most of Europe, then you are already a step forward in enjoying it. It has an emerging start-up industry, and due to this, many modern solutions are part of the everyday life here of ordinary people, like e-ID, e-tickets, e-voting, no ques in public administration offices, etc. The weather might be overcast many days, but Estonia does receive a fair amount of sunshiny days as well and then you realize that it is really worth it! It is so beautiful, some gardens and cottages are just like if you were in Paradise. You can enjoy hiking in beautiful clean nature, and unlike in the South, you don\u2019t have to fear the sun. Even I can be outside hours in Summer in the bright sunshine without sun-screen and receive only a slight red tone on my untannable fair skin. If you like the active life, here you\u2019ll find companions to go with you for sure sooner or later, because locals are active. When becoming friends the locals are very helpful and friendly in all circumstances. People judge you by how much results you have actually made and not by how well you can sell yourself through small-talk. If you are interested in a field, they will give you the chance to proove your skills and will be rewarded accordingly. Economically, it is not the West or Scandinavia yet, but it is on the best way to reach it in the foreseeable future. It is already not bad economically, to be frank. Although prices are high, you get very high services for your money, something that also improves your life-quality. Distances are exactly the same as in Central-Europe. Geographically the territory of the country might be smaller than the average down in the South, but the low population-density makes up for it: If you have a friend living in the next town with a colledge/university, you must travel two hours in average. (E.g: P\u00e4rnu-Tartu-Tallinn) as cities are further off from each other. I definitely don\u2019t recommend it to coach-potatoes and city-boys, although they can find their social-bubble as well. Over 90% of Estonian men are very muscular while healthily skinny. Most Estonian women can wear a cocktail-dress without any feel of discomfort. Overweight people here under 50 are rather rare. And they are really active, not just when going hiking and swimming, but in everyday life as well. No-one asks you if you bear the tempo/weight/are able to do it. Do it. Now. And they make it. Pensioners as well. So you must be fit. Those who like adventures will thrive in Estonia. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "I think the way foreigners see Estonia is as different from how Estonians see it as how Estonians who have left see it. I am an Estonian who has left many times and lived elsewhere for long stretches of time. I returned again a year ago for good and took my American husband with me. The most common mismatch between foreigners views versus people born here is that for the first it seems like Narnia (gorgeous forests, sea everywhere, magical technology etc) whereas for the latter something from Lord of the Rings is more appropriate (scary forests which one third of the population has left behind to live in the busy capital with a hint of medieval beliefs). I think majority of that mismatch is coming from many foreigners not speaking enough Estonian to be able to gauge the finer nuances of culture. And the local society doesn't make them do it either since English is widespread and accepted. We don't mind the size of the country, in fact we like that it's small because everything, including change, happens a lot faster than it does in giants such as the States. One thing to know about Estonia and Estonians is that deep routed subtle nationalism is part of our dna due to historic reasons of Estonia being occupied by so many countries and having to continuously fight for its freedom. I think there is a level of casual racism in there too but that's more to do with Estonia not being exposed to many races until only very recently (mostly via tourism though). In general it is a very liberal country, to the most part nobody cares what your religious, sexual or political views are as long as you're a good conversation. ",
