            "answer_text": "Well i think i can answer this question . I have used both samsung and redmi smartphones and found some pros and cons in both the brands. So i am going to discuss all information related to samsung and redmi based on my experience but before that i request you to upvote my answer to show your support and increase the visibility of my answer. 1.)Display  When i talk about the display quality of both the devices , then i must clearly say that no doubt samsung is the best . Because the quality of display used in Samsung is really premium quality as compared to The Redmi Devices which have just an average quality LCD/IPS display . But in case of Samsung you get a AMOLED display in most of the devices So if you prefer a great display then go for Samsung. 2. Prices  When i see the budget range of both the brands , then you can clearly see that redmi phones are really affordable ,you can easily grab a great feature Redmi phone under 15,000 INR but when you compare the same features of the 15,000 Redmi phone with the Samsung phone you will see that the samsung phones list the same features as of redmi with a slight change and prices the phone at around 30k-40k INR. So you can clearly see the difference between the two Brands. 3.Heating issues Now in terms of of heating issues , i must say samsung is really good as i have used 2\u20133 redmi phones and i have got some heating issues after a certain period of time . What i have seen is that the build quality used in Redmi Phones are not that good as compared to Samsung, therefore this maybe be one of the reason for heating issues in Redmi Phones Maybe problem is in my device .But what i have experienced i have shared 4.Performance  When i talk about the performance of both the devices you will see a difference . What i meant to say is when you buy a Samsung phone at a price range of 10\u201315k you wont see a great performance . But when you move your price from 20k -40k you will see great performance and quality. In case of Redmi i must say you will experience great power at a low price range . So make your choice according to your budget. if your main focus is on power and performance. 5.Camera Quality  When i talk about the camera quality of both the brands . Samsung wins at every point . Dont see the pixels mentioned on the redmi devices like 48 MP or 108 MP . As i have seen a 12MP Samsung camera competing with Redmi 48MP Device. What i meant to say is samsung focuses more on the Quality . So if you have want a great camera you can go with Samsung. 6.Updates  Receiving time to time android or system updates makes your phone meet your future needs and improve its performance . So when see both the brands in terms of updates ,then i must say redmi receives updates more frequently than Samsung. I hope i have helped you choose the better phone based on your needs.

            "answer_text": "Samsung and redmi are two smartphone brands present in the market in leading position.samsung giving a tough competition with redmi.Both are good while we talk about the durability samsung stand good like nokia.redmi is suitable for people expecting a smartphone where you need a cheap smartphone where you dont need of camera as important thing and needs more performance at cheap rate.redmi has bad display and redmi has poor build quality and durability.when i see the people with both the smartphones still samsung mobile users use it for 3 to 5 years like me still i use samsung s2.but there is total reduction of redmi note 4 users because the the budget and it is also difficult for redmi to manufacture at that budget and also to lead the market.While talking about samsung,first thing if you see movies lot dont think of any smartphones because of top class display which is a super amoled display and samsung cameras will be cool while comparing redmi.performance wise the 4gb ram redmi gives a good competition with 2 gb ram in samsung and it has good ram management.worst thing in samsung is low volume speakers.If you use a big branded headphones,earphones you will definitely notice the hearing experience will be best in samsung because of best quality headphone jack.redmi is the only only ram and battery other than that it is not user friendly and main thing is security is less.samsung is highly secured one.but cost wise redmi is the best and due to branding samsung cost much.Finally i conclude samsung is the best because whatever you do in a smartphone it is only viewed through a good display i.e amoled.
