Ever see a \"rooted\" or \"jailbroke\" BlackBerry? Can't be done.  So do you want the leader of our country using a phone the enemies of our country can hack and listen or see what documents he has on his phone? Or use a highly secure and government IT controlled phone? So no he won't be allowed under any circumstances to use an iPhone. ",
