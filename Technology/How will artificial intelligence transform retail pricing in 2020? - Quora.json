By having a real time instant valuation tracked to real time sales and distribution, all fluctuations of prices can be calibrated to maximize profits.An AI that can \u201csee\u201d a weak or strong selling point in the process, can either instantly lower or raise a retail price to maximize the profit margin for the product.
