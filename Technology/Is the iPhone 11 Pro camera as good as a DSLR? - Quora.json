            "answer_text": " Here\u2019s is Apple\u2019s new iPhone Pro. It\u2019s got three tiny, tiny, tiny <ridiculous, isn\u2019t it> tiny, tiny little cameras. It\u2019s also got an AI brain. If you\u2019re not interested in learning photography and want to take good-looking snapshots for instant upload to Instagram or, if you must, a hundred selfies a day on Twitter, you could do worse than this phone for your snapshooting needs. You can also do better\u2026 your call. You might take a look at the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G, that\u2019s got the best camera rating (DxOMark) to date\u2026 for a phone.  Here is a Digital Single-Lens Reflex Camera called the Nikon D850. This is a professional tool for making art, one of many you will probably use if you become a photographer. Pick the one that fits you brain. This camera has a sensor with 4x the resolution and, depending on lens and which camera you pick on, 40x-60x+ the light gathering capability of the iPhone 11.  Here is my Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II, a mirrorless camera. It\u2019s smaller and lighter than the Nikon DSLR. I personally favor a smaller system for many kinds of photography. This is also a professional tool for making art, some of which you can find here (B&W Photo of the Day).  It\u2019s not just the camera, but the system. A DSLR or mirrorless ILC can be adapted to a whole variety of applications. A phone can, too, just most of them aren\u2019t photographic applications. It\u2019s a pocket personal computer, after all. Stop trying to make it a professional camera, it never will be.  I can capture a liftoff taking place 3 miles away.  My camera is fast enough to catch a butterfly in flight.  Or a bee!  Or a bird!  I can focus in on a flower.  Or just part of a flower.  Or way out to the moon\u2026  \u2026 or the whole galaxy!

            "answer_text": "iPhone 11 Pro can actually create the claimed DSLR or mirrorless quality for most situations for photos being shown on monitor or for small prints, a test below compares it with and full-frame professional mirrorless cameras - full-frame Nikon Z7 and APS-C Sony a6400. A very important issue for professional photography is that iPhone photos are limited to 12MP resolution of its sensors that do not actually allows using its photos for big prints, here is its camera overview and comparison with other cameras:   DSLR cameras provide some important features for professionals that cannot be achieved in a smartphone. The main DSLR benefit is much larger sensor providing much greater quality for low-light photos. Here is a detailed overview of DSLR features which are not available on top smartphone cameras: My iPhone is Great, But It Will Never Replace My DSLR DSLR lenses simply provide better sharpness and better image quality than what a smartphone brings, as you can see in the side-by-side comparison:  There's no grip in a smartphone, so you're forced to tightly grasp the edges of the phone to keep it steady. That's not to mention how hard it is to actually see how everything fits into the frame. You can also reach all the buttons and dials on the camera and lens while it's raised to your eye, so you don't have to fumble around trying to hold it while acquiring focus or changing camera settings on a smartphone:  The benefit of a larger camera sensor is also seen during daytime shooting as well as at night. Just like a larger sensor has a greater ability to retain the detail in shadows in low-light situations, it's able to retain detail in highlights in bright shooting conditions as well:  ",
