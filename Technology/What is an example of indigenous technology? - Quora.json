            "answer_text": "One very excellent example is the use of laminated bows to hunt buffalo. The wood used sandwiched a layer of springy tendon material and the bowstrings were also made of this material from deer and elk. This allowed a very powerful bow in a compact size for easy use in hunting from horseback. Another area of technical advancement was the use of Red Willow bark carefully prepared as a treatment for pain. Later it was discovered that the main healing ingredient in Aspirin is also found in Red Willow bark. Other healing herbal preparations predated even the most advanced European pharma in the day. Finally, selective breeding of corn and other crops gave rise to greater yields even in dry lands with irrigated fields. Some of those strains are shared worldwide even today. ",

Outrigger canoes and sailboats in hawaii. Surfboards in Hawaii. American Indians used to drill holes in rock and put grain in the holes and then wet it. The grain would expand and split off a layer of rock. Some tribes quarried rock that way. ",
