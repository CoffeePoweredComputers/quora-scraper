            "answer_text": "Same as a gas-powered bike. The differences are: You have a much bigger battery.It has an electric motor instead of a gasoline engine.They will generally have no transmission because electric motors generate enough torque at low RPM to negate the need for a transmission. (Same applies to electric cars.)May have a belt drive instead of a chain drive.The other components are identical. All you have is a different drive train. That is it. From an operational stand-point an electric motorcycle is easier to ride because the throttle is more linear, and there is never a point at which you need to shift gears. It makes it easier to develop a feel for the bike when accelerating. It is also easier to operate at low speeds because you do not have to feather the clutch. On the flip side a gas bike is easier to ride at specific speeds above idle, as you have more engine braking, and you can use specific gears and RPM ranges to more easily control/gauge your speed. This can make the riding more fun. Mechanically an electric motorcycle is easier to maintain \u2014 you generally have nothing to service other than tires and brakes, and some bearings (e.g. steering head bearing) \u2014 but if the bike has a failure it can take a lot longer to get the bike fixed. For example, it took four months to get my 2017 Zero S fixed when it failed. Also, if the battery fails out of warranty you are cost to fix the bike that is greater than the bike is worth. From a service stand point more dealerships sell and service gas bikes. The biggest issue I have is dealerships keep dropping electric brands in my region, which makes it a gamble as to whether or not I will be able to get the bike serviced at a dealership near me. This is the reason I will not consider another electric motorcycle until a major brand (Kawasaki, Yamaha, etc) offers electric. Financially gas bikes retain their value better. They are also less expensive to buy. You will generally pay a 40% to 60% premium for an electric motorcycle. Around half of that price will be the battery. Which should a person choose? If you are looking to commute short to medium distances on a motorcycle \u2014 especially in an urban environment with lots of stop and go traffic \u2014 electric may be your best bet. Especially if you do not want to deal with routine maintenance. If you ride longer distances, want to tour, ride in cold weather, or like wrenching on your bike you would be better off staying with a gas bike for now. ",

            "answer_text": "An electric motorcycle works just like an e-bike, except no pedals. The motor is brushless, ultimately powered via batteries through a controller. The controller takes an input from an electric throttle (outputs 1 to 4 volts DC on an e-bike) and converts the DC battery voltage into 3 phase AC for the brushless motor. More throttle voltage modulates the 3 phase AC waveform with a higher duty cycle Pulse Width Modulation, making the motor faster. At full speed, PWM is fully \u201con\u201d so the waveform looks closest to a sine wave. At low speed, the sine wave looks choppy, as the PWM is chopping the sine wave \u201coff\u201d in sections of the waveform. A higher battery voltage usually means more power from the motor. On an e-bike with a 1 hp motor, battery voltage is around 36 volts. Off road e-bikes are around 2 hp with battery voltages of 72 volts. Electric motorcycles are generally much more powerful, with battery voltages in excess of 100 volts. ",
