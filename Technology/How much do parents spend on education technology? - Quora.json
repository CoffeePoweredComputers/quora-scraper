            "answer_text": "According to a Rubicon Project survey [1], parents of K-12 students spent an average of $873 on their children (plural) in 2015. About $390 of that was for technology in general. This summary comes from EdSurge [2]. There currently is no market data on parents\u2019 spending habits on edtech specifically, just numbers for schools and teachers [3].
