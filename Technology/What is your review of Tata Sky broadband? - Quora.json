            "answer_text": "Tatasky broadband has one of the worst customer services possible. When i asked for installation, i asked for installation at a specific location at my home. The person came, i showed him the place and he said ok. Next day i was not present, he installed the router at some other place of his liking and now i dont get coverage properly. Plus the place i told him had power backup, now the place he installed doesn't have it. I asked for re-installation. Dint happen i gave up. Next, two days after installation the internet stopped working which turned out to be there digisol router issue later. But they took whole 8 days to resolve it. I called there customer care multiple times.They would say somebody with definitely attend your complaints in 8 hrs. This way many days passed. I kept on calling the person who took installation money from me. He also didn't pick up the call. Finally got some area manager number from a reference. Called him. He gave nimber of some 4\u20135 People one of them helped. And finally it worked. Again after two days internet is there but not able to open web pages even. It got resolved next day. Then after 10 days again some issue no internet. 5 days for resolution and this issue was with multiple connection in my society. This is my one month journey with tatasky broadband. Avoid tatasky even if you have only local options available. ",

            "answer_text": "I got TATA Sky broadband in February \u201819. My experience with them has been satisfactory. The only problem i can pick if i had to is their connection routing. I am based in Delhi, but the servers picked by speed-test are almost always in Mumbai. So my data is almost always relayed every time I go online. Not good for what i intended to get their services in the first place, Gaming. Also, when they installed it and tried to show me the 100 Mbps speed, they specifically asked me to connect to their own TATA Sky server in Bangalore. Speed not guaranteed if you don\u2019t connect to their server!!! The connection is perfect for daily usage, streaming, browsing etc. But when it comes to Gaming, which was the one of the reasons I shifted to them, the performance Ping wise is average, I get 90\u2013110 ms on Pubg PC (Singapore Server), 20\u201350 ms on Pubg Lite (Indian Server - Mumbai), 145\u2013200 ms in SMITE (EU Server - Amsterdam). Although Connection is rock solid with minimal Packet Loss and Bufferbloat, I was hoping for a general improvement in my pings over my last connection, which was an Airtel ADSL 14 Mbps. Sadly, the performance except speed in MBPS is exactly the same. Their Customer Service is average, the website is always under some weird error but works fine through android app. There seems to be no sync between their app-website-customer service team. As in if I recharge my account through the app, the plan would still expire, so every time I recharge, I have to call them up and tell them to update my account, in 2019!!! NOTE: My plan is 50 Mbps, they have activated a voucher which makes it 2x till 2030!! So i get 100 Mbps. In India, I guess most of us are destined to forever be forced to use mediocre ISP\u2019s. ",
