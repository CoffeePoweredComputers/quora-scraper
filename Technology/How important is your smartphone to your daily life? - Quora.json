It and my iWatch remind me of meetings I need to go to and new emails. I check the weather every morning. I use the exercise reminders and monitors in my iWatch and phone. I get texts every few days from my children (I have 5). It\u2019s not essential, but a nice lifestyle upgrade :) I rarely use it as a cellphone. ",
