            "answer_text": "\u201cComputer Science certification\u201d. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re discussing professional certifications. No. Computer Science isn\u2019t a particular piece of software, nor is it a vocation. It\u2019s a mathematical science, an academic field of study that studies computation. If somebody is trying to tell you they can give you a \u201ccertification\u201d in Computer Science, I advise ignoring it. People like me won\u2019t take you seriously with a \u201ccertification\u201d as a basis of your supposed expertise. An expert is my field is somebody for instance that contributes to the scientific literature in this field, and has dedicated their work in studying it for years. I do not like speaking in the terms of who is and isn\u2019t an \u201cexpert\u201d, but there is an important distinction to be made between what an actual contributor to CS is, versus somebody treating the field like it\u2019s some static entity that is unchanging and doesn\u2019t contribute to it and only applies it. Computer Science is something you earn a university degree in. If somebody is trying to promise you a x-month certification in a scientific field, it\u2019s not a good idea to buy into it. If they are offering more, like a set of courses you can take or a workshop, and it is being run by actual computer scientists, then we might be talking about something out. If I were to tell you that you could get a \u201ccertification\u201d in Physics, you\u2019d probably find that funny. It\u2019s no different here. A high school student has enough stuff going on, if they are genuinely curious about CS, you can always just learn more CS. If you\u2019re interested in software development (something different), then you can pursue perhaps (on the topic of certifications) certifications for specific industry-level pieces of software. I really don\u2019t think the average high-schooler is prepared for anything like that (it takes time to learn these things), so be warned. ",

            "answer_text": "None. Certifications are worthless outside of very narrow areas (like Infiniband version 6 configuration or something.) They won\u2019t impress a college, an employer, your peers, or anyone else. Worse, they\u2019ll give you a false sense of achievement or competence at a time when you can be doing real learning. ",
