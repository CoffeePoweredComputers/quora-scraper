            "answer_text": "Simple! Start when they are young. Talk to them, show them how things work. Grow plants, cook with them, build stuff, and while you do all of this, tell them what are the basic concepts. And as they grow, explain the same thing a bit more. When kids are ok with reading, get them to read books. Read with them. Remind them what you did with them earlier and co-relate what is being read with what was done. When they come talk to you about what they learnt at school, repeat the same. Have a discussion with them with what they did and what they are learning. Try to experiment with them. If your child is curious, you need to be prepared to answer a looot of questions, and even then, have loooots of patience to listen to them, their explanations. By the time they are about 10\u201311 year olds, sometimes even earlier than that, they just take off. The amount of knowledge they absorb and understand is mind boggling. You too will loads of fun in this journey and learn new stuff every other day. ",
