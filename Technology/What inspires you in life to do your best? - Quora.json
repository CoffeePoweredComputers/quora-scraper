            "answer_text": "My purpose inspires me to do my best. \u201cThe purpose of life is to live a life of purpose.\u201d \u2015 Richard Leider Realizing my purpose - to become my best so I can help others become theirs, I know my exact reasons for doing everything. For example, my purpose for healthy living isn't because it's trendy or wise to do. The motivation for it is to unleash my full potential so I can give 100% in everything I do, which includes creating my dream life. My benefits include: Serving others better in personal and professional settings.Having the courage to go after what is most important to me despite fears and doubts.Living a meaningful life aligned with my values.Experiencing more fulfillment and happiness independent of life\u2019s outcome.But for me to fully show up, I have to first take care of myself physically, emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually.  Feeling fulfilled and valued based on my definition of success, I can then truly give to others without expecting anything in return. Because my time is finite, I want to take complete advantage of every second I have. I don't want to squander the beautiful opportunity I call life. When the inevitable time comes as I lay on my deathbed, I will be smiling about the life I lived, instead of regretting the one I wished I had experienced. Having embraced life on my own terms, I will peacefully go to the grave with battle scars knowing I have fully lived. In my journey of self-discovery, I have learned not to fall into the trap of constantly \u201cchasing\u201d external factors to have significance or validation. It's an endless vicious path. I will never truly feel satisfied because I will always be wanting more. Nothing will ever be enough for me. Society is constantly bombarding me with things I need to buy to be \u201cenough.\u201d It's part of their marketing scheme to generate more revenue. The truth is this: I am and will always be enough right now. True fulfillment and happiness come from within. It starts when I see myself as high value and live a life true to me. I hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "What inspires me in life to do my best?  Like any individual, I have realized I have a particular task of which I am uniquely designed to accomplish. So until I do my best to reach my best potentials this cannot be accomplished. This has sparked an inner urge keeping me on to always be my best self, and permitted me not to settle for anything mediocre. On the higher side, these words of Ayn Rand, \"a creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others,\" always puts me up. These words liberate me from that desire to compete with others, to position my energies at the center of myself to develop my abilities. So in doing my best, I must always be my own competitor. I also find the following words of Steve Maraboli much inspiring; \"Do the best you can, with what you, while you can, and success is inevitable.\" I also make sure to always do what I love doing to keep my passion alive, and to deliver my best. \"When you love your work, you will be exceptionally diligent in what you do and you will excel in delivering both quality and quantity.\" \u2014Dr Prem Jagyasi These have been inspiring to do my best. But my best now is still not the best. So I must keep on, doing my best. ",
