            "answer_text": "There are two direct ways to earn money from Tik Tok. But, you must know that Tik Tok doesn\u2019t pay any money directly to the users or stars of the platform. The two ways as I mentioned before are: Live Stream: When you do live stream on Tik Tok, the viewers watching you can actually gift you money. Off course your content has to be worthwhile and liked by your viewers for them to pay you anything. The viewers don\u2019t send you direct cash, but digital gifts which you can convert into real cash pretty easily though. Tik Tok takes a 20% cut of that digital gift, just so that you know.Influencer: Just like Instagram, if you are popular enough on Tik Tok, brands can regard you as an influencer and pay you money for directly or indirectly advertising their product. I remember an instance when a single mention of a book during a telecast of the Oprah Winfrey show made that book a bestseller. Oprah surely was paid huge sum of money for that and you don\u2019t have to be that influential to earn money from Tik Tok either. Just make sure that you produce good content and have a decent following - that\u2019s the simple trick for becoming influential on Tik Tok.You can also try selling your own products or do affiliate marketing (Selling products of others for a commission) through Tik Tok as well, but it\u2019s not very straightforward. Tik Tok doesn\u2019t allow you to post links on your videos or bio, so the trick is to post a plain text of a webpage of your website and then promote the product or referral links through that webpage. Not very straightforward and not highly recommended either. ",

            "answer_text": "YES! According to this link, TikTok Money Calculator [Influencer Engagement & Earnings Estimator] Brands make deals with influencers, and prices can vary markedly depending on the circumstances. However, one thing is consistent in nearly all cases - Influencers get paid more if they have both a high engagement rate, as well as a high number of followers. Brands have learned that you can easily buy followers who are of no practical value to anybody. Hence, they are far more interested in you having genuine followers, those who interact with your posts. TikTok is currently trialing biddable ads, and this may change the way influencers can earn income on the platform in the future. According to Adweek, TikTok has told agency partners in the U.S. that it is working on a biddable advertising option on the platform. With biddable ads, advertisers will be able to bid against one another for the ad impressions they want on a self-managed platform. Presumably, TikTok will develop some form of ad revenue-sharing program in the same way that YouTube has. Obviously, the higher your engagement rate, the more successful brands will consider you, and the higher they will be willing to pay. It is difficult to find overall engagement rates for TikTok \u2013 all the published ones appear to wrongly equate engagement with the percentage of people opening the app once a day. However, like most social media networks you can calculate your individual TikTok engagement with the following formula: [(Number of hearts + number of comments)/number of followers] x100. You can calculate this either for a single post or overall. We suggest that you add together the figures for your last 20 posts when you make this calculation overall. *This was all copied from from the link above.* ",

            "answer_text": "While TikTok uses advertisements and sponsorships to earn money itself but you, the user, can\u2019t apply advertisements or anything like that to earn money on the platform. Also, TikTok doesn\u2019t pay you directly anything. Not even a single cent. So, the question arises:- How do TikTok stars get paid then? That question has three definite answers. Let\u2019s discuss all of them in detail now. Sponsorships (by being an influencer) This one was obvious, wasn\u2019t it? It\u2019s simple really. If you have tons of followers, then obviously you have a platform where people either look up to you or are your fans or just hold a high opinion of you. That all comes with having fans. Anyway, because of this following, now you\u2019re in a position to \u201cinfluence\u201d them. Say, a big company asks you to mention their product in your video. And when you do, suddenly, that brand gets credibility in the eyes of thousands (if not lakhs) of people. BECAUSE of you. This is a form of direct advertising. And trust me, just for a mere mention of their product, corporates would be willing to pay huge bucks! This is true for Instagram or Twitter as well. Apart from follower count, your engagement rate (comments or like to total no. of views ratio) also matters. Because that means people respond to your content when you post it and not just ignore it.  ",

So TikTok isn\u2019t actually paying them, the viewers are (although TikTok takes a cut). However, like with most social media platforms popular creators can choose to work with businesses to promote their products. For example, a popular creator could choose to work with a cosmetics brand and create short videos promoting the product in exchange for cash, a percentage of sales, or free products. This can also be done with affiliate links, which is where whenever someone purchases something through the link you post your receive a percentage of sales. This is the influencer marketing model that has been popular on a range of platforms for quite some time. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes , people make huge chunk of money on Tiktok! For that , you have to have a small follower base and a good engaging rate which shows that your auidence is interactive with all the videos you share on tiktok. In general , it is like to be a social media influencer where you are approached by a company or you approch them for promoting their products on a Tiktok Video. For this you can charge anywhere between from \u20b9500 to \u20b91,000\u20132,000\u20135,000 or anything you like based on your follower count and engagement rate. I guess for getting Sponsorship you May require more than 1k followers and your engagement rate should be more than 4% . This is my point of view of how these people who are so called famous on Tiktok make money. Other writers may agree or disagree ,this was my opinion. Thanks for reading. ",

Fortune recently published TikTok\u2019s 7 Highest-Earning Stars, detailing last year\u2019s income of the platform\u2019s top creators.  Addison Rae: $5 millionCharli D\u2019Amelio: $4 millionDixie D\u2019Amelio: $2.9 millionLoren Gray: $2.6 millionJosh Richards: $1.5 millionMichael Le: $1.2 millionSpencer X: $1.2 millionMany of the above creators also make money through other brand partnerships (or get paid in kind \u2013 i.e. with products) or from sales of their own products. Charli & Dixie D\u2019Amelio, for example, have launched a Morphe makeup line. To stimulate great video content creation and invest in its community, TikTok recently launched a Creator Fund (e.g. US: $1 billion, Europe: $70 million). Eligible creators can get about 2\u20133 cents per 1,000 video views. While this does not seem like much, if all of your videos get x million views, this can add up\u2026 Lastly, TikTok also lets you buy \u201cCoins\u201d which you can use to send Virtual Gifts to live streamers.

The only way to get paid as a TikTok star is as an \u201cinfluencer\u201d - promoting particular brands for example on your channel. This has only limited potential, I would advise using TikTok to build an email database of your followers - i.e. see behind the scenes footage by signing up to my email newsletter at http://www.tobyberesford.com or wherever. Then when you have you own email database you can promote as many products and services as you like without having to worry about any TikTok restrictions on promotion that may come in the future. ",
