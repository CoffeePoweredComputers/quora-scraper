The M series and A series launch by Samsung is a good move for targeting the mid range price. As per the requirement you can get the good specification in the above mention phones. Also other brands, Nokia - They are not seems active from last year although they launched lot of phone. ASUS - They also seems inactive during current time. They brought good mid range phone. LG and HTC - These brands are not even visible. So you cannot considerate. APPLE - Seriously, under 20000. NO WAY, I DON\u2019T BELONG HERE. Good Day ! ",

            "answer_text": "Apart from the Chinese brands we have samsung (south korea) Nokia (Finland) Asus (Taiwan) Motorola (American) But for mid range budget (20k) we don't have good phones in nokia, and asus Samsung and Motorola have great phones like Motorola one fusion plus (16999rs.) You get complete stock android experience with moto smartphones.Samsung galaxy M series and some A series phones ( M31, M30s, A50s, A30s, A21s, A50) with Samsung phones you are secured with Knox security.PS : I wish non-chinese brands realise the situation and get into Indian market. We also have other brands like Sony, but the problem with Sony is that it never releases phones in the mid range. The mid range section is captured by Chinese manufacturers. ",
