            "answer_text": "I unlocked my iPhone because it allows me to personalize it more. I use an AppStore called Cydia that has hundreds of free apps. I can watch movies on my phone that are not file type \".mp4.\" My home and sleep button on my phone are physically unresponsive so I have an app that allows me to use the screen in replacement for the buttons. I can personalize my home screen with different icons and add a fifth/sixth button to the stationary shortcuts at the bottom of the screen. Easier to customize ringtones. Better battery life. Same loading speed. I get all the perks of an iPhone and galaxy phone in one. If ever I am unsatisfied, it can be reversed and returned to normal state.  ",

I attached a video with more info.@  ",
