            "answer_text": "Before heading onto functions let us shortly know about what is software asset management.Software Asset Management is the business strategy for reclaiming budget and maximizing savings by actively controlling and automating procurement, usage, and deployment of software licenses. Wherever you are in the process of implementing Software Asset Management (SAM) in your business, it will provide you all the vital information to help you go further, quickly and easily. 3 key areas to succeed at SAM- 1. Licenses: the SAM foundation Licenses are assets that need to be managed. Each license contains specific conditions for how the software product can be installed and used. As a user, your job is to make sure your company is compliant with the terms and conditions of the license agreement. Compliance is the bedrock of SAM. Software vendors don\u2019t want you to use more software than you licensed. Even though SAM is much bigger than compliance, compliance is where license management becomes an essential part of your business strategy. And it\u2019s the first goal for most companies when starting SAM. 2. Audits: a licensing health check To check whether you are compliant, vendors will perform software compliance audits to see how their software is being used, how it\u2019s configured, and whether your licenses cover all of it. There are two possible outcomes of an audit: either you\u2019re compliant, or you\u2019re not. Non-compliance can result in unexpected fees, which, if you\u2019re not careful, can cost you big. An audit also disrupts your business and can take months to complete without license management technology to support the process. 3. Optimization: strategies for lean licensing Often businesses are over-compliant simply because they have more licenses than they need. They prefer to over-pay upfront to outsmart the audit risk. So, while they aren\u2019t losing a ton of money at once for failing an audit, they are losing it slowly. It may not hurt at first, but over time being over-licensed costs more than failing an audit. When you fail an audit, you buy just enough licenses to close the gap, and often vendors demand you pay back-maintenance for the licenses too. It\u2019s expensive, but the problem is a one-time cost \u2014 that can also be reduced or completely eliminated with SAM strategies. 5 most crucial functions of SAM- 1. Cost savings: Like winning the lottery With a full overview of your environment and your software needs, you know exactly what you\u2019re using and exactly what you need. So you purchase the right licenses from the start, saving you money on maintenance fees, and helping to ensure compliance. In fact, you can reduce your licensing costs up to 30%. 2. Time savings: License management, lightning fast Organizing your licenses and setting up SAM processes will save your time: Have a central database of your licensing terms and conditions, making it easier and quicker to get the information you need to make better software purchasing and IT budgeting decisions.Be able to respond to audit letters within days instead of weeks.Transparency means you can respond quicker to problems, sometimes even before they arise.3. Automation: No more heavy lifting Nothing says effortless like automation. Automating your processes frees you up to concentrate on other things. With alerts and regular reports, you don\u2019t need to spend time watching out for problems and looking for areas to save. Just to name a few examples a Software Asset Management tool can automate: Alerting you to over usage and non-complianceInforming you about high-risk configurationsSuggesting optimization optionsFilling software requests with existing licensesSimulating your data center architecture and the resulting licensing costs4. Software License Optimization: Make smarter decisions. Reap the benefits. When you know what you have and use, you can go beyond compliance. You can compare your licenses. See what license schemes are possible and make the most sense in your environment\u2014while easily keeping an eye on cost. You can negotiate better agreements that meet your business needs at a killer price. Or have you wanted to optimize your software portfolio, cleaning up unauthorized products and packaging software for deployment? With SAM you have the data and transparency to do this. 5. Strategy: Plan ahead. Watch the competition follow. SAM gives you transparency into your current and past software needs. This in turn gives you valuable insights into your software future. It can help you plan in advance on multiple levels from data center architectures to budgets and service-charging. There are strategic benefits for every department in the company. Nothing is certain but death, taxes, and audits Software vendors use audits to increase revenue. Complicated licensing metrics mean that without smart tools, you\u2019re at risk for an audit. So even when you\u2019re not purchasing new software or increasing your spend with a vendor, audits are a good way to get more money out of the customers. All the big vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP have a business unit dedicated to performing audits. They are well-staffed and well-prepared. You should be, too. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many great advantages of asset management software. Good Business Practice. Asset management results in better decisions. Aligning management of infrastructure with strategic policies and direction will support the long-term success of the utility\u2019s mission, goals and objectives.Improved Regulatory Compliance. For wastewater utilities in particular, the proposed CMOM regulations will require improved asset management. Part of asset management involves the implementation of better O&M practices, which can significantly improve compliance.Improved Reliability. More structured day-to-day attention to system assets and their condition means that unexpected failures are less likely, thus minimizing emergency repairs, costly lawsuits and customer relations problems. Assessing the risk implications of asset failure helps focus resources on critical priorities and reduces overall risk to the utility.Long Term System Integrity. The concept of \u201csustainable infrastructure\u201d is gaining increased visibility, probably due to the problems in many American cities and towns where sufficient reinvestment in infrastructure has not been made. By relating costs to asset condition and conducting long term planning for each asset, policy makers get the facts they need to help sustain the infrastructure.Cost Savings. There is evidence that asset management systems that maintain infrastructure in a sound and reliable condition and are based on minimizing life cycle costs, can significantly reduce operating and maintenance cost, as well as long-term capital expenses. A life cycle approach means that the utility always gets the most assets for its money.Eligibility for Federal Funding. The apparent need for increased infrastructure spending coupled with concerns over the quality of infrastructure management prevalent in the industry have led to a range of provisions in proposed funding legislation that include requirements for \u201casset management plans.\u201d",
