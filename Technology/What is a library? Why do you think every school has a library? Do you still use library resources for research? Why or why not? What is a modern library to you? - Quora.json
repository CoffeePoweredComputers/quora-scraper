            "answer_text": "What is a library? It is a collection of carefully curated materials, and it is the staff who gathers and curates these materials. It\u2019s a place (or Web site) people can go to for help with the firehose of information that opens up whenever they try to find information. The collection is important but, in the end, perhaps not vital, as long as there\u2019s a librarian to help find the piece of information needed. If someone asks me to help with some research, and I\u2019m away from our collection at work and my own collection of bookmarks, I can still get on a computer and do a professional-quality search on Google and other search engines, and should be able to come up with something helpful. Unfortunately, not every school does have a library, but every school needs one (the collection and the professional(s)) to help the teachers teach and the children learn. I haven\u2019t had to do any research beyond just for fun recently, but when I last did need to do something, I did use my local library in addition to the Internet. Not all books have been digitized (and not all ever will), so if you actually need to read the book or article and it\u2019s behind a paywall, your library will almost certainly be able to get it for you. It may cost a small fee, but it can be done. A modern library (and this is from the point of view of someone working in a large federal science library) is the place that you find what you need, and the people who help you find it. We have a large staff (not all librarians) of professional database searchers, who can sniff out obscure materials because they have the backing and funding of the library and of the organization in general. Public libraries have large, networked collections, on and off site, where people can get help with information on any topic, and where people can find a good book to read and a good place to read it. School libraries start kids out with the simplest information (my first lesson to a class of kindergarteners was how to handle a book, without tearing or bending the pages, etc.), and, in concert with teachers, parents, and other groups, help them become readers and learn to do the kind of research they\u2019ll need in college, by the time they graduate. Law libraries help the lawyers and associates find the fine points of law and the important precedents they need to win their cases. Hospital libraries support the medical and nursing staffs with information on conditions and diseases they may not see all the time, so they can help the patients heal, or deal with the fact that they can\u2019t be healed. Corporate libraries support the needs of research and development, and also help the directors and officers keep up with the latest management trends. There are lots of other kinds of libraries, but I think you see my theme: whoever you are, and whatever you need, the library is the place where you can find it, or find out *how* to find it. Did that answer your question? ",

            "answer_text": "Wow- there are so many questions there and the answers would really vary. So what is a library. Well the best way I can explain that is to say that a library means something different to almost everyone. To completely understand that, I would suggest visiting several libraries and just watching the patrons. While many may do similar activities at the library, it will mean something different to each one. Do I think every school should have a library- the simple answer is yes. But there cannot just be a library in the school. The school district needs to provide money for someone to staff the library AND for new material for the library. Those two factors become issues at many schools today, there may be a physical space called the library but there needs to be more. Do you still use the library for research? Of course I do. And I encourage the local students to use us as well. Library staff can assist patrons on finding the material that they really want and show them tricks on how to weed through the huge amounts of internet information to find information that is correct. What is a modern library to me\u2026.. It is a community space where the community goes to learn, find entertainment, connect and grow. ",
