After reading this answer you will get doubt regarding correction of stocks.Lengthy answer pls bare with me. The best thing learned from recent corrections from Indian market is, we are finest buy on dips markets for at least next 10 years guys, don't get dishearten by corrections at all, use it as buying opportunity again on dips, we are growing as nation, will continue that irrespective of any party running the country, temporary dips may come but is just for buying, stocks which have multibbager returns in the past will again give Multibagger returns in the future too, kindly don't worry and believe in Indian growth story, every wealth creator from Indian stock market is a person who believed in growth for future too irrespective of downfalls coming which is most integral part of markets, so why not we? We should, stay with stocks, we are in 2019 now and 2022/2025/2030 will be more than awesome than this, will be more progressive than this, people investing in markets are more than current numbers, so why we are worried now? We should believe in India as market, we should stay invested with stocks, and we will make more returns what people use get earlier, Don't worry, I find equity markets are best innovations in the world just our psychology plays damn important part in it so why we should loose with it, we should develop with it, After 5-10-15 years, people would have more medical problems, more requirement of cars/bikes, more requirement of technology (Information technology), more requirement of everything with 130++CR population, so why worry now? Stay invested, we are growing and will keep growing and equity investments turn out to be best investments ever, So why worry about dips? Let them come more, we can utilize them more, anyhow I think markets are not going to shut at least next 100 years Learn and Earn Warm regards C.prakash ",
