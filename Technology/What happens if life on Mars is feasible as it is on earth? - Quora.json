            "answer_text": "The question is a real interesting one and it mixes my imaginations and feelings while trying to answer a question like this. There can be many possible scenarios in while life could be feasible on Mars except the fact the all of them triggers directly or indirectly the same outcome for the fate of Mars. Let's imagine a condition when this deep secret of Martian surface was unknown to human for many years. Only after sending the first probe to Mars human suddenly came to know that the Martian atmosphere is quite breathable with high quantity of oxygen and traces of carbon dioxide. The surface is mostly land mass which is reddish in color due to presence of high oxide content. There are also few water structures like lakes and rivers, which are filled with water contaminate with several minerals. The far stretched landscapes are deserted, however patches near the water bodies are indeed covered with vegetation, which are mostly radish in color. They are capable of photosynthesis due to presence of traces of chlorophyll in their huge leaves. There are also small animals which mostly resemble reptiles and amphibians and also fishes in the water bodies, however no birds. Also, there is a huge population of insects of varying sizes and some of them are larger than those on earth. Also, there is no intelligent life form like human on earth.  Then, human sends some more proves to Mars and after few decades of research they confirms that there is actually plenty of water underground the Martian surface, which although contaminated, can be filtered out for hydration purposes. Also, the soil can be fertilised to grow crops, not actual crops which we grow on earth, but their Martian versions after genetically combining them with Martian vegetations. The atmosphere is all right for breathing and sufficient green house gases can be produced in order to make the temperature warmer. Special training can be supplied to cope with the law gravity conditions and survival instincts. Measures can be taken for the forestation of few land areas and crops can be cultivated by using ground water.  The next step would be sending human to Mars and colonizing there. Major economic countries like India, China and US would be among the first to send human to Mars. These countries would come together to collaborate rather than sending individuals missions for such big projects and it would result in huge scientific gatherings starting from Physicists, Biologists to Chemists. With few decades of careful design and techniques, human would be ready for its first colonisation outside the earth and most fortunately (which is not going to happen) on the very next planet to earth. This project would get very high appreciate and hope for all humanity and most probably many of the countries would have risen the funding towards the science cutting funding towards armed forces. It would seem like human has got a new reason for existence.  Soon, human would colonize some places on Mars and carry on research work on many aspects of science there, including the space above Martian atmosphere. The colonized civilians would mainly consist of Scientists, Engineers, Dostors and Farmers and they will avoid any mistakes that would ruin the Mars and its environment. The coming future will witness many scientific and technological advancement of human race including many more colonisation in satellites of Jupiter and Saturn and exoplanets around many other stars.
