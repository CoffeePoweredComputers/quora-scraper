            "answer_text": "1. Auto detailing Have a meticulous eye for detail and love to get things gleaming clean? Auto detailing is probably a perfect side business for you. In essence, your job is to make cars sparkle inside and out \u2013 and many people are quite happy to pay well for this service. 2.Rent out a room in your home Have some extra space in your home? Turn that extra bedroom into a \u201cbed and breakfast\u201d room. If you live near any sort of tourist destination, you can try your hand at renting out a room through Airbnb or Meet and Stay with Locals All Over the World. You may also find paid hosting opportunities in your community: Sign up to host exchange students, visiting professors to a nearby college, or hospital patients receiving long-term treatment. 3.Blogging If you enjoy writing, find a topic you\u2019re passionate about and start a website dedicated to covering that topic and anything else interesting you want to talk about. All you need is a computer, some time, and some energy to consistently write. It can start as a hobby and turn into a business over time. And blog hosting can cost less than $12 per month. 4. Buying and reselling on eBay Thanks to technology, there are more opportunities than ever to buy and resell products for extra money. Plenty of people buy local and in-demand products at a discount and resell them on eBay for profit. 5.Freelance writing If you\u2019re good with words, you might be able to find some work as an online freelancer. A variety of publications need online content in the form of stories, product or service descriptions, and reports, and if you have the talent and skill, you could easily be the one to create them. Fortunately, all you need is a computer and Internet connection to get started. 6.Social media expert Almost everyone uses Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest these days, but did you know that many companies will pay people to help them manage their social media accounts \u2014 sometimes even part-time from home? To find social media jobs, you can start by contacting businesses with a social media presence and scanning sites like Upwork, the world's largest online workplace for opportunities. 7.Start a construction business Similarly, a construction business could be a great fit for someone who enjoys hands-on work. While you\u2019ll probably need to complete either an apprenticeship or a trade program to get started, if you\u2019re already an amateur or have worked construction in the past (or simply have interest in seeking the education), this might be a great fit. 8.Start a sewing and alterations business If you enjoy sewing, you might like a business specializing in altering or repairing garments. While you don\u2019t need a specific degree or training, you\u2019ll need a certain level of skill to get started with this one. However, if you\u2019re already a great sewer, an alteration business could be a great fit. 9.Start an accounting business Do you enjoy bookkeeping, preparing taxes, and generally managing money? Consider starting an accounting business. However, unlike many suggestions on this list, becoming an accountant and opening your own firm will require the right education. 10.Start a financial planning business Like starting an accounting business, you\u2019ll want to look into the requirements for starting a financial planning business. However, if you have a background in finance, or would like to pursue the schooling, starting a financial planning business might be the right small business idea for you. 11.Start a personal training business If you\u2019re into some aspect of fitness, a personal training business could be a great small business idea. From general fitness coaching to becoming an instructor (think Zumba or Pilates)\u2014if you\u2019re more motivational than Chris Traeger from Parks and Rec, a personal training business might be a successful route for you. After all, the best business ideas for you will be the ones that play to your strengths. Bear in mind that like many options on this list, you\u2019ll need certification. NASM, ACE, and ACSM are a few of the most common and well-respected certifications, but the path you choose will depend on your specific focus. 12.Start a life coaching business Did you successfully navigate a difficult situation against all odds, and come out stronger on the other side? Do you see the best in people, and want to help them reach their full potential? If so, you could consider building a small business around life coaching. 13.Start an editing and proofreading business Similarly, editing and proofreading services are always needed, and would make a great small business idea. You can begin by taking on freelance work, and go from there. 14.Start a photography business If you\u2019ve got a great eye and are always the one who documents special moments, you might want to consider making a career out of your photography passion. While the competition is pretty stiff, specializing in a specific area, such as pet photography, weddings, or portraits can help set you apart. 15.Start a consulting firm Similar to teaching a class based on your skills, you may want to evaluate what you currently excel at, and see if it would make a good consulting business. Consulting firms exist covering a huge variety of topics, from business, to IT, to public relations, and more. Live and breathe social media? Start a social media consulting business, helping businesses leverage their social presence. You get the idea. ",

            "answer_text": "You don't want to work for somebody else? You don't like your boss at all? You want your upside to be unlimited? You want a freedom to make your own decisions and mistake? Starting your own business is the pavement towards all of that. There are many different reasons and benefits from starting your own small business. However, I think what holds people back from actually taking the risk is the fear of not being successful. To this, I'd say - So what? You will try again and eventually you will get where you are headed. Small businesses, in my opinion, are such a smart idea. And today, there are hundreds of small business ideas everyone can start today. Here's my list: Virtual RealityBecoming the huge hit at is it, people will pay more and more to be able to experience what virtual reality products are offering. The industry is growing day by day and the potential use of VR products is practically limitless. For example, you can start selling some of these products such as 3D movies, virtual reality games, social media VR interactions and different kinds of training.  Services for kidsI do think people underestimate the importance of this kind of services. There is a huge amount of opportunities in lots of different areas in the children's service market that we often neglect or don't see as a potential working business. There are tons of things you can actually profit from such as art/ creative classes and events, preschool education, fitness/meditation for kids, outdoor exploring etc, you name it.  Home DecorBeing the busy people that we all are, we often cannot find time to decor our homes when moving or renovating. Therefore, if you are a creative individual and have a sense of decorating interiors, you should definitely go for it. I bet it won't feel like a job at all.  Therapy and counselingMental health is so important. The demand for this kind of services has increased significantly over the past few years. This means that if you have the knowledge and you have a passion for listening and helping people make good life choices then I suggest opening a private practice. This kind of job requires extensive schooling and a graduate degree, but it still is a small business that makes changes in people's lives.  Coffee ShopThe good old coffee shop idea is probably one of the best small business ideas that ever existed. People never have enough coffee, and if you happen to make it good and offer them snacks with it- you have won. Your own coffee shop can be packed with customers from day one if you know how to properly advertise and manage it. You will definitely need a convenient location for the vehicles, you will have to offer a cozy and pleasant atmosphere, serve high-quality beverages and snacks and not the try to compete with others. If hospitality and coffee are your passion, why not make them your business opportunity?  ",
