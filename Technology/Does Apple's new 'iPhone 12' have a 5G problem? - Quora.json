            "answer_text": "The iPhone 12 hasn\u2019t been announced, and while it is widely believed that it will be announced tomorrow that means we know basically nothing about it. We don\u2019t know if it will be called the iPhone 12. We don\u2019t know if it will support 5G. We don\u2019t know which of the many different kinds of 5G it supports (if any!). We don\u2019t know if Apple will make a big deal out of 5G, or downplay it (\u201cit has 5G so it\u2019ll still be a great phone years from now when 4G goes away\u201d) In my opinion 5G itself has a manor problem. Several actually: 5G comes in many flavors and people think they get all the advantages of all of them all the time. They don\u2019t.Some 5G is faster the 4G, but the \u201cfast kind\u201d has extremely limited range and penetration\u2026\u201dwhy is 5G fast in my kitchen, but slow in the living room?\u201dSome 5G uses super low power and can let you build a cellular tracker that runs 5x as long as a 4G tracker\u2026but that 5G is also dog slowsome 5G has super long range, but again is slowsome has super short range which is ideal to solve the \u201clast 100ft\u201d problem for a fixed wireless provider\u2026but it doesn\u2019t work well for phonesPeople think it will be \u201cfaster\u201d like LTE/4G was faster then 3G & 3G was faster then 2G and edge\u2026and 5G can be faster (see above). People also forget why that use to matter. Pre 3G cell data networks were basically the dancing bear. It was amazing that it worked, because you never expected it to. It was really too slow to use for much of anything though. When 3G showed up it was useable, mostly. As long as a website didn\u2019t have too many pictures. Video was right out nopety nope. With 4G video is just fine. You can stream movies and it is great. So where do you go from there? What is actually slow on hit cellular network? When you switch between WiFi and cellular do you notice? If WiFi doesn\u2019t wow you with speed on something you care about you won\u2019t get that feeling from 5G even if you are lucky and get \u201cthe fast kind\u201d. That is 5G\u2019s 5G problem. I expect if Apple launches a phone with 5G that they won\u2019t step in it and actually rely on 5G to be a big deal. Marketing will be pushing something else in the new phones. A new look of it has one would be a far bigger deal! Amendum: ok, this answer didn\u2019t exactly age well. The technical parts are all ok, but as it turns out Apple did lean into 5G on its advertising. Go figure. ",
