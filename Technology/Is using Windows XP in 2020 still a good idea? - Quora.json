            "answer_text": "Depends. Here are some use cases where Windows XP is still being successfully used in 2020: Car repair shops. Old, rugged diagnostic laptops with time-relevant diagnostic software, which are still running Windows XP. These machines are kept in stores for their compatibility with cars from that era. Also, software from that era works on them and might not work on newer systems. These laptops are often not even connected to internet, and even if they are, they aren\u2019t used to do anything internet-ey except the diagnostics software validating it\u2019s own license. This use is relatively safe.Hospitals. Medical equipment has been developed, tested, certified and delivered with specific operating system and nobody, not even hospital staff, is allowed to do anything about it, except to buy new ones. Lifetime of this equipment is often in decades, so the usual practice is to have them either completely disconnected from hospital infrastructure, operating on their own, or have them in a DMZ or completely separate infrastructure without internet access, or with specific internet access. This tends to be a problem in countries with socialistic healthcare model, as they usually run their salaries based on a government-approved rates and no capable IT technicians want to work for them. This resulted in a mass outage of Czech Brno hospital of 2020, where a ransomware attacks cleared out entire hospital network and medical records of more than 250.000 people. Incompetent IT staff then spent over a month to make the hospital able to receive patients again.Factories. Factory floors and automation processes in general, once they work, are not touched unless broken. You can often see photos from Chinese production plants running Windows XP, because the system is lightweight and capable by today\u2019s standards even. These floors are usually completely disconnected from outside world and so the use of time-proven OS is warranted.As you can see, XP can still provide some value to you if used properly and this will go on into 2030s as well. If XP is not being used, the Server 2000 and 2003 editions are still being used in government infrastructures, ATMs, etc. I would not recommend to use it for general purpose use, however. Even if you have old laptop laying around which you might want to dedicate to internet browsing, I would still not recommend doing this, as it will most definitely not be able to run videos in browser (it\u2019s GPU being unable to decode modern video codecs) and it\u2019s CPU being unable to render more complex websites such as Facebook anyway.

            "answer_text": "My experience with XP is given below. I am a Windows user since 98SE edition and have been loving XP for 2 decades and still use it. As primary OS. My current system is an HP Mini laptop with 2 GB Ram, 1.6 GHZ Intel Atom processor. I have successfully installed Windows XP with SATA support and working fine. Most of my day to day works including online browsing, word file editing, excel and other common task i am doing on my XP system. Browsing internet without any issues. Apart from XP i have installed Fedora Linux XFCE editiion , Windows 10 and Android X86. However my primary OS choice is still XP. Linux mint was installed however i removed and moved to Fedora. In 2020, You would need 2 critical things to make your system secure. A powerfull Antivirus and a Firewall. There are no free known antivirus supporting XP. Even if you see AVG, Panda or Comodo they wont protect your PC as the version is old. My suggestions to Antivirus and Firewall are below. My system got infected with a virus running Panda from USB. So use the below suggetions. For firewall i am using Zone Alarm Free Firewall from Check point software. For Antivirus i am using Norton Antivirus version 22.15 which was release in 2017. You need an active subscription for it which i have already have by paid. Coming to browsing internet, Chrome and Firefox already stopped supporting and latest Chrome browser available for XP is version 49. In my experience Chrome and Chromium and Firefox even old versions still works. You will get a popup saying the support ended. you can ignore. There is an unofficial chinese version of chrome available known as chrome 36o but i dont recommend. It is based on version 78. Mypal browser based on Firefox still works on XP. CCCleaner the well known cleaning software also dropped support. I have office 2010 running smooth on XP As soon as you install XP install Antivirus and firewall then connect to update.microsoft.com using Internet Explorer and download all updates including critical optional and every thing. Store your important files in online cloud storage services like OneDrive, Google drive etc. You can access those websites using Chrome and upload documents to it. Never connect an unknown USB drive. If you follow all security process you can use XP unlimited time. No issues. Side by side if you like install a modern OS like Linux Mint or even Windows 10 if your system can afford. ",
