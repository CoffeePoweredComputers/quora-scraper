            "answer_text": "First, it\u2019s very important to define terms. When someone usually says \u201cDestroy the Earth,\u201d they usually mean making it so that no life can ever exist on Earth ever again. To do that, you\u2019d have to make the planet completely uninhabitable. There\u2019s many ways you can go about doing this if you have the right technology, but fortunately, none of these ways are currently available to humans. It would have to involve destroying the moon, wiping out the atmosphere, or even simply moving the planet out of the habitable zone of Sol. There is currently no technology that can do such a thing. But wait, I can hear you asking yourself. What about Nukes? The nuclear warhead is easily one of the most destructive and deadly things Humankind has ever devised. Surely, those can destroy the Earth? Fortunately, no. While nuclear explosions are indeed very powerful, in order to blow up something as big as the planet Earth, you\u2019d need a bomb with at least 53,000,000,000,000,000 (Quadrillion) Megatons of explosive force. Given that there are currently 35,000 Nukes on earth, and each large scale single warhead has on average 5.2 Megatons of force, that would mean that the total Nuclear stockpile of the entire planet is only capable of putting out 186,000 Megatons of explosive force. So that rules out blowing up the planet, but what about the environment? Nuclear fallout is deadly, and can be devastating to the surroundings, right? Very true. Nuclear radiation can kill many on Earth. But there are some species that have evolved resistance or even immunity to radiation. Those species being rats, cockroaches, and waterbears. There are possibly others that we have yet to discover. So while it\u2019s true that a nuclear armageddon would destroy all human life on Earth, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean all life on Earth would end, as there would still be life after the bombs drop. Perhaps enough life would survive to evolve into something new, a completely new species that would eventually be at our technology level, and have the same issues as we currently have. Even if every nuke on Earth went off all at once, it would still not be enough to force the atmosphere to clear the gravitational pull of the planet. The Nuclear arsenal of Earth isn\u2019t powerful enough to overcome nature, and generally speaking, natural disasters are far more destructive than nuclear explosions. But what about moving the Earth out of it\u2019s habitable zone? Nukes simply don\u2019t have enough force to do even that. If every nuclear warhead on Earth were stuck in one spot, and detonated, it might, MIGHT move the Earth a tiny fraction out of the Sun\u2019s orbit. But gravity being what it is, the Earth would simply return to it\u2019s original orbit in a matter of days. So in summary, can humanity and it\u2019s technology destroy the Earth? No. Will the Earth eventually be destroyed? Yes, but at this time, I doubt humanity will have a hand in it. ",

            "answer_text": "Technologically yes, even though the cost would be huge and what would be the point? We can choose one or more huge asteroids and push them slowly towards an orbit that collides with the earth.We could also, at huge costs and a lot of time, slow down the moon and the more it slows down the closer it gets to the earth, until a collision happens.So technologically would be 100% possible but the costs would be insanely high and it wouldn\u2019t happen in a short time.
