            "answer_text": "For purposes of this question, I define gardening as something you do on a small scale, part time. I define farming as full time work. I\u2019m a real farmer, born and bred, university trained, old and retired. I loved it but I never made even half as much money as a skilled worker can make working forty PLUS benefits. So I spent half my life working off the farm as a mechanic, welder, small contractor, teacher, etc. I kept going back to the farm, lol, because I loved the lifestyle and freedom to starve on my own terms. Now it\u2019s not that you CAN\u2019T ever make some money farming. It\u2019s simply that if you have money enough to own a decent COMPETITIVELY sized and equipped farm these days, you don\u2019t need to work anyway. In that case, you can invest a few hundred thousand on up to a couple of million or so into some land and a few cows and maybe a couple of saddle horses to impress your friends from the city. If you REALLY do want to raise corn, wheat, soybeans, cows, apples, etc, figure on a few million for land and at least another half a million for second hand equipment\u2026\u2026.. assuming you have EXCELLENT mechanical skills. Otherwise, double or triple that for new equipment. If you think you want to farm, drop whatever else it is you are doing and find yourself a job working on a farm for a full year. Then figure out how you will support yourself, buy land, buy equipment and expendables, hire help, find customers, and deal with the never ending GAMBLE involving the weather and the markets. It\u2019s extremely hard to make a living farming even if you are already experienced and already HAVE a farm. Now as far as GARDENING goes, go for it, because that doesn\u2019t mean giving up your job, lol. HAVING SAID ALL THIS\u2026\u2026\u2026 A few people who are in exactly the right spot, and have excellent marketing skills, can make a living raising various crops and selling them direct to the public or high end retail stores or restaurants. But ALMOST every farmer has to sell into the wholesale market. That means you get maybe forty cents or fifty cents a pound for the apples that you grow which sell in supermarkets for two bucks and up. ",
