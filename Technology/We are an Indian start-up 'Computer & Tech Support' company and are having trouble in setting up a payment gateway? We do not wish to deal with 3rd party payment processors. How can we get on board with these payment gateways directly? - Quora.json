            "answer_text": "Hey there, Are you still searching for a Credit Card Processing Solution for your Tech Support company? Great, we can help! But first, there are a few things you need to be careful of: Even though the Tech Support industry still remains a fantastic industry to grow a huge company, getting approved for an actual merchant account has become nearly impossible. You see, most banks across the United States are no longer willing to provide Tech Support merchant accounts because of the high chargebacks that are commonly associated with this industry. And that\u2019s not your only problem. You will soon find out that there are an unlimited amount of sales people that will all promise you that they can get your company approved for a merchant account. (But they can not.) And, usually these people receive commissions just for getting applications filled out by potential tech support company owners. Wow! These sales representatives get paid even though they know full well that 99.9% of the time that can not get you a merchant account. Listen up! These people are going to waste your valuable time. And you don\u2019t have time to waste. And don\u2019t even think about contacting Paypal, FirstData or Authorize dot net! They are all great companies, but based on the last 500 owners I\u2019ve talked to, you will be rejected instantly! We have a better option for you. It works, and it works 100% of the time!

Though I might be new to the venture but with an exp. in IT and business. Here are some pointers I felt you must know; 1) Signup with legitimate companies with proper background check for India and abroad 2) Company formation documents 3) Go with companies who not only offer a 3rd party / only gateway but also can provide Lead generation (calls, email, chat), CRM, Agreement Process 4) Do not run behind fake calls and call providers, try running a legitimate process. It works for long without issues. 5) Do not make CB's on other companies - since you know its one of your own Indian companies, it can happen to you as well very easily. 6) Look for processes that has more scope of service than the usual ones. 7) Reselling / Selling Hardware, software on site services in Tech Process within the country /state should as well be complimented along with services. 8) Multiple processors should be used along with multiple gateways to avoid overload on accounts. In short all these services will only be provided by someone who has legitimate company in India and Abroad as to avoid any nuisance on gateway/company/co-owner in India or Abroad. We provide all the above services and I am sure there will be many more if you keep looking for the right company/person. ",
