            "answer_text": "Some phone companies provide your communications to government. Maybe not content. But you put content in the clouds, air, wired to another phone, it is out there somewhere. You have no control any longer. Most the \u201cWait\u201d while we reconfigure your computer from who knows what and who knows where and who knows what they are doing\u2026amazes me. At least I can't see their actions. One time a black screen.. and I tried to escape.. it said Wait while we read your computer content. What? It flashed the sign off\u2026 but still I could not even emergency shut down. No more modem telephone wires to unplug. No more secrets. No more battery packs to remove.. apps running under apps we don't see.. phones and more requiring your first born child to get service.. you and everyone else is out there, after the first few computers. It's a definate plan between hardware and the powers that want your information. Daily I get new screen photos I did not put on my computer. Someone is in there. Shop for an item.. they will be on your screen for sometime later. You and every politician has to know.. no more secrets. China wants your new item to copy and sell.. or photo.. they will. Smart kids helping people getting slaughtered in foreign countries to have any computer service, deserve credit\u2026wonderful, but credit who when Hollywood used their name for fiction TV shows.. no more finding the real issues. Don't put sensitive items in electronics. ",
