            "answer_text": "They're completely possible. But in what context? And for how long? Those can be game changers tight there. For long distance to work, there has to be a strong sense of commitment and faith present in both partners. Absence doesn't quite make the heart grow fonder, so that's where commitment and faith step up to glue the relationship together. It can be tough, though. You won't be able to embrace each other physically often, and you won't be able to perform any romantic gestures in person either. Will both of you be able to handle the wait to see each other in person again, or will the wait get to one of you first? A long distance relationship is basically a normal relationship minus everything in person, yet you're still expected to uphold the bond somehow. It's difficult and takes immense desire to remain a couple despite the distance in between. But if the sense of commitment and feelings that a couple feels for each other is strong, a long distance relationship is completely possible, and may prove to be very well worth it in the end if it survives. You can think of it as a long term investment with a large return in the end.   Together forever and never apart. Maybe in distance, but never in heart.  - Nicole Buckland P.S.

            "answer_text": "Long distance relationships are often complicated. I truly think it depends on your situation, but what I will say is long distance is usually possible if the distance is temporary. Essentially, if the long distance aspect is temporary, such as you are waiting to move out to him/her or vice versa. For example, if y\u2019all are at different colleges per say, but eventually one will move to the other, I would say there is a very good chance it could work out. However, long distance shouldn\u2019t be permanent, if neither or you have any plans on ending up in the same place, then it most likely will not work out. Eventually, trying to stay in contact while never actually being together will get exhausting. Humans need humans. If the long distance is permanent, someone will probably move on. Hope this helps, God bless. ",

We actually had been in our own separate relationships for 3 to 4 years, around the same time. Last year in January we started talking a lot more and playing games together every day. Feelings developed, and we ended up meeting in real life for the first time on my birthday in September. Now we see each other every weekend even though we live ~35 miles apart. (I understand that's not a comparable distance to most LDR couples, but any amount of distance puts a strain on relationships). We have our moments; it's stressful not being able to see him during the week, because of work, but we maintain open communication and honesty to keep our relationship healthy. ",

Look at the two sides of the story and communicate with each other as much as possible. It also depends of the type of relationship you are having if its either a long distance relationship which let me tell you i've been in one for 7 years or you are living together etc.. It can also get complicated because of all this social media going on now a days its terrible .  ",

It takes constant communication, trust, honesty, true caring or true love, and plans to see one another at some point. If you are true friends and know your partner and how he thinks, you can keep a relationship going, It\u2019s when you may judge one another of trust that it can go bad on you! Yes, LDR are very possible! If you can deal with the absence of him or her, it can work out for you! It is not easy! But possible! ",
