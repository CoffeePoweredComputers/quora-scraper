            "answer_text": "No, they do not. But only if you look at the bigger picture. This has been one of the greatest delusions over time. The same fear appeared during the Industrial Revolution when machines where destroyed by workers who feared unemployment.They mainly feared that machines will replace humans and this seems to be the same problem now with computers. Think of how many jobs the invention of machines has in fact produced. Instead of local manufacturers we now have huge factories with far more workers. Think of how many people actually work in order to supply the factory with materials or deliver the products.  In the same way, computers will either help people in their jobs or replace people. Even if people will be replaced in a particular job, more jobs will exist for creating those computers, for developing and supervising them. In the long run, it will improve efficiency and therefore productivity. Because businesses will thrive, they will probably expand and therefore offer new employment opportunities. Even if the producer decides to spend the money in other way, there will still be an industry benefiting from it.It is important not to forget that, at least at first, there will be some unemployed workers.  It all depends on their capacity to adapt to the change and thus search for employment opportunities in the right place, maybe by trying to train in a different field. ",

            "answer_text": "No. This is not to deny that some people have lost their jobs to computerization, but other people have found jobs, and have been enabled to earn livings at different kinds of jobs, because of computers and the Internet. Computers are not the basic cause of unemployment. Back in Tudor England, there was an unemployment problem, with upper class Englishmen complaining of \"sturdy beggars,\" despite the absence of computers, cheap imports from China, and other things sometimes blamed for unemployment today. Then, it was easy to see why people were out of work: landowners had turned them out of their homes and villages, because the landowners could get more money from grazing sheep on the land than by collecting rents from peasants. In modern times, it's more complicated, but in the end, we still need land to live, and we still have a problem with high land rents and land prices making it impossible for people to afford land to live and work on. This applies to city land as much as to agricultural land; if some speculator is sitting on a vacant lot in the city that could be used for a factory or an apartment building, then the people who could have jobs building the factory or the apartment building, and then working on the site, are deprived of employment. When a bubble in land prices finally bursts, and people default on their mortgages and other loans, this triggers a financial crisis, as happened ten years ago. The solution, I believe, is to tax land according to its value (not just its acreage), and reduce or eliminate other taxes, from the property tax on buildings to income tax, sales tax, and payroll tax. That would remove obstacles to people getting work, and providing for themselves and their families, and would give land speculators an urgent incentive to put their land to good use. With more efficient use of urban and suburban land, we wouldn't have the same pressure to expand into the clean and green countryside, and people wouldn't usually have such long commutes. ",

Truely they offer so many employment from normal people to high-tech workers. Just imagine ,if the need of computers are high then it results to manufacturing more computers and hence it gives opportunity to workers. On the other hand, today we are in need to get our basic certificates like native ,birth,death,etc\u2026., purely via online ,so it seems to give work to the people as a government taken project like E-Source . Hence 90 percentage it rises employability ,and we have to accept that somewhat decreases the man work. Nice question\u2026 ",
