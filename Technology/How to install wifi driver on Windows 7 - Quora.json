            "answer_text": "Most desktop PCs do not come with a wireless adapter. Nearly any laptop made in the last 15 years has one already installed and they are not easily replaced due to restrictions the manufactures place on them but can be bypassed with a USB version. Usually you install the physical adapter then\u2026 Install the driver from the CD included with the adapter orInstall the driver downloaded from the Internet (either while the wired Internet is connected or put onto a thumb-drive from another Internet connected computer.)In some cases you must install the driver first before installing the adapter. Best bet is to find the instructions for the exact model of adapter you are installing (in the package or from the manufacturer\u2019s website). If you are purchasing an adapter make sure the model (PCIe or USB) is compatible with your OS (Windows 7 in your case). ",
