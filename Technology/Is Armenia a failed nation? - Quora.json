            "answer_text": "I think it is a failed nation. I am not trying to be offensive but there are some things to realize why they are failed. Average Armenian still lives in 1915. If you try to make a sensible conversation with an average Armenian the conversation ALWAYS comes to \u201cgenocide\u201d at some point. It literally sounds like they are BRAGGING about being a victim all the time; it\u2019s bizarre and annoying because it doesn\u2019t add anything to any conversation and it blocks the development of the relationships between their neighbors hence the rest of the world. They always talk about how they survived a genocide etc and they think their neighboring countries are the ones who should be blamed for their poor economy and social infrastructure. But they don\u2019t see the fact that Israel, a real holocaust survivor nation, was born from their ashes and now they are one of the strongest and most influential countries in the world. Another thing; A nation\u2019s progress happens through their folk. They need to accept their history and move on. There\u2019s no point to feed the younger generation with hatred. The below pictures are average Armenian\u2019s mindset and the lack of respect for national symbols are saddening. These kids are growing with hate. I\u2019ve seen many similar scenes in Los Angeles. Kids and their grandmas/grandpas are stepping on Turkish flags like they are getting revenge, i think this is pathetic.    I\u2019ve met and interacted with MANY Armenians who live in California and I can honestly say most of them are good people but extremely ignorant due to their parents. God forbid if you don\u2019t agree with their genocidal claims they become hostile. I personally don\u2019t think Armenia will be a developed country ever because their mindset is a huge block on development. ",
