            "answer_text": "So, qualification for myself, I collect computers and laptops especially:  My favorite laptop brands: -ThinkPads. I own like 4 of them. Seriously they are awesome, the older Lenovos and IBMs tend to be better though. The ThinkPad X61 is my personal fav. The ThinkPad 25 which i also own below is my daily driver:  -Dell Latitude. Similar to ThinkPads, but the new ones come with the nifty InfinityEdge display and tons of Thunderbolt 3 ports. Haven\u2019t had an issue with any of them yet.  -Alienware. Yeah, I used to think they were overpriced, but surprisingly they are well made. They use aluminum and magnesium for their builds which is better quality than the Asus ROG / MSI / Acer Predator ones which use plastic usually. I\u2019ve been using the same Alienware for almost 2 years, everyday its been left on, for VR / gaming etc and had no issues  -Apple. Yeah, I\u2019m not a big fan of Apple in general, but I don\u2019t doubt their Macbooks are well built and look really clean and stylish. The new Macbook Pros I do not recommend for professionals (go for a Dell XPS or ThinkPad X1 instead) but they make great consumer laptops (I know, it\u2019s \u201cPro\u201d but its actually an upgraded Mac Air)  -Microsoft. Their Surface Pros and SurfaceBooks are excellent. They are taking design cues from Apple and some like the SurfaceBook are just straight up innovative. I used to use the X1 Yoga as my convertible but the SurfaceBook 2 is now my main convertible. detachable, convertible, dedicated graphics, 3:2 display with high ppi (in my ranking its the third best screen I ever had right behind the MacBook Pro and X1 Yoga with OLED), stylish, and portable.
