            "answer_text": "While WiFi is essentially everywhere you look, sometimes while traveling, you\u2019ll be in a situation where you only have a wired Ethernet connection. What happens then if you need to connect your \u201cWiFi only\u201d device to the internet? If you have a Windows 7 laptop, you can turn it into a WiFi hotspot and share its wireless connection with your device via an Ad Hoc network. Here\u2019s how to do it without third-party utilities. Note: Windows 8 has quietly removed this feature, but you can still do this with XP \u2013 Windows 7. And if you are running Windows 10, make sure to read our article on making Windows 10 a Wi-Fi hotspot. What You\u2019ll Need A Laptop with built-in WiFi capabilityA mobile device with WiFi capability (For example Kindle Fire HD, iPod touch, Nexus 7)A hard-wired Ethernet connectionTurn Your Windows 7 Laptop into a WiFi Hotspot Click the wired network connection icon in the System Tray and select Open Network and Sharing Center.  In the screen that opens, click \u201cSet Up a New Connection or Network\u201d under Change your Network Settings.  Now select the bottom option to set up a wireless ad-hoc network.  The Wireless Ad Hoc Network wizard will start up. Click Next.  On the next screen, give your ad-hoc network a name, select your security type, and enter a security key. If you\u2019re in a public place, I recommend WPA2 for the best security of your network.  It should just take a few seconds, and your ad-hoc network will be ready to use.  If you click the connection icon in the system tray, you\u2019ll see the network you just created in the list waiting for users.  Then go to Network and Sharing Center and select Change Adapter Settings.  Then check \u201cAllow other network users to connect through this computer\u2019s Internet connection\u201d and click OK.  Now you\u2019ll be able to see the shared WiFi connection from your laptop on your mobile device. Just connect to it and you\u2019ll have internet access on the device in no time.  ",
