            "answer_text": "I was interested in how the human eye compares to digital imaging and so far have found and compiled this table from the sources listed at bottom:Human Eye Specifications (typical): Sensor (Retina) : 22mm diameter x 0.5mm thick (section); 10 layersResolution : 576MP equiv.Visual Acuity : ~ 74 MP (Megapixels) (printed) to show detail at the limits of human visual acuityISO : 1 - 800 equivalentData Rate : 500,000 bits per second without colour or around 600,000 bits per second including colour.Lens : 2 lenses - 16mm & 24mm diameterDynamic Range - Static : contrast ratio of around 100:1 (about 6 1/2 f-stops) (4 seconds)Dynamic Range - Dynamic : contrast ratio of about 1,000,000:1 (about 20 f-stops) (30 minutes)Focal Length : ~ 3.2mm - (~ 22mm 35mm equiv)Aperture : f2.1 - f8.3 (f3.5 dark-adapted is claimed by the astronomical community)FOV Field of View : 95\u00b0 Out, 75\u00b0 Down, 60\u00b0 In, 60\u00b0 UpColor Space - 3D (non-linear) RGBColor Sensitivity : 10,000,000 (ten million)Color Range : 380 to 740 nmWhite Balance : Automatic (constant perceived color under different lighting)Refresh Rate : foveal vision (high-quality telescopic) - 3-4fps; peripheral vision (very inaccurate) - up to 90fpsObviously compiling this creates some very big assumptions - many of these are interrelated to the brain's processing of the eye's signals. I am sure that while the above statistics are factual, presenting them as a direct apples-for-apples correlation to common camera specifications is probably fraught with inconsistencies. So bear in mind that I did this just for fun!

            "answer_text": "In terms of sheer resolving ability, I have to go with Michael Rodney Osborne's simple calculation.  But the human eye hardly ever functions at such unforgiving levels, choosing instead to see what we are looking for, therefore allowing the brain to make sense out of sheer data coming in and I suspect, keeping it as simple as possible. We can fool the human eye easily with a mere 2000 lines of resolution as in movie screens.  We can stitch the lines into the image, and we hardly notice the dots, do we?  It can even be fooled into seeing continuous motion, even though there is a blank screen every 1/24th of a second.  But this is putting this question into the regions of image processing rather than \"seeing\". What is amazing about the human eye, to me, is dynamic range.  We can see details across a wide variety of brightness levels in any given \"scene\".  One day cameras will get there, no doubt. The other amazing thing is peripheral vision - we know about things we're not even looking at! ",
