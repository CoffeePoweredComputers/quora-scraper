            "answer_text": "The LCD and LED tech used in the mobile phones has there display module either on the top or the bottom of the display, so it has to keep top or bottom bezel to accompany all the necessary components for it to function. Now you must be thinking but the I Phone X series don\u2019t have the bottom bezels that\u2019s coz it uses a flexible OLED display which is folded in the bottom side.  This technology come at high cost and only possible in OLED tech, so the android manufactures don\u2019t go for this display technology which will make there devices cost higher Bottom bezels also have its own benefits like it make the bottom display much reachable in the tall display phones ",

            "answer_text": "There is a reason for that. You see most of us dont notice but the bottom bezel that you speak of is of great importance. We hold the phone in such a manner that our hand strikes the screens all the time but as you might have noticed the bottom part is well mostly touched or bumped. The upper part stays there for the longest period remaining untouched in many events. To avoid accidental touches many companies are thinking of a solution but if you do wanna see a phone with no chin, The oppo Find X and The View 20 by Honor is Well a practical application of the no chin no bezel design. Hope you liked it!! ",
