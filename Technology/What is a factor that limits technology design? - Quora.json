            "answer_text": "One big problem is the lack of communication between the engineer designing the technology and the customer. That may be hard to believe but I have seen it over and over again. In the past I have seen large software systems built and their installation attempted only to find that there were big holes in the functionality or poor ease-of-use. Customers rejected the software. I do not blame the engineers for designing poor software or customers not adequately specifying the functional needs and operational constraints that the software would need. We are all too humans. To compensate, there needs to be continuous communication between the engineers and the INDIVIDUALS who will actually use the software in the customer\u2019s organization. Initial designs and prototypes need to be examined by the actual users. [Too often exedcutives from the customer company prepare the specifications for the software without full participation of the actual users.] Then there should be a significant beta testing period of the software.
