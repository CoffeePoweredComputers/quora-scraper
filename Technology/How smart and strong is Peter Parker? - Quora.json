            "answer_text": "Peter Parker is definitely smart. He isnt a super genius, like Reed or Tony, but he is a genius. He just doesnt have the resources or time to explore that aspect of himself. But the tech he\u2019s produced (web shooters and the actual webbing, for example) display a very advanced mind. I\u2019d say he has to be easily 160+. Also keep in mind that IQ tests really dont accurately measure intellect. I know numerous Mensa members who are semi functional idiots. In terms of strength we also have nebulous data. Supposedly Pete\u2019s 10 to 50 ton range in terms of strength (which is a HUGE range). He\u2019s displayed strength that suggests he\u2019s past 50 tons\u2026  Allegedly that was supposed to be a modified T90 tank, and they weigh in at 50 tons unmodified. He landed a private jet, supporting the weight on his back\u2026  Small private jets range anywhere from 10 tons to 30. Thats heavy. But basically supporting a weight like that as it lands with 80 mph+ momentum behind it? No idea how heavy that would be.   I dont even wanna begin to guess how heavy this could be. Spiderman when he\u2019s stressed or pissed seems to have a lot greater strength than even he thinks. It\u2019s been shown that Peter underestimates his own capabilities, often, and I think this equates to raw strength as much as anything else. He seems to rely more on speed and agility than strength, but you shouldnt sell his power short. The guy has staggered the Hulk, and knocked Apocalypse back. ",

            "answer_text": "Peter is up there with some of the smartest in the Marvel universe. earth 616 at least.    Consider he\u2019s AT LEAST smart enough to match pace with Reed Richards while giving on the fly instructions to a \u201cdolt\u201d like Johnny Storm. In fact not only did they continue each other\u2019s sentences for each other.. they trailed off at the right time too\u2026 (lol). As for Peter\u2019s strength. It\u2019s one of those things in flux. It depends on his Adrenalin and how much he himself exerts. I mean he can hold up part of the daily bugle building as it\u2019s about to crumble, long enough to finish a evacuation. (We won\u2019t even go into his fight with Firelord, former herald of a Galactus) Depending on the era he can bench press anywhere from 20 tonnes to 100 tonnes. This of course is all depending on circumstance. (I\u2019m sure there\u2019s many images around that can indicate that) Update. So I always wanted a little more in this answer, and then suddenly I came across this, this morning. This is from \u201cFull Circle\u201d (a one shot Spider-Man title.)  \u201cphysics, engineering, biology\u201d. \u201cadvanced\u201d at that. ",
