            "answer_text": "This year we have seen the different innovations from the mobile industry, such as the iPhoneX, and smartphone developments continue to impress us with their innovation and creativity (e.g. the rumoured Samsung S10 bezel-less design). What more can smartphones possibly showcase in the future? Here are some features that might continue or be included in the future lineups of smartphones.  Wireless - As more and more mobile devices include portable wireless charging, this will most likely increase and become a norm in the future. Wireless accessories, such as Apple\u2019s wireless earphones called AirPods, will also most likely be a commercial possibility in the future. Thinner - Phones will continue to become thinner and lighter, thus making it more portable. How thin could phones get? A thinner hardware would mean lesser space for necessary computer processes such as microchips. Producing smaller but more capable chips would prove to become a challenge in the future. Battery - Batteries would most likely contain powerful and longer-lasting power. An idea presented in an article via Forbes on the future of smartphones, suggests that if phones are capable of receiving power over the air, batteries would not need to have extra storage power and can become smaller and leaner. Solar-powered smartphones are also a possibility. Transparent - With smartphones becoming more transparent, this removes a phone\u2019s back side and allows both sides of the phone to function. This is possible as long as we manage to figure out how to put and fit all the necessary phone accessories like the battery and microchip while unseen. Aside from the difficulty of producing this kind of phone, questions on privacy would surface as the content you would be viewing would be seen through your phone. Smarter - How smart can smartphones get? We still don\u2019t know how expansive software can get but as development for Artificial Intelligence and machine learning continues, it is possible for smartphones to be so smart that they can be able to predict queries or situations or already give out answers. Imagine yourself about to type a question, but before you could touch your screen, your smartphone has already predicted what it is and has already suggested your question on the search engine. That\u2019s possibly how smart they can get, or more. While we\u2019re waiting for these to happen, here are some of the things you can do with your smartphones: 10 Must-Have Fitness Apps (Part 1: Let\u2019s Get Moving!) 10 Must-Have Fitness Apps (Part 2: Let\u2019s Lose Weight!) 7 Mobile Apps to Help You Learn Coding on the Go 6 Apps To Train Your Brain To The Best Mobile Game Engines of 2018 (Free and Paid) ",
