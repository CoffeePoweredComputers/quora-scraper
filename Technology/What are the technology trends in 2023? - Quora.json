Just one reservation, if General AI to be created in 2023, all forecasting becomes invalid.  We\u2019ve built pyramids. We learned to harness electricity. We understand how our universe formed after the Big Bang (mostly). And of course, the clich\u00e9 example, we\u2019ve put a man on the moon. Yet, in spite of all these accomplishments, the human brain remains far outside the understanding of modern science and is, by default, the most complex object in the known universe\u2014or at least our understanding of it. Given this reality, it shouldn't be altogether shocking that we haven't yet built an artificial intelligence (AI) on par with humans. An AI like Data (Star Trek), Rachael (Blade Runner), and David (Prometheus), or non-humanoid AI like Samantha (Her) and TARS (Interstellar), these are all examples of the next great milestone in AI development: artificial general intelligence (AGI, sometimes also referred to as HLMI or Human Level Machine Intelligence). In other words, the challenge AI researchers are facing is: How can we build an artificial mind comparable to our own when we don't even have a full understanding of how our own mind works? We\u2019ll explore this question, along with how humans will stack up against future AGIs, and finally, how society will change the day after the first AGI is announced to the world.
