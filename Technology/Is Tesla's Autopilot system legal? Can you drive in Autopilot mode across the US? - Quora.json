            "answer_text": "The Tesla will keep pace with a car in front of you, speeding up (within the speed limit) or slowing down to maintain the distance you choose from car in front, and your car will change lanes if you put on the turn signal (when it's safe), but otherwise it's just following the lanes and speed limit signs and surrounding traffic. It has no idea where you're going and will not turn (except following curves in the road) or even stop at a light without your active control. Eventually the software may do more, but not now. Tesla wants you to keep your hands on the wheel and be prepared to stop when required. That said, if the car in front of you stops at a light, of course your car will stop behind it as well, and start up again when the car ahead moves again. I imagine clearly marked lanes are a big advantage, and driving on unpaved roads is probably not currently feasible. If it weren't for needing to charge and sleep and eat, I suppose you could use the software to drive across the country on an interstate like I-10 or I-80, assuming there were no construction zones where stoplights had been temporarily added, but you'd still have to manually exit and re-enter for rest stops and sleep and charging, and I'm not certain whether the charging network is fully implemented next to interstate exits all the way across the country yet. You might have to charge longer, or further from the highway, so these segments would be under your control. And remember, you're supposed to be aware at all times of the actions of the car, even if it's doing the tedious part of the moment to moment driving. It's still in beta, you can't go to sleep or tell it where your destination is and ignore the actual driving. Maybe that's in next year's update... ",

            "answer_text": "As of March 2019, approximately 37 states have enacted regulations concerning Autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles. Most of these are executive orders by the then standing governors, and are for the most part just definitions of what an autonomous vehicle is, and reinforce the hands on regulations. In late 2017, Senator John Thune introduced a bill to enact a regulatory framework for Autonomously driving vehicles that would have created an advisory committee. It would have been in charge of autonomous vehicles, and would also have overwritten all state laws so that they would have had an equal footing. The law was very open ended. That law did not pass, and now a new law is being created that will appease more politicians. Without regulation, the only laws that take precedence are those for aircraft where a pilot must maintain vigilance while on autopilot. Some states including Nevada have enacted testing or research laws for a limited number of vehicles to test the autonomous abilities of vehicles. To maintain this legal status until such a law is passed in congress, Tesla has maintained that all autonomous vehicles must have hands on otherwise they will park on their own. As Tesla has stated, their recent version 3 software is capable of level 4 autonomy meaning that the car does not need to be monitored, but the driver must be available to take over in an emergency, so once the law passes, the need to keep the hands on the wheel will not be necessary once that regulation is put in place. The need for Tesla to require hands on also helps them legally since the car \u201cTattles\u201d on the driver when an accident occurs, and eliminates the ability for frivolous lawsuits to occur that could cost Tesla Billions. The reason for the \u201cTattlings\u201d is not primarily to protect themselves from the lawsuits that would occur, but to find a way to improve their autopilot software so that such an accident does not occur in the future. The fact is once the hands on law is eliminated, and the autopilot is in full control, then that same \u201cTattling\u201d could result in Tesla\u2019s software to be at fault, but at the same time, laws could be put in place that you are accepting the risk involved with driving an autonomous vehicle, and as such Tesla will not take responsibility. If not, then there is a chance that autonomous driving could be eliminated from such vehicles just to protect the manufacturers, and that would be a sad thing since it turns out that autonomous driving as of late 2018 is at least 7 times safer than manual driving. Concerning driving across the US, in older Tesla's you may be required to take over at interchanges or cities, but newer ones the only thing you have to do is keep your hands touching the wheel. ",
