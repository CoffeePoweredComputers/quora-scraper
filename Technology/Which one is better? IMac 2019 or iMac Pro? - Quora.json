            "answer_text": "I had to address this same question for five Final Cut Pro/Premier edit systems. There is a ton of difference between these two systems. What I needed to address first was what my use would be. In my case it was easy, since the use was right in the title of the procurement request: Five YouTube video edit systems. No browsing, no word processing, no analog audio mixers. The iMac Pro has more high speed Thunderbolt 3 (Tb3) I/O available, a better video card, error checking RAM with more capacity. It costs much more. It will likely be supported a year or two longer for OS updates\u2026 maybe. The iMac has one Tb3 port and a hand full of other I/O, a pretty good video card, enough RAM. It costs less. On the balance, we don\u2019t need the Pro for YouTube videos. Take a look at what you want to do and be brutal on your needs v. wallet. Both will be obsolete about the same time. ",
