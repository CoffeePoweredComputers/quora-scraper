            "answer_text": "Get the iPhone 6S Plus 128GB. I switched over from an iPhone 6S to an iPhone 7, and trust me, the difference really isn't that big. After a while i felt like i was using the same phone. Additionally, the 32GB version of the iPhone 7 has a slower memory as compared to the 128GB and 256GB versions, you can look up for more info online. Yes, you get better processors and cameras, but you lose a 3.5mm audio jack as well (might be important depending on your daily usage). I lost my adapter and couldn't get any of my earpieces to fit on ny iPhone 7. On the 6S Plus, you get way better battery life as compared to the smaller iPhones, and a display with higher pixels per inch (ppi). 128GB of memory is also really useful for travelling. I went overseas for 12 days and took tons of videos and pictures, used up about 40GB of space, but i don't have to worry about my phone running out of space any time soon. And i can keep my photos in my phone (after backing them up)! Afterall, Apple isnt all about their specs. It's the user experience that matters a lot and you will be equally happy with the 6S Plus! Edit: Just note that iPhone 7 has a 3D touch home button as compared to a physical one on the 6S Plus, which can be good/bad depending on your opinion. But to me the physical home buttons is more prone to wear and tear especially after clicking it so many times. (But there's always the AssistiveTouch if that's your kind of thing) ",
