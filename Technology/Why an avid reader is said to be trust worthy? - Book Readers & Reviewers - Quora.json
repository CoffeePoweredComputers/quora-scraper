            "answer_text": "People who indulge themselves in books, love spending time with book instead of wasting their time in pubs and bar. People who read books are trustworthy (only those who implement books in their lives) because they have created a different world for them selves, books never taught us to cheat, to do fraud, to hurt someone (atleast I have never read any books having any hatred for anyone not even for mosquito) The reader not only reads the book but also things that the whole world is polite, soft hearted, faithful and trust worthy and that is why when she/he comes out from their book's world they behave like the ideal person, they value and appreciate every line of the book in their lives. A human always creates image in their mind while reading or even listing, so a reader always understand each and every emotion because he/she can feel the emotion of pain, hurt, happiness, loyalty. They become more sensitive towards everything. So according to me and I have experienced this in my life as well that they understand people try not to hurt anyone ( I am not saying that those who don't read books are not trust worthy ) But we can see this in another way where we can clearly see avid reader like Sashi Tharoor as a human being I don't appreciate him. There are more avid readers but we can't say this that they are more trust worthy than the non-reader. It's a 50/50 thing we can\u2019t trust someone because he is a reader, we should always keep our secrets. Never share your any sensitive thing with any one until and unless you know him/her ( how they react in different situations) in all their ways. ",

            "answer_text": "Avid readers are trustworthy! This is a pretty bold statement to make but I am not sure how true this could be, books play a certain role in our lives and make us a better person in various ways. People who adopt reading as a habit early and fall in love with reading generally do not leave it throughout their life. So people make book companion for life - books can surely trust their reader.Readers can get perspective of our good and bad acts in various stories and if you see that most of the books end on a positive note and convey one clear message - good happens with good people. So, if you want good for you, do good for others.Books make us empathetic and readers can better understand others as compared to non-readers. Betraying someone hurts and readers know that.I am still not sure if we can generalize the statement that \u2018readers are trustworthy\u2019 because human behaviour and mind is too complex to be put into certain categories. But yes, readers are slightly better than others. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey, this is a great question. Well, the first instant answer would be because books never teach you to betray someone. It doesn\u2019t ask you to use someone for their own advantage. You know, it\u2019s like when you read a book you actually link yourself to it. And everything it talks you feel it\u2019s so true and you try to follow it. You start thinking like that. Be it fiction or non fiction, it always end up teaching you values of friendship, honesty and finding the correct way to get what you want. And moreover, till now I haven\u2019t come across any book which ends with the bad person winning the game. :P ",
