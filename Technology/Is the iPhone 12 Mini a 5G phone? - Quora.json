            "answer_text": "Yes. Apple claims it to be the smallest iPhone at this time and indeed the most compact 5G smartphone in the world, the Apple iPhone 12 Mini is priced Rs 69,900 onwards will be available in three storage options and five colors. This is the entry point into the new Apple iPhone 12 line-up which also includes the iPhone 12 (prices start Rs 79,900), the iPhone 12 Pro (prices start Rs 1,19,900) and the iPhone 12 Pro Max (prices start Rs 1,29,900). Under the hood is the Apple A14 Bionic chip that has already started its journey with the Apple iPad Air refresh announced last month. The A14 Bionic is designed on a 5nm manufacturing process, making it the first commercially available 5nm chip. The A14 Bionic chip has a six-core CPU of which two are high-performance cores and four cores are for less power intensive applications and processes. There is also new quad-core graphics.  The smallest iPhone in Apple\u2019s line-up till now was the second-generation Apple iPhone SE, released earlier this year. That measures 5.45-inches in height, 2.65-inches in width and is 0.29-inches thick. In comparison, the Apple iPhone 12 Mini measures 5.18-inches in height, 2.53-inches in width and clocks 0.29-inches in thickness. The Apple iPhone 12 Mini has a 5.4-inch Super Retina XDR display, while the iPhone SE has a 4.7-inch Retina HD display. Apple says the iPhone 12 Mini is the smallest, thinnest and lightest 5G phone in the world. The iPhone 12 Mini will support the sub-6GHz and the mmWave 5G standards, which means the new iPhone 12 will work on pretty much most 5G networks globally. ",
