            "answer_text": "I can remember 2 insect examples from high-school biology. However, I can't remember details (species' names, exact areas) because it was long ago. Also, both of them examples are not trully natural in the fullest sense, they were partly driven by human actions (James Kelly talked about this). MothsA certain species of moth lives in both the countryside and in cities in England. It comes in 2 natural forms, a white-gray ashen one and a brownish-black one. Before the industrial revolution, the white variant was by far the most prominent in all areas, because the black moths were spotted by birds too easily and were eaten very often.  After the industrial revolution, however, the buildings and trees in the cities started becoming darker and darker due to all the smog and stuff. In these areas, it was the white ones that were at a disadvantage as they stood out too easily, and consequently, birds spotted and ate more of them than of the black ones. Nowadays, the white one remaines the dominant variant in the countryside, but the black one dominates in cities. This moth has been described in scientific literature before, during and after the change, so it is easy to confirm that the change did in fact take place. Technically, it hasn't evolved into 2 separate species yet, but that's where it's headed. Fruit Flies I believe the area for this was one of the two american continents, can't remember which. There was a species of fruit fly that fed on apples, and its reproductive cycle was timed perfectly with the reproductive cycle of the apple trees so that the fruit fly babies would have as much food as possible. When colonization started, pear trees were introduced to the area. Pears and pear trees are similar to apples and apple trees, enough to allow some fruit flies to feed on them instead. The offspring were weaker than the ones that fed on apple trees, but they still managed to survive and reproduce. Also important was that the reproductive cycle of the pear tree was different to that of the apple tree. Eventually, the fruit flies that had gone to the pear trees evolved to have two major differences. First of all, they became better adapted to feeding on the pears. Secondly, their reproductive cycle changed to match the pear trees' cycle. Eventually, the pear-eating flies and the apple-eating flies stopped interbreeding, because their reproductive cycles were not synchronized. The result was 2 separate species. ",

            "answer_text": "One of he interesting things happening now as never before is the assemblage of people in Silicon Valley.  You have men and women with fairly high levels of education concentrated together.  Lots and lots of engineers, men and women in relatively close proximity.  This changes certain probabilities that specific kind of genes finds another and creates an offspring.  This is not the kind of thing people think of when the word natural selection is used but natural selection it is.  Now, in and around Silicon Valley there are very high levels of Autism.   Is that because some genes are getting together that normally have a lower probability of getting together in other geographical places?   I don't know the answer but you see my point?  Silicon Valley is having the effect of making a gene pool as if it were isolated. ",
