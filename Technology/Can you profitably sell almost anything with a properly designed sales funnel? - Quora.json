            "answer_text": "The answer is YES, and you SHOULD use a funnel to sell anything online.A funnel allows you to upsell the buyer that will create a higher ACV (Average Cart Value) and that is the key to earn back your ad spend right out of the gate. When you do that your ad budget will be infinitive. Example:If you offer a cheap product as a front end offer and giving it away for free as long as they cover the shipping and handling and immediately follow up with i complementary product priced higher you have a much higher probability to make a profit after expenses that you would otherwise.If you then follow up with emails you on those who didn\u2019t get the upsell you would most likely get som more sales.You also have your customers email addresses that you could continue to promote your products to as long as they stay on your list. One hurdle is that most funnel software's is either difficult to use or crazy expensive. I myself have paid $297/mo for ClickFunnels for years, but now I\u2019m switching to a new platform called GrooveFunnels that I think will blow every other software out of the water. I\u2019ve made a quick and honest review of it here. Hope it helps. :) ",

            "answer_text": "A sales funner is an important part of sales and marketing. This does not mean that this is the only part of sales an marketing. If it were, we all would be millionaires. Think about it; why would a customer buy from you? Have you ever bought a product only because you thought a company selling it had a great sales funnel? You have to keep in mind other important factors that will influence your success: Value proposition of your services and products. Relationships between yourself (or your brand) and your customers. Ability to supply product or service timely. Ability to provide adequate customer service. Your reach (i.e. sales funnel itself can be fine, but how big is it? Do you have means to reach out to required volume of potential buyers?) Those are just some of the examples you have to consider when you are getting ready to sell a product or a service. ",
