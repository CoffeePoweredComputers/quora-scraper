            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what will be my situation in 2021 , but still I will try to figure it out CSK of 2021..\u2026 it will be fun (may not be true) First I will talk about 2019 auction :I think they have left 6 cr in the pocket & after releasing some they might go upto 10 cr. They will target some quality fast bowlers & overseas batsman. They will invest in youngsters keep in mind that msd will retire soon. IPL 2020 may be last IPL of ms dhoniIPL 2021 , CSK will retain suresh raina and one other good performer of previous IPLMy guesses for IPL 2021 : Ms dhoni will not part of it , he will mentor of CSK.Suresh raina will be captain of teamRishabh Pant will be wicket keeper of CSK ( keep in mind his good relation with dhoni & raina )jadeja , raina , deepak chahar , lungi ngidi , raydu , kedar jadhav will be there in the squadDhoni , bravo , watson , harbhajan will be retired.But after retirement of msd , csk will have 15 crore extra in their budget & from that they will buy quality player (though they can\u2019t replace the legend)Having msd around they will be favourite as always.( note : As a csk fan I don\u2019t want msd to retire but we have to be practical . In 2021 he will be of 40 , lots of cricketer have played after 40 & I also want same from msd , if fitness allow him) 3 year is long duration , anything can happen. We can only guess about it . I have formed the basis , let discuss it in comment section. Thank you , A proud CSKian . ",

            "answer_text": "the question is grammatically incorrect. Pls. concentrate on that aspect before asking questions. CSK can only RETAIN the IPL, if they win it this year. Only a title won can be retained, if CSK do not win the title this year, how in hell will they retain it in 2021. The right grammar is to ask if CSK will regain the IPL in 2021, which is very much possible, as much possible for CSK to regain the IPL, as it would be for the team which wins it this year, to retain it in 2021. Get the point? ",
