            "answer_text": "Yes, eventually. A battery sitting on the shelf, not connected to anything at all, will slowly lose its charge over time due to internal self-discharge. With the lithium batteries that are usually used in power banks, this process is slow and would take years. A battery installed in a power back is connected to some sort of load all the time. There\u2019s usually some sort of battery monitoring circuit that consumes a little bit of power continuously. Some power banks have a button that is used to turn on the output circuitry. In those, the circuit associated with the button consumes a small amount of current. If these are the only loads, the power bank is likely to retain some charge for a year or more. Other power banks have 5 V applied to the outputs all of the time, so no button is needed to turn on the output. This output circuitry draws more power, even with nothing plugged into the output, so this design of power bank might become fully discharged in a few months. None of this will matter if you use and recharge your power bank weekly or even monthly. But if you charge it and stash it away for emergencies, then need it in a year, you might find that it\u2019s dead. For emergency or very occasional use, it might be better to buy a power bank device that uses 4 single-use AA batteries. With a mechanical switch that draws no current when off, a set of alkaline AAs should last at least 5 years if unused. ",

            "answer_text": "This question arises from an old concept worked during the period of lead-acid batteries and NiCd batteries In those case, if battery go beyond a cut off voltage , considered as impossible to re work But new lithium iron batteries overcome this issue it can be charged and drained, from zero, also new graphene method reduce internal discharge almost nil this it not loose charge for a considerable time, where lead acid battery fully discharge in one week, ",
