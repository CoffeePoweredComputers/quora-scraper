            "answer_text": "With apologies to all of the Indians and south Koreans out there, let's talk about Japan and China. I think more people should learn their stories, because the lessons you can glean are broadly applicable to most poor and developing countries. And currently undeveloping western countries. JAPAN: when the \u201cPrinces of the Yen\u201d sat on their hands and talked a great deal of rubbish about the need for structural reform and the need to \u201cAmericanise\u201d the Japanese economy, the Japanese financial system partially destroyed the \u201cconveyor belt\u201d of intermediate regional and local banks which had effectively conveyed about 45% of the BoJ no-cost investment credit funds down to Japan\u2019s millions of SMEs. Worse still, the bond of trust - the constructive cooperative partnership between SMEs (which are the bedrock of new inventions and factory floor innovations) and the financial system and the government was substantially damaged and no longer operated as well as it once had. It still doesn\u2019t. That system need to be fully restored. Shinzo Abe has been doing his level best but until he places the BoJ under government control and resets the objectives of the BoJ to the Japan CB Law of 1942 - that the BoJ exists to \u201cassist with Japan\u2019s economic development\u201d (which BoJ repositioning my colleague and great mentor Richard Werner has suggested) - it will be more difficult to restore widespread prosperity in Japan. The whole financial system needs a productive reboot from top to bottom. The \u201cPrinces of the Yen\u201d seem to be continuing to behave as if they will outlive the Shinzo Abe Government and are not exerting themselves to achieve Government growth objectives, which they would do if the BoJ was subservient to the Government. see Shinzo Abe\u2019s 19 April 2013 Growth Strategy Speech to the Japanese Press Association where he mentions and praises Dr Osamu Shimomura twice (not that the Western Press had any idea about the significance of that) and mentions his aim of once again making Japan \u201ca nation of abundant capital\u201d Speech on Growth Strategy by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the Japan National Press Club (Speeches and Statements by Prime Minister) | Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet CHINA: A central bank (in the case of China, the PBC) which partly funds local banks and creates vast flows of no-cost project credit and is not independent of the government. Central banks do not assist local development unless they are under the direct control of government. When central banks are independent they create asset bubbles and consequent credit crunches.Central banks are badly informed because they lack the local information about company prospects which local banks can possess and use when advancing long term loans. Loans made to SMEs at about the rate of inflation, thus stabilising the system by making money a counterpart of real resources. the loans made to chineze SMEs have been at a low rate which has been equal to or slightly above the estimated rate of inflation of factory gate goods outputs. That policy stabilises the financial system by making the value of loans approximately equal to a counterpart of real resources because the real value of the initial loan is preserved and maintained with changes in inflation. An inflation-limiting salary and wages system which involves the payment of annual income rises in two parts\u200a\u2014\u200aabout half weekly or monthly and the other half in lump sums payable in November. The major factor in many economies is the control of inflation. Wage and salary costs are always a major component of consumer demand and the factor most likely to increase the rate of inflation. Splitting the wage and salary awards into two sections\u200a\u2014\u200aone part awarded as an increase in weekly or monthly incomes and the second part paid as a November bonus\u200a\u2014\u200areduces the level of consumer demand and increases savings and household stability because lump sum payments are more likely to be saved. citation Princes of yen by Richard werner various articles by George tait edwards.

Over the course of two painful \u201clost decades,\u201d Japan has lost much of its competitive edge. Its economy continues to operate below its potential. Productivity growth has steadily eroded in almost every sector, including its signature advanced manufacturing industries. The age demographics are hurting them. They are a closed society against immigration of foreigners. To add to a bad situation is shushinkoyou \u2026. is Japans lifetime employment system that over time builds corporate deadwood and labour costs. Investment in japan has been declining.
