            "answer_text": "To have the best facts about your question, go to Yerevan. Enter their main metro station there. You will see a map. This map displays a \u201cgreater Armenia\u201d, which includes not only current Armenia, but also Azerbaijan, Georgia, half of Turkey. That is their goal ultimately. That is how they base their claim on Karabagh today in fight with Azerbaican. Karabagh is officially Azerbaican\u2019s. Armenia invaded it 30 years ago displacing 1 Million Azerbaican Turks at the same time. They say it is historically theirs. Well, if we go by history, Turks can claim almost half the world, including Karabagh and 1000 times more than that. Or any other country can come and say \u201clets redraw the map according to this year, when we had the largest borders in our history\u201d\u2026 For example if we go back 300\u2013400 years, the Ottoman Empire was many times larger than current Turkey. If we go back to the year 1500 for instance, there would be no USA. Seriously, Armenian claim is based on this logic alone and nothing else. Which is also incorrect because even in the last 1000 years that area was offically under Turk control, uninterrupted (except soviet time). But no, armenians dont like the last 1000 years. They want to go back more. That is the most convenient for them. (Assuming their history version is correct, which is not, because before the Turk control in last 1000 years, there was the Roman Empire control there for another 1000 years). So may be Armenians want the world borders to go back to 500 BC or so? - again assuming the history they claim for those years is true. ",

            "answer_text": "Because they want to achieve greater Armenia. Just like any other spoilt proxy state, Armenia thinks that its okay to invade a land that belongs to another nation and call it theirs according to some made up history that is written by their ministery of propoganda. Just like the Nazi Germany did in ww2. They also think that their big brothers(Russians and French) can give them whatever they want uninterrupted. But thats not the case since people don't like to give up what is theirs. So it all started 30 years ago, armenia invaded Azerbaijan and took approx 25% of their lands and Azerbaijan couldn't do something about this because they weren't powerful enough. Also UN decided fourt times that Armenia is invader in karabagh and they must immediately and unconditionally relieve control of these lands back to Azerbaijan but of course Russians intervened and this never came to pass. But now Azerbaijan is strong and they are driving Armenia back to their depressed, old, technology deprived soviet country that is a grace from Russians. Btw Armenia never ever controlled anything more than Yerevan because even when they had a proper state, it was expanding rapidly due to some regional power emptiness but when it collided with Persians they just quickly became a satrapy. So whichever frame of history you look at, they are somehow under control or influence of some nation in one way or another. Only when Soviets needed some Russian influence(at collapse of soviet union) in caucasus they just implanted some soviet influenced States in the region so that they could exert influence later whenever needed. Also even now when they are so called independent, they still rely on money thats coming from armenian diaspora all over the world and old allies such as Russians and they are using this money to build up more and more defences and stockpile weapons against a nation that they have invaded and bombarding civilian territories while UN doing f all. Killer logic. ",
