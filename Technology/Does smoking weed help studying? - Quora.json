            "answer_text": "Short answer: It depends on who you are. For me, personally it did and still does. I recently earned a B.S. in Biochemistry while basically being a chronic pothead. Keep in mind, that I am also a medical user who uses it for psychiatric issues (PTSD), and pain from previous injuries as a martial artist (kimura locks are not fun to be in). It works for me personally because it prevents PTSD symptoms (flashbacks, anxiety, etc), and also physical pain. I consider myself motivated and studious, so I can\u2019t really say that weed helps my studying directly. Rather, in an indirect way, it alleviates the other issues I have so I can function better. Much to my fortune, most, if not all, workplaces and institutions I have worked or attended have an \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d policy. I perceive this as an incentive to ensure the quality of my work and writing is excellent. I seek to show in my future answers that people who put their faith into my skills are not stifled by my habits. Another big factor is the strain of weed you\u2019re using. People will say sativa for focus and wakefulness, and indica for relaxation and sleep. This an imprecise rule of thumb that is continually being challenged by the myriad of hybrids and growing conditions that are being innovated and put into practice. Additionally, the terpenes, seem to make a noticeable difference. Terpenes are the compounds that offer the fragrance and flavor of the weed. For example, strains like OG Kush that have high amounts of the terpene pinene may help with memory and alertness[1]. In my opinion, if you\u2019re a motivated and/or productive person, weed won\u2019t change that. If you\u2019re a lazy piece of shit, weed will certainly amplify that. So if you didn\u2019t go through the same thing I did, it might or might not work as well for you as it does me. . Let me know how it works out! Edited 12/15/19 to add in some better grammar and some content I feel that I should make clear. Footnotes[1] What Is Pinene and What Are the Benefits of This Cannabis Terpene? | Leafly",

            "answer_text": "Marijuana effects everyone differently. Marijuana gave me energy. It worked like n antidepressant for me. I always had energy problems. I took me out of funk iaafter elementary school and all through junior high school I became an honor student but I never went to school stoned nor did I get stoned everyday. Pot smoking was the in thing in those days. Marijuana is a lot stronger now. Or ther people claim the contrary that marijuana made them tired. Teens often can get paranoid on marijuana it has more profound effect on teenagers. People under age shouldn't smoke pot some people feel over. Studying while you are stoned is more likely make it more difficult to remember things because it heightens your senses and you are more likely to be distracting. People say marijuana helps them sleep,m me it makes it more difficult to fall asleep. Marijuana is an antisemitic and a mood enhancer and increases appetite. Lots of people also don't like the way they feel on marijuana. It helps federal with pain and stress. People who smoke pot should do it recreationally people seem to get stoned all the time like me no pharmaceutical antidepressants help me and I am in pain alot and often feel sick. I don't smoke it anymore , I get it from a dispensary by prescription. You may find out it helps you but most people have trouble committing things to memory when. They're under the influence ",
