            "answer_text": "Switches provide convenience of connect/disconnect in simplest form.The wall switch is one of the most common and important electrical devices in the home. There are several different types of switches, and although they may look the same when they are installed with their faceplates/cover intact, the various switches look and function differently on the inside. Most of the common types of switches come in different styles, such as toggle, rocker, slider, or push-button. The style usually does not affect the switch function and wiring. While switches usually are used for lights, they can be used to turn electrical current on or off for almost any electrical device. For example, switches sometimes are installed to control the current running to an outlet, in order to turn a floor lamp on or off. ",
