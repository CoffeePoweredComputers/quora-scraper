            "answer_text": "Technology Education is also called the Study of Technology or Technological Studies. Technology Education teaches about technology as an educational area of content. Technology Education is concerned with a broad spectrum of technology, which is any innovation, change, or modification of the natural environment to satisfy perceived human needs and wants, and how technology accomplishes this through the interrelated disciplines of math, science, engineering, and others. The primary goal of Technology Education in grades K\u201412 is to develop technological literacy in all students. Technological literacy is the ability to use, manage, understand, and evaluate technology in general. The most important thing is mentorship which is best done by SkillPal. Mentorship is the new age term of Education technology. Without any life coaches, you can\u2019t go towards success. So join SkillPal to develop new ideas in your mind. Any amateur can get life coaches through SkillPal and set goals. Educational Technology focuses on the use of computers, information systems, audiovisual equipment, and other media. Educational Technology is also called Instructional Technology or Information Technology (IT) Educational Technology is mainly concerned with the narrow spectrum of technologies used for communication and the dissemination of information. Educational Technology teaches through technology, instructing students in the use of a relatively small set of tools developed by technology. Education is increasingly becoming high tech. All the things that are happening in the world of technology are directly impacting education and learning systems. People who act as a mentor usually supposed to say something as free. But if you go to an expert mentor he or she maybe ask for some payment. SkillPal is here to provide expert mentors. On this platform of SkillPal, mentors supposed to provide knowledge and ideas against some money. You can get a shoutout video message regarding mentorship. This personalized video will help to develop your plans and ideas. The mode of learning is changing vastly with technological advancement students become more brilliant in education and have versatility in knowledge. Various tools and avenues create with the aim of delivering training and learning to learners more efficiently. Educational technology examples are several that bring knowledge to the people making them knowledgeable. Learning methodologies and experiences should never be the same for everyone, but the earlier education systems could never accommodate the custom learning experience as there were too many limitations. Thanks to modern technology in education, we can really initiate custom teaching and learning methodologies and experiences in our present-day educational infrastructure. With modern gadgets and interfaces, now one can initiate learning based on their need, preference, and availability. Instead of the one-size-fits-all approach to classroom education, mobile apps development for education unleashed a new way of need-based learning. For instance, a junior surgeon now can seek guidance for a critical procedure during the operation right through his mobile app. More than any other technology, cloud computing unlocked the door of high tech education. The anytime-anywhere accessibility of information stored in remote cloud servers of the apps made it possible to access courseware and educational materials from any device and from anywhere. You can continue reading a book and collaborate with other students and teachers about your homework just through any device and at any time. Besides the ease of access and collaboration, cloud-based education apps solved the problem of storing data as well. A vast majority of devices and app platforms are now coming with virtual assistant apps and features like Apple\u2019s Siri. Such smart assistants responding to voice commands make things even easier for learning. Moreover, the speech-to-text feature, coming with most devices, makes note-taking and writing even more comfortable and fast-paced. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality have come as s big boost to online education. Thanks to VR and AR learners can actually get an immersive learning experience without needing to move their legs too much. If you want to learn about space objects just by running a 3D space video on your VR headgear, you can float in space while a background voice continues depicting you the Milky Way in detail. Similarly, real-time broadcasting of critical surgical operations allows medical students to learn through a more immersive experience. Thanks to the increasing pace of high tech adoption of the educational system, learning data is increasingly becoming important to drive decisions and make decision-making procedures easier. The huge volume of education information and data give birth to learning analytics, as it is increasingly important to assess and evaluate student engagement, traction, and learning output. In the near future, we can see learning analytics warning teachers about certain issues, warning students about deadlines and their progress, etc. Eventually, learning systems will dictate the way education is remitted by teachers and experienced by learners. Learning analytics will boost learner engagement in education more than anything else. A mentor of SkillPal can help you advance within your field and connect you with opportunities that you might not have otherwise had access to. They do this by sharing their knowledge, helping you identify opportunities in your path, and potentially opening doors for you when the time comes. Almost every great achiever in history has claimed that they had a great mentor at some point during their rise to excellence. Mentorship is a valuable tool for turning one\u2019s vision into reality. SkillPal Mentors are expected to guide and advise their mentees, helping them build a successful career or gain a solid footing within a certain organization. Typically, a mentor has one mentee at a time and can focus on shaping their trajectory. Skilled immigrants and international students who want to quickly advance in their career in a new country should take advantage of mentorships. ",

            "answer_text": "I hope an excerpt from my another answer should help here. \u201cEducation Technology\u201d literally means slightly different than \u201cEducational Technology\u201d (EdTech). The first refers to the \u201ceducation\u201d as a technology. While the second refers to the \u201ctechnologies of education\u201d and \u201ctechnologies for education\u201d. \u201cTechnology of education\u201d refers to the learning strategies, instructional strategies, pedagogies, etc. which aim at achieving a teaching-learning goal. \u201cTechnology for Education\u201d refers to the external technologies such as Computers, Internet, Content Authoring tools, simulations, animations, manipulable objects, etc. These technologies can be integrated into a teaching-learning environment to aid the process of achieving any teaching-learning goal. A typical EdTech takes both of these aspects (Tech for Ed and Tech of Ed) together. To pursue this domain one needs to delve into the theories from Education, Psychology, Cognitive Science, Human Computer Interaction, design science, etc. This is a Socio-Tech domain, and the EdTech research requires employing the research methodologies from both Social Science and Technology. One of the prominent research methodology for EdTech research is Educational Design Research (EDR), which is further categorized as Design Based Research (DBR), Design Based Implementation Research (DBIR), Design and Development Research (DDR).
