Those attachments on the bottom of the email saying it is a private communication are so ridiculous because of how the internet works. When you share anything over the internet it does its best to get from your computer to the internet provider and from their it goes through a process where the information is recreated onto dozens or more other devices before it gets to the destination.  How Email Really Works I mention emails because when you send a file to another user the same thing happens but it is the information to retrieve the file that goes through this process. If I share a file via a file sharing service, like dropbox etc. The shared file details get sent in an email to the user who then uses the email to take them to the file. So what does that mean for your question? If you send a file as an email attachment, it is a larger amount of data that must be sent. If you send them a link it is less of a demand on the internet. As to which is better? That depends on what you are using to evaluate the comparison upon. Sometimes I send small files as attachments, for larger files, I have to upload them somewhere that I can put them where they can be shared. It takes more work to share than it does to attach it to the email. ",
