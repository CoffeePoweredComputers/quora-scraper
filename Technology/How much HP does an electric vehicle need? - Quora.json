            "answer_text": "This is a more interesting question that it appears, at least in my opinion. The criteria are: That you need enough torque to get rolling, even on a steep gradient.You need enough power to go 70mph even up a mild gradient that you might find on the highway.You want to be able to accelerate to this speed in a reasonable time such as 10-12 seconds.You need to be able to go up steep hills.You have to do all this without a variable ratio gearbox.So for a 1.25 tonne vehicle 80kw or 106hp is sufficient. That's what my old Nissan Leaf had and it was quite a lively car, much more responsive and quicker to accelerate than most petrol or diesel cars of its size. Could it have had less power? Yes, but given that an 80kW motor and a 60kW motor are both similar size, and weight (both quite small units) but an 80kW motor doesn't use more energy to deliver 20kW than a 60kW motor, why specify the smaller motor? An IC engine\u2019s maximum power correlates to how efficiently it can deliver lower power levels and how much emissions it creates an electric motor's does not. This is why Tesla go for 400\u2013700hp, because they can, they have the space, the weight of the motor isn't that much compared to the battery and the rest of the car, so why not? It's a very different decision than deciding you want a 700hp IC engine which will be a very different beast from a 400hp engine. The problem of decoupling top speed from acceleration is fairly well handled by an electric motor which due to its huge torque gets you moving fast but doesn't necessarily allow for very high top speed. You could, with a very efficient gearbox probably specify a smaller motor and manage to achieve the criteria above, but what you save in motor mass you have now thoroughly exceeded in transmission mass.
