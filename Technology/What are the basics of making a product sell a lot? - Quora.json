            "answer_text": "I assume you already have a product since you\u2019re asking about making a product sell, not making a product that sells (a lot). However, the two are linked. If your product is bad, it\u2019s very hard to make it sell. This immediately brings to mind a quote from a senior exec at DaimlerChrysler (back in the days) that he shared over a beer: \u201csome companies have great products, others have great marketing, very very few have both\u201d. So there you have it, all your basics of doing successful business in one sentence. (1) create a great product that appeals to many (2) market product well You can come a long way by only focusing on one of the two for quite some time. Back in the early 2000s when I worked at Google, there literally was no marketing budget. The product (Google search) was just so much better than everything else at the time that it didn\u2019t need marketing - it practically sold itself. I vividly remember Larry and Sergey on stage one Friday after the IPO (they were answering employee questions personally every Friday) being asked whether Google should do a Superbowl ad. Larry and Sergey looked at each other, shrugged and said \u201cNo. We don\u2019t believe in advertising.\u201d Google search is a great example of an absolutely amazing product. It solves a very hard problem for a great many people in a very simple and accessible way. If you\u2019re going after mass products, look for exactly these traits. Find a problem shared by many people, preferably one that\u2019s hard to solve and make it easily accessible. If you really want to go big, then please don\u2019t ask your customers what they want. Don\u2019t get me wrong, customer feedback is important and does have its place to refine a product, but it\u2019s almost completely useless to generate new product ideas. Focus on customer needs instead and you\u2019re more likely to succeed. If Apple had asked customers, nobody would have said \u201cI really want a store that allows me to easily buy and install lots of \u2018apps\u2019 on my smart phone\u201d. My favorite \u201ccurrency\u201d when creating products is time. That\u2019s the one thing none of has enough of, and little control over, no matter how rich you are or where you live. Create something that saves people time and you\u2019re onto something. That\u2019s essentially how I looked at Amazon Prime when I managed it. For inspiration, go read \u201cThinking, fast and slow\u201d by Daniel Kahneman. Look at things in life where you switch from fast into slow thinking and focus on these pivotal moments. See how you can replace slow thinking with fast thinking through your product. There are a great many ways to market a product, but my strong preference is to see it as a catalyst for an already great product. It should simply accelerates sales. My favorite marketing tool that was designed right into the product was the (new) VW Beetle. By incorporating something funny, quirky and unexpected (unexpected is great for marketing): a flower vase of all things (!) into a car (!) got them lots of free marketing. Blogs, newspapers, coffee table conversations - it got people talking. Very clever. Marketing in my mind is more art than science. A select few products have inferior or downright bad products and are driven entirely by marketing. Red Bull energy drinks (or Coke or pretty much any other soda) are a great example. Easy and cheap to produce with the recipe being publicly available and solely driven my advertising and brand marketing. In fact, they\u2019re not selling soft drinks, but a lifestyle. Similar for Harley Davidson - one of their executives has been cited as not selling motorcycles, but \u201cWhat we sell is the ability for a 43-year-old accountant to dress in black leather, ride through small towns and have people be afraid of him.\u201d So there you go. Create a great product or a great brand via marketing or - if you can - both. Quite simple, really. ",

            "answer_text": "To add to what Ben said, to figure out what people want, you need to sell little. The famous quote of \u201cdo things don\u2019t scale\u201d is popular for a reason. Doing things at small scale helps you spend a lot of time with your customers and that will help you learn what they want or not want. You should also experiment a lot and get what you\u2019ve worked on out into the world, no matter whether you think it\u2019s relevant or not. For example, segment\u2019s business is based off of a few lines of code that they never thought would make money with. Before developers and PMs got interested in their analytics features, they burned almost half a million dollars building stuff nobody wanted and they were close to shutting down, until fortunately people loved their tiny library they uploaded on github without the slightest intent of selling it. Get something out of the building, listen to the market and let them decide what your product should be. ",
