            "answer_text": "To add to Alfredo Perez-Davila superb answer, it is possible that the carrier and the phone are incompatible, technologically. Carriers have their own phones manufactured in order to work best with their own network. Even if a phone is unlocked (as all Verizon phones are), it is possible that the hardware in the phone can not work with the new carrier. In that case, there is nothing that can be done to make the old phone work on the new network. ",

Now, if you are talking about a phone (again, iPhone) that is icloud locked, there is nothing you can do to unlock it unless you are or know the original owner and know the iCloud password. ",
