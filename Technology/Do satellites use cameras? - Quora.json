It\u2019s the entire function of some satellites to use cameras like spy satellites and commercial imaging satellites. Other satellites, like weather satellites and Earth observation satellites, make cameras a key part of their scientific sensor suites. (Pictured: World View-2, a big camera in space.)  (Pictured: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, a big camera orbiting the moon and snapping pics of Apollo sites.)  (Pictured: Hubble, a giant camera in space.)  ",
