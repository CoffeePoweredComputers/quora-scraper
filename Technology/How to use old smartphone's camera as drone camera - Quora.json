            "answer_text": "It is possible simply by fastenning your mobile phone to the drone and use apps like filmicPro (if your OLD PHONE supports it anymore) to start/stop recording. Keep in mind it works in a very short range. Other way is to desamble the camera, make your own rig, master the art of radio communication and genious electronics to make your own drone camera. The sane way is to get a drone that has camera already and save your valuable time and make some sense. ",
