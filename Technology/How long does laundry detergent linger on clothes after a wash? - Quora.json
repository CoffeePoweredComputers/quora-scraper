            "answer_text": "If you rinse the washing in clear cold water, only the merest traces remain. A good fast spin will remove more, along with much of the water. The only thing remaining on the cloth is the horrible perfumes they put into the detergent, and that is designed to remain on the cloth. Furthermore, if you use fabric conditioner, the stink you get on your clothes comes from that. On the positive side, the clothes feel nicer with a trace of cationic wax on the fibres, from the conditioner, but whether any of it comes off into the air, and into our lungs, has not come to my attention in newspapers or online reports.
