            "answer_text": "The issue becomes how to answer this. A place like Japan which sees its demographics not meeting its demands can find a place for automation quickly and therefore try to make that as friendly as it can. The mainland has a lot more of a population so it can convert the industrial routine fairly easily, but is still going to have a lot of social interests. India or Africa may be yet other unique perspectives. Russia named the things. Europe imagined a mind. The US made a lot of advancements. Space would seem to require actors that can abide other atmospheres, so maybe that becomes useful for natives under climate change. Or consider sidewise questions like can they, must they, or when will they. Effort and intelligence seem to be a lot more straightforward than consciousness and ideology. Some think that everything can be made artificially so that eases up on natural scarcities. Then it borders on life. So the issue would go from reliance to becoming. They establish the precedent and the antecedent, but raise the problem of whether it is sufficient or merely begging the question. Whether humanity would be honored or honorable, the next stage converts the members of the civilization into something that may or may not have compassion for its former version.  In any case it would seem to become a political question sooner rather than later. The system admin may get there ahead and their actions may make or break the public perception. Ideally they are targeting insights rather than individuals. Or perhaps this is the android's reverie. Also see Artificial-Intelligence, Robotics, The-Technological-Singularity or Transhumanism ",

            "answer_text": "Thats more of a question about our own perception...what exactly do we feel in the limit of our dependence...I mean...for instance,the autopilot option in planes is an example of AI right, so for that period of time,the whole plane itself is an automated robot carrying that many number of people..another instance can be the usage of automated robots in the production line in car factories...there too the robots and humans work at close proximity..so there too we are depending open them...however,if you are asking about our complete dependence on robots  for every small thing in life and basically for our very own existence,such as in the matters of life and death, then that's a long long way to go my friend..when it comes to ones life,we depend on no one else apart from ourselves!!!So basically,the question stands on opinion basically :)Adios!!!
