            "answer_text": "Seems you have not been a fan of Macs before, lets explain you in avery simple way ! \"The mac pro line is a series of Intel Xeon\u2013based workstation and server computers manufactured by Apple Inc. The Mac Pro, in most configurations and in terms of speed and performance, is the most powerful computer that Apple offers\" Now above sentence has been copied from Wikipedia and to simplify it more, I would say that the MAC PRO series is a series of workstations produced by APPLE which are used to do the profession works of maybe coding, preparing excel sheets and some heavy graphics gaming as well and much more which could be done by other workstation, but this one gets you done it faster and smoother ! Now MAC PRO is just like a CPU that you would have seen with your desktops, but these MAC PRO are made to run 3 \"4K\" Displays and \"6\" thunderbolt sdisplays at a time, that is the number of user you could provide with one MAC PRO ! It comes with Quad core and Six cores and with RAM available as 12 GB, Dual AMD fire pro for better Graphics which helps you watch Hd movies, play HD games, do the simulations without a glitch ! In all it is a CPU which consists of everything you need to connect to your displa, even comes with an inbuilt speaker, bluetooth, 802.11ac wifi and a lot more ! It doesn't look like a laptop or computer because it is not one ! ",

            "answer_text": "The answers here so far leave quite a bit to be desired. Glyn Williams's answer is the best so far, but it leaves a lot out. Make sure you read his answer; I won't reiterate what he said.  Most computers on the market today are designed to be inexpensive. They use cheap, mass-market components to minimize cost. The result is a computer that isn't particularly great for people who demand a lot of their computer.  The Mac Pro eschews these norms. It's made of only the best, highest quality, and generally most expensive components. Some of these components add fault tolerance features so that if something goes wrong at a very low level (which would cause a normal computer to crash), they can detect the problem and compensate for it (so that the computer can keep working).  It is incredibly fast and powerful. Most computers this powerful are servers; designed to sit in a server room in a big rack of similar servers. They have loud fans and lots of blinking lights. They are designed with entirely different purposes in mind. People who work with images and video for a living (among other less obvious professions, like software developers) need a very powerful, very reliable computer to get their job done efficiently. Before the Mac Pro, the computer whose capabilities matched their needs wasn't designed with them in mind. Nobody in their right mind would use one of those rack-mount server computers on their desk to edit video, and so these professionals would generally compromise and instead buy a high-end desktop computer. The Mac Pro is designed to better fulfill the needs of these professionals. It is compact and quiet. It's capable of driving six monitors at once.  It's monstrously fast. ",
