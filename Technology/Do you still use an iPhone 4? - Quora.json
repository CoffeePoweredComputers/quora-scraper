            "answer_text": "Do you still use an iPhone 4? Thanks for your request to answer. But, fortunately for me. I have never owned an iPhone device. I am an Android person\u2026 yes, think whatever you wish, but I don\u2019t like Apple\u2019s iPhones. I don\u2019t like it not because it is a bad product, on the contrary, it is a beautifully designed product with an excellent operating system (*NIX related, same as Android *NIX -Linux actually- based kernel), so, no engineering-wise complaints. I dislike iPhones because of Apple\u2019s policy and attitude of limiting users in everything and anything. They love controlling what you can do or not do with and to your smartphone, you hard earned smartphone. I am not like that, so I prefer Android. As of security, lots of people ask me about this, believing Apple is \u201cfar more secure\u201d; I don\u2019t agree: security, device\u2019s security is a state at any give moment. It is not a constant situation: One second you are 100% secure, the next second you are absolutely hacked and cracked and your identity stolen. Apple,as well, as Android and others\u2026are not innocent in this regard, not any of them. All single one platform has had its breaches of security and some companies have even tried to hide the situation to their users and customers\u2026that\u2019s your homework for you: to find out who has done that. So, there you go\u2026 I have never owned an iPhone (someone at my home has owned Apple devices) and I have no plans on getting one, not now and not in the near future. But, thanks for the question anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it makes a great music player.. I can still load MP3s onto it and the sound quality from the 3.5mm headphone jack is actually surprisingly very good for an phone that was from 2010. Unfortunately Apple made the phone pretty much obsolete because I cannot install or update new apps.. only a very few apps can be downloaded from the App Store and the phone pretty much is useless without apps. TuneIn radio and YouTube surprisingly still works, though they are running an older version of the app (UPDATE: the YouTube app has been DISCONTINUED on the iPhone 4 and 4s\u2026 very unfortunate.. you could still access YouTube from a web browser though). I use the phone mostly for music and keep airplane mode on to save battery, only using WiFi if I need to stream music from the two apps above. The headphone jack is great and I don't understand why people aren't mad at Apple for removing it.. I have it connected to speakers and it constantly plays music, nature sounds, or internet radio streaming everyday. I don't use it as a phone of course and the web browser is very outdated and slow, so it's only used for music and maybe as an alarm clock. Shame on Apple for making the phone obsolete by not allowing apps to be installed or updated, there are many apps that I cannot install. This was actually the last phone by Steve Jobs and I really enjoy the physical design of it.. the screen is flat, it has a headphone jack, and the side bezels are made from stainless steel.. plus, the screen is completely flat so installing screen protectors are easy.

            "answer_text": "Hi, Thanks for your question. iPhone is in line of the most premium smartphones in the world. Especially where I come from Africa Kenya, owning an iPhone is considered as if you are rich or a big spender. I have used iPhone 6, 6+,6s and 7. Back to your question, about iPhone 4; yes people still use the device. Despite it being a very old iPhone in the market. I have assisted so many customers who were using iPhone 4 and they were okay with how it\u2019s performing. WhatsApp and Gmail announced that their application will no longer be supported in iPhone 4. All iOS applications available from the Apple Store can\u2019t be supported in an iPhone 4 so no access to social media and you can\u2019t install your favorite applications. Inbuilt apps still work well but not as fast as you would experience while using the latter models. Whenever I assist a customer using iPhone 4, it's always an opportunity to upgrade them to the latest model which they later come and purchase. So to answer your question; yes they work but only for calling and texting hence not a suitable Apple device to own when the Company has advanced their later products with better features and giving all customers the reason to upgrade. Personally, the iPhone 4 doesn\u2019t allow the user to enjoy the privilege of using an Apple device so I won\u2019t call it an iPhone anymore. ",

However, I do recommend an IPhone 4 for older people, because its very simple. But its very very outdated and runs on IOS 7 or 8, so you can\u2019t download mostly any app in the app store. Its also very slow and doing a quick google search is a hassle. If your looking for a cheap IPhone to get I recommend the IPhone 6, IPhone 6S, or the old IPhone SE. Now, if your looking for a simple phone that is easy to use and wont be used for much, than I recommend the IPhone 5. ",

I replaced the battery in about 2015 because it would die after a few hours. Unfortunately, Apple doesn\u2019t support iPhones below the 6s so it is currently stuck on an outdated iOS from 2013. Up until I recycled it, I used it to listen to music in my car. I could always have it plugged in charging and I would hook it up via headphone jack and use it like an mp3 player. Worked great in the summer but unfortunately the battery would actually discharge in the winter even when plugged into power because it was so cold outside. ",

Unfortunately, I started using Libby to listen to audiobooks from my library, and the App Store effectively played a sad trombone when I tried to install it. The iPhone 4S runs the still-obsolete 9.3.6, but that supports a lot more apps and newer versions than those on the iPhone 4. Anyone want an 8GB Verizon iPhone 4, cheap? ",

If you\u2019re considering to upgrade to a newer version it\u2019s probably worth thinking of repurposing your iPhone. One thought that has come accross my mind is making it a baby monitor and believe me if you run a search on google you\u2019ll get endless ideas. ",

It's not very compatible with modern web or situations, but still gets the job done and it's FAST. A huge problem with the 4 (not S) is iOS 7, wich was really too heavy for that phone. If you can keep iOS 6 on it it wouldn't be bad at all. ",
