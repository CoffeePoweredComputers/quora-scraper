            "answer_text": "Hi! So there are two ways of making pictures of products\u2026 Either the website asks for pictures from the seller or the website clicks the pictures itself. Mostly online retailers ask for pictures from the seller itself. They mention the size, dimension, quality etc of the picture. Soon the website uploads the pictures it gets from the seller. Brands which sell their own products online however, need to take the pain themselves by clicking their pictures. A good DSLR is all one needs. Professionals use studio lighting and clean white background. For non-white, colored products, a white background with adequate lighting and a stand for the DSLR does the trick. For white products, the lighting is changed to slight yellowish tint, which helps distinguish between the background and the product. If you own a website and are planning to make pictures, you can even use a smartphone with a tripod. Though I\u2019d suggest to get yourself a DSLR. Make sure you have a clean white background which you keep covered (to protect from dust and other things) and you\u2019re done. Take high quality, high-resolution pictures. Customers like zooming in for detail, especially when buying footwear and apparel. Hope it helps! Checkout Cool Shopping Hacks in India! Thank you. :) ",
