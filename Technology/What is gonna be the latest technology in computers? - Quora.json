            "answer_text": "Computer field is so vast these days. Computers have become key enablers for anything and everything that we do in our lives Many different layers exists when we talk about the computer - there is a hardware layer, device driver ( a sort of hardware adoption layer), system software ( and OS ) layer, Application Software layers, Connectivity layer, and so on. Innovations are happening in all these areas. So it is simply unjustified to talk about all of these trends on one small post. Each of these areas are large and complex by themselves. In any case \u2014 the key trends that are most buzzword in technology industry are: Artificial intelligence is reshape business strategies and operations. Everything is revolving around this new technologyBlockchain has become very popular with the popularity of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Industries are exploring the potential of this new secure technology in other industry segments.Privacy and Security issues have taken centrestage than ever before \u2014 new technologies are coming to address constantly emerging challengesOffcourse Intenet of Things and Pervasive computing is the talk of the town. It will revolutionize the whole set of business to consumer, business to business and manufacturing processesDeep Learning ( Neural network) is throwing new applications which were unimaginable than ever before. The key issues around it were related to performance, but that is also improvingChatbots are completely changing the way customer interactions and customer servicing is doneQuantum computing which is still under research is likely to give a big boost to computing potential and computing power. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Internet of Things and more ",

            "answer_text": "In an era of slick gadgets, PCs are the dinosaurs, ensnared in wire clutter, sporting tired 2D cameras and stricken with the occasional blue screen of death. Technology coming up in 2015, though, is set to make PCs more interactive, fun and perhaps nosier than you'd like them to be. Apple's iPad changed the way people viewed computers and spurred PC innovation. Hardware makers drew ideas from mobile devices, gaming consoles and even 3D printers to rethink the PC, and the resulting new technologies will have a profound effect on how laptops and desktops are used next year and into the future. Wireless charging Place a laptop on a table, and it'll automatically start charging. No wires needed, no need to carry a power brick. That's how Intel views wireless charging for laptops, which could become a reality next year. Intel wants to make wireless chargers as easy to find as a Wi-Fi signal, and wants to bring the technology to cafes, restaurants, airports and other public places so laptops can be recharged without power adapters. The first laptops with wireless charging could come out next year, and Intel has shown a few prototypes laptop being recharged on a table. ",
