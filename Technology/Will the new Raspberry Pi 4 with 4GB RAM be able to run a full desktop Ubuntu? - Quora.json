            "answer_text": "Sure, no problem. The only question is, how much system resources will that take. The Pi 4 has plenty; there\u2019ll be no issue. Yet you could save more for your apps if you use something of lighter weight. Even the original Pi 1 was able to do it, but the OS would just take too much of the system for its own. OS is there to facilitate run of applications and provide a user environment; it should be as lightweight as possible while fulfilling these requirements. The more \u201ccomfortable\u201d OS, the more resources it acquires. So such a relatively heavy-weight desktop GUI was not suitable for Pi 1. ",
