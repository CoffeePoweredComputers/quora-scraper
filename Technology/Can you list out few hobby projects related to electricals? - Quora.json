            "answer_text": "Certainly Logic gates and ICs serve as the best foundation stone of any project work or assignments as far as electronics is considered. you can have multiple no. of circuits made of these usables. Like some decision making circuits can employ these stuffs, such as parking spaces for vehicles can be fitted with alarming systems made of these gates, whenever a parking space is vacant it sends an alarm to the guard for permitting other vehicle to replace the previous one at that space. What this system basically does is that ICs decide whether the space is empty for accommodation or not as they have decision making capability which can be activated by some combinations of values( truth table ) of 0s and 1s. Let\u2019s say an AND gate is used having one pin constantly at +5V(logic 1) and the other depending on whether at a particular instant of time a vehicle is parked or not (logic 0 for parked and logic 1 for vacant). Then a combination of 1 and 1 will give the output 1 signaling the other vehicle to take the place of the previous one. This system will be quite beneficial where you have crowded and thick streets with almost nick edge parking lots. Or you can have a bit of tricky and marvelous circuits for your work but that too will be best adopted and suited only with these Gates and ICs. That was the CASE for Electronic\u2026.. Now let's move on to Electricals. Try making a small step-up or step-down transformer for daily household and delicate appliances so as to protect them from burning due to short circuits. You can also use Zener diode as a voltage regulator or stabilizer alonwith transformer to protect the appliances. Else go for electricity generation using simple dc generator principle with 2 horse shoe shaped magnets ,an armature over which wire is to be wound , shaft connected to the armature via the commutator and split rings. Find some source able to move the shaft. Pedal the bicycle whose tyre rim connects to the shaft of the generator, thereby converting the mechanical energy to electrical energy which produces the current through the wires wound over the armature and directed by carbon brushes towards the external load. Or you can simply use the bicycle with changed tyres made of non-hollow conductor which moves with the help of pedal in the magnetic field of pole magnets placed at two opposite sides of the conductor. more innovative ideas henceforth can be implied.
