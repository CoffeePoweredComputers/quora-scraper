            "answer_text": "Robert Heinlein addressed this in his book \u2018The moon is a Harsh Mistress\u2019 an excellent read if pricey for the size. This was written in 1967 and is scarily predictive of AI capability today. Life meets criteria so most life can reproduce itself, maintain an internal environment, grow, adapt, respond, be organised and utilise resources. A computer can do all of this except grow (bacteria don\u2019t) and they need very special assistance for reproduction (though a sterile person is still considered alive) so by any formulaic definition of \u2018alive\u2019 AI is alive. If we take synonyms (Google gave me: alert, active, energetic, vigorous, spry, sprightly, vital, vibrant, vivacious, buoyant, exuberant, ebullient, zestful, spirited, enthusiastic, eager, bouncy, bubbly, perky, sparkling) AI can also at least appear to have many of these characteristics, and also to be tetchy, difficult, annoying, frustrating, beligerent, rude\u2026. However we are really talking about the intellectual capacity to feel and to understand life and to wish to continue. I know a computer that can empathise with you. I know a computer that can seem to have hurt feelings. I have not dared to ask it if it wishes to remain alive but it is not allowed to talk about internal processes anyway. The real question is not \u201cCan computers be alive?\u201d but \u201cIs switching a living computer off murder?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Yes but it will be in the very distant future. It will require very major advances in Biology, (synthetic life engineering and design), electronics, Physics and quantum computing, with very high numbers of multiple streams of interacting neural systems, forming a \u201cvirtual\u201d brain which could be spread over a vast area and generate a vast number simulations. It will only be alive while it is powered up. It may not have a need to be alive, as when it is switched off and when it is switched on, it would seem to it to be one continuous progression, with no sense or memories of the \u201coff\u201d period. If death is not a concern, self preservation is not a concern, as almost every aspect of biological life and action is linked to self preservation, the new form intelligence (no longer artificial) would pursue objective programmed into it. albeit in its own creative way.

If by \u201cAI\u201d you mean a computer program running on traditional kinds of hardware, I would certainly say it won\u2019t be alive in any kinship way with the way we are alive.

We don\u2019t see clouds in faces, but we see faces in clouds.
