            "answer_text": "Bill Gates needs the security of a permanent prison, as he is so far beyond any concept of human decency. Who gives him the right to use surveillance satellites on the whole world?I do not care who invested in it, he does not have global consent to do so so he is a privacy pervert off the scale. Any attempt by him to say \u2018others desire the service\u2019 is a death sentence if those being spied on have not consented. Adam d\u2019Angelo is unfit to run Quora if he says Gates can behave like that. End of. 2. Who gives him the right to demand global vaccination and implanting chips for permanent surveillance? He has no right to even raise the issue and private financiers should all face the death sentence for even investing in such technology. All this technology must be implanted into the children and grandchildren of shareholders and officers. Do a demonstration showing how their lives are ruined through total lack of privacy. Gates has no right to legal due process over this and should face public firing squad for thinking he can even broach such a subject. 3. Who gives him the right to try and destroy traditional agriculture so people are forced to eat his lab-made burgers? If he has ever, ever been party to any sustained weather warfare with the US military his entire family must be sent on a one-way trip to Mars with all his Mars technology to create his own food out there. People need to think about what Bill Gates is, and that is a global pervert without compare. He has no right to ever access the private information of billions of people and he does not have the right to life if he challenges that verity. ",
