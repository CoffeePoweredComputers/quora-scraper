            "answer_text": "The first point should be, in the grand scheme of designer eyewear, Oakley is not that expensive. Oakley sits around the same price point as Ray Ban. They're not up there in terms of price with brands like Chanel, Tag Heuer, or Persol. However, they're more expensive than non-designer frames, typically. Oakley eyewear is (relatively) expensive for two reasons.   Technology Branding Oakley's technology is decent. Although they use an awful lot of their own terms for things, so it can be quite difficult to figure out what each technological improvement actually is, their lenses are of better quality than most, as well as offering improvements in other aspects of their eyewear. Unobtainium: Special type of rubber ear sock that gets more grippy as you sweat. HDO: \"High definition optics\" - Oakley's lens tech that reduces lens distortion XYZ Optics: Oakley's lens tech that improves clarity in the peripheral vision, especially on highly curved lenses. O Matter: Oakley's polycarbonate frame material.  Oakley C5 Alloy: Aluminium alloy material that some of Oakley's metal frames are made of. Hydrophobic lens coating: A coating on the lens that repels water, dust and oils. This gives a few of Oakley's technologies used in their sunglasses. All of which make them decent to look through, resistant, and lightweight. The styles are typically sports-oriented which may not make them to everyone's taste, but the frames are of good quality. Which brings us onto branding. Oakley, or rather Luxottica who own Oakley, spend huge amounts of money on the Oakley brand. From sponsoring the world's top athletes, to funding extreme sports videos, even the design of their headquarters is all part of their extensive brand.  Oakley's headquarters building. And this is why nice things are expensive, it's why people pay the Apple Tax, (including myself), it's why any designer brand costs more. Even the anti-Luxottica brand Warby Parker ironically, still costs more because of the brand. Creating and maintaining a brand costs money, investors want to see a return on that cost. ",

            "answer_text": "Prior to Greg Lemond wearing Oakley Blades in the Tour de France, cyclists didn\u2019t even realize they needed radical eye protection. Most of us rode with drugstore sunglasses or none at all. Some even rode with glacier glasses which are about the worst possible choice since they reduce peripheral vision so much. After Lemond wore them in the TdF every cyclist had to have the expensive sunglasses. Blades were not even very good glasses. They were not very comfortable; didn\u2019t stay in place better than other glasses and they distorted a bit. Cyclists loved the interchangeable earpieces, nosepieces and lenses so they could customize them for conditions. How did they ever get along without them? Of course Oakleys have improved a lot since then. The last pair of Oakleys I owned were some Straightjackets in the 00\u2019s. Straightjackets were good glasses but not much different from other quality sport eyewear like Bolle. I sold Oakleys, Bolles, Smith and a few smaller brands I don\u2019t recall at bicycle shops in the 80\u2019s. My most popular Oakleys were Frogskins and I probably sold more of them to skaters than I did to cyclists. I still like the look of Frogskins but they are ridiculously expensive for what you get. Getting back to the question, Oakleys are expensive because people are willing to pay a premium for them. They are certainly a quality product. Are they overpriced and overhyped? Definitely. Marketers understand that most consumers do not buy the product that best meets their needs for the lowest price; they buy products they believe enhance their image. Just like people buy Apple to be creative and different, Harley Davidson to reclaim their manhood and Miatas to be young and carefree people buy Oakleys to show they are fashion forward and innovative.
