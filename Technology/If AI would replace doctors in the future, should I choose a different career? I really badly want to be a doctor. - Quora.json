            "answer_text": "By all means, go to school, work hard, and become a doctor. The world needs you, as soon as you can become ready. Which will be in about 15 years. AI is going to replace a lot of things that doctors do. Maybe even in 15 years, so you will start out not needing to do some of the things that doctors do now. That\u2019s all right. Lots of those things aren\u2019t very much fun anyway. What you will be doing instead, are lots of things that doctors aren't doing now. Partly, because they have to do all that stuff the machines will do in your place. And partly because in the next 15 years, they are going to invent incredible new things, that doctors now can only dream of doing. And you will get to be the guy who does them. Sure, machines are going to replace doctors, and just about everyone else. But engines replaced horses and oxen and mules. And now we have way more drivers and heavy equipment operators and ship crews than we ever had drovers and carriage drivers. Great big machines compound chemical and formulate drugs and make and package pills. But now we have way more Pharmicists than there ever were Apothocarys. Get yourself to become a doctor. Become the best-educated, most skilled doctor that you can possibly become. You are always going to have a job. AI will just make a better job. ",

As George Warner has said if you train as a Doctor you will end up using AI to assist you in your job For things like diagnosis even simple \u201cExpert Systems\u201d can work better than a human doctor Because they don\u2019t forget things So you will work as a doctor with your \u201cAssistant AI\u201d keeping you right and between you you will be a much better doctor ",
