            "answer_text": "You have a lot of options. The one you decide on will depend on how quickly you want to sell them, the quality of the coins, the type of coins and the way you sell them. First, the description \u201cold coins\u201d is not very helpful in giving you advice on selling your specific coins. My coins are mostly between 1,000 and 2,750 years old. Most Numismatists and collectors consider any coins minted more recently than 1600 CE to be modern. There are many ways to sell the coins. If you want to do it yourself you can go to eBay, Collectivecoin.com, tantaluscoins.com, amazon and many other websites that let you list things for sales. Some of these sites are specifically aimed at coin collectors, some are flee markets. As with all the ways to sell your coins, this way has many advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, the fees you will pay are less than the other options and you can set your own prices. The disadvantages are larger: Less traffic on the website, lower average sales prices, you have to do all the work yourself and you need to know the correct prices to place on the coins. Another way to sell your coins is to consign the coins to an auction house. Auctions generally charge the consignor 10\u201315% of the sales price but some places also have minimum fees per coin. The average fees also vary by the type of coin. The major problems with this sales arrangement is that you may wait a long time before the coin is listed in an auction, final sales prices are frequently well below retail value of the coins (although some coins inexplicably sell for many times what they are estimated at) and payment is made only after the buyer pays for the coins. Some auction house will wait for 45, even 90, days after receiving payment to pay the consignor. Coins can also be consigned to a dealer. If a dealer is willing to take your coins on consignment, the fees you pay will average about 20% of the sale price. However you will have to wait for payment until the coin sells and the dealer is, justifiably, going to put more effort into selling the coins that he owns first. These coins will result in more profit for him. Alternatively you can sell the coins directly to a dealer. This may be the most expensive way to get rid of your coins. Dealers will rarely pay more than 30% of what they think they can sell the coin for. This is not because they are ripping you off and is actually a fair price under the circumstances. If a dealer buys your coins, he is doing you a favor. He is taking the coins off your hands and giving you money. He is gambling that he can resell the coins at a profit. He will probably have to hold on to many of them for a long time. He may have to slab some of them at his expense depending on the type and grade of the coin. He needs the sale of the coins he buys to cover his rent and other overhead in addition to the amount he paid you. One other problem with consigning or selling coins to a dealer is finding one. There aren\u2019t a lot of coins stores on main street or in the malls anymore. You may have to look online or, if your not near a major city, travel to a coin show. Also the best payments will come from honest dealers who are knowledgeable about the types of coins you\u2019re selling. Since you don\u2019t already know the dealers, it can be tough to find the right one. (Note: most established dealers are honest. Don't be fooled by the fact that you heat a lot more about the bad ones than the good ones). ",

            "answer_text": "First, you need to understand that billions of coins were produced. Many type of metals were used - zinc, copper, bronze, silver, gold and mixture of metals. If you have U.S. coins, they are more valuable to the American collectors. Foreign coins are not valued as highly in the U.S. identify what coin you have - country of origin, denomination, and most importantly the date it was minted. More importantly, find out how many pieces were minted. In U.S. , an old coin from Denver mint, with a \u201cD\u201d marking is more common than \u201cS\u201d , San Francisco mint. The \u201cS\u201d always bring more money.then grade the coin - they range from junk to mint, in the U.S., the highest grading is MS-70 , proof coin. It takes a lot of experience to grade accurately, so unless the coin is worth thousands, you probably don\u2019t want to spend $100 getting it certified. So a local dealer is your friend in this case. The same coin graded average vs mint can mean hundreds of dollars in differencenow, you can get on eBay to see how much people are asking for it, then look at Completed Sales to see how much they ACTUALLY sold for.now you can either list it on eBay, Craigslist, OfferUp, etc. or you can sell it to a coin dealer for about 20% of retail value.Remember that just because a coin is \u201crare\u201d , it doesn\u2019t mean that people pay big money for it. Collectors change directions all the time, and timing matters. so, what coin do you have?? ",

            "answer_text": "It is a very reasonable question, because the answer is not as simple as one first thinks. - Trust is the big issue. There are (unfortunately) a lot of fake coins, fake buyers and indeed fake sellers online. So YOU need to be sure whoever you are dealing with is legitimate and likewise they will want to know you are too. If they don\u2019t ask lots of questions of you, my advice is don\u2019t deal with them. Your coins. You need good quality pictures and be prepared to re-photograph with a specified background so the potential buyer sees you have the coin/s not that you have used someone else's image downloaded. You will ideally have a valuation certificate or some history provided for the buyer, this shows you have done your research and therefore know a bit of what you are talking about. You need to describe them honestly and accurately. IF you manage to secure an online deal then be prepared to jump through a few hoops for the buyer, because as I say it is often used as a bit of a test to reassure the buyer. Please ensure you use recorded delivery and adequate insurance. The platform you choose for sale is up to you, EBay is the obvious, there are many on there, but also a lot of fakes. Try online auction houses, but you may have to send them the coins for valuation/verification before they will sell for you, so again choose wisely. I am not sure where you re based, but to be honest with you the best way to sell them is through a local auction house to yourself, one that is linked to an online system, as they get buyers from all over the world and will value them as part of the sale process, I for one prefer to use this method to buy as I know the auction house will not knowingly sell fakes, plus if they do I have comeback on them. I hope this helps, if I can be of further assistance please contact me HOME Nigel. Director Bats Publications Ltd. Batcaveenterprises.com ",

            "answer_text": "First thing, you need to learn quite a bit about your coins. Without this knowledge, you\u2019ll either get scammed out of some valuable coins, or try to sell common coins for high prices and get laughed at. So, get the following items: a magnifiyng glass, a pair of white cotton gloves, a pen and a writing pad. Always handle the coins with the gloves on! This because our sweat is quite aggressive to the coins, and collectors want their coins in the best possible condition. With the magnifier, read and note the country, year and face value of the coin. With this data, lookup your coins online. Here Coin catalog, world coins gallery, coin collecting, catalog of world coins - uCoin.net and here Numista are two very good sites to learn more about your coins and to lookup their value. Also read a lot about condition and grading. These are very important. After you know a bit about your coins, you can try selling them. I would suggest finding either a local coin shop or a local coin collector\u2019s (numismatists) forum. These will be the most trustworthy options. Beyond that, and if the coins are in a precious metal (silver, gold, platinum, etc.) those \u201cWe buy gold\u201d shops will buy your coins (but will pay you the lowest price they can\u2026) and pawn shops are also an option. Final option is putting them on ebay or some other internet marketplace. Only do this if you really know how to do business online. Thanks for the A2A and good luck Unique :) ",

Old coins don't necessarily have much value unless they are in super condition or rather rare\u2026double struck or very few made or things like that. Go to flea markets or look on E-bay or wherever to get an idea before wasting the time of a coin buyer & seller. You can ask him but after a few looks at your old coins, he may decline to look at any more. Look up coin selling services on the internet\u2026can't think of any off the top of my head\u2026I'll look before I post this response. See what they are asking for their coins, but realize this is strictly retail and you'll be lucky to get wholesale if they were to grade and buy your coins\u2026going locally would be more logical. Perhaps a flea market on consignment - quite often 15% of the sale price, I do believe. Other than that, the bank will give you face value. Okay\u2026just remembered one site and I am not endorsing them nor knocking them\u2026just now I don't have to look it up (lazy me): Littleton Coin Company out of Boulder, Colorado, I believe. That should give you a start\u2026good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "It kind of depends on exactly what you mean by old. Collectors of ancient coins (such as myself) and collectors of modern coins kind of work in different worlds. Either way, though, if you ask because you have come across some collectable coins (through an inheritance or something), I really suggest you find yourself a coin dealer and ask for an estimate, then consign them to someone who seems good. I can\u2019t really speak for modern coins, but if a non-collecter were to try to sell an ancient coin on eBay or something then I\u2019d be very suspicious. There are a lot of forgeries out there and we tend to be pretty wary. There are, though, a number of excellent numismatists who have web stores who would probably at least give you a vague idea of what you have if you were to send some photos to them and say you\u2019re interested in a consignment. Some of the biggest include CNG-Ancient Greek, Roman & British Coins and Harlan J Berk. If you\u2019re really talking about ancient coins, then I really like Marc Breitspecher. Tell him I sent you!

If you get in a dispute with a buyer, Paypal rules for them 90% of the time. You get stiffed on the payment and lose the coin. I\u2019d stick with the traditional way. If you have a long time reputable coin dealer where you live, take the group down to him for an offer or take it to the next local coin show. There are also lots of ways to get valuation info online so you can get an indication of their worth. Here are a few general wholesale price ranges for US coins: common pre 1965 90% silver coins - 7 to 8 times face, 40% Kennedy halves - 3 to 4 times face, common date silver dollars in circulated condition - about $10 each.

I took them to a coin dealer, but he wanted to break them out of their cases, scratch the surface, and then melt them down, and if all that checked out with them being 1 full Troy ounce of 22 karat gold, then he'd give me a thousand dollars. He didn't even look at or care about the certificate of authenticity or the serial number. In addition, he was rude, and acted like he was doing me a favor, so I opted to sell them on EBay to somebody who appreciated them and was willing to pay a fair price. That way ended up being the win/win situation that I was looking for. ",

If you have some valuable coins you may want to have an appraisal done. This will cost you but not a huge amount. Coin dealers will want to buy all your coins in a job lot. This is one time when the sum of the parts will be greater than the whole. If you want to take the time and have the ability and knowledge you can sell the coins yourself. Some Auction houses may be interested in your collection, again depending on what you have. As a stamp collector I firmly believe my collection is the best in the world. Reality usually brings a wake-up and you may be surprised at the value of your collection in the eyes of a dealer. Any collection is only worth what you can persuade some one to pay for it. ",

If the coins are rare collectibles you will need to find a coin collector that specializes in valuing collectibles. If, on the other hand, your coins are popular precious metal coinage such as gold eagles, silver eagles or junk silver, their value is derived from their precious metal content and they are fairly liquid. Some banks and even western union may accept gold and silver eagles. They are treated the same as foreign currency worldwide. However they may not give you the best exchange rate. Typically the best exchange rates are from online precious metal exchanges that don't require physical store overhead. TradePlacer.com is one such online exchange, but there are many. ",
