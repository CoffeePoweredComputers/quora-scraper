            "answer_text": "Simple answer is Yes. There are programs out there called RAT's - Remote Administration Tool. A RAT is a virus that allows the hacker access to the whole of your phone or computer. Files, photo's etc including the camera. If your super paranoid cover the camera with a sticker, disabling it won't help. Get a reputable Anti-Virus software I personally use Bit Defender on my phone, pc and laptop Bit defender has a ton of feature, anti-theft feature for your phone is a nice touch. Always keep devices up-to-date. I know installing updates are an absolute pain but it's a necessary evil. Updates provide your devices with the latest security patches. Also if your using a older version of Windows it maybe time to upgrade, while I agree Windows 7 is great it now no longer gets security updates thus leaving your computer vulnerable. If you download illegal content - Game's, Movies etc then the risk of infection is much greater. ",
