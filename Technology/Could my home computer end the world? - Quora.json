            "answer_text": "Depends upon what you are doing with it. If you where a very dedicated cyber terrorist then you would be able to do a lot of damage to the world. You would be able to fire weapons, override the safety protocol of Nuclear reactors. Heck, you could go the sophistication route and go down the social manipulation route and use things like social media to sway public opinion. End the world, however? That's a stretch of the imagination. The world was near a point of obliteration during the Cold War. This was due to the huge amount of nuclear weapons that was outstanding. There is a lot less chance of Armageddon now as we are more prepared for it. Even if we take this out of the equation, you have to remember that there are a number of different government which have a number of different computer which are much more powerful than your home computer. Could you honestly say that you could counter the might of the Chinese cyber force? Nope. ",

For anything remotely like that to happen, in addition to the computer you would need your winged unicorn to fly to Never Never Land, pick up the Ultimate Device of Reality Bending and completely distort reality. Not to mention you would need to \u201croll a natural 20\u201d and would need to have bribed the Game Master with pizza and the phone number of that cute girl you know who likes him. ",

And let me just say, for those of you contemplating the likelihood: this is impossible. Not even statistically impossible (extremely low chance) but completely impossible. ",

It damages people, society or civilization. The world existed before computers and even before electricity and so did civilization. So no, you can\u2019t end the world. ",
