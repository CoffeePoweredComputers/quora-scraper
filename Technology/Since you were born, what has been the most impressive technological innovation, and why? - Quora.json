At first response, I would answer Public Key Cryptography: In 1970, James H. Ellis, a British cryptographer at the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), conceived of the possibility of \"non-secret encryption\", (now called public key cryptography), but could see no way to implement it. In 1973, his colleague Clifford Cocks implemented what has become known as the RSA encryption algorithm, giving a practical method of \"non-secret encryption\", and in 1974, another GCHQ mathematician and cryptographer, Malcolm J. Williamson, developed what is now known as Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange. The scheme was also passed to the USA's National Security Agency. (Wikipedia)Likewise, the World Wide Web can trace its roots to a Post-WWII essay by Vannevar Bush: The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association.

It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature. (The Atlantic)I could send you the link, and you could operate by association\u2026 I think you know what he is talking about. ",
