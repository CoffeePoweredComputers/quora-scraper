            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by excessive use of smart phone or internet use by adolescents. If by excessive you mean using spending significantly more time than planned on smart phones, and interfering with some areas of life to some degree (eg. studying with adolescents), probably most adolescents today would be using their phones excessively. And if almost all adolescents have problems with smart phone use, it is hard to identify risk factors that apply to everyone. One of the best solutions has been for schools in some states to ban the use of smart phones during school hours, and for parents to more closely monitor amount and type of use as well. School performance, level of in person socialising, and level of overall happiness/wellbeing among students tends to increase. However, if the threshold for excessive smart phone use is raised to a clinical level, where the problem is causing major impairment in multiple life domains and/or serious distress, here are some of the risk factors: -Been given a smart phone at far too young an age by parents eg. a nine year old -Mental health issues such as depression -Isolation; or most or all of their friends are communicated with online rather than in person or over the phone -Impulse control issues -Ability to access internet pornography on the their smart phone, which can easily become compulsive. This in itself is linked to a range of problems in adolescents. They are not old enough to provide informed consent to watch such material, and are therefore even more likely to develop addictive like behaviour and other problems than are adult users. ",

            "answer_text": "The main reasons for excessive smartphone usage in adolescents according to me are Anxiety , Patience and Sadness or Depression. Anxiety :- People now-a-days are too much anxious. I will explain with an example. Suppose you messaged a person, say Mr X. Now, you will remain anxious about his reply until he actually replies. Until then, you will constantly check your smartphone for his reply. That\u2019s how it works and that\u2019s how you get addicted to mobile phones.  Patience :- The best thing about the previous generation was that they had so much patience while our generation is too impatient. We need everything fast. We need to succeed faster, we need to earn money faster. The same thing applies to smartphones. Suppose you were doing some questions and you are facing some difficulty, then most of the people instead of applying their own brain would google stuff for help or call some friend. This leads to EIU and ESU.  Sadness or Depression :- This is one of the most important reasons that people use smartphones a lot. Whenever we are sad or depressed or even tired, we look for things to relax and what\u2019s better than using a smartphone. In fact, it gives you a hell lot of options. You can watch your favorite movies, play games or listen to some songs. This again leads to excessive usage of smartphones.  Hope that helps. Image(s) courtesy: Google ",
