            "answer_text": "I have repeatedly recounted the exploits of an old friend, who served in an obscure UK unit named \u201cCombined Ops\u201d created during WW2, and latterly used to infiltrate deep behind enemy lines to call-down fire from the Artillery, Naval gunfire, and Airstrikes. Like ordinary FAO\u2019s (Forward Artillery Observers) these guys are NOT popular with the enemy as they\u2019re directing fire with precision onto their positions. When detected (or their presence is even suspected) the other side will throw everything they\u2019ve got at them. My mate was on R&R in Hong Kong, and China began one of its periodical demands for the return of the colony, stirring up its sympathisers among the population\u2026 standard stuff. My Mate was helicoptered by night to a hill top just inside the New Territories, unseen, ready to dig in and call down fire on any attack that came. Morning arrived, the sun rose, the mist cleared\u2026 and he realised that he had been dropped on the WRONG HILL. A hill that was slightly under a mile on the WRONG side of the border. He had singlehandedly INVADED the PRC. His superiors instructed him to sit tight, keep his head down, and a helo would return for him that night. ",
