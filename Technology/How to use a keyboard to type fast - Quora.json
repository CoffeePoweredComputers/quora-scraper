            "answer_text": "I am assuming you are a beginner. So I will answer accordingly. First of all I would like to tell you about how I started learning typing and how I got better at it little by little. Keep in mind that when you start learning it will be overwhelming to go through rules and at times you may want to break your keyboard because you will be making to many mistakes. But remember that mistakes will gradually subside and you will eventually pick up speed as well. So here we go. I started learning to type 4 years ago. I didn\u2019t join any typing class because there are too many tutorials already available on the internet following which you can learn yourself and be your own teacher. But yes, I also admit the fact that having a mentor is crucial if you think you will get distracted easily or lose moral down the line. I used a software called \u201cTyping Master\u201d. You may already have heard about it. You first install the software on your windows PC. Then you open it. You put your name in it and now we are ready to launch. Actually I don\u2019t even have to say anything because the software is the Teacher itself. The course is divided into sections. First you will be required to keep your four fingers on both hands on certain keys. Keep your finger on the Keys as follows. Left pinky finger = A Left ring finger = S Left middle finger = D Left index finger = F Right pinky finger = ; Right ring finger = L Right middle finger = K Right index finger = J You are now left with two free Thumb fingers. You can use any of those two to press the \u201cSpace Bar\u201d according to your ease of use. I usually prefer the left thumb. The row on the keyboard where you kept the fingers is called the Home Row. Now you will be trained to press the Home Row Keys for some time until you become accustomed to it. Now you will be redirected to a different chapter where you will be pressing the top row (q,w,e etc.) After learning that you will start pressing keys on the lower row (z,x,c etc.). This way you will learn to type the alphabets on the keyboard. ( This is not easy and you will want to give up midway. BUT! A big But. Don\u2019t quit. I am so glad I didn\u2019t quit or else I would have not been typing this answer because it would have been too long to type and time consuming). This chapter will probably take around 15 to 20 days with dedication and at least one hour daily. Next Chapter is a bit tough because you will be typing with Capital letters now. So you will have to use the \u201cShift Button\u201d. e.g. you want to type A. Then you will have to press \u201cShift Button+a\u201d. You will get A. Now there is something very important. Typing should be something which should not only be accurate but should be easy and fun to type too. Because of this there are TWO \u201cShift Keys\u201d on both sides of the keyboard. When you want to type a Capital letter which belongs to the left side of the keyboard you will use the left \u201cShift Key\u201d and Vice Versa. This chapter will take you another 15 to 20 days. After you are done with the Capital Letter part you will go to the number row part where you will be typing numbers. For that you will use the row located two rows above the Home row. After number you will use special marks. This will also use the number row but with the use of \u201cShift keys\u201d. This chapter will take you almost 25 to 30 days. So after 2\u20132.5 months you will be typing with confidence. But keep in mind that in the software there is a number of typing paragraphs where you can test you speed and accuracy. After giving the test for 2 or 5 minutes depending upon your patience level check your statistics. Are you making too many mistakes. If yes then slow down, lower your speed and focus on your accuracy. I can guarantee you that you will catch speed in no time. Accuracy is important because typing a document in 15 minutes with 90% accuracy is always better than typing it in 5 minutes with 50% accuracy. In the later case you will again have to go through proofreading which is a very tedious job. Trust me \u201cFocus on accuracy\u201d Speed will come with time. What\u2019s NEXT. Learning from Typing Master will not be enough if you want to be a typing superstar. Following are some of the websites where you can test your typing skills and compete with other players online for free. (1) https://thetypingcat.com (2) https://www.typingtest.com (3) https://www.typing.com (4) https://10fastfingers.com ( You will find the most number of participants in this website.) (5) https://onlinetyping.org (6) https://www.ratatype.com ( You can get an online certificate Here) P.S. Don\u2019t buy any good quality keyboard while starting to learn typing. I have myself broke two of my keyboards while going through typing lessons because of frustration. Any keyboard will do. After two months when you have enough confidence in you buy a mechanical keyboard or any keyboard of your choice. Happy Typing. ( It took some time writing this answer.
