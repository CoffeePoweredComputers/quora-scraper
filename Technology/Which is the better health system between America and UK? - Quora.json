            "answer_text": "If my husband and I did not have insurance from his job we both would have been dead before we were 50. We are now retired, he has chronic lymphocytic leukemia and I have had 3 surgeries for cancer. We would not have been able to pay for treatment or surgery for any of it. Last year the hospital charged our insurance company 487,000 dollars, that was for only one year, every 6 weeks my husband has a treatment that the hospital Bill's the insurance company $10,000. The insurance company only paid a fraction of that, they negotiated the price with the hospital. An individual would not be able to negotiate a price with the hospital and would be responsible for the entire amount. My husband and I would not have been able to pay even the amount the insurance company actually paid. Only people with good insurance or are on Medicare or Medicaid or are very rich can get good health care in the USA. It makes one think about why do we allow people to die in this country when the rest of the industrial, advanced countries in the world have universal health care. If you think that you don't need insurance or that it costs too much remember that one major illness in your family could wipe out your life's savings, you could lose your house, your car, and still die before your bills are paid.

            "answer_text": "If you have plenty of money or 5* health insurance, the US is excellent although clinicaloutcomes overall in the US are not very high up the league table - around 15th in terms of effectiveness. The UK system is in the world\u2019s top 10 and private health insurance and/or money can always get you better/faster treatment. UK doctors etc are also some of the world\u2019s best. For the population as a whole, the US system is horrible with decent health care denoed to 35 million people. The UK, or almost any centrally funded universal health care system in Europe, is better than the US system. The status of the helath of the population in the US is not that hiugh against almost all measures. ",
