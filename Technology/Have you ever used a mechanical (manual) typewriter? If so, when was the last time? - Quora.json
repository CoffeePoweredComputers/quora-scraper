            "answer_text": "I'm 47. Kind of at the cusp of the computer age. In grade school, I turned in handwritten essays. In high school, in the 1980s, some teachers wanted typed papers but by then electric typewriters were inexpensive. Once in awhile, I would use someone else's nonelectric typewriter. I'd use special paper where I could erase mistakes. The ribbons were messy. Keys often jammed. A carriage return was a physical thing. So was cutting-and-pasting. To move paragraphs, you could physically cut them with scissors and place them elsewhere. I'd then use a photocopier to make the pages look neat. The electric typewriters had little cartridges where I could go back and white out errors. One I used, a Sears Type-O-Graph, had a little LED screen, where I could see the type about 50 characters or so before printing. This helped a good deal. Going to college, in 1988, I brought an electric typewriter with me. The kind with a correcting ribbon. I was a Writing major, so used it a good deal. But by 1990, we were encouraged to use the new computer lab. They had 8088 PCs with Word Star. The dot matrix printers all going off at once were loud. But I didn't need the typewriter anymore and sold it for $70. Eventually, I picked up a used Apple IIc with printer from an ad in the paper for $130. When eBay hit in the late 1990s, my wife and I would go thrift storing and scavenge items to sell on online. We definitely came across a few typewriters, including a Sears Type-O-Graph, which I kept. It runs on batteries, but uses little pens to write, which are impossible to find. It only has one working pen left. I fire it up once in awhile to play with. It has no practical use. Maybe the last time was a few years ago, to answer your question.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I have used mechanical typewriters. I cannot remember the exact date of the last usage but I write here my experiences. The first typewriters available in Hungary did not contain the whole Hungarian character set. There was a place of small German \u2018\u00e4\u2019, the paragraph \u2018\u00a7\u2019, the square used in area units \u2018\u29e0\u2019 but some Hungarian characters were missing. Of course the layout was German = qwertzuiop. The German \u2018\u00df\u2019 was missing, \u201813\u2019 was typed in German texts instead of it.I have never been an quick and expert typist: my double letters looked like this \u201cattempt\u201d.If a frequently used scientific character was missing from the keyboard then you had to write in a large space them by black ink or go to the typewriter amending craftsman to replace the unnecessary keys according to your needs.I was already married and father of a 4 weeks old daughter when I met with my first law by chance. What about ought I chat with her? Surely not about her and my family state. I told her:\u2014 Here is my typewrite (Silver Reed, Japanese). I am bringing it to the service in order to replavr unnecessary Q-s and W-s with square brackets.She replied:\u2014 I cannot throw away W-s because I am writing my diploma work about the poet S\u00e1ndor We\u00f6res.Some years later my good old Silver Reed kicked the bucket because I was writing on in a competition in three carbon copies. I could by only a monstrous Erika made in East Germany.1990\u202691 ? I don\u2019t remember exactly when I discarded this Erica (whose real name should have been Br\u00fcnhilda) and bought a partially automated typewriter which had single-line memory and automatic correction mode using a white ribbon.",

            "answer_text": " Last night. I still write a fair number of letters. When I'm behind on correspondence, I'll switch from handwriting to my old \u201cportable\u201d manual typewriter. A friend or two have commented that getting one of my typewritten letters, where I don't bother with White-Out, is like getting a secret spy communique from The Cold War days. I learned to type on a manual and still look for full travel keyboards that can take a beating to this day. Manual typewriters have several advantages: No ink to buy. This ribbon will last years because I'm cheap.No distractions. I won't get sucked into reading about cool stuff on Quora. It's me, my typewriter, and my dictionary.Google has never once found out anything about me from what I've typed on my typewriter.My typewriter has never forced me to watch a short ad before allowing me to use the carriage return. ;-)When the thief broke into my house, he stole my ten year old laptop\u2026 but curiously, he left my typewriter alone (proof he was a Neanderthal).Yeah. I adore my typewriter. ",
