            "answer_text": " Snapchat Snapchat is poised to become the next hot messaging app, if it isn't already. After having reportedly turned down a $3 billion offer from Facebook and a reported $4 billion from Google, CEO Evan Spiegel has convinced investors his company is worth $16 billion, with more potentially on the way. Snapchat isn't generating much in revenue, with just $3 million from advertising and the company's Discover product seeing mixed results, but usage is growing like a weed. In May, Spiegel said Snapchat has close to 100 million daily active users in developed countries, with 65% of them contributing to the platform. For those worried about having a 25-year old being the CEO of a company that may soon be public, consider this: he wrote a lengthy email detailing his thoughts on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy actions and how that's helping prop up asset prices. Not bad for someone who just became legally allowed to rent a car.  Uber Uber is well on its way to becoming the next $100 billion company from Silicon Valley. It recently raised money valuing the company at $51 billion, making it the fastest company to reach that mark ever, surpassing Facebook. Uber, led by CEO Travis Kalanick, allows users to hail a cab straight from their phones, using either UberX, UberBlack, UberSUV or a traditional taxi, with UberTaxi. Founded in 2009, Uber is in more than 200 cities around the world, and appears poised to rapidly change the auto industry, as it works on autonomous vehicles. The company is expanding its offerings, having recently launched UberEATS in New York, a food delivery service. The company has experimented with delivering products from time to time, as it seeks to become more of a logistics company, a la UPS (UPS) or FedEx (FDX), than just a taxi alternative. In the past, Uber has held special events, including deliveries of ice cream, medicine, cats, Christmas trees and more. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, IT IS FACEBOOK!  Facebook is the only company which has the potential and ability to reach the world's entire population as it's customer base.  At the moment even Facebook has the most number of Active Monthly Users (AMU) and the highest money earner in mobile ads just within a single year it introduced FB ads in 2014. If you take iOS, Android and all desktop OS platformes, Facebook is already bigger than any of the single platform since it's on all combined. FB just started to monetize it's unique proposition in 2014 and it will have more users and user data that toppled Google, Bing, Yahoo, Apple and all the rest combined.  Most don't see this that way at the moment but FB is the reason any other company have a chance to go viral and Mark is already one of the most powerful guys in the valley being the youngest at the same time Those who all tout for Google Search for power,  Google Search is being unable to go inside App Stores or In Apps lately,  psst... So don't tell this Google yet.  Google's cash cow legendary Search IS FUNDEMENTALLY BROKEN in mobile. Also note Google has never really indexed anything in China either.  Now world's most informative information is held within in apps, they are not in the open web anymore where Google Search did shine,  with iPhone, Apple started the closure of the platformes where no Google Search Robots dare to go,  AppStores toppled it now mostly Facebook (WhatsApp, Instergram, App Links) holds more cards across cross platformes.  So unless if there is major mishap on Facebook side,  it's the only company which is selling to the entire world's population. No other company in the world will have such a customer base in our lifetime! ",
