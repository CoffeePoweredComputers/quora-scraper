            "answer_text": "Yes, I feel they are overblown. Identity theft doesn't really use information from the internet for its practices. It needs items, like the social security number, which are never shared in this manner. I would argue that security and identity theft are trying to penetrate secrecy, not privacy. The people that want these details are seeking things which you don't share with anyone, not those items that you feel safe discussing with your friends. Or your online shopping habits. Or the websites you browse. Your privacy does not put you at financial or physical risk when it is penetrated, only those things you keep secret do so and no one shares secret things in the internet. What's the difference between privacy and secrecy? might be a relevant question to review as a follow up to my answer. ",
