            "answer_text": "Myanmar has a lot of opportunities but to take over Singapore for 20 years, sorry. It won\u2019t happen if you just only give them 20 years to do so. Myanmar currently is facing so many struggle to become a relatively modern country. They are just rebuilding back their country after decades under junta rule, but so far, Myanmar suffers many difficulties which cannot be resolved one day: Its economic attractive in Myanmar is still so low comparing to others. After opening up in 2011, Myanmar has been hoping to attract more. But so far, still only Chinese, Thai, Russian, Vietnamese, Bangladeshi and Indian investors come there. Just recently seeing the flux of waves from Canada, Europe, Japan, America, Australia and Korea but still lower than standard.Its human development is not even better than any others. Myanmar is just on the similar level with Zimbabwe, Laos, Cambodia and DR Congo. This can\u2019t help them.Lack of skilled workers: when Vietnam opened up 25 years ago, Vietnam faced the same, but now we are becoming Asia\u2019s new startup machine and we are having a lot of high-qualified workers. Myanmar is not, but maybe it is possible for Myanmar to do so. They need to employ a massive good and highly skilled Burmese in around Burma and also sent their students to study abroad. Then you can be.Distrust among Burmese: the people in Burma are not united. This was the result of the ongoing civil war right now. Burma has to make all ethnics there work together. Especially like with the Karen people, or other ethnics like Rohingyas or Shan.Other interfere: letting someone interfering your development would harm you. Myanmar had been under Chinese control until 2011, but so far this country is still too weak to break the Chinese dominance inside.It is not impossible for Burma if they are guaranteed, but unless Singaporeans don\u2019t want to work anymore or Singaporeans go away of Singapore, Myanmar will have a lot of jobs to do. They have to reduce their problems. The opening of Yangon Stock Exchange can be considered as the new chapter of Burma, but this is not enough. You have to make sure your country is ready to compete. First, try to reduce poverty. Second, encourage privitization. Third, unite all Burmese. Fourth, limited foreign influences into an accepted level. You can\u2019t take over Singapore for 20 years with that low level. You have to aim to the level of Bangladesh first, then, try to be like Thailand, and dream to South Korea. Vietnam knows their limits so right now Vietnam is aiming to be like Thailand and then, South Korea. Know your limit, and make a clear target at first. When you qualify, target to a further one. It will make Burma have a chance. ",

            "answer_text": "For me it unpossible, it could be 30 years or even more than that, just remember Myanmar are still fighting a civil war for 60 years and there are haven\u2019t any sign to end in next 10 years meanwhile the ARSA group are still making chaos in Rakhine State and since other rebel groups still there, they are armed and cannot be control by the Tatwadam. For economic, Myanmar are going great since 2011, but after 7 years Myanmar still can\u2019t change their investment laws are are still not suitable for the FDI and the foreigner enterprises to enter the country, example the city Yangon have the most expensive rent price in the SEA region($80/m2/month), the laws for foreigner to reach real estate also quite bad, they can only rent a piece of land for only a year except they can have a real estate license for 70 years. FDI flow into Myanmar also decrease in2016 because Rohingya dispute, just take Vietnam, Indonesia, and Philippines to make a small comparison. FDI flow into Vietnam in 2017 is $36 billion, Indonesia is $32.24 billion, Philippines $8 billion, meanwhile FDI flow into Myanmar in fiscal year 2016/2017 only around $6,65 billion. Even Vietnam GDP are larger than Myanmar for 2,9 times $75 billion to $220 billion, but a lot of guys in Nam know Vietnam can\u2019t surpass Singapore even on 30 years, about economic, there are a lot of thing to look out, GDP/capital, life quality import \u2013 export operation \u2026 ",
