            "answer_text": "According to Elon Musk, the problem with the current education system is that teachers teach the tools and not the problem. They will talk about 30 different types of screwdrivers that are available and the kids must memorise; but, if they were to describe the problem of how to get two things to hold together, the child would start thinking and would naturally become curious about the screwdriver. Likely, even end up learning about more tools available to get things to hold together due to their curiosity. I hope to one day help reverse the model on a national level, but for now, I created Einee - Talk to Einstein. One can talk to Einstein, Cleopatra, Leonardo Da Vinci and learn by simply talking. The app attempts to reverse the way education is fed. Play-first, education is second. ",
