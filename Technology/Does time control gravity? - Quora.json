            "answer_text": "Time controls nothing expect for the human. I think I might get what is being asked here but not positive. So does time control gravity? My first answer was no, gravity controls time but that\u2019s to simple right, not really. How does gravity control time. Time is nothing more than an object moving from point to point , a distance through space or space time. Gravity is something we don't understand because of the standard model. We will not understand gravity until they get over the idea that the standard model is junk. But time is not fundamental to the universe there is no such thing as time. Humans created the idea of time to use it for coordinating things and named it time. Gravity is a fundamental part of the universe. If there was something considered time it would be a moment the moment our conscious is present that is the only time that exists. Space time is describing space to the masses because we can\u2019t comprehend what space is other than the amount of time it takes to get from one point to another. Gravity controls movement and movement is time because anything with mass is affected by gravity . Either it will move faster or slower depending on the proximity to the curvature of space and time creating the force we call gravity. What a minute now my answer is yes but how can that be right. The issue is I m not sure what your meaning by time. but if you are referring to time as the movement through space meaning space controls gravity i don\u2019t know. The question is clever. ",

            "answer_text": "Einstein shows us that time is relative, depending on your viewpoint. What we can observe is that time slows as mass increases, the greater the mass, the more time slows, with black holes at the centre of galaxies stoping time completely. It is also observable that all matter is moving from where time is relatively faster to where time is slower or stops completely. So rather than time controlling gravity, gravity controls time, perhaps gravity is simply matter moving towards where time slows and eventually stops. ",
