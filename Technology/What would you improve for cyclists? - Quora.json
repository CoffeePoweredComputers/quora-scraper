            "answer_text": "This kind of question inspires thoughts that come from a different perspective. People that are riding a bicycle everyday are already receiving the benefits. Improvements for them may make their experience more enjoyable and safer, but it will not increase the amount of benefits they get from riding, unless they ride more because of the improvements. These people will save society in health care cost, if they continue riding a bicycle everyday. So the purpose of improvements should be to get more people to ride a bicycle more frequently. These improvements would pay for themselves in coming years, if they succeeded in getting more people to ride. And it would benefit the cyclist. They would have less cars to deal with and slightly better air quality to breath. Here are some numbers to consider. If every gallon of gasoline was taxed one penny, there would be an estimated 470 million dollars for bicycle infrastructure. That's so far in 2019 only. If this infrastructure increased the amount of people commuting by bicycle to 25%, which is just half of the trips in cars that are 5 miles or less (US Household Travel Survey), it would prevent the release of 108 million tons of car exhaust in the same period. Then there is the savings in health care cost. And studies by various organizations suggest that, based on the Netherlands, societies that bicycle more are happier. When one considers that in just 4 months the dollars spent on 11 billion gallons of gasoline would still be in Americans pockets with this 25% scenario, one knows that would have a significant economic impact. Politician could not be counted to support any project that could have such a result. Any campaign would be blasted by a public relations anti-campaign funded by Big Oil. That\u2019s what using customers dollars to keep them customers looks like. It seems the only way to get improvements so more people can enjoy the benefits of riding a bicycle everyday, is to change the value of a bicycle in the minds of enough people that a significant number will support bicycle friendly infrastructure. According to U.S. Census data, 70% of American said they would like to ride their bicycles more. But how would we get people to act on those desires? My hope is in the youth that are not yet gasoline customers. This is what I would improve for cyclists. The education of the next generation, on the benefits of riding a bicycle eveyday, and the real cost of driving a car powered by an internal combustion engine. There is not any reason I can think of, why a society wouldn't want it's children to learn why the bicycle is one of the most beneficial, yet overlooked inventions in human history. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I cycle a lot. In an ideal world, I wouldn't particularly want segregation. I'd be happy to just use the existing road infrastructure. If everyone could get along. If drivers of 1+ ton of metal never made mistakes. If they gave me 1.5 m (5 ft) when overtaking, and didn't overtake towards junctions, blind bends, that sort of thing. But the world isn't ideal. Good infrastructure in cities would be nice, but traffic in cities is slow. It's much easier to mix with city traffic travelling at 20 mph than busy intercity routes with 60 mph limits. At the same time, city drivers can be maniacs\u2026 Education. It's not compulsory to use the cycle routes. They're often OK if you're travelling at 10 mph, but, if you cycle at 20 mph like me, they can be downright awful. It's safer to stay on the road at such speeds. It would be good if drivers understood this. Overtaking safely, too. Good cycle routes (i.e not yielding at every side road) would be amazing, but that doesn't seem to be the done thing in the UK. Quiet 20 mph roads (or 30 mph, but 20 is better), with patient drivers, are a good substitute. Regarding intercity journeys, I love doing these. However, navigation of back roads isn't easy, and main roads are busy. Sometimes, there are nice quiet A roads, but it's at the mercy of the Strava hive mind. Sustrans do some long distance routes, but they're not always suitable for road bikes. I'd like nice wide dedicated bicycle highways with a tarmac surface (Holland has something like this). Maintenance wouldn't be huge, and they could use the general routes of the existing motorway network. However, rail travel is more practical for intercity commuters, so this would be the preserve of lycra-clad roadies. I wouldn't mind paying a toll to use such routes!  The dream  Good, by UK standards. This is adjacent to a motorway, crossing the River Severn. ",

            "answer_text": "I would like bycycle specific infrastructure. Not after thought bike lanes on normal roads, but actual 6 or 8 foot wide paths away from normal roads. The idea being that if I decide to go 2 towns over on my bicycle I could ride a mile or 2 to the bike highway, hop on, pedal for a while, and hop off in the town I was aiming for Alternatly I would like to see normal roads built with seperated bike lanes, complete with physical barriers that would keep cars out of that space, as can be seen in the neatherlands Another thing I would like to see is more space alocated to secure bicycle parking. Not necessarily dedicated buildings, but more good bike racks in well traveled spaces, and perhaps a secure room in most workplaces to park a bike. If its feasable to ride a bike to and from work, but there is no way to secure your bike safely, its no longer feasable to commute by bike. Truely secure bike parking is probably not feasable in the short term, not enough people ride to make it a priority in most places. However, if there were infrastructure improvments that encouraged more people to ride, it becomes very possible that in time, many buisnesses would bend over backwards to offer such a perk to their employyees and customers Another rhing I would like to see is some legeslative changes acknowledging the differences between a bicycle and a car. Such as rules specificly allowing for cyclist to treat red lights as stop signs and stop aigns as yeilds. Such laws, where they have been implemented have proven to increase rider saftey, and reduce congestion. Last but not least, I would like to see driver education improve, and even a rider safety course implemented, to make drivers more aware of the hazzards faced by cyclist, and to ensure new cyclist are aware of the hazzards they will face. An emphasis on measures a cyclist should and should not take to protect themselves0 from traffic. Last (for real this time) I would love to find a decent taillight that functions as a turn signal. Something very robust, with amazing battery life and very bright lights that clearly shows any body behind tlme that I am definatly planning to turn or take the lane, or change lanes. Such signals exist, but I have yet to find one that seems to be worth the cost( if any one knows of a legit worth while bike turnsignal, please feel free to offer up a suggestion) ",
