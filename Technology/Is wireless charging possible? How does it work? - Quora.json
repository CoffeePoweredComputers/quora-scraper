            "answer_text": "Wireless Charging ??? Hmmm every new thing allures human mind and it'll definitely if it's having some mighty powers to show off. Wireless Charging can be considered as inductive charging. Okay so how does it work? It basically creates an inductive magnetic field. So if a device is fitted with the proper induction coil inside than the energy will be received from the created magnetic field so that it receives  power having no physical connection with any charging device. Inductive charging is not incorporated right now as its going through some glitchs. Don't worry you will come to know. But there's one problem with this so called inductive charging technology. Efficiency/conversion of supplied energy to charge the device is so low that the device charges very slowly. All in your device must be prefitted with the inductive coil than only it will have the communication. Though it attracts the consumer as it is very alluring to charge your device without having any problem of tangled wires it has its own limitations I.e. distance. Currently, apple inc. has patented a device allegedly charging the device uoto 1 metre.  But Intel is working hard to achieve this and also made there grounds clear by signaling that this technology won't be limited with the mobile phones only. So in which devices you want it? Here's what they said. We think the ability to have a wire-free charging experience with a broad ecosystem of devices like keyboards, mice, storage devices, cameras and smartphones will be realized in the near future,\" said Gary Huang, director of PC Growth and Innovation at Intel. Inductive charging technology is having its own llimitations so it isn't been used still very openly. WiTricity an MIT company is having numerous patents on this so called speculated technology. They have implemented the magnetic resonance  technology which can charge devices  up to 80 feet's and even with wall dividing a room don't make any difference at all. Here magnetic coil transmits and the receiving device accepts it . But the device must be tuned to the resonance frequency. Every one is coming up with their own technology and are claiming to be the most efficient from their perspective but here's where the problem arises. Which of the so called methods be used?   In coming years it won't be uncommon to find every not comprised of wireless charging. Because every company will be pushing themselves to incorporate this and will end up with numerous devices.  I guess you might be knowing about QI standard of wireless charging which was first unveiled/made publicin CES 2012. Several devices support this standard.  So coming to your question, Yes, wireless charging is possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Wireless charging is a way to get power to a battery-powered device like a cell phone without using a wire. There is a small base that is plugged in to the wall. When you set your phone on it, it charges. There are a lot of ways to do that, but the popular term \u201cwireless charging\u201d is usually referring to a Wireless Power Consortium standard called Qi (pronounced \u201cchee\u201d). Here\u2019s a simple analogy for how it works: Imagine you have two magnets, one in your charging base and one in your cell phone. If they\u2019re close enough, turning one magnet will make the other turn. Using a motor turning the base magnet, and a generator to harness power from the phone magnet, the generator can use that power to charge the phone. The motor and generator have just been combined with their magnets to manage the rotating magnetic field in a more efficient way. Qi is primarily built to work like an air-core transformer. Transformers work by using electromagnetic coils to build a magnetic field on the input side, and then similar electromagnetic coils on the receiving side to turn that field back into electricity. This is usually for the purpose of converting voltage, but it can also get power across an air gap. There is one last thing Qi does: the cell phone will briefly put the \u201cbrakes\u201d on the rotating magnetic field in a special pattern that tells the base how strong to make the field. This ensures that the base charges the phone at the right rate, and doesn\u2019t heat up loose change or waste power when the phone isn\u2019t there. Here are the internals to a Qi charging base:  The coil produces the rotating magnetic field, and it\u2019s backed by a gray ferrite pad to store, aim and shape the magnetic field ideally. The receiving coil looks very similar, but it\u2019s smaller. This is hidden between the battery and the rear of the case in Qi-enabled phones.  ",
