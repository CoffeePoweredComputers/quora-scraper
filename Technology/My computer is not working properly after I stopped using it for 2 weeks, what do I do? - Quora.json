            "answer_text": "It all depends on the exact symptoms. Leaving a computer off for two weeks shouldn\u2019t cause problems, or nobody could go on vacation. I packed up my extra desktop machine for a few weeks while my brother visited. I just powered it back up and everything works fine . So, what exactly are you experiencing? Does the machine boot without problems? Is it slow? Are you getting the \u201cblue screen of death\u201d\u2014 occasionally or often? Is the video coming up in the wrong resolution? Is there no sound? Tackle the most irritating symptom first. I suspect that the fact that you let the machine sit idle for two weeks has nothing to do with the problem. Liran Cohen\u2019s suggestion to let a PC technician look at the machine is always a viable suggestion. They can run diagnostics and tell you definitively that you actually have a problem\u2014 or are misremembering what your computer was like two weeks ago. :) ",
