            "answer_text": "\u201cMore powerful\u201d isn\u2019t really very well defined in this context. There\u2019s nothing that a quantum computer can compute that a classical computer cannot also compute. It just appears that there some classes of problems that a quantum computer can solve faster. But quantum computers aren\u2019t likely to be practical for a very long time. You\u2019re not going to be running a quantum version of Chrome, for example. I doubt they\u2019ll ever be more than highly specialized coprocessors like GPUs. If that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s hard to argue that a GPU is \u201cmore powerful\u201d than a regular processor\u2014it does some things very well, but others not. The general-purpose processor is more useful across the whole range of tasks we want computers to perform. So, if you want a purely theoretical measure of \u201cpower\u201d, then a quantum computer is no more powerful than a Turing machine. We don\u2019t really even have any theoretical model of computing that\u2019s more powerful than a Turing machine. If you want a practical, utilitarian measure of \u201cpower\u201d, then quantum computers are less powerful than classical computers outside of a pretty small problem domain. ",
