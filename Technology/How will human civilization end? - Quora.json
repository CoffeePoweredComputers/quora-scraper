            "answer_text": "Everything will be business as usual superficially, while the underlying problems keep getting worse and worse. Politicians will keep blocking reforms that would be needed for sustained survival arguing for the same old reasons of economic growth and free markets and anti-communism. Basically it would look something like this: Republicans Vote To Repeal Obama-Backed Bill That Would Destroy Asteroid Headed For Earth. But instead of a giant asteroid, it would be the collective collapse of global industries fueled by (pun intended) unsustainable energy and infrastructures. The issue is that changes of catastrophic proportion do not happen progressively in such a way that once we are actually over the edge, we can simply patch our behavior and get back to the safe zone. Catastrophes happen suddenly and irreversibly. Think about going on a hike through the desert. Say you need to hike for 4 hours and refuse to take water with you. At the beginning you feel great! You have less weight to carry, and you are at top health! You go faster than every other hiker that packed a gallon of water for the trip. To all short sighted metrics you were better off than every other hiker around. Then things start to get rough. You realize that you are not doing as well as you were at the beginning, but it would be a lot of work to go back and get water. It would cost you a huge amount of effort to back track, and it seems reasonable that you should instead continue. Measurable progress is being made, after all, and it is not clear that the huge investment in backtracking is worth your time. You decide to move forward. As you get further and further away from the starting point, the cost to go back is greater and greater. The incentive to back-track is directly increasing due to your tiredness and dehydration, but so is the cost! Ultimately, the incentive to continue is counter balanced by the cost of going back. So you decide to go forward at each step, and it seems like the most logical decision (locally, anyway). This overall incentive to continue is maintained until the cost of going back is so large that if you tried, you would certainly die trying. At this point, you have no choice but to continue and hope for the best. And then you die of dehydration and exhaustion. What went wrong? You made the rational choice at each point? Of course, in this example, you can clearly see the whole picture and realize that you should have taken water instead of optimizing for short term gains. The problem is that in the real world and global-scale economy, this big picture is not as clear. And there would certainly be people who would not think that the risk is high enough. Just as there are people that actually decide not to take water when hiking on a desert, there are politicians that don't think climate change, or ecological devastation, or depletion of non-renewables are actually a big deal. And just as idiotic hikers die when making stupid choices, these politicians, corporations and general public are betting our collective survival on their global assessment of risk being accurate. Unfortunately for all of us, all evidence points to them being wrong. We will die, and they will drive us right into it, one exhausting step in the hot-hot-sun at a time. ",

            "answer_text": "Like Icarus flying too close to the sun\u2026 we will make ourselves dependent on technologies that become more and more complex. At the same time they become more complex, we will become more dependent on them. One day, the whole thing will enter into a territory where things that go wrong grow into bigger problems instead of dissipating into smaller and smaller problems. This will persist for a few hours without consequence, and then quietly, and without anyone noticing, there will be a very small problem that sets in motion a kind of tragic Rube Goldberg machine of our undoing. Very few will notice the problem while it is in its earliest phase. Then the problem will start to grow exponentially. This might happen on day 2 or 3. Once it starts to grow, people will notice. Critical systems will fail. Maybe the tracking system at UPS, or maybe it will be the SmartGrid. These failures will start to propagate and affect other systems. Before long there will be a run on banks and grocery stores. Some people will start to notice and see what is happening and try to keep things holding together. But there will be others who will quickly move to protect themselves at the expense of others. We might see some communities blow up a bridge to keep outsiders away from their grocery store. We might see looting and shootings in response to the violence. Before long, the internet will fail, and with it our main source of news will be gone. There will no longer be food in the grocery store. Electrical power will be gone. All the information we rely on in Wikipedia and Google will no longer be available to us. Heritage seed banks will be raided by mobs looking for food. Livestock and zoo animals alike will be hunted for food. There will be rumors of cannibalism that nobody will be able to substantiate. The urban centers will empty themselves into the surrounding rural areas as people do the math and realize that staying in the city leads to certain starvation. Reactions to this vary wildly, with some communities dealing with it as an invading army, with others trying to cobble together a new community with the influx of people. But the numbers are simply too great. There are too many people. There is no food for today\u2019s needs, there is no food for next week, and with everyone starving, people make the fatal mistake of eating anything and everything that could have been planted in the next spring. People are dying at a prodigious rate now. Some countries were relatively insulated from the mess\u2014 like Bhutan. But little by little they realize that even they miscalculated how dependent they are on the rest of the world. They cannot get replacement computer chips. The chips exist\u2014 and nobody is using them. But all the information about where they are is in a computer that no longer has power. Fossil fuels run out. The cycle is greatly delayed there, but it happens nonetheless\u2026 There are too many hungry people and the rule of law eventually fails. Some other countries with brutal dictators see the tsunami a week before it hits them, and they hatch a bold plan to survive it. Brutal methods are employed to keep order. Public executions. Genocide. It seems for a little while that they will keep a toehold on modern civilization. But even they will make mistakes. They will have become used to a surveillance culture that relies on electronics and computers. They have forgotten how to run a dictatorship using paper. The result is that an insurrection begins and cannot be put down. The regime topples. In parts of Africa and South America, though, the metaphorical tsunami laps up and only wets their feet. In the Andean mountains, in Central Africa, and possibly\u2014 just possibly\u2014 in isolated pockets of North America, what they experience is that their phones don\u2019t work anymore. They still have to walk for water every morning. They stop seeing coffee at the market. They can\u2019t get sugar anymore. They don\u2019t really know what is happening outside their community. But they don\u2019t die. Icarus\u2019 mistake was not that he glued feathers to his arms. It was that he put himself into a position where he relied on those feathers staying put. When the sun melted off the feathers he was in a position that he could not survive the fall. We are approaching this point. Possibly we have already passed it. From where we are now, if we fall\u2014civilization is set back to the Iron Age. ",
