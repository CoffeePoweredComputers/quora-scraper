            "answer_text": "Depend, Earlier inkjet printer especially in earlier 90\u2019s had used fairly standard ink, and it was relatively easy for third party ink company to formulate one that is closer. Also, manufactures were not exactly into Razor & blade business model just yet. In contrast, Modern inkjet at least past decade or so often uses fairly unique formula, to be exact what is unique is what give specific viscosity to specific ink color. Typically they use fairly specific type of polymer for each ink formula, which are guarded by their own patents. So, third party ink manufacture typically have to do guessing work to get right color, and viscosity while not infringing these patents (as inkjet manufacture always tried to go after them). And because they will often need to use fairly different way to get particular viscosity, there are chance they done formula wrong, that may not help inkjet head last for several ink tank change. But some of formula are really well made and have no problem especially if you use particular third party ink from the start. But, it is depend on who you have sourced ink, so it will be difficult type of question to answer in forum like here. ",

            "answer_text": "When ink is used that didn't come from the manufacturer (either refill or non-OEM new cartridges), it is possible for it to cause problems. The most likely issue is print quality problems like colors that aren't quite right. The most serious issue would be if the ink plugs up the print head. Worst case, the print head cleaning won't work and the print head has to be replaced. At that point, you would probably be better off replacing the printer. Bottom line, you have to trust that the ink manufacturer knows enough about the printing system and ink formulation to make a good product. Larger manufacturers are more likely to have done the necessary testing to make sure the ink works well. Keep in mind that different printer generations may need different ink formulations\u200b. ",
