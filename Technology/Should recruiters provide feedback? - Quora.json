            "answer_text": "I'm primed to just bluntly say yes. But... It's a tricky question to answer, so I'll give my best shot at it. From a company's standpoint Recruiters have to find the best talent. They don't care how the person will improve after the meeting if they're not a good fit to hire now. Their main focus is to find the best fit for the job, not to educate the potential fits how to get better in time. From that standpoint, a recruiter giving feedback may be considered as a time investment that isn't generating an expect ROI (or in blunt terms, the appropriate hire). Not to mention proper feedback should be done on a personalised basis and it's better if it's constructive (a feedback the candidate can focus on and improve in the long-term), and to find that a recruiter has to invest his time into something that isn't his or her core activity. Note that the branding aspect isn't that big from just giving feedback. Simply notifying them with a short \"thank you for your application, but we chose someone else\" will have a similar branding effect. At the end of the day, you have to understand what people really want and what matters to them. And getting a great response from a recruiter although is good, but if the terms of employment are bad, no one will care they received a good response in the long run. Let me give you an example, I applied for a job a few years back in a company that had a really friendly hiring process. You get notifications for every step, and when I wasn't hired they gave me the exact terms I wasn't - it was an automated email just listing the terms, but I really liked it. After a while, I worked with another company, and heard stories from the first. The terms and environment their employees work in is just bad. I'd never work for them after I heard that, and although I still like their emails, the current notion just hurts them, as I'm one of those who spread the bad words about their company. One more notion here, great feedback can hurt a person, and in some cases the person you're giving it to may not like it (they feel like you're condescending or similar), so be careful here in terms of branding. From an employee's standpoint This is basically a no-brainer, every employee would love to hear feedback on why they didn't get the job. Even if it's hurtful, it gives them an idea of what to do next, and what to improve. The worst feeling you can have is sending a bunch of applications and not getting a single word back, or going on interviews, thinking it went great and you never hear back from them. Especially in most cases, the situation was just that someone was a better fit because of a company's preference. I think a big value for them is seeing the picture from the eyes of the employer, understanding how they appear to someone who's screening them. From an overall perspective I would say it would benefit the job market if recruiters would give out feedback. It would give them an idea of where to improve and basically tell them - you need to improve. (saying this because a lot of people just send out millions of applications without trying to improve anything and don't look at themselves if they're the cause of not getting a job) This would come back to the companies, as continuous improvement makes a better workforce for them to choose from. Yeah, it would be harder to find one if you have more better candidates, but I'd rather have to choose on from 10 great, rather than find an ok-ish one from 10 so-so One more addition, currently this situation is more in the hands of the candidates. We recently had a job opening and 50% of the people didn't have a proper CV or a good motivation letter. Those two documents are one of the basic steps to a good job application, and that part should be solely on the candidate. You can find quite a good form after doing an hour or 2 of research online.

            "answer_text": "It is uncommon to find the recruiters who will take a time and give feedback to the applicants, especially to those who are rejected! There are also some companies that don't even inform the candidates that they are not shortlisted. What the HR teams of such companies don't understand is that their habit of not giving feedback may put them at trouble in future. There are a few reasons why the recruiters should always give feedback to the candidates: 1. Hearing nothing from the employer sometimes becomes really frustrating for some applicants. The HR teams consider that the applicants wouldn't take it personally but in fact, some bad experiences they never forget! Eventually, this thing affects the overall reputation of the company in the market. 2. After one bad experience or the feeling of negligence, chances are there that the recruiters may lose some very talented candidates. They might never apply again in your companies, even they have an open offer. 3. Recruiters often think that it doesn't come under their responsibilities to give feedback to all the candidate. Hence, those who are in real need of a job, would reapply for the same job again and again avoiding their feeling of negligence. This way, the recruiters may occur a mistake of hiring a non-deserving candidate! Therefore, being recruiters, you should always give feedback \u2013 no matter whether it's direct or indirect. Feedbacks will keep nurturing a strong relationship with the job applicants and will help you in the future to hire talented resources. ",
