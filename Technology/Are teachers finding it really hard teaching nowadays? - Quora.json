            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t say that I do. I\u2019ve been teaching for 16 years, and I find it no more difficult today than I did when I began. Sure, there are differences between now and then, but I think of myself as flexible enough to accommodate those changes. I have the same principal, so there is consistency in my school's administration. National and state policies have also changed, but since I teach science they haven\u2019t affected me as much as the ELA and math teachers. I teach high school, so the punitive 3\u20138 testing regime also doesn\u2019t affect me. I hate the cell phones, but firm rules and being backed up by the main office take care of those issues. The kids? Well they are the same, and they are a joy to work with every day. I have no idea if I just got lucky with my situation, or it is a reflection of myself and my particular personality and skills, but I just don\u2019t find teaching harder nowadays. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many challenges facing classroom teachers today. Perhaps the most difficult challenge to overcome is the ubiquitous use of technology and social media because it really interferes with learning and impedes the development of crucial relationships that kids need. While it is true that students must be comfortable with technology, they shouldn\u2019t be able to use it in place of real communication with their teachers and peers. I think teaching has become more of a job instead of a profession or vocation because teachers are held responsible for outcomes they cannot control and many teachers are not able to use their expertise; rather they are encouraged to use apps., programs, and other tech. products that may or may not be useful to students. The biggest obstacle is that the teaching profession has been eviscerated by bureaucrats, politics, and poor technology integration. That\u2019s why teaching is harder today. ",

Administrators who do not know what they are doing Administrators who just want to please the kids and their parents. Overcrowded classrooms. Students who threaten other students, threaten teachers, beat up other students, hit teachers and who are not expelled. The requirement that he be on page 327, teaching Parabolas on April 5th, or he risks being written up for not following curriculum guidelines. ",
