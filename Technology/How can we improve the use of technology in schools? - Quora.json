            "answer_text": "I am a school technology person for a k-8 school. At present, we have more technology tools than we know what to do with. Literally. Most of our teachers do not know how to use technology. I watch teachers tell students how to google for a web address by SEARCHING form the complete address \u201c google for pbskids.com\u201d. I watch teachers showing kids how to center a title\u2026. by hitting the space bar until its centered. I help teachers who cannot create the simplest spreadsheet to add a column of numbers. You want to improve the use of technology in classrooms? Stop letting teaching credential students graduate without the first fucking clue how to USE a computer! If they don\u2019t know how to type with more than two fingers, and don\u2019t know the difference between typing a web adress and googling for a search phrase then they have no business teaching in a 21st century classroom! You want technology to get USED in a classroom? You want technology skills taught to children? Then take professional development for teachers in the technology subject area as seriously as you would take math professional development for teachers who can\u2019t add, subtract, multiply, and divide. You want kids to be able to actually USE a computer, rather than just play games, then you need teachers who can use computers. Teachers who actually DO use computers to prepare their own materials\u2026 maybe knowing how to create a document and print it, rather than spend twice the time cutting and taping together worksheets to photocopy (a pet peeve of mine when the copy machine is also a high speed scanner.. Which they do not undertand or know how to use, because they have never been trained!). We expect a lot out of teachers, and loading on yet another set of continueing education classes is going to cost a lot, and cause a shitstorm from angry teachers who, sad to say, are very resistant to learning new skills (and hey, lets be honest, we ALL are resistant at times!). We need to do it. If a teacher right out of a credential program has deficient technology skills, don\u2019t hire them. Tell their credential program that it has unacceptable technology standards. If a teacher already in a classroom does not have sufficient technology skills, they should get technology training from the school district, and be required to demonstrate proficiency. They should be compensated for this, but it should be required. We have 20th century standards for teachers when it comes to technology, and It\u2019s the 21st century. ",

            "answer_text": "I think a very first thing is that the application of technology should not be too complicated (or simple enough) so that school teachers can use technologies without spending too much time, energy or even money in learning how to use it. Technologies are tools and should be able to facilitate teachers\u2019 instructional design, development, implementation and assessment, not to make these activities more complicated. The other thing is to help current school teachers to be equipped with more skills of using technologies. Meanwhile, some teachers may resist the use of technologies in their existing teaching. For these teachers, training should be focused on changing their attitudes toward technologies and let them believe that technology is not a monster but a friend or assistant to them. Another thing is that technology should be practical and could be used on a frequent or regular basis. The use of technology should not be for one or two presentations, but for more practical purposes. For example, VR could be a nice assistant technology for science and biology classes. However, only if this technology can be used in classes frequently rather than for only 10 minutes in one single class, will it become successful and be welcomed by schools and teachers. ",

            "answer_text": "Fund all the schools who don\u2019t have computers or laptops for the underprivileged students in their district. Poor black and immigrant communities, government housing students etc. Every CHILD should have their own technological device not just access from a library or classroom. coupons should be given or a \u201crogers Roget\u201d that provides access to the internet with limited hours so kids don\u2019t use it entirely to play video games or watch a movie with the family. It should not be given to the parents to use for their pleasure. Fine the parents not the kid. Force teachers who are not comfortable with the computer esp. older elementary teacher to take a course on search engines, word processing, spreadsheets. Make them create these for their own work that they need for administration to use like marks entry, report card comment entry, etc. Make it a mandatory course. Make it a requirement when hiring a teacher as part of an interview process that they word-process and email to the Principal, use a spread sheet with various tasks in it, write a comment on a report card, search for information using a search engine other than google. If teachers can\u2019t do these skills then they can\u2019t teach them. These are basic skills. Every teacher needs to be able to do this. Principals should not be spending hours deciphering written comments from teachers and entering them onto student report cards. That is done! and it is ridiculous!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t ever use technology for the sake of using technology. Only use technology when it provides an added benefit. For example, it\u2019s clearly better for me to present my lectures using a google slides document, complete with images, bullet points, breaks for short youtube videos, student activities, animations, and all the other things that can hold a person\u2019s attention, than it is for me to stand there and talk for half an hour. I can also record myself presenting and post the product on my classroom page for students to access whenever they need. On the other hand, studies have conclusively shown that taking notes by hand the old-fashioned way is more effective at helping students understand and remember than providing them with prepared notes or letting them take notes on a laptop or phone.
