            "answer_text": "Some laundry detergents contain what is called bleach alternative, which is sort of what it sounds like. It is added to detergents to make them more powerful at stain fighting. But before I get into that, let me give you a background on bleach.      \"Regular\" bleach is chlorine based. This is especially effective at stain removal. However, chlorine bleach produces harmful fumes and damages clothing quite often. Have you ever seen a bleach stain? Well, it is not really a stain in the sense of the word. Chlorine bleach is used to lift color from clothing. Often, while lifting the stain, it lifts most of the color from the parts of the clothes in contact with the bleach. In order to fix the \"stain\", one would have to dye the area back to its original color. Most people do not even know where to begin doing that, so the clothing is essentially ruined. That's why this type of bleach is primarily used on white clothes.           Bleach alternative is meant to prevent such things from occurring. Bleach can be made out of all sorts of things, but the most popular kinds are oxygen based ( i.e. hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate, sodium precarbonate). The main ingredient oxidizes within clothing, lifting stains. These are much safer to use on clothes and can prove equally as effective as traditional bleaches. However, it works slower than traditional bleach. Clothes may need to be pre-soaked. Other than that, it is perfectly fine and works on a large range of types and fabric types and colors.        THAT is why it is used in  laundry detergents. It is an effective way to boost the power of a laundry detergent without harming clothes of varying colors. Regular detergent does not have the added boost of bleach alternative. It is simply your average, run-of-the-mill detergent, and it might not work as well as the other kind.       I know I elaborated quite a bit, but I hope this answers your question! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, bleach.  However, one will soften and fray the fibers of your clothing faster than the other- and that one is the one with bleach.  Bleach is very hard on fibers- it whitens, sometimes brightens and if it contains chlorine, it sanitizes, but it also breaks down the fibers faster. So does softener- even faster than the usual amount of bleach in your wash-tub.  That's what softener means: It \"softens\" the clothing by \"softening\" the fibers. My mother had a more succinct explanation:  It rots your clothing. ",
