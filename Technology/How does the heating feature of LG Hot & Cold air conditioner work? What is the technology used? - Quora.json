            "answer_text": "LG and all other brands use the same technology. In summer season you see that inside the room AC throwes cold air in the room. Actually AC circulates the room air through its cooling coil. While AC throwes hot air in atmosphere from its backside. Air conditioner absorbs heat from the room air and transfers the same heat to atmosphere. In winter season we make the AC in reverse position. No no not by fitting it in reverse position. But this function is done technically. A reverse valve is fitted in the Refrigeration system of AC which makes its function reverse. Only you have to press a switch ' Hot' on your remote. The reverse valve is activated which makes the refrigeration cycle reverse. If you have an ordinary AC which only cools the air , you can fit the reverse valve by an expert. Which costs you rs 4000.00 to rs 5000.00 approximately. ",
