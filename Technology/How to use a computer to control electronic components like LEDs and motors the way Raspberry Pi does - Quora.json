            "answer_text": "Once upon a yesteryear, the once ubiquitous parallel printer port was the interface of choice for this sort of thing. As such ports disappeared from computers more than 20 years past, it is no longer an option for you (unless you still have a very old desktop running MS DOS or something like it). Your most straightforward option is to troll on the Web (particularly large Chinese vendor sites) for a USB interface of the correct type. These are normally quite low cost and not difficult to use. Among the sort of interfaces you can obtain that are USB 2 or 3 compliant are\u2026 USB to RS232USB to RS485USB to I2C (ftdi)USB to SPI (ftdi)USB to Dallas 1-wire.USB to stepper-motor controller (usually with microstepping).USB to 4/8/16/32 on/off digital/analogue input and/or output.USB to LED driver devices (including semiprofessional DMX512).USB to audio or video streaming (various analogue and digital standards). And so-on. In a more professional way, most of the above can also be obtained and more using ETHERNET network/s. This type of network has been in use for a number of years to control and monitor large factories of many types. The cost of such gear is usually a lot more expensive and carries mandatory industrial compliance as a significant portion of the cost. If you are more interested in remote/wireless (eg: controlling lights in your house), then there are also many options available here as well - most are Wi-Fi (some Bluetooth) and many are cloud-based (avoid the cloud based ones would be my suggestion). If you go in this direction you are firmly captured by the IOT upsurge - watch the hype and the hooks - of which there are many but too numerous to recount here. The goal-posts are moving all the time in this electronic control/monitoring sector. Good hunting. And \u201cCaveat Emptor\u201d. ",
