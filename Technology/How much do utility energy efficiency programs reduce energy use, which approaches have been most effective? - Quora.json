            "answer_text": "I'll answer my own question, after speaking with Chuck Goldman, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab http://eetd.lbl.gov/ea/emp/staff/Goldman.html:  For many years utilities have used a combination of rebates and low interest loans to subsidize the purchase of energy-efficient appliances, lights, and other energy-efficient equipment for factories. Some of these programs are general, available to all of the utilities' customers. Some are actually customized for large industrial customers. A good overview of Ratepayer- Funded Energy Efficiency in the U.S. is here:eetd.lbl.gov/ea/ems/reports/lbnl-2258e.pdf  These programs were most effective when there were a lot of new homes built, and the utility program could affect 20%+ of its customers via these rebate programs. Installing CFLs reduced electricity bill by 5-10%. Such rebate programs usually cost about 3 or 4 cents per kilowatt-hour to the utility/ratepayers, which by the way, is lower than many renewables.  Then there are demand response programs, where customers agree to have the utility (or a third party) turn off some of its energy use and get paid for that.  And there's a newer type of behavior-modification programs targeted at consumers, with companies such as Tendril, Opower, Efficiency 2.0 and others in this space. I just wrote about one pilot, run by Tendril, here: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703439504576116383311363522.html?mod=googlenews_wsj ",

            "answer_text": "Are you familiar with the lighting legislation act that will have impact on energy moving forward? Pretty interesting -- beginning 1/1/2012 for the 100-watt incandescent bulb, will establish minimum efficiency standards that most standard incandescent bulbs will not meet. Since lighting accounts for about 22% of all electricity consumed in the U.S.\u2020, a switch to more energy efficient lighting will help reduce the amount of greenhouse gases resulting from the production of electricity.
