            "answer_text": "Preliminary data got from International Data Corporation (IDC) in the second quarter of 2018 shows Samsung has the greatest market share. Probably due to the innovation and the build quality they put into their products. They keep pushing the limits of smartphones, setting the pace for others to follow. However, other brands are coming up from china and are rising in market share especially in Africa. Huawei, Xaomi, Oppo are examples. They are cheap and promise to be as good as their US counterparts. In my opinion, Samsung is the king of the smartphone industry although they are very slow in implementing software updates but their devices are very durable and feel premium. According to data gotten from Statistica, In the second quarter of 2019, Samsung's market share was 22.7 percent. I would have said Huawei is great but due to the current tension between the US and China and Google recently withdrawing the use of google apps and services from the brand, the smartphone will likely score poorly in User experience for a vast majority of the users who are accustomed to the Google eco-system. nevertheless, look out for great exploits from that department because challenges stir up innovation and creativity. I will not be doing justice if I do not talk about the Google pixels, as we all know Google is the fastest deployer of software updates for android. if you are more interested in software updates and love seeing cool features as they arrive, I propose you check out the Google Pixel. In my opinion, Google beats Samsung hands-down in software updates. In conclusion, The Samsung market share speaks for itself. Apple is doing remarkably well in market share and it\u2019s worth checking out. I just have a feeling they are almost running out of design ideas :) hope that was helpful ",

If you are looking for a fast great specs of a phone I would go for a razor phone because the hardware inside is top of the line amazing. Samsung also is amazing as well little less pricy than the razor. iPhone is also a great because of the camera qualities and aesthetic. ",
