            "answer_text": "I\u2019m laboring under the assumption that your iMac is working, just not at peak. First, I would perform a backup (Time Machine, SuperDuper, CarbonCopyCloner, etc.) then you should boot from the recovery partition (hold down Option immediately after the chime) and run Disk First Aid from the Disk Utility. You can also run a Permissions Repair, but I would only do this on a drive that has permissions problems. These issues usually manifest in opening/deleting folders or files that are clearly owned by you, but you have to enter your username and password in order to perform those tasks. This does not apply to files in the Applications or the root System Folder. They are owned by Admin groups so you have to enter your credentials to move/copy/delete. If that fails to address the issue, wipe your drive and do a clean install of whatever OS you have on there, then do a migration from the backup. That usually solves 99% of problems, however, if you only use your Mac for work or specialized tasks, I would look into upgrading your hard drive. I have the same iMac, but with the Core I5. I upgraded to a Seagate 2TB 7200 hybrid drive (8GB SSD cache) and 2 TB standard hard drive (all sandwiched together), from a 1 TB Seagate Barracuda 5400 RPM drive, and I see a marked improvement in the performance. Not as good as a straight SSD, but miles better. The only reason is the price. I wasn\u2019t going to downgrade my storage to under 1TB. My new drive cost about $108 on Amazon. A comparable 1TB USB drive at the time of purchase was going for about $250. If you can spend that, great. I have better performance and I didn\u2019t have to pay through the nose. Now, how to get it installed. The late 2013 iMac is painfully not user friendly to service. The one advantage over its little sister, the late 2013 21.5\u2033 version, is that you have a panel where you can upgrade the RAM. I did that, and I\u2019m now at 16GB. Please note, I don\u2019t believe Applecare covers you for hardware upgrades. You could take your iMac to an Apple Store and the Geniuses can probably do an upgrade for whatever they charge *, or you can look up an AASP (Apple Authorized Service Provider) and have them do it, probably for less. AASP\u2019s have to be Apple Certified techs, so they have the experience to do this kind of job. If you have the guts, you can do it yourself like I did. I would suggest watching this here video;  I watched it about 20 times before I even attempted this. You will have to buy the upgrade kit from OWC. It has everything you need; tools including plastic spudgers, the guitar pick, screwdrivers, suction cups for removing the glass, tape for sticking the glass back on, etc. It also comes with the cable to fool your iMac into thinking you\u2019ve installed an Apple certified hard drive into your machine. This cable also has a heat sensor that tells the Mac the temp of your new drive. The reason Apple includes a 5400 RPM hard drive* with all 2012 and later iMacs is the illusion of thinness has a cost; heat. 7200 RPM drives were considered thermally challenged, so 5400 RPMs it is. The upshot is I\u2019ve been running my iMac for 3 months and I haven\u2019t had one issue. You can get the upgrade plus a Seagate Firecuda 2TB SSHD for $169.00 at OWC. Footnotes: * They might not. Apple considers the HDDs in 2012 and above iMacs non-upgradable. You are probably out of warranty, unless you have Applecare, so tread carefully.** Everywhere I look, I see the specs given for installed hard drives on the late 2013, 27\u2033 iMac (model 14,2) given as 7200 RPMs. I took my drive out and it\u2019s for sure, 5400 RPMs. You might have a 7200 RPM unit as a slow drive becomes the bottleneck for an otherwise fast system, so you will have to find out.",

            "answer_text": "I agree with both of the posts here. If you don\u2019t have an SSD that would be the one worthwhile upgrade. In fact, I max out the memory and put in a SSD on every Mac I get and they move lightning fast. That aside, I also agree a possible backup and factory reset could be worth looking into. I operate heavily in cloud storage for my design files so all I have to do is literally install Drive and all of my files download. If you don\u2019t like that it could be worth using local network file storage or an external drive via USB/Thunderbolt/etc. This way you can easily wipe your computer and start over fresh whenever it suits you.
