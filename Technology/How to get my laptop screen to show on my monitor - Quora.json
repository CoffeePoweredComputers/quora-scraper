            "answer_text": "Generally most laptops will have a video output port on the side or the rear. The laptop I currently use has an HDMI port on the left side next to some USB ports and I connect it to an HDMI cable and the other end to the monitor I want to use. Then you have a toggle switch on the laptop which is usually an icon or picture with the shape of a screen on a key and may require the function key and that key pressed at the same time to toggle between different display choices, my choices are laptop only, external screen only, or both screens simultaneously - to see the display on an external monitor you also might have to toggle the monitors inputs to tell it which input port to use.

            "answer_text": "Most laptops will have one of the Function keys (top row, maybe F4 or F5) with an icon representing a monitor. Usually pressing that will cycle between different display modes. If you currently have nothing showing on the external monitor, then it appears to default to single output. Click once, and it\u2019ll likely mirror your laptop display. Click again and it\u2019ll extend your desktop. Click again and it may display only on the external monitor. Click again and it\u2019ll go back to just your laptop display. Yours may have a different order, but play with it and see what happens. ",
