            "answer_text": "Most of remote keyless systems operate at a frequency of 315 MHz for North American cars and at 433.92 MHz for European, Japanese and Asian cars. They produce a radio frequency signal with a designated, distinct digital identity code. As any other radio frequency signal, the signal produced by a car remote lock can be intercepted. It is theoretically possible for a thief to capture a modern keycode and use it to unlock the vehicle, but he needs to be armed with the right technology and the ability to manipulate the code correctly. Some sophisticated thieves have laptops equipped with a radio transmitter and use brute force attacks to find the correct and unique code of a car's key fob. Also cars using smart keys are not immune from thieves. The proximity system of these cars is capable of searching for a wireless key fob that is within a couple of feet from the vehicle, but car thieves can use an amplifier to boost the key searching capabilities, sometimes up to around 300 feet, and unlock the car. On the bright side, car manufactures keep updating and improving the technology, thus making life more difficult for thieves. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not able to go deep technical descriptions. But this is just a remote, sending out radio signals. Yes they can be intercepted, and stolen. They can be recorded with not that advanced gadgets. Then while you are sleeping, they just play it back and your car opens. There are some things car manufacturers do to make it harder to record and playback, and even try to distinguish between the two. But this is a cat and mouse game, when one ups the battle, the other one goes further. Kind of like left foot right food, one goes further than the other one and then repeat. This is also the reason why your remote has  a rather short distance of working.  ",
