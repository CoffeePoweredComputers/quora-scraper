            "answer_text": "If you have surplus bare hard disk IDE or SATA drives sitting around, IDE to USB or SATA to USB adapters let you use them for external storage very inexpensively, moving the adapter from drive to drive. 3.5\u2033 drives also require an external power supply, a 5v/12v one with 4-pin connector for IDE drives, or a 12v supply with coaxial plug for SATA drives. Some 2.5\u2033 drives draw more than the 500ma supplied by a single USB port. In this case, a Y adapter with two male and one female connector doubles available current supply. ",
