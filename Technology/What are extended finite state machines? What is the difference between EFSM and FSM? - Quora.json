            "answer_text": "An FSM always performs a transition on a given input from one state to another an EFSM however only performs a transition when a given set of conditions have been satisfied. An EFSM allows you to also use variables for example you could implement a for loop. This allows you to easily model algorithms that would otherwise require a combinatorial explosion of states. ",
