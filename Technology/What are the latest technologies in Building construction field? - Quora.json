            "answer_text": "I am very excited to answer this question because first time on Quora I am getting a chance to showcase my daily work. Automatic climbing system is new in construction market which provids working platform for labours and to stack material like rebars and shutters. It also works as a Edge Protection at periphery of any high-rise building so workers can work freely at greater hights. The unique feature of Automatic climbing system is that it climbs automatically to next level after casting of one floor. Using this special system, we can achieve cycle time of around 6 days. (Here cycle time indicates average time required to cast 1 floor. VERY FAST). These systems are generally used for buildings having more than 40 floors. Attaching some pictures from construction job sites in India with Automatic climbing system. Feeling proud at this moment as I have worked on projects shown here but believe me it is freaking complicated and time consuming interms of design and execution. Fed up :(        ",
