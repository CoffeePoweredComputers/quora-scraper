            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, but I don\u2019t really think anyone can answer this for you. I\u2019ve bought them, and I love them. I expected to like them, but to feel a little guilty paying so much for mid-range-at-best sound. Turns out I love them. Full out. No guilt, no regrets. They are super convenient. They are comfortable enough that sometimes I forget I have them on. Putting them back in the case (when I remember they are on) when I get up to go to the restroom, or talk to someone in a nearby office or whatnot seems to keep them charged all day. I hadn\u2019t given a lot of thought to using \u201cjust one ear\u201d, but it works so well I frequently do it. They stay put in moderate activity (light jogging included). Having had them for months now I\u2019ve never had them drop signal except after telling me they are running out of power\u2026and then later running out. The sound was as I expected \u201cok\u201d (actually slightly better then normal EarPods, the bass is better, but not fantastic). Other people\u2019s ears are shaped differently, so AirPods might not be comfortable for you. Or might fall out. You might hate the sound. Who knows. Oh, and my wife hates the way they look, so she teases me about them\u2026 and maybe you can\u2019t deal with that ;-) Actually now that I think about it, I can answer this. Check the return policy, if it is easy and doesn\u2019t cost you much (& I think the Apple store is 2 weeks 100% back, no restock\u2026but it is worth checking, I might be wrong, I never worked at an Apple store, nor have I returned products to them). Anyway if the return policy is decent buy a pair. It is worth it to see if they work for you as well as they work for me. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether you, specifically YOU, should of not is subjective and depends on factors we don\u2019t know. But I\u2019ll share my experience with them. I now have both the original AirPods and the Pro version released in 2019. Under certain circumstances, I still prefer the originals; any earbuds with the rubber tips make the insides of my ears itch if I leave them in long enough. So if I\u2019m listening to spoken content, and if I don\u2019t want to block outside noise, the older model works better for me. The battery life isn\u2019t as good as it was when they were new, but then, since I have more than one set of AirPods, I can switch if my continuous use is more than they can handle. The AirPods Pro are truly great, though. They block the loud noise of the lawn mower or vacuum cleaner better than the earmuff-type hearing protection I previously wore while being secure enough not to worry about one falling out (and potentially ruined by the mower) and vastly more comfortable even while also allowing me to listen to something at the same time if I wish. Under quieter conditions where I can hear detail in music, they seem to reproduce it well. The ability to turn hearing through them on and off by holding the tail for a second or so is nice. I don\u2019t at all regret having bought them. However, I also haven\u2019t used similar products from other companies. There may be a different product out there that would suit you better. ",
