            "answer_text": "This varies with editor to editor. More is the years of experience in editing, more difficult to recognise fake images provided it is an legit image ( not like riding an unicorn where you can easily say it's edited) If you edit images then it's more easy to recognise others fake image because you know the difficult parts which can't be hidden or where to look for errors. The most common mistakes people make while editing is: Leaving some traces of cutouts of the original image.Colour corrections (the subject colour may not exactly match with other subject parts or backgrounds)Have a close look to the edges to check whether the cuts are natural\u2026usually hairs because they are pretty difficult to cut out. Sometimes they become smooth or sometimes background are cut along.Shadows. Not a perfect part but one become perfect with shadows easily with experience but still a factor to keep in mind. Every object in the image should have same source of light.Size comparison. You can't expect the shoes you are wearing be the size of your head.(unless in an illusion image of the photographer)",
