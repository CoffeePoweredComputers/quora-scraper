            "answer_text": "When you went to start a startup, you can\u2019t get any handsome profit in the beginning. You need time to achieve the goals. People who admire you will expect you to invest more, money and time. But the main issue is you can\u2019t see the success as you expected. In any business, there was a mentor for that entrepreneur. You need to learn the process of earning. How good your listening skill, much better your profit graph. Any top businessman in the world had a mentor who teaches and educate them in the beginning.

The survival rate of new businesses is understandably intimidating to entrepreneurs, but those numbers can change drastically when you add a mentor to the equation. According to a survey by The UPS Store, 70% of mentored businesses survive more than five years. That's double the rate of businesses who choose not to have a mentor. SkillPal will provide the technology which may help to maintain the business goodwill. Once a guide comes to show you the way you can put your steps on it. SkillPal got many business mentors and industry experts who will help young entrepreneurs. Unlike a management relationship, SkillPal mentoring relationships tend to be voluntary on both sides, although it is considered possible for a line manager to also be a mentor to the people that they manage. Unlike a coaching relationship, mentoring relationships are more usually unpaid. The idea behind mentoring relationships is a semi-charitable one: that the more successful, senior partner, the mentor, wishes to pass on some of what they\u2019ve learned to someone else who will benefit from their experience. Some organizations run formal mentoring programmes that match mentors with learners. However, less formal mentoring relationships can also work well for SkillPal. British mentoring programmes tend to have four key elements: improving performance, career development, counselling and sharing knowledge. In other countries, especially the US, there is also an element of the mentor acting as a sponsor for the learner, but this is not usually seen in the UK. These four features are also relevant for SkillPal also. Mentoring relationships, especially formal ones organized through a mentoring programme, are often entered into with a defined time limit, or a defined goal. Having such a framework in place can be easier for both parties to agree than an open-ended commitment. For example, a learner may agree to work with a mentor for a year, or until they achieve a particular desired promotion. After they have reached the time limit or achieved the goal, terms can be renegotiated. The mentor and learner may decide to continue to work together, especially if the relationship has been productive and helpful to both. A mentor can help you advance within your field and connect you with opportunities that you might not have otherwise had access to. They do this by sharing their knowledge, helping you identify opportunities in your path, and potentially opening doors for you when the time comes. Almost every great achiever in history has claimed that they had a great mentor at some point during their rise to excellence. Mentorship is a valuable tool for turning one\u2019s vision into reality. Mentors are expected to guide and advise their mentees, helping them build a successful career or gain a solid footing within a certain organization. Typically, a mentor has one mentee at a time and can focus on shaping their trajectory. Mentorship is a relationship between two people where the individual with more experience, knowledge, and connections is able to pass along what they have learned to a more junior individual within a certain field. The more senior individual is the mentor, and the more junior individual is the mentee. The mentor benefits because they are able to lead the future generation in an area they care about and ensure that best practices are passed along; meanwhile, the mentee benefits because they have proven that they are ready to take the next step in their career and can receive the extra help needed to make that advancement. SkillPal Mentors are expected to guide and advise their mentees, helping them build a successful career or gain a solid footing within a certain organization. Typically, a mentor has one mentee at a time and can focus on shaping their trajectory. Skilled immigrants and international students who want to quickly advance in their career in a new country should take advantage of mentorships. Gaining knowledge from someone who has successfully navigated a similar experience can help you accelerate your growth. Someone who will help you make the right decisions at the right time could influence the rest of your life. ",
