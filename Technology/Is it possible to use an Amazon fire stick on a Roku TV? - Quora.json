            "answer_text": "Yes you can. You only need a free HDMI port and a broadband internet service. The Roku apps are built in to the TV so it does not take an HDMI port. The input on your TV remote will get you to the Amazon Stick. If you subscribe to one of the popular streaming services, you can watch them on either streaming device. The only advantage of the Amazon Stick is it does not limit the number of apps. Normally a TV only service has a limited number of apps built in as there is limited space available built into the TV. Note that the stand alone Roku does not have the same limitations as the built in version. TV with built in Amazon has the same limitation as the built in Roku. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with D.M. If you already have a Roku TV, then Amazon Prime (everything) should already be there and if not, you can install it on the TV. I have my Roku connected to my LG tv and it has all the Amazon Prime channels available, music, video, wardrobe, so I don\u2019t need an amazon firestick, not even for my Samsung as I have the Amazon Prime installed on that without the Roku.
