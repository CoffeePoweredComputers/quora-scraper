Nowadays, most websites wouldn\u2019t work at all without Javascript. There are basic best practices such as always to keep your apps and system up to date (not only the browser itself!). Minimize your usage of unreliable websites (e.g. with pirated software or other illegal content, most adult sites). Do not use pirated software as it may be injected with backdoors, and any software from unreliable sources. Never use same password for different sites. Do not use http (as opposed to https) versions of sites, if there\u2019s a choice \u2013 especially when over a public wifi. Never post intimate photos and other content on the web, never send it to anyone. Never talk to strangers. Watch your back. Lock the doors. Mind the gap. Keep calm and carry on. ",
