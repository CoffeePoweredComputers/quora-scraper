            "answer_text": "For the first part of your question Kitkat is more advanced than jelleybean.Kitkat uses resources more efficiently than any previous version of android, there are many feature enhancements for details visit Google android official site.Thus Kitkat can run more efficiently than jellybean on the same hardware. Thus Kitkat is better than Jelleybean in every aspect. Now if you are a mainstream user it may not be possible for you to upgrade a jelleybean phone(I.e the default OS which came preloaded in your phone at the time of purchase) to  android Lollipop. But if you are a advanced or root user then you can visit XDA forum and check out whether any android Lollipop ROM is available for your phone and install it accordingly. In some might be no Lollipop ROM available for your phone; then sadly  you cannot upgrade your phone to Android lollipop.",

            "answer_text": "I assume that you comparing these two in general, so my point is this: KitKat is the best compared to any versions of the Jelly Bean any day. It's lighter, that it can even run in the 512MB of RAM, in which the Jelly Beans cannot.  It's a voice command ready. Just say \"OK Google\" and it's ready to receive your command, anytime. It is introduced from KitKat onwards, so no go for Jelly Bean. If you still want Lollipop but you don't get it, it's OK. To me, KitKat is already satisfying, as long as the phone is still running. Thanks for A2A! Edit: Thanks for the correction given. I wonder why did I type KB instead of MB for the RAM, but oh well. ",
