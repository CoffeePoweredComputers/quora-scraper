            "answer_text": "Is your phone overheating? When temperatures start rising and you\u2019re lugging your best tech poolside and to the beach, you may be wondering if phone overheating will affect the performance of your phone. We\u2019re here to give you the truth on what heat will do to your phone.  Will phone overheating cause my glass to crack? Phone overheating alone cannot cause the glass on your smartphone screen to crack. It can, however, cause the glass to be more vulnerable to breaking. If you were to leave your device on the dashboard of your car, in a parking lot in direct sunlight with the outside temperature being higher than 90 degrees Fahrenheit, you would still likely need an outside force such as a bend or drop to cause it to truly crack. A more likely scenario would be for your phone to experience thermal fracturing. This occurs when you move very hot glass into a very cold environment very quickly.  Lithium-Ion batteries can start to melt under extreme heat, but you\u2019d have to be charging it in an environment with temperatures over 115 degrees Fahrenheit. What can happen to my phone if it overheats? While it would take a considerable amount of heat to cause your battery to malfunction, other smartphone components can be affected by heat. The adhesive that bonds smartphone components and helps your device stay waterproof can start to corrode under high heat. The adhesive can get gummy and could allow gaps to form or components to shift, allowing dust and dirt to get inside and ruin the phone. This can also make any water resistant device completely vulnerable to water damage. Components such as the CPU, GPU, and other crucial chips really don\u2019t like too much heat. Devices like computers and game consoles have built-in fans to keep these parts cool, but smartphones don\u2019t have this feature. High temperatures, whether due to outside temperature or internal temperature, can cause damage to the chips or their connections. If these parts become overheated, the user will typically get a warning on the screen of the device. How to Prevent Your Phone from Overheating  Most smartphones have a sensor and a warning that will alert you when your phone\u2019s internal temperature reaches 95 degrees or above. If you get this warning, your phone will not operate (except for emergency call function) until the phone has cooled down. To avoid getting this warning, you should always keep your phone in a cool, shady place if you plan to be out in the sun. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it does, heating or rise in temperature affects the performance of a smartphone.  Processor is the brain of a smartphone, as in our human body our brain consumes more energy, just like that a processor consumes more energy in a smartphone because it is the one which performs all arithmetic and logical operations, so the processor heats up while in use(not only processor every electronic component heats up but the temperature of the processor is more compared to others). We can observe this heating after using intensely i.e. gaming or using camera\u2026.. Back end reason for heating The reason being is processor is just like any other transistor or MOSFET where the operations takes place with the movement of the electrons. In fact processor is combination of (billions)Transistors.(Universal Law - Nothing in this universe is perfect i.e. 100\u2105 efficient everything posses some energy loss in one or the other way).Due to this fact the energy loss in electron movement in processor is in the form of heat. So the heat is produced due to movement of electrons which is inevitable, thus processor heats up, you might wonder why only processor, as said processor consumes more energy.As the energy consumption is more heat dissipation is also more. This is the reason why we observe heat near the camera because most of the OEM's place processor near the camera.The question here is how it affects the performance. As we know processor is an electronic component so when it heats up more than its operating temperature then it will be damaged. So in order to protect it OEM's don't let them to operate at its maximum potential for a long duration.They limit the performance by underclocking the processor to manage the temperature as well as energy consumption. We observe this under performance i.e. lags or frame drops when the smartphone is hot.This under clocking or reduced performance of the processor is called as CPU throttling. If you are familiar with PC's then you might have come across this CPU throttling.Energy consumption and heat dissipation are the key reasons for CPU throttling. So this way heating affects the performance of a smartphone.Another question: Is this(CPU throttling) the only way to stop heating in smartphone ? No, here the back of the smartphone is exposed to air so cooling takes place i.e. air cooling there are other ways of cooling the smartphone to increase the performance which is again liquid cooling, which is the most hyped feature of most gaming smartphones. If you want you may check my answer on liquid cooling in smartphones. Does liquid cooling in mobile phones really help bring down its temperature?The other way to cool the CPU is air cooling using a fan, we use this in PCs and desktops. As we don't have enough space in a smartphone we generally don't see this in smartphones. But there are some gaming phones with fans i.e. Nubia red magic 3 and Asus ROG - this one has fan as an accessory.Meanwhile my smartphone got hot and I observe lags - keyboard isn't responding as it should and frame drops while scrolling the answer. Don't worry as your smartphone may not experience this because mine is 2 1/2 year old. I wonder even if you observe frame drops using quora with a recent smartphone. ",
