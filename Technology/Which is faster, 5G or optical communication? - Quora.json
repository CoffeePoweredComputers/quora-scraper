            "answer_text": "Optical communication will always be the fastest, as they use \u201clight\u201d as a medium of transmitting information. In fact, 5G mobile towers and antennas are connected to the core network using Fiber links (which inturn use optical communication methods). For example, optical fiber technologies allow you to support several 100s of Gbps of speeds when compared to 5G (which supports 1 Gbps speed). ",

            "answer_text": "5G is wireless and optical is wired, wired thing are usually faster. Also 5G is backhauled on optical so it is a simple logic that the data should be backhauled on a faster media, not on a slower one. Current Fiber transport standards can backhaul 1000s of 5G towers at the same time and without showing any signs of congestion. ",
