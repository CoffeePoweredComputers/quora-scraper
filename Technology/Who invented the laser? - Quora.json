            "answer_text": "I should start by saying that a maser, based on two energy states of ammonia, was already in existence. Masers produce microwaves, and are useful in very low noise amplification of rado-telescope signals. The laser was conceived and documented by Gordon Gould in 1957. He coined the name \u201claser\u201d in his notebook. He recognized the need for a Fabry-P\u00e9rot resonator and the possibility of optical pumping as well as atomic collision pumping. When he tried to get someone to build the laser, DARPA funding was forthcoming, but DARPA classified his work and the notebook. (He had communist activities in his youth and could not get a clearance.) At Bell Labs, with the proper clearances, Arthur Schawlow and Charles Townes independently discovered the importance of the Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot cavity\u2014about three months later\u2014and called the resulting proposed device an \"optical maser\". Schawlow and Townes got the credit and patent. Using the Schawlow and Townes concept and design, Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories built the first working laser. Gould later was able to get his notebook, long since declassified, and got the patent for the basic laser under his control and caused quite a stir in the laser business when he wanted a royalty on every laser sold retro-actively. Gould\u2019s patent battle was one of the most important patent battles in US patent history. Several laser companies turned control over to Gould because they could not afford to stay in business owing back licensing royalties for up to 20 years. Some scientists, including several I have worked with, do not fully accept Gordon Gould\u2019s role in the invention of the laser. In fact, we never even heard of Gordon Gould until we had been building lasers for 20 years. We wondered who in the heck he was. Until the law suits came. Thanks to William Boyer for suggesting that masers be described to explain why optical maser was suggested as a name for lasers. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a detailed answer of exactly this question in Wikipedia as I found by Googling the question word by word. But I would like to inform the questioner that there is also another similar thing called MASER which is acronym for Microwave Amplification by Simultaneous Emission of Radiation and which was forerunner Laser. The first MASER was built by Charles H. Townes, James P. Gordon and H. J. Zeiger at Columbia University in 1953. Townes, Nikolai Bosov & Alexander Prokhorov were awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for theoretical work leading to the maser. Masers are used as the timekeeping device in Atomic Clocks and as extremely low-noise microwave amplifiers in radio telescopes and deep space space craft communication ground stations. Modern masers can be designed to generate electromagnetic waves at not only microwave frequencies but also radio and infrared frequencies. The LASER works by the same principle as the MASER, but produces higher frequency coherent radiation at visible wavelengths (Light). The maser was the forerunner of the laser, inspiring theoretical work by Townes and Arther Leonard Schawlow that led to the invention of the laser in 1960 by Theodore Maiman. When the coherent optical oscillator was first imagined in 1957, it was originally called the \"OPTICAL MASER\". This was ultimately changed to LASER for \"Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation\". Gordon Gould is credited with creating this acronym in 1957. ",
