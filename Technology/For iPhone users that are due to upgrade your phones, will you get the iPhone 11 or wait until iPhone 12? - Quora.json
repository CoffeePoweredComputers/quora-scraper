            "answer_text": "If you figure the iPhone 12 is not likely to be release until September 2021, I would recommend deciding on whether you should buy the iPhone 11 now, or wait 4 months for the iPhone 11s. Granted, I am being picky about naming conventions, but only once did Apple not release the S model, and that is the iPhone 7s which was skipped to bring the iPhone 8 to coincide with the iPhone X (the 10 year anniversary edition). okay, so they also skipped the 8s, 9, and 9s, but again, this was because they had already released the iPhone X (10), and now it does not make sense to back-track and release an 8s \u2014 especially since the next models were all based on upgrades to the iPhone X, so naturally, the next releases to follow were the XS (10s), and 11. I fully expect Apple to stick to their S model release, and this years\u2019 phone to be named the iPhone 11s unless they come out with some really ground breaking changes, or change the naming convention all together\u2026 maybe iPhone, and iPhone Pro 2020 models. Back to the subject at hand, should you buy now, or wait? That depends on your unique situation. Did you break your current phone, and need a new? If you don\u2019t need a new phone, I would wait 4 months. But, if you need a phone now, I wouldn\u2019t try to wait, I would get the 11 now. There is not likely to be such a significant difference between the iPhone 11s and the current iPhone 11 that would make it worth the wait\u2026 Not likely \u2014 but not guaranteed. Until Apple makes an announcement, we are all guessing. ",

            "answer_text": "I will wait it out. Straight and Simple. Personally, I think that the iPhone 12 series will definitely be better option than iPhone 11. The upcoming iPhone series is rumored to come with an array of feature that will be difficult to pass on, considering the again, rumored price range. If speculations are to be believed, the iPhone 12 (the base model) of the iPhone 12 series is expected to come with a price tag of Rs.74,900. Anybody who is aware of the previous iPhones would know that for a new release, Apple has brought down the price of the device by many folds. According to the recent speculations, the following are the known features of the iPhone 12. It comes with a completely bezel-less screen that stands 5.42-inch tall. The OLED panel serves a screen resolution of 1,125 x 2,436 pixels along with a relatively sharp density of 495 PPI. The iPhone 12 comes with an IP68 technology that resists it with water and dust particles.  The iPhone 12 is powered by an A13 Bionic chipset, which assists the Hexacore (2.65GHz dual-ore Lightning, 1.8GHz quad-core Thunder) processor. There is an Apple GPU (four-core graphics) that reduces the load of the processor while the 6GB RAM renders smooth gaming and multitasking. The battery that always been an issue for many. The iPhone 12 features a Li-ion battery with 3,210mAh capacity that can provide ample usage time, no doubt. However, to make things easier and smoother, Apple has offered a convenient refilling option. There is a Fast Charging and wireless charging support. It comes with a 64GB non-expandable storage. Optic wise, there are 12MP+ 12MP + 12MP rear lenses featuring Quad-LED True Tone Flash and offering an image resolution of 4,000 x 3,000 pixels. There is a 12MP lens in the front with Retina Flash, that can capture detailed pictures. One of the other major reasons behind waiting for the iPhone 12 is the speculated availability of 5G modem in the device. And iPhone 11 doesn\u2019t have it. Once 5G rolls out, you\u2019d again have to get rid of the iPhone 11 because then they will just be outmoded. It would be wise to buy a 5G capable modem rather than spending money on upgrading again and again once it becomes a necessity. ",
