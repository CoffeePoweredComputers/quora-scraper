            "answer_text": "Yes and no. In one sense, you can\u2019 t change the resolution of a flat panel TV. The pixels are where they are. Your 4K TV will always be 4K. It will always have 3840 pixels horizontally and 2160 pixels vertically, unless you\u2019re using it with your computer or in some sort of public display and rotate it 90 degrees. What you CAN do is display a lower resolution image on your TV. You likely do that all the time. It happens whenever you watch most cable or broadcast TV, shows and movies on streaming services that are not offered in 4K, DVD or Blu-Ray discs, and so on. The TV upscales the lower resolution content to 4K so it will fill your screen. Every 4K TV I know of will accept signals at 1080p, 1080i, 720p, 480p, and 480i at various numbers of frames per second (24, 25, 30, and 60 at a minimum), and some will accept additional resolutions and FPS rates. Most TVs use a fairly simple algorithm to upscale the image. The obvious example happens when you can multiply by an integer. A 4K TV can show a 1080p image by displaying each pixel from the original image on a square of four pixels; similarly, it can show a 720p image by displaying each original pixel on a square of nine pixels. An image upscaled that way will look no better than it does on a display with that native resolution, but it will also look no worse. Other resolutions, such as 480p from a standard definition channel or a DVD, require a bit more math, but there is still no effort being made to improve the image. Another thing that the TV needs to do is deinterlacing of 480i and 1080i signals. On flat panel displays the pixels are on all the time, rather than being painted at the refresh rate and then gradually fading as CRTs did. (Exception: OLED and MicroOLED displays may work by turning the pixels on and off really quickly rather than applying analog voltages to them, but that is at a rate much higher than your eye can see. DLP projectors also work that way.) When you display an interlaced image, it\u2019s important to combine the correct images (you don\u2019t want to show the interlaced fields that are part of different frames), so the upscaling needs to be able to recognize which ones go together. The tricky case is when 24 fps film content is presented in an interlaced format. as it is on broadcast channels, videotape, and DVDs, because of how the math for that interacts with interlacing. 24 fps is shown on a 60 fps display with a process known as 3:2 pulldown; one frame is shown three times and the next is shown twice to get the numbers to come out right. But in an interlaced 480i or 1080i signal, each frame always contains two fields, which means that some frames contain one field from one image combined with a field from the NEXT film image. Our brains mostly ignore that when we see it on a CRT because the fields are not actually displayed at the same time. But on a flat panel it looks bad, so the TV has to be able to figure out which fields go with which frames and untangle it all correctly. Fortunately, most current TVs get it right nearly all the time, though you may see an occasional deinterlacing glitch at a point where there is a cut in the film. 3:2 pulldown also introduces a barely-noticeable jerkiness known as judder. A really smart TV would be able to figure out and display the image at 24 or 48 fps instead, but I don\u2019t know if there are any TVs that can do that. They DO display content that is actually presented at 24 fps at that frame rate, like much of the 4K film content on streaming services. Some higher end TVs have more sophisticated upscaling algorithms, sometimes marketed as artificial intelligence (AI) upscaling, where the TV tries to calculate additional image detail. The result can be impressive or terrible, depending on the nature of the source material and how well your TV does the upscaling. Most TV with that feature will let you turn it off and do the simpler pixel multiplication instead if you encounter content where the artificial intelligence is really artificial stupidity. Another sort of upscaling that some TVs do is in the time domain rather than resolution. That\u2019s called motion smoothing; the TV tries to convert the incoming signals to 120 or 240 frames per second by extrapolating the changes between frames into additional intermediate frames. Some people like the effect, Others hate it passionately, derisively calling it the \u201csoap opera effect\u201d because it makes everything look more like it was shot on video (which traditionally used higher frame rates) rather than film. (Most people who make movies are in the \u201cagainst\u201d camp because it means their creation doesn\u2019t look like they intended it to.) TVs may ship with that on or off by default; you should be able to change it in the menus. So know you know\u2026 the rest of the story! ",

            "answer_text": "Can you lower the resolution of a 4k TV? Technically, I have a monitor, not a television, the difference is really features, I don\u2019t have a tuner in a monitor. But with my Samsung, I have no problem changing my resolution to 1K (1920x1080), just as my 2007 1K (HD) Sharp Aquos that does 1920x1080 beautifully, has no problem dropping down to 1280x720. If you\u2019ve got a great deal on a 4K TV but don\u2019t want to fork out the extra fee for the 4K service, I\u2019d suggest that it\u2019s a good move. You can also stream 4K content from NASA (I believe) at no additional charge. Depending on your geography, you may be able to get 4K over the air with a regular antenna. You don\u2019t need anything special. That being said, there are some pretty slick flat antennas (using the same advances in fractal geometry that let mobile phones loose their external antenna) that you can pick up for $20\u201350. Note that the data \u201ccost\u201d is significantly higher for streaming 1K (call it 5Mb/sec) versus 4K material, up to 20Mb/sec\u2026 ",
