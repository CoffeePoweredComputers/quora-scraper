            "answer_text": "Connect Machines using wireless sensor network (IoT Sensors) Connected machines create an ecosystem using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to connect different machines transforming them into intelligent broader embedded systems. The data of these machines can be best supplied to the machine maker\u2019s end too for addressing issues if any arises in the middle of a project. Nowadays, the connected machines are built upon two approaches, one inside the factory where information regarding productivity of a machine collected by smart sensors has to be supplied to the key participants in the connected machine ecosystem. The other approach is much more macro level, the outside factory approach where information regarding a machine is supplied to the key ecosystem participants when the machine has reached the customers end and timely interaction with the machine maker is required to understand the working of machine in real conditions. Request PDF Sample for More Information About Smart Wireless Sensors based Connected Machines The IoT sensors based connected machines are expected to bring about real time data tracking enabling marketing and effective communication of any business using connected machines. Applications: Automotive, entertainment, manufacturing, smart homes, power and energy, IT, Banking Financial Service & Insurance (BFSI), utilities, and others ",

            "answer_text": "You can easily and cheaply buy sensors that can measure a variety of variables that would be interesting in industrial applications, for example (and this is for sure not a complete list): light or sound intensity; voltage; current; pressure; temperature; rotational position; XYZ orientation;  compass direction; acceleration; location; fluid flow rate and so on. These sensors can be interrogated by microcontroller, and data stored to memory card, or communicated in realtime to other systems via Bluetooth, Zigbee, WiFi , Ethernet, serial, USB, infared and so on. The inexpensive nature of these microcontrollers (for example Google for ESP8266 to see a WiFi-enabled microcontroller) means that you could deploy a large number of these in an industrial setting (even in hazardous environments) and gather data without a large capital investment, and without the worry of \"what if it gets destroyed\"? There must be so many industrial applications of this technology that it's impossible to enumerate the possibilities. The limiting factor is really only \"how can we process all of this data\"? ",
