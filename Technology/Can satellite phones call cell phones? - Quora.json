            "answer_text": "Well, it's a phone, so if it couldn't call every number, it would be useless. But it wouldn't connect directly. Your satellite phone would send a signal up to space, the signal would bounce around to other satellites, then down to the ground, then into the ground circuts, like all phones. Then the signal would go to a cell tower near my cell phone, and then to me. So two different systems, yes, but connected by a third: the old telephone land line circuts. ",
