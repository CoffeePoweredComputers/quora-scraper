            "answer_text": "This was my first cellphone, 1997, I think:  The battery is massive, and that charge only lasted one day. You could also swap it for a new battery, and you\u2019d often have to remove the battery to get it to charge properly. The external antenna was large. You actually did have to pull it out to get reception. There was nearly no storage. I think I could store 10 numbers, but I\u2019m pretty sure this my first phone didn\u2019t have any contact storage. My next 2 or 3 phones looked like this, and contact storage was definitely in v3, but rather frumpy. You didn\u2019t save names, you saved so you could press *1 and get the number saved in it (or maybe it was another button combo, I don\u2019t recall exactly). Oh, and this phone wasn\u2019t cheap either. It wasn\u2019t $700 like today\u2019s flagships, but it wasn\u2019t $25 either. I\u2019m thinking it was about $200 for the phone, plus perhaps 500 minutes of talk time included. Oh, and text messaging? hahaha. no. Storage? please\u2026 To get to where we are today: Phones to shrink, and they certainly did after the year 2000. Color screens were introduced around the year 2000, which was a huge leap forward, and of course, you had to pay a premium for that. Batteries had to be smaller and more reliable. In the 00\u2019s, when you bought a phone, it would come in 3 pieces: phone body, external battery, charger. The external battery could be swapped out when it died, and it often did go bad in about 6 months. Oddly, it was usually the same price, or even cheaper, to buy a new phone than it was to buy a battery. We used to have to buy SD cards to store music. These were pretty expensive, but worth it if you wanted to listen to music on your phone. Of course, there was compatibility issues, so you may be stuck getting a smaller SD card. Internet in the 90s was dial-up, or if you were rich, DSL. WiFi was pretty uncommon and unreliable. Wi-Fi - Wikipedia The first version of the 802.11 protocol was released in 1997, and provided up to 2 Mbit/s link speeds. This was updated in 1999 with 802.11b to permit 11 Mbit/s link speeds, and this proved popular. Those speeds are unusable today. Thinking back on how horrible cellphone coverage was, I don\u2019t think it would have mattered if a smart phone or tablet itself existed. You could walk around the corner and lose all reception. \u201cYou sound like you\u2019re on a cellphone\u201d was not a compliment, it was a polite way of telling someone to drop a quarter instead. The infrastructure just wasn\u2019t there, even if the actual smart phones and tablets existed. All of this isn\u2019t to say that there were no concepts or products at the time. The Palm Pilot PDA (personal digital assistant) was introduced in the 1990s:  I think The Pilot was the first commercially successful PDA on the market. You\u2019ll notice the pencil. These were required and didn\u2019t work with fingers. Capacitive touch was invented in the 1960s, but I\u2019d guess the technology didn\u2019t shrink down to phone size for quite a while. PalmPilot - Wikipedia Capacitive sensing - Wikipedia It seems that a lot of things had to come together to make it all happen in unison. Technology has advanced tremendously since the 1990s, and perhaps equally importantly, companies had to solve how to make components cheap enough so the end-users could buy them. No point producing a tablet if it cost $10,000 to produce. R&D is integral to making all of this happen as well. The last piece was the invention of Gorilla Glass by Corning. While it was around for a while, it wasn\u2019t perfected until Apple requested it. Gorilla Glass - Wikipedia My thinking is, no, it wasn\u2019t possible, but likely imagined. I recall reading about \u201cfuturistic\u201d products in the mid 90s. They were exciting to think about as a child, but honestly, they were dead wrong. The stuff we have today is much more advanced than the tech they predicted would happen, so even the \u201cimagineers\u201d underestimated how much technology would advance.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s look at this one issue at a time. Smartphones - even wired connections were limited to the speed of the serial port into the early 90s, and we did not have methods of sending high-speed wireless data through cellular networks or Wi-Fi. So you\u2019d have a device that was tethered with a cable. Could you get a smart-phone-sized screen? Yes, but it would be heavier, use a ton more power, and make it impossible to have it battery-powered because the processor inside would use too much power for the battery available. One solution would be to give it a grayscale screen, but in general, the technology wasn\u2019t mature enough. Memory would have been ridiculously expensive too. Tablets - everything said about cellphones goes double for tablets. The need for more memory and processor power would make for an inch-thick tablet with the battery it needs, but lacking wireless communications you\u2019d have to have it tethered to your computer. The Internet - I\u2019m old enough remember dial-up internet and the era of the early 90s when modem speed was increasing every few months. In high school I had a 300-baud modem for my Commodore 64. My first IBM-compatible machine was 1200 or 2400. That was good for dial-up networking and text-only connections. Downloads of programs from \u201cpirate bulletin boards\u201d was slow, but reasonable only because the programs themselves were small. It took a few years for 56k modems to arrive and by then you could play games over the internet - calling your friend directly and playing a game against him - and there were graphic interfaces. Internet connections were available in the early 90s but before that, well, without the computing power for a graphical interface (prior to the Windows era) it was going to be tough, and the speeds were just too slow. All of this is predicated by the fact that if you throw money at things you can get better results. T1 and T3 lines existed for industry and they worked. But they were prohibitively expensive for even small business. ",
