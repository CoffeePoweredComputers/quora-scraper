            "answer_text": "Mathematicians don't exist because they're needed, they exist because it's a fundamental human endeavour, like making music! Conjecture. The evidence points in the direction of more rather than less mathematicians being needed in the future. People in computer science, physics, econometry, climatology, banking all need mathematics to make sense of an increasingly complex world. They may have \"theoretical physicist\" or \"financial analysis consultant\" or whatever it's called on their job description but you'll recognise them for what they truly are by the chalk marks on their clothing, and their excitement at some symbols that appear to bear little relation to the real world (but that actually do).

And people will continue to tolerate them because they can make numbers do things that ordinary persons can't even begin to imagine. Look around you. Every piece of technology that you own exists only because some really good mathematician realised that such things could exist. ",
