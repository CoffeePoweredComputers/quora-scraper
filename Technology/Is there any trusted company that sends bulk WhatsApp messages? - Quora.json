            "answer_text": "Yes, there are many good companies providing customers with whatsapp bulk message service. But if you hire a company to send message for you, you have a risk that your data number & your ad content might be shared to others. So if your project is a \u201csecret\u201d project,then I suggest you learn to send by yourself. You could search on google for \u201c whatsapp hash channels\u201d or \u201cwhatsapp marketing\u201d to learn more. ",
