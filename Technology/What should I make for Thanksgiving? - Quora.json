            "answer_text": "First are you doing all the cooking or are you getting help. Which by the way is one of the best ways to handle it, if you are doing everything, then hang on. Turkey, for me that\u2019s a fresh turkey, if I had a choice it would be fresh, they simply taste better and you don\u2019t have to worry about it being thawed out. Figure 3 to 4 ounces per person (roughly). Next stuffing, I really like Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix, follow the directions, though for me I add a little more poultry seasoning. Never use water, use broth or stock. I know I\u2019m about to tick off a bunch of nutritionist but stuff the turkey with the stuffing. You only do this once a year, I\u2019m pretty sure you won\u2019t die after one day. Mashed potatoes a given, try Yukon gold, in my opinion they make the best mashed. Candied yams and I don\u2019t mean the marshmallow kind. My family recipe is simple bake your yams the night before, chill, peel and slice the thinly the next day on to a rimmed cookie sheet. Slice REAL butter into thin slices and dot the yams, usually this takes one cube per pan of yams, sprinkle generously with brown sugar. Though I\u2019ve seen similar recipes that add chopped peanuts, I don\u2019t. Cook at 425 for about 20 minutes. I usually do this while the turkey is resting. Then oven roasted Brussels Sprouts. (Know most people think it should be green bean casserole). Rolls, for desert try pumpkin, pecan pie, and for a different desert try brownies with ice cream. If you need any recipe for the pies, I will gladly share mine, on a different \u201cpage\u201d. PS, cranberry and gravy. ",
