            "answer_text": "I've been working at LiveChat for over 10 years now and the company has been running since 2002. I can answer your question based on our experience. At this moment (February 2016) our company headcount is 57 people, with more than 20 in development and close to 20 in customer service. We don't have any sales people.  Now, let's get back to the answer to your question. At their core, LiveChat and Olark are very different products that cater for different needs: Olark is a very good tool for companies with a need for a basic chat. There are some technical limitations that make it virtually impossible to run a large customer service department with Olark. Olark's roots are deep in XMPP protocol which has been designed for instant messaging, not specifically for customer service. Olark does not own the protocol it uses and I don't remember them ever having their own desktop or mobile apps - they have been relying entirely on 3rd party apps that support XMPP. LiveChat is more of a premium customer service software that just a simple chat. It works best for larger teams, where scenarios include management of a dedicated customer service department. The infrastructure and communication protocol in LiveChat have been designed from scratch and built entirely for supporting online visitors - in addition to web-based application, this includes native applications for desktop (Windows, Mac OS X) and mobiles (iPhone, iPad, Android), security and customer service-dedicated features such as customer message sneak-peek and canned responses (available from the interface, not using text commands). There's a lot of enterprises using LiveChat, while not many of them are using Olark.  Generally speaking, these days it is fairly easy to launch a simple chat solution. The main resources you need to launch a chat product would be: programmers - to build your chat solution - a simple, probably web-based product, that will work closer to Olark than LiveChat.some money to let you go through the first months of product development, hosting and getting some traction before you officially take off with a paid product.I am not providing you with any numbers, because it will cost you different money to build this kind of product in the United States and different in Europe. The cheapest solution would probably be to outsource this kind of job to India, but none of the 2 companies you asked about did that - they are developing their products entirely in-house. You also need to remember that to get to the point where Olark or LiveChat are at this moment (Olark has over 10,000 paying customers, LiveChat has over 16,000 customers), you'd need to chip in a lot more than just money - it will take a lot of time, hard work and effort.

The other are definitely more complicated regarding coding, like marketing automation.  Look for the Quora Q&A regarding software providers like Intercom, Zopim, Olark and LiveChat. That can give you an overview what kind of issues you have to take into consideration while starting of such a business.    ",
