            "answer_text": "Will global civilization survive the 21st Century? Well, what global civilization do we speak about ? Short answer : In my opinion, from the United Nations society about International Law, the Global village about the solidarity & free circulation of the People of the World, the expansion of liberal democracy to non-Western aligned lands, and the global Market revolving around the Dollar, the 3 first are progressively shattering, while the fourth one will keep prospering, but probably \u201cmultilateralize itself out of the dollar\u201d to reach neutrality and prevent anyone to sanction globally someone else and those who want to make business with that someone. Details : I) The United Nations and its values ? Its \u201croad to failure\u201d grand-opening can be dated to the hostile negation of the existence of Yugoslavia in 1992. The World Order based on International Law and consecutive to WW2 was discarded after the end of the Cold-War, for only one hyperpower emerged after the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. The Badinter Commission, European community decisions, and U.N Security Council resolutions, then NATO destroyed the rule of both Constitutional & International Law and legitimate monopoly of violence for existent States in exchange for the rule of both self determination of non sovereign entities arbitrary designed (and hence, not even people) and alleged (and unilateral) interventionism, hence, an even worst one that before WW1.The formation of the breakaway States secating ethnic lines, the denial of the right to resistance, and the victories on the ground of standing States, the non U.N sanctioned attack against the Federal Yugoslavia in 1999, then annexation of Kosovo & Metochia by the U.S.A and NATO, then it\u2019s sham \u201cindependence\u201d, led straight to the situation we know today in Iraq (2003 - today), Georgia (2008 - today), Libya & Syria (2011 - today), Ukraine (2014 - today) : torn countries, when the mightiest rule as it sees fit, nonobsting any form of International Law that lost most of its credit in the 90s.The Interventionism and Unilateralism of the U.S.A & NATO, and per consequence, and to a lesser extend Russia, are hence dangerous.Still today, the U.S.A keep attacking or threatening various People and countries (Syria, North-Korea, Venezuela, Iran), as did or still do their allies (France/NATO in Libya (2011), Israeli colonization of Palestinian territories, Saudi Arabia in Yemen)II) The Global village ? Still ongoing right now in the developed World who exploits the less developed World, it never faces nowadays a wider resistance from numerous States, including from its leadership itself : The U.S.A tightened their immigration as the consequences of their wars in the Middle-East and the Islamist terrorism that ensued,the far right, both traditionalist and europeanocentrist (if not all out xenophobe), wants to clean its own part of the village, is progressing in many European States, starting with Italy and France, but also Hungary and various States from Eastern Europe & Scandinavia. The Western Balkans are still in latent turmoil, the whole Balkans face depopulation and\u2026 populism at the same time.Russia has been casted out of the village and hence leads its own course toward unilateralism (and I don\u2019t blame them), remilitarization, autharcy toward the West and Asianism.China doesn\u2019t want middle-East migrants because it judges the West responsible and has enough mouth to feed anyway.And powerful nationalisms tainted of xenophobia rose in the whole Asia, accompanying the affirmation of the Asian countries as growing economic powers, after freeing themselves from the former patronage of the West since WW2.India, biggest multipartist republic in the World, is still facing a radical Pakistan and God knows what might happens in the decades to come between those two.The Muslim World as a whole is \u201cin question\u201d, from shitty borders created by the British and French in the 20s and leading to impossible harmony in the Muslim countries, to the opposition between Shia and Sunnite Islam, and the opposition between both part of the \u201cOumma\u201d and the Western World.Africa is still in question also, in an even deeper shit than the Muslim World, for similar reasons and then more (underdeveloppement, still ongoing demographic transition, massive exploitation of its ressources from both the West and now China, supportive of authoritarian, if not murderous regimes who allow them to do so).In south-America also, the socialist Venezuela is fighting for its survival against the American predation, while Brazil also turned up to populism, on the far right side.All of this shows a quite damage \u201cvillage\u201d in my opinion, which might keep breaking up in its limbs as much as it expends in its trade & infrastructures. III) These breaking up patterns are also challenging greatly the liberal democracy our global civilization was supposed to be about along International Law, global village & market : China remain, with its own reasons, resistant to liberal democracy, and retained its single party system, while achieving a record growth and the emergence of a middle class. That\u2019s an inspiration for many.Russia, after the failure and U.S backed self betrayal and perversion of the newly conquered liberal-democracy in the 90s, went back to a mild authoritarianism, still in a multipartite system, but with one block strong than all others.Serbia followed the same direction 10 years later, but is in a much weaker position.Hungary is also following that direction.\u201cAmusingly\u201d, France also saw its political life re-centralized around an local Hegemon, but from\u2026 the liberal democrat chapel.The U.S.A themselves, beyond the Democrat/Republican opposition, are seen widely as a duopoly which disagrees only marginally from a foreigner standpoint, despite the endless debates and theatrics, and perpetuate each others\u2019 policies in the World as a playground / supermarket to rob. Same could be said about the other important NATO countries, like France or the U.K. Beyond the different colors, it\u2019s more than less the same materials : greedy and careerist politicians, converted to both neo-liberalism, competition/competitivity, and global predation.And it hence seems that having either a single party, either a local Hegemon in a multipartite system, either a strong duopoly for the World Hyperpower, follows a parallel line with expressing a fierce sovereignty for many countries, mostly against the Western Global Hegemon-wannabe/wanna-remain, while working/attempting-to-be/puppeted-to-be multipartite systems in which democratic patterns are strong are often easily \u201cbuyable\u201d by predators, thanks to both economical and political liberalism, and an inner sense of moderation (\u201clet\u2019s not play tough and get in trouble\u201d/\u201dWe\u2019re dependent on others anyway\u201d).Hence, despite their numerous flaws and \u201cundesirable\u201d internal situation, countries like China, Russia, North-Korea, Iran, Syria, Cuba, or Venezuela, demonstrates a much higher sovereignty and resistance to American influence than the Western liberal democracies and those they emulate in the World, of higher potential capabilities and yet much lesser sovereign behavior.In a World more and more craving for sovereignty after the partial failure of the U.S led system to bring freedom, democracy, and\u2026 equality to everyone while preserving both territorial integrity, peace, and traditional sense of identity in the targets of the U.S Foreign policy, I\u2019d say that the Western \u201cliberal democracy\u201d is facing challenges, and the more the U.S.A will keep pushing, the more the others will keep resisting. The global market, finally, which is the core point of this system. Will it endure ? It\u2019s the most solid also : People, countries, and companies want to trade, no matter what, for obvious reason : money is everything, bring wealth, prosperity, opportunities, to those able to captate it, nonobsting who likes who. And like water, if something blocks its flow, that something will be bypassed at some point and new conduits will be found.Hence, the prevalence of the dollar on Global Trade is currently endangered by the unilateralism and bellicism of the United States, may it be through arms, may it be through diplomatic and economic sanction. The dollar was never neutral, but now its prevalence prevents more and more country to trade freely (including big ones : Russia, Iran, etc), this situation leads many countries, starting with China, India and Japan, to consider bypassing the U.S sanctions, diversifying their forex currencies reserves, and develop/use crypto currencies to escape the system.The U.S.A have been investing themselves a lot, including their trade balance or the unity of Europe (to avoid the emergence of a competitor), to foster this dollar system granting them \u201cdominance and control\u201d over the global trade. But due to both the problem their governance pose on the World-Affairs, and their related loss of appeal and credibility, that investment fruit is rotting as the branch its hanging from, and the \u201csingle tree\u201d (US.Dollar) surrounded by bushes might be replaced in the decades to come by a Savana (US.Dollar, Euro, Yuan, Pound Sterling) and why not Yen, Ruble (Russia is currently piling up massive amounts of Gold), Rupee, and crypto-currencies meeting the threshold of \u201cglobal reliability\u201d (like the Bitcoin might or might not), once the time comes.Hence, a global system will most probably be preserved about money and trade, but become more diverse, and emphasis on its neutrality rather than one of its actor hegemony.",

We survived the Ice Ages, the Black Plague, the Thirty Years War, World War II and the second half of the 20th century. Panicking about the future of civilization is a time-proven method of drawing attention to some cause or other. Humanity will adapt, and civilization will go on in most cases, as humans are resilient and adaptable. Climate change? Sea levels do not rise by a meter a year.Pandemics? Most diseases are not all that lethal. Bear in mind that the Black Plague killed something like 1/3 of the population of Europe.Catastrophic terrorism? Unless it makes the earth uninhabitable, civilization will recover. Something that will kill global civilization would have to be massive and quick. Nuclear irradiation of most of the planet's surface, perhaps.A disease as lethal as Ebola - but with a long incubation period with little or no symptons so it could spread across the world without detection, maybe.

            "answer_text": "A lot of phenomena in the world are chaotic, which means that the probability of huge variations of a system are statistical in nature.  A certain huge event is almost certain to occur in a certain time period. In this century \"the boat is being rocked\" pretty hard by the massive number of social changes that have happened. The question is will it go with a bang or a whimper? I think it will go with a whimper - disasters and crises will be spread out around the world, times may get hard for a lot of people, but not deadly. On the whole things get better and better - I live in a \"third world\" country, but my quality of life is hugely better than that of people from my parents generation. They had to work really really hard for the simple stuff. I am a fan of Kurzwelian ideas, and I believe that things will get exponentially better, and the next 2 decades will be a huge leap forward. I eagerly await the day when the \"nation-state\" meme is chucked into the dustbin of history. ",
