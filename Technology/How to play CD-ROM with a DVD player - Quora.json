            "answer_text": "It all really depends. What kind of \u201cCD-Rom\u201d is it: a music cd or a computer program cd? What kind of DVD player is it? One found installed (connected to ) a computer or a Stand alone Mediaplayer movie DVD player. A store purchased / studio produced Audio CD should play in both styles of DVD players. A computer program install CD will only work in a computer DVD drive. This is all assuming that you are aware that CD\u2019s, DVD\u2019s & Blu-Ray\u2019s are all different technology and though some people use the terms interchangably they are in fact very distinctly different, so you have to be careful to use the right terms when your talking about the different technologies.

            "answer_text": "When you say a CD-ROM, it means a data CD. Such a CD-ROM or a data CD cannot be played back on a DVD player. Most DVD players can play audio CDs only. However, one can create a CD which is not really like any commercial audio CD but a data CD that contains audio tracks in MP3 or other new formats (not WAV). The new generation of DVD Players can read the menu structure of the CD and display the menu on a TV. ",
