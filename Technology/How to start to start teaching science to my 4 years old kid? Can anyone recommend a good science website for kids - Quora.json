            "answer_text": "Wait. You want to allow children to learn in a learner-centered environment. To do this, you need to change the way you view education. You, as parent-teacher, are a guide. Do not teach as the authority. Instead, listen to your child\u2019s thoughts and questions, and respond to these. Children are natural scientists. They ask questions and try to fit the answers into a hypothesis. Why are trees green?Why is the sky blue?How do trees grow?Where is the sun at night?Why, when I get into the bathtub, does the water rise?What are those floaty things I see when the sun\u2019s rays shine through my window?Which is heavier, a pound of feathers or a pound of lead?So, the research needed to answer these questions is research for you to do, and then it is your job to explain what you learned to answer your child's questions. There is no website for you to accomplish the task of educating your child in all subjects of interest relating to science. When questions are beyond your ken to answer, find an expert.  When my child was three, he was in pre-school. He knew all things were made of matter, and matter was made of atoms. And then he asked a question which I could not answer: What is the difference between a photon and an electron?I didn\u2019t know. I could not find an answer (pre-internet). So I telephoned UCLA\u2019s physics department and asked if someone could explain it to me. They did. A grad student ended up coming over to join us for a few dinners (plus pay) and answered our questions in a way that satisfied my child\u2019s desire to understand more than I could teach. He has been an autodidact ever since. Ditto, his sister. And, ditto, their mother. ",
