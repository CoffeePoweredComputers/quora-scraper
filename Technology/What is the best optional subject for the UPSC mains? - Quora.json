            "answer_text": "Before I begin, I should tell you that I am a graduate in Chemical Engineering, but chose Political Science and International Relations (PSIR) as optional subject for UPSC CSE Mains 2015. And despite many people calling me \u2018crazy\u2019 for such a choice, I managed to get through in my first attempt, with 5 or 6 months of preparation in PSIR. In short, the answer would be - There is no such \u201cbest subject\u201d. Its a myth. The thumb rule of choosing the optional subject for UPSC CSE, accepted by most successful and aspiring candidates, is that you must be interested in it. However, in the initial stages of preparation it is extremely difficult to make out which subject really is interesting enough to sustain an aspirant\u2019s attention for the next 1 or 2 years at a stretch. I myself went through the dilemma of choosing a \u2018scoring\u2019 or \u2018manageable\u2019 optional subject, for almost a month during the initial phase of my preparation. Steps to follow before you settle for a particular subject - (1) Divide your attention between science and humanities subjects first up. Ask yourself which line of thought you are more \u2018comfortable\u2019 with. It does not matter which stream you graduated in, as long as you are convinced about your own strengths and weaknesses in two separate fields. This is easy to decipher. I knew that I hated engineering, and did not have the time to prepare a science subject - humanities was my obvious choice. (2) Look at the list of optional subjects in UPSC CSE notification, and straightaway discard a few. There are 25 such subjects, excluding the regional languages, and you can easily make out which ones just don\u2019t appeal to you. For me, such \u2018straightaway rejects\u2019 would be Botany, Engineering subjects, Management, Mathematics, Medical Science, Zoology, Statistics, Commerce and Economics. These should be the subjects in which you have absolutely ZERO interest. (3) The list is already narrowed down, and you should not be left with more than 8 to 10 subjects after first 2 steps. For the remaining subjects, check the following - Syllabus, Previous Years Question Papers, and availability of material for self study. You don\u2019t have to get into any kind of big data analysis, but a cursory glance at the keywords in the syllabus, and question papers will tell you whether you are feeling okay to go ahead with a particular subject. For example, I don\u2019t like reading maps at all, and I am pretty weak in identifying exact spots on a map - hence I would reject Geography even though it is not entirely out of my ambit of interest. (4) You may still be unable to decide, and be left with 2 or 3 options. In such a situation pick up the most basic book (ideally Class XI or XII NCERT) for each of the remaining subjects, and get through with it in 2\u20133 days each. You will yourself know the option that you will be going ahead with now. I was confused between Sociology and PSIR at this stage, and Step 4 worked very well for me. A short comparative analysis of Science and Humanities subjects Science subjects - More scoring than humanities counterparts. But need way more time for completion of syllabus and revision. Besides, these subjects have no overlap with GS syllabus. Humanities subjects - Difficult to score in, and vulnerable to \u2018swings of scoring and marking by UPSC\u2019. But need less time to complete, and knowledge of some subjects like PSIR, Sociology and Anthropology is very helpful in Essay, Ethics, Interview and GS. To conclude, I must say that ALL the subjects have equally good chance of fetching good marks. It depends on YOU how you handle that subject. ",

            "answer_text": " Selecting the most relevant IAS Mains Optional goes a long way in helping a student score well in Civil Services Mains Exam. The Civil Services Main examination is designed to test the intellectual prowess of an aspirant. It is intended to assess the overall intellectual traits and depth of understanding of candidates. This is why the most appropriate IAS Mains Optional needs to be selected before beginning preparation.

Invest a lot of time in reading and understanding the syllabus.In case you do not want to opt for a subject you studies during graduation or if that optional is not a part of the official list, then go back to your school and college days. Think about your favorite subjects. Think about the subjects you excelled in, in which subject you showed more interest and in the subject in which you scored the most.Now contemplate on your current situation. See which areas of news you are more interested in. Think which topics of General Studies you like more. Some people like history, some like polity, some sociology, so on and so forth. Think of shortlisting them as your Optional subject.Now see the list of UPSC Optionals again.Based on above criteria, make a list of 4-5 subjects which captivates your interest.Now go through the previous year question papers (at least 3 years) of the shortlisted Subjects. Read all the questions. Again gauge yourself the level of interest you have or residual knowledge you possess to answer each question. It\u2019s just to know yourself how comfortable you are with a subject. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know answer to any question.Analyse the syllabus and ponder over the fact that whether it will keep you interested throughout your preparation. This is really important.Finally, the availability of materials and guidance in the form of coaching matters a lot.

Though the number of candidates selecting each optional for IAS mains can vary year to year, the below table gives an average estimation for the coming years based on past year trends of optional subjects (As per latest syllabus). Please keep in mind that all optional subjects are high scoring if you have knowledge in the subject and if you can answer the questions in an analytical frame of mind in line with the latest requirements of UPSC. 4 Things to Avoid While Choosing an Optional \u201cMy Friends and Family have suggested it.\u201dDo not choose an optional because a friend or a family member suggested it. 2. \u201cMost students opt for it.\u201d Do Not opt for an optional just because it is what most of the aspirants have chosen. Believe it or not many serious candidates fall prey to this and waste attempts before they even realize it and still many realize it after exhausting their attempts. 3. \u201cIts a high scoring IAS Mains optional\u201d Candidates have cleared this exam with almost every optional and not just with the so called high scoring optional. In UPSC there is no high scoring-low scoring optional but only a paper, an innocent examinee and a ruthless examiner. High scoring-Low scoring optional is a myth. 4. \u201cThe topper chose this subject last year\u201d Don\u2019t let your judgment be guided by the optional chosen by the previous year toppers. Probably they topped the examination because they did not base their choice of options on the subjects chosen by still past toppers. ",
