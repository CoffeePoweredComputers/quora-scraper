            "answer_text": "Star Wars is unpretentious. It knows it\u2019s diesel punk fantasy and never tries to act all sciency-wiency with it\u2019s graviton fields and deflector field modulcations. Except for that one time  with the god-damned midichlorians. Star Wars is about action and good vs evil using space as the backdrop rather than the story line. There\u2019s no muddling about in the morality of interfering with other cultures, they just blow the fuck out of them.  Star Wars doesn\u2019t care which directions the bombs fall or the logic of needing 2 people to drop a cluster of bombs from directly overhead, it\u2019s a World War 2 analog to the T. It deals with absolutes, good and evil\u2026or is that just the Sith?  or did I just deal in absolutes by saying the Sith only deal in absolutes? Fuck! It talks about taking down an empire, it initially follows a hero\u2019s journey to take down a massive evil empire. Then it back tracks to talk about muddy politics and a creepy old man taking power. Then it goes forward to talk about abuse and fascism. But with LASERSWORDS!  Star Trek tries to be a lot of different things, mostly taking a traditional sci-fi route of using technology as the backdrop for asking questions about modern life. DS9 is a lot of people\u2019s favorites because it\u2019s a lot more distilled\u2026you can see this right away in how the different captains handle Q\u2026Picard works around him, and out negotiates him  Sisko beats the crap out of him  Janeway outdid them all by saving the Q by teaching Q\u2019s kid to not be such an asshole.  TNG was about exploration, negotiation, morality, diplomacy, solving problems without fighting except when absolutely necessary. DS9 realized some problems needed solving though fighting, even with very tense negotiations. Voyager fixes every problem at the root. Fixing the Q, destroying the Borg at the source, lying, cheating, stealing to survive. In the Orville, which is a homage to Star Trek, there was an episode, Mad Idolatry that takes a massive swipe at the Prime Directive. One of the crew helps an injured native with their futuristic technology and then they leave. The planet disappears and reappears and thousands of years have passed. The planet made the crew member out to be a god and formed a religion out of her, which was one of the main reasons why the \u201cprime directive\u201d (In Star Trek) existed. They leave a robot AI there to work things out and help guide them away from this. 11 days later when the planet comes back, they beam aboard and the people are more\u2026enlightened. They say that they would have worshipped something else if the crew member hadn\u2019t been there. That their interference didn\u2019t really change anything at all. Star Wars dispenses with the morality and gets right into the action. There\u2019s some philosophy about the Force, but it\u2019s mostly irrelevant to the plot other than: be nice, be respectful, don\u2019t Force drive angry. ",

            "answer_text": "Better? Yes, if you are more attracted to action scenes, special fx and fantasy fiction (instead of science fiction), with a binary, even puerile portrayal of good and evil, including heavily stereotyped characters and common tropes. No, if you don't care as much for any of that as you do for a more complex character profiling, convoluted interactions, science (at least of the pretend kind) fiction and a very blurry line of good vs evil (Picard was the best character to introduce such problems in any star trek show so far, IMO) set out in a web-like landscape of different races. Even though many races of star trek are very stereotyped (Klingons and Vulcans mostly), they managed to introduce grey areas even in such seemingly caricature-esque populace (corruption and cowardice in the Killingon high council, terrorist Vulcans with the mind reasonator, struggle between emotion and rationale in half breeds). Star Trek, and most of all TNG introduced some real moral problems that I found of great interest (euthanasia, eugenics, despotism, ethical issues regarding newer technologies among many others), you won't find any of that in Star Wars. Though I do watch SW and enjoy it, it's mostly a more superficial kind of enjoyment than that which some shows from Star trek provide me. ",
