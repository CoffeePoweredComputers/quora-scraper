            "answer_text": "A very thoughtful question indeed! I've come across a lot of cases which have developed into complications, and the reason which can be attributed to this is self-medication. Basically, OTC drugs are supposed to be harmless. But there still exists a small fraction of pharmacies which provide medicines (non-OTC) without a proper doctor's prescription. Prima facie, this constitutes a major problem when the CNS drugs are involved, i.e. the drugs used for depression, anxiety and other sleep medicines. The patients are at a greater loss here. They often do not come to know if they have become tolerant towards that drug or have become addicted. Needless to say, continuous intake majorily makes the body dependent on medicines, quipping around with a \u201cchalta hai\u201d attitude. If a doctor has asked you to follow prescription until \u2018x\u2019 days, then you should have a follow up after the schedule is done. Also, you should not stop medicines in between or take on alternate days. This constitutes one of the major reasons why MDR-TB has come into preview of our existence. Lastly, it is imperative that you, as a patient, know where you have to draw a line. Even WHO says, \u201cself medication when done correctly is self-care, but beyond that it is self-harm.\u201d If you do not have an idea about how different doses work of the same medicine, do NOT take it without doctor's consultation. It might have worked for XYZ, but it may not work for you. Life is very precious. Do not necessarily put life at risk. That's it. Thank you for A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two types of self-medicating behavior. The first one involves taking medications/supplements for your concerns without consulting a medical doctor. The effects of these are debatable. Some individuals do great when they use alternative medicines, and some end up harming their bodies more than they realize. This kind of self-medication is a trial and error process and can go either way. The other kind of self-medication is what is more closely associated with my profession. This involves use of a substance to cope with stress and mental illness. Most people doing this get physically and psychologically dependent on the substance. Additionally, they get increasingly disconnected with their own thoughts and emotions, and go through life without really \u201cexperiencing\u201d anything. ",
