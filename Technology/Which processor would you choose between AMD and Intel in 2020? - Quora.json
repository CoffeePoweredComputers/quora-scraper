            "answer_text": "If I was building a high-end gaming PC, or a PC for Adobe Suite software, I\u2019d definitely get a new Intel CPU - for example the i5-9600KF or i7-9700. If I had a workload which was particularly memory-bandwidth sensitive, but didn\u2019t require a huge amount of single-thread CPU performance, I\u2019d choose an old Intel Xeon E5 CPU - some E5s are extremely cheap (e.g. the 10-core 2660 V2 only costs $100), and they support quad-channel memory, but the cores are individually relatively slow. I\u2019d choose AMD for anything else. AMD\u2019s \u201cZen 2\u201d architecture provides better value, efficiency and IPC (instructions per clock) performance than anything Intel makes, but is limited in the clock speeds it can reach under normal conditions, and has worse memory latency. This means that AMD\u2019s Ryzen CPUs tend to run lightly-threaded tasks such as most video games slightly slower than Intel\u2019s competing CPUs. AMD also lacks some of the specialist acceleration technology built into Intel\u2019s iGPU, but there is not much software that doesn\u2019t have better alternative options for acceleration from AMD or Nvidia, with Adobe Creative Suite being the main exception.

            "answer_text": "I recently built a PC for myself. Since past 14 years which I have been interested in Computers and other Electronics, I have built PC a few times, and bought laptops multiple times including for my family. I have gotten HP Dell Lenovo Apple Laptops and used PCs for my work as well. I have always chosen Intel so far. But last year this changed. I for the first time recommend an AMD based Laptop to one of my friend and built an AMD based PC for myself a couple of months back. AMD has been on roll in desktop segment CPUs for past few years. They are not just an economic option anymore, they are performance workhorse and still keeping the value for money tag. 2020 is gonna be no different either. They have been lagging Intel in laptop segment but in CES 2020, they have announced Ryzen 4000 series Mobile Processors based on 7nm architecture. Already many Laptop makers have showed devices based on these AMD processors. AMD will also launch Ryzen 4000 series CPUs with even higher core count and better performance. Intel is now doing catch up to AMD. ",
