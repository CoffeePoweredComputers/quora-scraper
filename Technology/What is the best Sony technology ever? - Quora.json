            "answer_text": "The best Sony technology in this little guy here.   This the TR63 from 1957. It was a solid state transistor handheld radio. It revolutionised the world. This is what you had before that little guy.  The Sony TR63 gave people the ability to have their radio stations playing their favourite songs and entertainment in the palm of their hands and could be taken anywhere with them. This along with the youth generation popularised it and the use of the solid state transistor was like magic. It brought a whole new technology to the electronics industry. We had transistors before but they were tube transistors like this.  What they brought was something like this.  This about the size of half a dime. This little guy just made tube computer systems that took up a whole office building flat for just the computer to something that at that time could fit into a single room. They would eventually bring home computers to reality in the 70s and billions of them in the CPU of your every day smartphone.  This from an Intel i7 CPU. All that is billions of transistors, capacitors, and switches. All that started with the success of that little TR63 Sony transistor radio with the solid state transistor. It wasn't the first but was what ushered in the technology that still continues today ever growing on how to gain more power into a shrinking and more complex package. ",

            "answer_text": "For me the most memorable, most iconic, and my most used Sony device ever was\u2026  OH yeah, the Sony Walkman! I was sporting these orange spongy headphones with cassette player clipped on my waist, before and after school in the early 80s when I was in junior high. I didn't have enough allowance to buy cassette tracks from my favorite artists from the mall stores like Tower Records. But there was an even better way to create my Playlist - just sit at home with the family boom box and listen to your favorite station and quickly press Record when the DJ stops talking. When I was proud of my newest mixed tape, I'd let others listen to it, especially the girls, hehe. Walking the hallways in school, The Walkman always gave me an extra bounce to my steps, a level of confidence, a certain zest for life. No wonder Hollywood from time to time pays homage to it\u2026  Thank you Sony for adding Awesomeness to my youth! (now where is that shoebox of mixed tapes) ",
