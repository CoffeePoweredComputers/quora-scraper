            "answer_text": "Oakley is one of the many brands owned by Essilor/Luxottica, probably the largest single eye wear manufacturer in the world. Some of the other popular sun brands owned by them include Ray Ban, Costa, and Foster Grant. You can see that they have to manage thousands of SKUs related to each brand, and to multiple manufacturing sites around the world. That is only possible with a powerful and efficient computerized inventory control and tracking system. While I don\u2019t know the specifics of their system, it would have to be on par with other huge retail sites, i.e. Amazon, Walmart, Ali Baba, etc. and designed for the specialized needs of the company. This type of inventory/manufacturing tracking and control requires a separate corporate division for this purpose alone. ",

            "answer_text": "Yep , the inventory is amazing .They have many models to begin with then each one comes in several different colours . You can mix and match front colours with different temple colours , then there are 4 or 5 choices of lens colours for each model. I think the only answer to how they do it is\u2026Leprechauns. Throughout history , Leprechauns have been known for their refined accounting and inventory control skills. Microsoft and Amazon use them also. ",
