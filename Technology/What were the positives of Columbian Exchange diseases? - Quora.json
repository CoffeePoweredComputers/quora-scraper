            "answer_text": "Although one of the negative impacts of the Colombian Exchange was the death of 80% of the Native American population due to disease, it was also great for the population overall in the Americas. As food production increased (because of plenty of cultivation land and food trades), so did the population. If the death of the Native Americans never occurred, the Americas would be considered overpopulated and the food surplus would start to decrease. That would eventually lead to the death of Natives and Europeans. ",
