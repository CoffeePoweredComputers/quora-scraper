            "answer_text": "I think that the basic models and it shorter variants do it fine, a simple yet effective weapon, it has a every angle \u201cedged\u201d power that doesn\u2019t really need more than one blade, If they were equiped with spiky edges so they wouldn\u2019t need to be switched on ti be used, it\u2019d clearly be better. But still. But I\u2019ll argue if the simple, classy lightsaber is the best weapon in my opinion, a 2 or +2 bladed weapon like Kylo Ren\u2019s crossguard can hit an objective multiple times with shorter moves, a doble lightsaber offers the opportunity of hitting anything within a 360 degrees circle with 90 degrees movements, quite useful, not only for fighting, but also for blocking shoots, a critical point of lightsaber fencing in the far away galaxy, which brings me to a quite controversial point\u2026  This is a doble lightsaber that spins by clicking a button, not by moving the hand, which, if used with precission, means a wider range, faster movements (as we discussed how it lets us quicker movements through smaller angles) and the usage of less muscles per hit (for I do not need to make the hit itself, only to put the blade on the right track) which also means less exercise, and with it, less tireness, this little hated-by-fans weapon can easily be the greatest weapon of all times.   See?? The most efficent blaster deflection I\u2019ve ever seen. Also this theory of mine means that Crossguard lightsaber is not that stupid (it hurts me to not backlash it, but I must be pragmatic) Episode IX proved my point fairly as we see *minor spoiler* Kylo stabbing a guy with one of the secondary small blades.  It becomes clear that the more blades, the better. And of course I do see that a weapon full of tech such as the spinning doble saber can be proner to fail than a normal lightsaber, but still, every lightsaber is a delicate device, they all can fail, this is a fiction franchise. Nevertheless, dual phase and curved hilt lightsabers are worth mentioning, the first one can short and enlarge the blade, a tactic used to trick the enemy and making special moves, a curved hilt is great for dueling, as it can make angle changes during an attack, another great way of baiting the enemy.

            "answer_text": "For me, a crossguard saber with the guard open and joining the main blade, with a hilt that is plasma proof. Basically a space longsword, so that the fight scenes are based on actual fighting Manuel's and how they are used. I think this whole idea of no guard on the \u201csaber\" ( which is a sword framed for having a fucking guard) is meant to look cool, and we get it, based off samurai and eastern philosophy but I mean a space cowboy soap opera, with knights in it. Make the fucking guys weapons more western is all, nothing wrong with that history overly neglected in hollywood. ",
