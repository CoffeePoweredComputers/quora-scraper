            "answer_text": "Bluetooth started out being a technology for low speed devices such as mice. Headphones are more likely to interfere because there is continuous data being transmitted. However, Bluetooth will not impact WiFi in most cases. Bluetooth uses the same frequencies as WiFi in the 2.4 GHz band. However, Bluetooth does not pick one frequency and stay on it. It hops around, trying to stay on frequencies with little other traffic. In addition, Bluetooth is a short range technology. The radios transmit much less power than WiFi. A Bluetooth device in your neighbor\u2019s house won\u2019t affect you. Your Bluetooth device won\u2019t affect somebody in the next room. ",

            "answer_text": "Its possible, as many unlicensed apparatus use the ILM band in which both systems operate. Bluetooth operates at 2.45 GHz while WiFi operates at 2.4 to 2.5 GHz. However Wifi is able to select any of three sub-bands that offer least interference. So unless this ILM band is already highly contended the WiFi connection will avoid the Bluetooth signal. However if you are experiencing trouble it may be useful to migrate to the 5.0GHz band which is currently less popular than 2.4GHz and will avoid Bluetooth completely. Modern WiFi appliances are usually already able to use the 5.0GHz band. All you need to do is to purchase a new router if your current device does not support 5.0GHz. The dual band router conforms to the WiFi standard 802.11ac. These routers will also support all legacy WiFi standards too. A major advantage of a 5.0GHz router is that you get much enhanced WiFi speeds. The 802.11ac spec covers speeds of up to 1Gbps although in practice you will get less than this depending on router placement giving optimum signal strength and the WAN speed your ISP is providing.
