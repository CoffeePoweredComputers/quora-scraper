            "answer_text": "In some sense, much like chemistry, geology might be considered a fairly \u201cmature\u201d scientific discipline in that we know the overall organizing framework (plate tectonics), deep time, the geological time chart, evolution of species over geological time, the rock cycle and so on - the big pieces are currently known. There are certainly a lot of details to be discovered. Some big topics in geoscience remaining that impact humans include: predicting earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, better ways to discover mineral deposits, and working with other professions to better understand how the Earth system works as an integrated whole (e.g. understanding past and present climate change). New frontiers in geology are starting to be in the area of other planets, moons, asteroids, etc. in our solar system and working with astronomers in understanding exoplanets in other star systems (especially, signs of life).
