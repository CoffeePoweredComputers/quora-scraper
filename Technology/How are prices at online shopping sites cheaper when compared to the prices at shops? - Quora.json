            "answer_text": "There's a couple reasons, and I know because I work for one. The first is that there is a huge lack of over head that is associated with having retail locations, which must be built, stocked, staffed, maintained, taxed, and all with an eye to establish in prime locations that will ensure enough business to profit or at least survive. Some online stores get around this by just warehousing their product, and then only shipping things out through online orders. In this case they reduce many of those costs. They don't need to staff as much, and they don't need to consider buying space in prime locations for business. They simply have to locate the warehouse(s) in a location that is convenient to ship to a wide swath of customers - way easier to do, and way cheaper. If those companies are smart and want an edge in the market, they compete with box stores by passing on those savings to customers. Granted, shipping has costs too - that is why some consideration needs to be given to location, as well as logistics - for example, reducing packaging to what's needed, combining products in one box, and reducing the number of half-full delivery vehicles. This is one of the reasons why online stores really want to encourage bigger orders. Larger orders are more profitable for them than small since they pay for shipping by the truck. My company, like others, is a drop-shipper, which involves another level of removal from the physical product itself. Drop shippers work with warehouses, suppliers and producers directly. They basically take over the the function of marketing, promotions, ordering and returns for the product(s), and, after payment by a customer, send over instructions to the warehouses (, etc.) on what was ordered and where to send it. In return the drop shipper pays the warehouse for the ordered product, but not without taking a cut first. This can get very complicated if a drop shipper is 'representing' multiple warehouses and suppliers. While they lack a physical location and huge staff, they must have a good website, great code, excellent organization, and the logistic capacity to handle requests that may have many different kinds of fulfillment instructions depending on what's ordered. Even though those things cost money, it's still much less than having a 300 box stores all around the country - all of whom have to deal with the same issues anyway. This means that savings are generally passed down in order to stay competitive (box store brands are much much more visible, obviously).  Hope that explains it! ",

            "answer_text": "It is cheaper on many instances. I do a lot of shopping on line because of the following reasons: We can know more about the product, user reviews from the website. For further details we can go the manufacturer\u2019s website and other sites. We have opportunity to write to the seller as well as manufacturer regarding the product.Prices are generally competitive.Return Policies - the product can be returned if it is not as described in the offer, defective, damaged during transit, etc. even after opening the package and using it during Return Period. The On line stores will pick up from our place and replace it and or refund the amount paid without any issue.Tax Invoices are issued for almost all items.The purchase order can be cancelled before it is delivered and the amount paid by us will be refunded within a day or two .More importantly, we can see many models and brands or similar items without moving from our chair and order them at your convenience.It will not disturb in any way your scheduled appointments.However, we have to be very careful while selecting a on line stores.Offers/discounts etc will be notified.I prefer to buy petty items from street shops as they are cheep when compared to the on line stores Ex. a USB cable, cell phone charger, adapter, converter and similar items. In cities, we have to plan for shopping and a lot of time is wasted in finding suitable multi-brand stores, travel in heavily congested roads, move from shop to shop and search for a parking place ( many a times parking charges will be collected). In case of electronics, like mobiles, cameras, etc. the shop keeper allows you to open the package only after making payment ; and even if the item is found to be defective there itself, we will be asked to approach the manufacturer. Many shop keepers hesitate to issue a Tax Invoice. I prefer to buy my requirements mostly on line, except garments, grocery/provisions, vegetables, edible oils and other food items. For other these items I go to Amazon or Flipkart or Snapdeal which are the best on line stores available in India and they are trust-worthy. ",
