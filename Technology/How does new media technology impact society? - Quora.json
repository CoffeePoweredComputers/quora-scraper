            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s look at the times that had the greatest technological innovation. Recorded jazz became popular in the 1920\u2019s. Due partly to the fact that sound and radio engineering made tremendous strides. AM broadcast radio, \u2018 78 RPM vinyl records with cactus thorns as needles. Later, 45\u2019s and still later 331/3 rpm. We still use some of the same technologies that were developed then; a flat disk with a hole in the middle for non-linear audio playback. Topologically similar to the Edison wax cylinder but much more useful. It still exists in the form of spinning hard disk drives. During the cold war, in 1969, We actually put a human being on the moon and returned him to earth unharmed. Not because it was easy. But because it was hard. It was a challenge. Part of that challenge was to beat the Soviets to the moon. But we did it. What have we done since then? People have died in space. Plenty of unmanned missions. In 1969 NASA was cheered. Since then NASA has since become a plaything of politicians and conspiracy theorists. In my own work as a film and video colorist, the work is based on \u2018color science\u2019 which in turn is based on \u2018color spaces\u2019. (checks NDA. OK) Theatrical distribution of films uses a color space called x,y,z. It is based on work that was done in 1931. I kid you not. All of those oversimplified examples happened in the wake of large scale World Wars. I\u2019m not advocating for a third world war. The last two were bad enough. We still have some innovation going on. But it is nowhere near the scale that it once was. Large scale innovation is flattening out. And with it, our growth, our economy, and our expectations for the future. The US seems to now be in the business of exporting movies, TV shows, business models, culture, technology, media. The whole world seems to have become what they used to call in econ 101 \u201cAn economy of taking in each other\u2019s washing.\u201d But let\u2019s look on the bright side. Humanity is down but not out. We\u2019ll figure out how to have innovation without a World War. Or die trying. Some of our best entertainment came out of the Great Depression. It may have been a depression but it was a great one. So keep on smiling, \u2019Cause when you\u2019re smiling, the whole world smiles with you. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot and its mind bending realistic topics to three views in my opinion. 1) hard right not political right but. Not changing my mind im right view. 2) totally done with media the youth mostly. 3) hard left paranoid about everything even truth. Even if it is true or not super sceptical. This is a dangerous place for a society that has been working hard to grow and develop. This can silently start radical mindsets in people barely starting to understand what life is. Plus once u look at on hate news article the new AI search results will be stuck on that same bull shit news style. Its a loss to free browsing through the web ",
