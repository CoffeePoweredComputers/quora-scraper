            "answer_text": "Usually, part or all of one day. Sometimes, they want people to do all the CBL\u2019s as part of orientation so your position would determine how many CBL\u2019s you have and can determine how long orientation lasts. I\u2019ve seen them tell people that orientation will last a whole week. Of those, most are on the floor either towards the end of the first day or early the 2nd day. Some, that may not handle computers so well, will take the entire week, but that\u2019s pretty rare. It can also depend on how many people are in your orientation and how many computers are in the training room. My Walmart had 5 computers and would only schedule 4 people at a time for orientation. That way, each person in orientation would have a computer and there would be one left over for associates that might need one. If your Walmart schedules more people for orientation than they have computers, it could take a little longer depending on how they do everything else. ",

            "answer_text": "A couple of hours, a day? It\u2019s not really long. I don\u2019t remember exactly how long, but it\u2019s not long. Trust me there isn\u2019t a lot that you need to know. At least not in a classroom. Most of it is on-the-job training. Assuming that you get that much. Honestly, if you want to have an idea of what its like to work for Walmart - watch \u201cSuperstore.\u201d It\u2019s a bit dramatized, but you will get the idea. They kind of talk to you for a bit, make you watch a few videos, and then send you out to the world. Only skilled jobs such as cashier or deli or electronics will probably train you more. Everything else is figure it out as you go. It's not exactly a skilled job. You shouldn't treat it that way. ",
