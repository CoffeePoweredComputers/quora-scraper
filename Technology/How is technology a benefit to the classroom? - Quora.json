            "answer_text": "There are many benefits of technology in the classroom, particularly in the important STEM fields. STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Technology use in STEM has implications for workforce development, national security concerns, and immigration policy. 1) Technology in the classroom enables the use of more interactive educational tools, which allows for a dynamic learning experience that directly benefits students. Web 2.0 interaction involves not only sharing ideas and information with someone else but also receiving feedback. As classroom computer technology is being used for different types of communication (for presentation, for class interaction, and for collaboration), students are required to be readers, writers, editors, and publishers and must be willing to collaborate and co-create closely with others -- all skills that are critical for students to learn as they grow and enter the workplace. 2) Technology in the classroom provides flexibility and adaptability to differentiated learning. Technologies such as podcasts and vodcasts, for instance, provide students with the opportunity to learn at their own pace and the freedom to go back and relearn content whenever they want. This could be especially important for ESL students and students with learning disabilities: many ELL and ESL students need additional support with pronunciation and defining common vocabulary that may be new to them. Other students, might have difficulty reading and reviewing complex texts. The ability to access podcasts and vodcasts on classroom computers can help address these students' needs. Using technology in the classroom, therefore, can help combat the \"lecture style\" system of education, which does cater to a variety of learning processes.

            "answer_text": "Technology has been so seamlessly integrated in our day-to-day life that extending it further for education is an obvious step. While schools and educational institutes may or may not be tech savvy, the students are, moreso why technology in education is necessary and welcome. With technology, learning is accentuated, understanding is measurable and the entire experience is engaging for the students.  Here are few straightforward advantages of integrating technology in the classroom: 1.Immersive & Engaging Learning Technology in classrooms can help drive immersive learning with interactive videos, graphics, audios and presentations, garnering attention from the students. This engaging experience can help break down complex concepts and boring subjects into interesting learning exercises, ultimately helping the students to acquire more knowledge, both theoretically and practically. 2. Easy to update The curriculum if paired with technology, is easy to modify and update. Anything worse than no knowledge is wrong knowledge and hence with technology, rectifying mistakes as well as updating them with new findings becomes quick and easy. Technology ensures up-to-date knowledge reaches the classrooms and students. 3. Simplified home study Picking up at home from where the students left off in the classroom is easy with technology. Seamlessly integrated classroom learning sessions empower the parents to extend the learning at home without depending on manually transferred information. Technology can ensure that students learn in a specific way, both in school and at home, helping to avoid confusion, especially in the early years of learning. 4. Assistance to students with learning disabilities Not all students adapt the conventional means of learning with pen and paper. Technology comes to the rescue of students with learning disabilities. Tech in classrooms can eliminate the barriers in the learning, special learning techniques and methodologies can be introduced to ensure that everyone learns the way they are capable of. 5. Paperless exchange of progress reports Integration of technology can drastically help reduce the paperwork for teachers and educators and also provide a better way for parents to be involved in the learning. Teachers can share the progress reports of the kids and the parents can be informed of their kids development at all times. Currently Schools are using Education MDM software to secure and manage their school tablets, iPads and smartphones in the classroom. It helps them to restrict students from accessing unnecessary apps and websites apart from study related apps. It improves both teaching and learning practices. ",
