            "answer_text": "Rather then view this as a detailed question, why don\u2019t we ask a simpler question instead. What is the challenge of having users under go two forms of authentication as apposed to just one? You see there\u2019s a trade off between security and convenience. Having a thumb print to access your phone isn\u2019t necessary fun when it\u2019s raining, or your sweating or the hardware which recognizes it starts to ware. It isn\u2019t a matter of which one is best or is there a better one. If criminals really want to access data on a laptop there isn\u2019t anything stopping them from simply holding a gun to the person and forcing them to open the device. Or taking a picture of someone\u2019s thumb print to create the thumb print using 3D printing. Same thing with the voice metrics. I actually tried this service with my bank once and couldn\u2019t get into my account afterwards. So it\u2019s more about weighing the costs and benefits of each type of security. ",

Which one is best or is there a better one? The challenge is that ALL of them can be faked. ALL of them reduce to the generation of a random password that is then used. ANY damage to the person can destroy the identification - loss of fingers, damage to vocal cords, eye infections/degeneration\u2026 And you cannot replace them once they are duplicated\u2026 With the result that the best authentication is still a password. ANY of them can work find for an identification\u2026. but they suck for authentication. Almost (but not quite) as bad as using an unencrypted channel for passwords as EVERY biometric is essentially public information\u2026 ",
