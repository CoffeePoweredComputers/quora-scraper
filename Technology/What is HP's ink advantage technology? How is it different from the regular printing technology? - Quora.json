            "answer_text": "HP\u2019s Ink Advantage printers are designed to deliver affordable printers to school and college students. The range is enhanced with more features than its predecessors and is available at different prices to meet the customer needs. The Ink Advantage technology is added to the Deskjet printer range, hence they are compact and elegant in design. They are designed to use low-cost cartridges and are economically affordable. You will be able to buy genuine HP ink cartridges for a lesser price and the expected quality need not be compromised. The All-in-One range is designed to support Print, copy and scan functions. Many models support the mobile printing option as well. HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545, 3545, 3636, 4729 and 3776 are some of the best Ink Advantage models. These printers use the thermal inkjet technology like the other inkjets designed by HP and the difference is in the cost of the cartridges. ",
