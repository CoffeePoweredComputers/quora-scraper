            "answer_text": "The Only 7 Things You Can Control in Life The 7 Questions I Asked That Seriously Changed My Life From a young age, we\u2019re usually told not to ask a lot of questions\u2014don\u2019t interrupt the teacher; hold your comments until the end of the meeting; figure things out on your own. It was only upon deep reflection after turning 30 that I understood the magical power of simply asking. I realized I\u2019ve achieved many of my dreams in life\u2014moving to New York City, having a meaningful career, and finding love\u2014because I haven\u2019t been afraid to be vulnerable and ask for what I wanted. The good news: Anyone can learn how to do this more frequently and more effectively. If you aren\u2019t afraid to take action, anything is possible. I believe that your life\u2019s path can truly come down to a few defining moments and a handful of important questions. Here are seven questions that I asked that changed the course and quality of my life. 1. \u201cWould you like my phone number?\u201d  I said this to my now-husband. In my 20s, I was living in Sydney, Australia. One night my friend and I were debating whether to go to a concert. We almost didn\u2019t go out, but at the last minute we decided to stop by. I spotted a tall, handsome fellow in the crowd and was pleased when we were pushed together and started chatting. He made me laugh, and he seemed very genuine and warm. Before my friend and I left, I asked him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take my number?\u201d He did\u2014and he called the next day. We\u2019re celebrating five years of marriage this year. 2. \u201cCan we discuss my salary?\u201d For my first full-time job, I was a recruitment consultant and saw a lot of salary negotiations. Working in HR, I also understood how replacing a high performer was extremely time-consuming and expensive, so I knew my value as a hard-working, high-output employee. Since then, I\u2019ve negotiated my salary in each new job and each time I had increased responsibility or a good amount of success. As a result, I\u2019ve never complained about my paycheck, and I\u2019ve earned the same as (if not more than) some of my male counterparts. Remember: If you don\u2019t ask, the answer is always no. 3. \u201cMay I buy you a coffee?\u201d When I was 25, I arrived in New York with no connections, no network, and in desperate need of a job. I asked peripheral connections (largely people I met through the LinkedIn introductions I requested) to meet for coffee. Twenty-five lattes and a couple months later, I had two awesome job offers within the online advertising industry and accepted the highest-paying position. This kickstarted my professional network, which has grown exponentially over time. Never underestimate the power of a face-to-face meeting. (And don\u2019t forget: It\u2019s a two-way street. Always connect other people when you 4. \u201cCould I please ask you a favor?\u201d  Many of us are happy to help others, but we\u2019ll never ask for help in return. Don\u2019t deny others the pleasure of giving back to you! Personally, I ask for help with dog-sitting, setting up parties I host, and making connections to new people. As I am a pretty giving friend, people are normally happy to help me out\u2014and it makes my life a whole lot easier. It takes courage to ask and allow other people to help, but one of my favorite observations is the natural cycle of reciprocity that naturally occurs when we allow ourselves to receive. 5. \u201cCan I write for you?\u201d I wanted to write for the online publications that I love to read, so I took the chance to reach out to the editors and pitch my ideas. As a result, I\u2019m thrilled to have had my work published in various media outlets and have the opportunity to interview well-known figures such as Arianna Huffington, Sara Blakely, and Kris Jenner. My theory is based on this formula that I learned on my sales career: qualified activity X volume = conversion. All that means is if you ask decision-makers often enough and approach them with thoughtful, considered ideas, the results you want will eventually come. 6. \u201cMay I have a discount?\u201d This question has saved me thousands of dollars on items from designer shoes to flights to furniture. It feels like a game to me and I love it (even though it sometimes embarrasses my husband!). Before making the purchase, I simply ask: \u201cCan we work out a deal here?\u201d Often I\u2019ll also offer to pay in cash, buy in bulk, or write a sincere Yelp review if I am happy with the product. Try this at least once or twice\u2014you might even get hooked 7. \u201cWhat do I really, really want?\u201d  This is perhaps the most important question of all, and I come back to it frequently. When was the last time you paused and asked yourself what you really want? Maybe you haven\u2019t in a while, or maybe you never have. On an unhurried day, take an interrupted, quiet hour. Close your eyes, breathe deeply for a few minutes until you feel calm, and direct your attention inward. Ask yourself: \u201cWhat do I want most in this world?\u201dRemember, you don\u2019t have to go with the flow. You don\u2019t have to satisfy others\u2019 expectations. I had a few course corrects in life (an early divorce, some necessary partying pauses, an unfulfilling yet hard-to-leave-because-it-paid-well corporate career). At those times, I came back to myself when I needed to and allowed my intuition to guide me. Our intuition is rarely wrong. Ask yourself what you want, and the job/relationship/city/fill-in-the-blank will materialize. Then you just have to give yourself permission to pursue it..  ",
