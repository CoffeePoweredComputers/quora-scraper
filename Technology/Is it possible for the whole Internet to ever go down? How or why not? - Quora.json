            "answer_text": "As one of the other answers pointed out, the internet is not so much a \"physical thing\" as a \"concept\". Whilst the servers and infrastructure which give rise to that concept are physical entities, the internet itself is not those physical pieces of equipment, but the data stored on and transferred through them. Data is notoriously difficult to destroy even if only stored offline, as anyone will tell you who has ever recovered data from a wiped hard drive. Once you take that data and disseminate it throughout a whole global network of storage media, destruction becomes practically impossible, without taking down every router and storage medium connected to that network. The \"weakest point\" on the internet is probably the DNS nodes, which map the position of the data on the network, and translate \"human-friendly\" URL's into machine-friendly IP addresses. If you could work out a way to simultaneously take all of those DNS nodes offline at once, then theoretically it would be possible to \"take down the internet\", but you wouldn't actually be destroying any data or even bringing down the network as such, just making access to it massively more complicated. Anyone with fairly basic computer skills, and access to the IP addresses of the resources they needed could still access the data, so I'm not sure whether you could count that as the internet being \"down\" or just massively \"crippled\". For the internet to be truly destroyed, it would require that every server be destroyed simultaneously. Bearing in mind that some of those servers aren't even on this planet, but in orbit around it, the only event which I can think of which would have that effect would be a massive global EM event, which would also have the effect of taking every other piece of technology with it and returning mankind to the Dark Ages!

            "answer_text": "That would depend on what you consider to count as the whole Internet being down.  If you mean that every node that uses Internet Protocol stopped functioning-- well, no; even if Earth were destroyed by an asteroid, there would still be a couple left on or in orbit around Mars. If you mean more practically, that organizations connect their IP-speaking networks to each other... Maybe... It could happen with a virus that infects multiple vendor's routers (or the asteroid from my previous paragraph).  Cutting a few undersea cables won't do it (it could, at most, chop up the Internet into 2 parts or maybe a few.  Many of the most \"important\" sites are geographically and topologically diverse, so some stuff would still be reachable in each region.)   It could also happen if the economics of the Internet were to change.  Regulatory changes might do it, too.  The economics of the Internet provide N^2 (n-squared) benefit for N(N log N) cost.  This is hard to stop, unless some quadratic cost is added (enough to outweigh the benefit.)   Email spam is enough of a cost that many people don't use email or don't use it much -- preferring instead walled gardens of instant messaging.   If that were to happen more generally with Internet traffic, then the Internet would stop working (in the financial sense), which would inhibit infrastructure upgrades and maintenance. ",
