            "answer_text": "1600Mhz is DDR3-type speeds. DDR4 (with the lowest speed being 2133Mhz) is considered the norm these days. I\u2019d say that 1600Mhz is not where you\u2019d want to be in 2020. I would recommend shelling out extra money for a good 2x8 2400Mhz pack (something like Corsair\u2019s Vengeance LPX series sticks - they\u2019re relatively cheap, too). Also depends on your system. Ryzen CPUs favor higher speeds. You\u2019ll see a huge difference when operating at higher speeds. You also have the option of overclocking your RAM to even higher speeds in your mobo\u2019s BIOS using XMP profiles. ",

            "answer_text": "16 GB would be perfect for modern gaming in 2020, but your problem is the speed. That speed is below average when the average ram that's not overclocked is 2133 megahertz at the lowest. Go for a DDR4 motherboard and you\u2019ll be so much happier with how fast it is comparted to DDR3. ",
