            "answer_text": "This is a fascinating area of inquiry.  It's also pretty broad.  But I'll give you some observations as someone who was an IT professional for 15+ years: Information is not knowledge, but IT creates the illusion of knowledge because it makes so much data readily available for analysis.  The result is often that well-meaning folks - even academics and professionals - believe they \"know\" something when actually they haven't integrated all the information available into knowledge, but have just latched onto an informational veneer, a veneer that may currently have faddish traction or allure in their given field, but isn't well-considered.IT presents a limited VR dimension of experience and interaction; it does not equate the rich level of exchange that occurs in the real world.  But modern society has embraced this fa\u00e7ade as increasingly genuine, so that people believe they are really \"interacting\" online, really \"befriending\" or \"falling in love\" in virtual ways, really \"having a conversation\" on the Internet, etc. when of course they are only doing so in the most shallow and superficial ways.  Face-to-face human interaction has increasingly been perceived as less important, which has devastating long-term consequences for building and maintaining \"real\" relationships.Along similar lines, although on the one hand IT decreases the apparent distance between all sorts of interactions (producers and consumers, authors and readers, managers and employees, politicians and constituents, etc.) it also insulates and isolates us from the world around us.  IT makes it possible for a person to do their job from home, order all consumer goods from home, interact with relatives from home, pay their bills from home, etc.  And the resulting physical, psychological and emotional isolation undermines or distorts our development as human beings, our sense of political obligation and engagement, and our understanding of how we fit into the world - our sense of place and purpose.Since its inception, IT has promised the replacement of human labor as a cost-saving and increased efficiency measure. However, this has had spotty success, because the costs are transferred from a legacy employee base and skill set to IT professionals, expensive hardware, and expensive software. In terms of efficiency, institutional memory is often lost along with specialized expertise, and replaced with much more generic (though equally specialized) IT proficiency. Additionally, the training and retraining curve for end users sometimes inhibits efficiencies - and of course IT systems can also stop working or make errors, further interrupting workflow.  In the same way, many businesses and institutions believe that IT is a panacea, able to solve all of their most persisting problems...but IT creates as many problems as it solves.  However, the Pollyannaish conviction that IT is \"the answer\" has increasingly become quite irrational, prone to selective confirmation bias and high tolerance for cognitive dissonance, so that no matter how costly, problematic, inefficient, disruptive or crippling a given IT environment becomes, these businesses and institutions will keep investing more and more time, energy and money into it and continue blindly justifying their beliefs.IT expands cultural connections, but it does so in ways that dilute each culture, because each culture must interface with others according to established protocols that greatly confine or narrow cultural expression.  For instance, emails are expected to have a subject line that indicates content; tweets (initially) were 140 characters long; TED talks were limited to 12 minutes; English has been the dominant IT language and programming code relied on the Roman alphabet; QWERTY keyboards were the norm for many years...and so on.  In terms of organizing, storing, analyzing, compiling, generating, navigating, parsing, processing, propagating and communicating all sorts of information and media, IT is the most powerful force humanity has ever encountered outside of the human brain.  IT also democratizes all of these capabilities, so that more and more people have access to that power.  You might think that because six out of seven of the societal impacts I listed weren't necessarily positive, that I don't appreciate IT.  But I do.  I still love IT - because of #7.  Even though it isn't my profession anymore, I still follow new developments, play with new technologies, and engage in IT discussions like this one.  But I have come to understand that IT does certain things very well, and other things either poorly or terribly.  And until modern society comes to a similar realization about its strengths and limitations, IT will continue doing a lot more harm than good. My 2 cents.  ",

We\u2019re also not considering the morals and beliefs being BUILT into the IT infrastructure even as we automate many tasks, essentially systematically imposing those views.

Ask the people who died trying to enroll in the VA or never being scheduled for an appointment due to secret waiting lists. Another case is Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, Youtube. These companies are demonstrably biased far left. They\u2019ve trained AI on liberal data sources on everything from censoring content to comments. That is aside from fact checking against liberal sources entirely, so if a conservative group reports something liberals self-censor, it is flagged as \u201cunverified\u201d.

            "answer_text": "The answer depends on which society you\u2019re interested in. The answer to this question ecompasses a lot of information. For example, we might start small and define the social location of the particular society you want to know about. Once that\u2019s determined, then the economic situation of this particular group becomes relevant. Because where this group typically falls on the economic scale is important to answer how they may be influenced by Information Technology or how they may influence others in their group. Information Technology, According to Wikipedia Is the application of computers to store, study, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data. If we accept this definition of Information Technology, then we can start to study how Information Technology may be used to leverage power for this particular group and how that power may lead to marginalization of a different group of society, like racial, ethnic, or sexual groups. And conversely how that information can be used to marginalize the group we are studying. Consider that today many people find the amount of information available terrifying. My parents are still surprised when they see advertisements on the sites they visit and in their Facebook feeds after \"Just yesterday I was searching for X, and now X is in my Facebook Feed or on websites I visit.\u201d To understand a small part of how Information Technology impacts society, you first have to understand the Society. That my friend is a daunting task. ",

Other limitation is that we are not able express our feeling or what we are actually want to say by the use of e-mail or social networking sites. Thus we required face to face communication with them to express our real feeling. \uf0fb Social Disconnect: Although the internet has reduced physical distances between people, but that doesn\u2019t means they brought all closer together and emotional distance is increased in some aspects. People always busy with their own virtual world and passing a day. They forget the real world with family and friends and they becoming a formality. Children too are spending more time in virtual w orld and they adopt wrong thoughts thus rising cyber crimes and extra marital affairs with the use of ICT gadgets. \uf0fb Reduced physical activity/Health Problems: Users may accept a more sitting lifestyle by the use of ICT gadgets. This can lead to health problems such as headache, fatness, heart dise ase, diabetes, repetitive strain injury or eyestrain, wrong postur e/position, neck pain, physical and mental stress , etc because of continuous use.

            "answer_text": "Almost invariably, the technology that is considered in a developing country is an import. The technology was most likely designed and built in either North America or Western Europe. It would, as such, address the needs of those developed societies and not necessarily the needs of developing societies. The design and functioning of the ICT artefact, which is largely immutable, remains a challenge for the location for which it is imported and for which it has to be implemented. The first challenge is that of the imperative of change: people, processes, social conditions have to change to accept the priorities and methods of the technology. The technology may be modifiable, to a certain extent; however, for the most part the local implementers have to play \u201ccatch up\u201d. The imperative is often to \u201cleapfrog\u201d or to \u201cmodernise\u201d and accept, sometimes without questioning, the technology and the changes it is enforcing. The second challenge arises when implementers are conscious of the social impacts that the technology can have, and take a cautious approach. Local concerns, local conditions, the ability of populations to \u201cabsorb\u201d the change, and the acceptance of new phenomena are taken into consideration to implement the technology. The technology itself is carefully examined and selected to ensure that it is both suited to the local needs and is modifiable for such needs. The challenge in this approach is that power conflicts within the target population will cause some people to benefit from the changes, while others may be denied. Also, unintended consequences may cause certain negative effects (such as loss of privacy). ",
