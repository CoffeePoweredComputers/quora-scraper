            "answer_text": "That is a wonderful question. I am constantly telling entrepreneurs that their ideas or startups are not innovative, so in theory I should be able to answer. But to quote US Justice Potter Stewart:  I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description, and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the [...] involved in this case is not that. One complication is that, despite what you may have read from Thomas Friedman, the world is not flat, and (sorry for all the references) the future is very unevenly distributed. People are not omniscient, search engines can't read your mind, and the same product/technology can go by different names or descriptions. So you can be innovative even though you're developing something that is actually run-of-the-mill somewhere else. To further muddy the waters, a tech company may have a strategic incentive not to communicate exactly what its product does, so something innovative can masquerade as run-of-the-mill. Similarly, a non-technical entrepreneur may not be able to explain his company's innovations accurately, etc. So let's try to give a few examples.  In mid-2011 my company (ResolveA\u00cd) started developing a taxi booking app/website, we had never heard or read of such a thing, nor did anyone else to whom we pitched the idea here in Brazil. Uber had been launched less than a year before, and there were only a few other apps around, of which we only started hearing when we were already well into the PoC and started compiling benchmarks to pitch to investors. So I would definitely say that we innovated, although unwittingly. Maybe if we had done our homework better, we might have concluded that our idea was not innovative and pivoted. I would be doing gardening somewhere.Throughout the process, we met many other companies doing similar things to ours. The first batch were in the same situation: only found out there were other taxi apps around after they had a PoC or product out. I've had a few would-be taxi app entrepreneurs tell me they pivoted after finding out that ResolveA\u00cd had beat them to the market. They had innovated, maybe a bit less than us. Some of them are doing well in gardening or other jobs.There ensued a great era of copycats in the world taxi market, as it became a darling sector for VCs. Throughout 2012, more competitors than I can count entered the Brazilian markets. These did not innovate.In 2013, to escape the crowded market, we looked around for a related, blue-ocean business. We found one (managing high-flow taxi stops, such as airports and shopping malls) and built a product that solved that specific problem, thus successfully pivoting sideways. We definitely innovated, this time consciously.The main reason why I'm sure we've innovated is that, even though this product is highly profitable, no investor seems to understand it. A heuristic: if the VCs don't understand what you're doing, but you're making money from it, it means it is highly innovative. Most VCs only understand herd behavior, that is, something that has already been benchmarked to death, so they can safely follow. Another area with which everyone is familiar:  You take out your power tools and build a chair: not innovation.You build a chair with ultramodern nanomaterials, but it is functionally identical to regular chairs. No one would feel the urge to call it anything other than \"a chair\", or maybe \"a really expensive chair\": still not innovation.Thanks to those ultramodern nanomaterials, the chair is superlight, or you can fold it into a ball that fits into the palm of your hand, or it is ridiculously cheap to produce: innovation. Further, I would still count it as innovation if it turns out a similar product already exists, as long as you didn't copy it directly. The idea is still not in the collective Gestalt.Yet another area, maybe pushing it:  Believe it or not, only starting in 2000 was there in Brazil a law that enforced fiscal responsibility in all levels of government and that made elected officials accountable for overspending. While maybe a trivial concept elsewhere, the notion that a president or state governor could not just throw money around and leave the bill for his successor was, at the time, seen as a complex, mystifying concept around here.So maybe innovation really is in the eye of the beholder. Or maybe there is an objective component to it, but which can only be observed retrospectively, through a historiographical procedure. Hard to say, huh? ",

            "answer_text": "Not having an expert answer on crucial questions, like: 1. Is there or not human fecal dust* in hospital wards? 2. Is it or not a threat for patients, as causing HA Infection? (99.000 deaths /yr and 1.600.000 cases only in USA). 3. Is there a way to prevent its forming? *\u201cFECAL DUST: It comes from fecal residue, left AFTER wiping with t. paper (complete or, worse of course, incomplete) . Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air is going to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination. That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause, among others, of the known fatal HA INFECTIONS. The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a more than 2 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density, due to constant feeding from feces residue on patients, is a one more factor that increases microbe chances in developing antibiotic resistance. It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added. Up to now NOT A SINGLE scientific study have ever doubted fecal dust\u2019s existence and its role on microbe dispersion, but however no hygiene measures are imposed or advice is given by Health Institutes, particularly to women to prevent UTI, or any guiding to hospital hygiene managers to reduce HAI and the growing danger of microbe resistant to antibiotics. Why a comparison test is not made between a hospital, where all the special measures to prevent human fecal dust forming are taken and those, where no special care is taken, as the usual practice is, regarding the HA infection rates, so a safe scientific decision to be made about fecal dust\u2019s role on causing HA infection? On the case this test is not done promptly, everyone is entitled to think, that there are very strong reasons that other interests, than public health protection, are guiding science research.\u201d ",

Cupcake stores and coffee shops seem to come to mind.Find a business that seems to be keeping afloat, even though they are doing a terrible job. Bad customer service, a terrible web site, bad products, or whatever. Then do it better.Find a market that seems to be growing, and jump in. \"A rising tide lifts all boats\". In all these cases, what you see is a successful pre-existing market and business model, and some reasonable chance of success if you just do a good job. Why is \"innovation\" so closely tied to startups and investment funds? Because in all the cases above, what you see is low risk, and probably low growth expectations. VCs are all about high risk with high multiples of return, which is hard to find without some kind of innovation that is creating the great opportunity. ",
