            "answer_text": "For a regular microelectronics thing I'd say pick up an Arduino with a WiFi shield, but absent any knowledge of electronics I'd say a Raspberry Pi is a better bet.  There's also Intel\u00ae Edison.  The Pi and the Edison are better for n00bs because they're capable of running code in Python and Ruby, which are considered much easier languages to learn than C++.  Technically Arduino can run Python, but the processor has a lot less memory and Python is interpreted rather than compiled, so the interpreter takes up a bunch of space that could be used for more code.

You can view some architecture paper from website such as Bosch Bosch Media Service which contains automative to industrial iot. Hope to help you ",
