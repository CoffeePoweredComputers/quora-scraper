            "answer_text": "In ancient Egypt pyramids were built for what purpose? Tombs and in some cases cenotaphs. The pyramid era lasted from circa BCE 2680 to 1550. The pyramid built was Djoser and the last is thought to have been one for Pharaoh Ahmose. Later Pharaoh were placed into underground tombs as per those found at Tanis and the Valley of the Kings. Psusennes I, Amenemope and Shoshenq II (The Pharaohs found in the Royal tombs of Tanis. There are many un-evidenced fringe and alternative beliefs in what the pyramids were (mainly focused exclusively on the Great Pyramid), yet what evidence we have places them in the time of the ancient Egyptians and in context with their culture and religion. Ideas that they were built much earlier flounder due to a lack of meaningful evidence to support this contention and a complete lack of evidence for an \u2018invisible civilization\u2019 to have built them. This is usually stated to be Atlanteans, Aliens, other \u2018advanced humans cultures\u2019, etc., etc. ",

            "answer_text": "According to the late Idries Shah, the pyramids of Egypt served as storehouses of \"baraka\" (more or less like \"grace\" in Christian terminology.) Of course they were also tombs for the Pharaohs. Maybe they liked having a grace-full tomb on their way to the afterlife. However, these batteries \"now have discharged,\" so a divine blessing may not be included in the tour price.Cited in \"Sufi Thought and Action\", p. 84, https://idriesshahfoundation.org/storage/product_pdf/6._Sufi_Thought_UK.pdf Similarly, in the Islamic world, tombs of saints are still believed by the devout to confer baraka on deserving visitors.
