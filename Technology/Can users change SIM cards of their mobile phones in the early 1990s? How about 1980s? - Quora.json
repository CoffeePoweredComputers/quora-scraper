            "answer_text": "Early cell phones didn\u2019t have SIM cards. The first generation phones had permanently programmed ID numbers that were not encrypted in any way. Some enterprising folks discovered that it was possible to eavesdrop on the cellular traffic, pick up the subscriber numbers, and then clone those into another phone to start making free calls fraudulently charged to someone else\u2019s account. This led to the usage of encrypted digital authentication within the networks, and the use of SIM cards as a means of disconnecting the subscriber identity from the physical phone while still providing a secure authentication mechanism. While the first SIMs were evidently made for a Finnish carrier in 1991, it took some time for the spread of GSM networks to take place that has resulted in the worldwide ubiquity of their use. ",
