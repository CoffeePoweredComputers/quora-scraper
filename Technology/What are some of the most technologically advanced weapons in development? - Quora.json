            "answer_text": "The most ambitious weapon development (that is public knowledge) is done by DARPA, I would say. DARPA stands for Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. They have done a wide variety of cutting edge programs and are working on an extraordinarily large variety of programs. Here's just a list of recent things DARPA has announced they are working on, have requested proposals from companies about, etc:  Much faster and more advanced aircraft that are able to take off and land vertically (VTOL).    Very advanced robotic land systems. Two good examples are Big Dog and Cheetah. Big Dog is an extremely advanced supply carrying robot which can respond to voice commands, be led easily by a soldier, and can navigate any terrain. Here's a video demonstrating some of its capabilities:  Cheetah is a demonstrator type robot which is capable of running almost 30 miles per hour.      DARPA is also trying to make some very interesting medications and treatment techniques for nuclear radiation victims. (More info: Darpa Wants to Help You Survive a Nuclear Disaster | Danger Room | Wired.com) One of the very crucial projects DARPA is making progress in is advanced unmanned systems for tracking deadly, silent diesel submarines. There's a whole plethora of systems involved in this effort, but one of them is ACTUV. ACTUV stands for Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vehicle. The idea is to have many of these craft stalking submarines of rogue nations in case they try to attack carrier groups.     One last thing I'll mention they're working on is more affordable satellite launches and satellite cannibalization. Yep, they're working on ways to harvest working parts from out of commission or fried satellites to be reused.",

            "answer_text": "Non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NNEMP) is an electromagnetic pulse generated without use of nuclear weapons. Devices that can achieve this objective include a large low-inductance capacitor bank discharged into a single-loop antenna, a microwave generator and an explosively pumped flux compression generator. To achieve the frequency characteristics of the pulse needed for optimal coupling into the target, wave-shaping circuits and/or microwave generators are added between the pulse source and the antenna. Vircators are vacuum tubes that are particularly suitable for microwave conversion of high-energy pulses.[1] NNEMP generators can be carried as a payload of bombs, cruise missiles (such as the CHAMP missile) and drones, with diminished mechanical, thermal and ionizing radiation effects, but without the political consequences of deploying nuclear weapons. The range of NNEMP weapons (non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse bombs) is much less than nuclear EMP. Nearly all NNEMP devices used as weapons require chemical explosives as their initial energy source, producing only 10\u22126 (one millionth) the energy of nuclear explosives of similar weight.[2] The electromagnetic pulse from NNEMP weapons must come from within the weapon, while nuclear weapons generate EMP as a secondary effect.[3] These facts limit the range of NNEMP weapons, but allow finer target discrimination. The effect of small e-bombs has proven to be sufficient for certain terrorist or military operations. Examples of such operations include the destruction of electronic control systems critical to the operation of many ground vehicles and aircraft.[4] The concept of the explosively pumped flux compression generator for generating a non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse was conceived as early as 1951 by Andrei Sakharov in the Soviet Union,[5] but nations keep work on non-nuclear EMP classified until similar ideas emerge in other nations. Large EMP simulators were built in the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Italy.[6][7] The purpose of these large EMP simulators was to test equipment and vehicles (including ships and aircraft) for their resistance to high-altitude nuclear EMP. Information about the EMP simulators used by the United States during the latter part of the Cold War, along with more general information about electromagnetic pulse, is now in papers under the care of the SUMMA Foundation,[8] which is hosted at the University of New Mexico. The SUMMA Foundation web site documents the huge wooden ATLAS-I simulator (better known as TRESTLE, or \"The Sandia Trestle\") at Sandia National Labs, New Mexico, which was the world's largest EMP simulator.[9]  Nearly all of these large EMP simulators used a specialized version of a Marx generator.[6][7] The SUMMA Foundation offers a short documentary on its web site called TRESTLE: Landmark of the Cold War.[10] The US Navy also has a facility called the Electro Magnetic Pulse Radiation Environmental Simulator for Ships I (EMPRESS I). #Source Wikipedia ",
