            "answer_text": " Image source : http://androidleo.com This is a smartphone concept launched by Samsung recently. Probably leaks. It will have no notches, no punch holes, no slider, no pop-ups, no buttons, no keys. Full display and everything will be controlled by touch and gestures. Camera will be under display camera. So no need for camera outside on the phone. In fact, leaks of Samsung Galaxy S11 also shows under display camera. So just sit back and wait for the technological advancements much beyond our imagination. ",
