            "answer_text": "It\u2019s another term for what is rightly termed information systems. Information systems consists of five key components, which are: HardwareSoftwareDataProceduresPeopleThe top three represent information technology, while the bottom three represent business. All five together represent information systems. How can there be a top three and a bottom three when there are a total of five? The data component is shared by both IT and IS, because if you think about it, information technology produces and consumes data, and so does business. You might say that data is the binding glue of technology and business. Hardware and software are symbiotic, that is to say that without software, hardware doesn\u2019t do much of anything. Without hardware, software only exists as a construct in someone\u2019s mind\u2014an idea. Data is the raw facts, figures, text, and measurements of a business. It is meaningless without a mechanism with which to derive meaning and knowledge from it (a database, for example). A procedure is how an information system is used, designed, and implemented. It can be as simple as logging on to Facebook, or as complicated as a complex system design. People are the most important part of an information system, for obvious reasons. ",
