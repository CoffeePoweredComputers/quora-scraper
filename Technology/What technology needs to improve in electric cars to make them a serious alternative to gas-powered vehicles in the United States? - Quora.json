            "answer_text": "They already are a serious alternative to gas-powered vehicles. All of the big automakers spurred on by competition from Tesla, have announced programs to introduce new electric vehicles in the next few years. The biggest thing that is slowing this trend is the quality, cost, and availability of electric propulsion batteries. These battery problems are short term and will disappear. Charging infrastructure is being built out rapidly. Cheaper, safer, faster charging, higher energy density, \u201cmillion-mile\u201d batteries are due to be introduced. The trend line indicates that battery cost is heading down toward the $100/kwh point where the cost of EVs will be on a parity with ICE (internal combustion engine) cars. After battery costs sink lower than $100/kwh, the purchase price of EVs will be lower than ICE. This will be the coup de gr\u00e2ce that relegates ICE vehicles to the history museum alongside horses. There are also business and cultural forces slowing down the adoption of electric vehicles. The business models of the petroleum industry, auto industry, auto dealerships, and service stations will be upended. Even the advertising industry will be impacted since Tesla has shown that you can successfully sell cars without paid advertising. ",

Their range is now almost as good as gas cars and their performance, at least in terms of acceleration, is BETTER than even most high powered \u201cfast\" gasoline powered cars, in many cases even muscle cars will loose in an acceleration contest. Many Tesla models fit this description. As time goes on, the main technology needed is more energy dense and lighter batteries. Electric cars on average weigh more than gasoline powered cars of the same size category. Ranges now are around 300 miles before a charge is needed. Ranges will eventually reach 500 miles, still depending on how fast and hard you drive, but that also applies to a gasoline car. ",

            "answer_text": "Charge time. Suppose I want to drive for 1000 miles to visit family. If I take a Prius, I can fill it up before leaving, drive at 75 MPH, fill it in 3 minutes at mile 400, drive at 75 MPH, fill it again in 3 minutes at mile 800, drive at 75 MPH, and arrive at mile 1000 on that tank. 13 hours and 26 minutes total. Contrast that with an all-electric vehicle. Charge the vehicle before leaving, drive at 75 MPH for 300 miles to a supercharger. Charge for 1.33 hours, drive 300 miles at 75 MPH to a supercharger. Charge for 1.33 hours, drive 300 miles at 75 MPH to a supercharger. Drive 100 miles at 75 MPH. 16 hours total time. The situation gets worse when dragging a trailer, since trailers can cut mileage by a substantial margin. For EVs, trailers are a nightmare because of battery/motor overheating and charging requirements. Consider using the new Cybertruck to trailer a boat of roughly the same mass. The Cybertruck range gets cut by 50%, meaning the number of charges doubles. Good luck getting to that vacation destination on time. ",

            "answer_text": "They are already serious contenders in several niches and the clear winner in others, like short range urban commuting. It may be impractical to build an EV for *all* niches, but you can definitely win most of them. The main problems right now are three: Price. Sure, EVs are cheaper in the long run but you still have to come up with payment up front. This scares a lot of people from trying the technology. As time goes by and used EVs enter the market, they may make the investment easier to afford.Charging infrastructure. The best place to charge is in your own garage. But many people live in apartments without assigned parking. And even if they have parking, they may not have access to an outlet. Easiest first step is to include a 110V outlet in every assigned space. Or you could go 220V. After that, it gets tricky because now you need convenient and accessible public chargers. One possible solution is parking garages with wireless charging. When self driving cars become a reality, your EV could drop you off at your apartment before driving itself across town to a parking garage to charge.Lack of variety. It\u2019s hard to fill multiple niches with one vehicle so more variety is needed. In particular, there is a huge empty gap where a pickup truck should be. That will be rectified later with the Cybertruck as well as Rivians offerings.",

So for me to buy an EV I want the option to choose from 30 different models in lots of different price ranges. Not just 4 or 5. So the technology is already here. Now more manufacturers need to implement it. ",

Given the pace of research and the economies of scale, the price for a kilowatt hour in Lithium Ion battery packs has dropped 87% since 2010.

The main remaining difference then will be the $2,000 savings annually in energy and maintenance costs that the average EV owner will realize. Over a 5-year period, an EV purchased in 2021 will be extremely competitive with gasoline, and at the end of that period its resale value will also be a few thousand dollars higher. ",
