            "answer_text": "I guess computer mouse will not be replaced as long as computer looks like the way it interacts with human today. It is kind of mouthful but let me give you an example. Computer mouse exists because human needs a mounting point exists in the virtual world. Some alternative techniques to control that mounting point are touchable digitizers, small red point on thinkpad keyboard. Also when we are playing games like war3 and starcraft, which need lots of input from human, we need computer mouse to do that as well. Computer mouse may step off the stage in the world of vertical reality. In VR, the human computer interaction is kind of new, it gets signals from sensor, which keep tracking of the motion of user. A computer mouse may not be sufficient to catch all those movement. So, time will tell. ",

But the TV has been in the process of being replaced for more than a dozen years, and it is still around.  Don't expect mice to scramble away soon. ",
