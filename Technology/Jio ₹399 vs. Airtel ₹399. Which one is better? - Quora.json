            "answer_text": "I believe the Airtel 448 plan competes with Jio 399 since Airtel 399 is limited to 35 days unless given as promotion to some customers for 70 days occasionally. I prefer the Jio 399 as of now till next recharge where the competition will be more intense as Idea will jump into this game too. As per the plan, an Airtel subscriber can make unlimited local and STD calls with a capping of 250 minutes per day and/or 1,000 minutes per week. For instance, when a customer ends up using 200 minutes daily, the free talk time will get over after five days, however, on each day, if he exhausts the entire 250 minutes quota then the available limit will last for four days. And following this, he will have to wait for the next week for the free 1,000 minutes talktime quota. Once the talk time limit gets exhausted, the calls will be charged at the rate of 30 paise per minute, confirmed an Airtel customer care executive. Reliance Jio is limiting the number of minutes in voice calls to 300 minutes per day, according to some reports. Jio says the reason for this limit is to avoid potential misuse. This 300 minutes per day has been part of the Jio terms and conditions for some time now. Users would have noticed that Reliance Jio recharge vouchers come with the promise of unlimited voice calls be it local or STD. However, the limit stands at 300 minutes per day for voice calls but only in case of misuse. Best of Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Jio 399- The prepaid plan from Jio at Rs. 399 gives you 1GB/day for 70 days with unlimited calling (Local+STD+Roaming) and additional Free subscription to JioApps. One plus point of this plan is that if you exhaust you daily limit of 1GB/day, you will not be charged and you will be provided data at 64mpbs. And calls are free on Jio truly. Airtel 399 - This prepaid plan offers 1GB/day of 3G/4G speed for 70 days and Unlimited calling (There is a catch). The free calling comes with a limit. 250 mins/day and 1000 mins a week. Also, after you exhaust you daily limit, Airtel will charge you 10p/KB which is somewhere around Rs. 4,000/GB (Ridiculous I know) Also, Airtel gives its exisitng 4G - Wikipedia additional 1GB/28days and Non 4G will get 250MB data/28 days Conclusion - No way a person of a sane mind will choose Airtel beacuse let\u2019s be a little practical, 1GB/day is also not enough for some of us and there is no reason you should pay extra when Jio is providing internet at 64mbps after surpassing your daily limit. I\u2019d choose Jio over Airtel, Any day, hands down! Hope this clears out your doubt and you can check Jio\u2019s other plans at Prepaid & Postpaid 4G Data Plans to know more ",
