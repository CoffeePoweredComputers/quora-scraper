            "answer_text": "Depends on how good is defined. Hardware - Yes and no. In general, Chromebooks require lower specs since Chrome OS is light. Having said that, there are high end units with decent specs.Performance - Chromebooks are likely to meet the computing needs of most users i.e. email, productivity (word processer, spreadsheet, presentation), personal information management (contact, calendar, notes), media (music, videos, photos), install Google Play apps etc. In this context, Chromebooks are probably better, since no need to install software. Contrast this with regular laptops which will require software installation. To be fair, if ones favourite applications are available online or on Google Play, then Chromebooks will work well. Otherwise Windoze will be better.Security - Since files are stored on the cloud, Chromebooks are more secure. In the event of device loss/ damage, files can still be accessed via another Chromebook, PC or Android. Files are less vulnerable to malware, virus when compared with Windoze. Chromebooks do not require installation of anti virus and firewall. Winner Chromebooks.Maintenance - Chrome OS updates are painless. Windoze updates can be painful and time consuming. Winner Chromebooks.Collaboration - Work easily with others using Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides etc at the same time. Changes go live instantly. No need to install software and worry about compatibility since files are accessed via a web browser. No more emailing files or wondering who has the latest version. Winner Chromebooks.Unlimited storage - Yes, you read this correctly. With good housekeeping, it is possible to enjoy unlimited storage with Google. See this for tips J Cheng's answer to How can I get free Google Drive storage above the first free 15 GB?In summary, Chromebooks are likely to be just as good if not better than regular laptops and likely to meet the computing needs of most users. Enjoy hassle free computing with unlimited storage as a big bonus! Thank you Google :-) ",

            "answer_text": "The main difference between a Chromebook and other Laptops is the Operating System on which they perform. Chromebook comes with the Chrome OS installed while other laptops might come with Windows, Linux, DOS or Mac OS. Chromebooks work best when connected to the internet though they also run offline but a regular laptop's performance has nothing to do with internet connectivity. Also, the applications that can be run differ on both. While Windows allow you the flexibility to use a wide range of application softwares, Chrome OS only allows installation of those that are on Play store or Chrome Web store but the basic applications required by a typical user are covered. So, if you just want to use the laptop within the boundaries of Chrome OS then it can be an option. But, Windows gives you flexibility with the applications having a wider community of users. In my personal opinion, chromebooks are not as good as the Standard laptops at present. They might be in future but that's a completely different scenario. ",
