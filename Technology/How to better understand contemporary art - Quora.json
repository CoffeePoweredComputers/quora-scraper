            "answer_text": "It's most important to understand that \"Art\" doesn't exist. What you respond to and what I respond to, both positively and negatively, are likely to be so entirely different that it's ridiculous to even try to lump them together meaningfully. \"Art\" is the use of just about anything, in any way to create some kind of emotional reaction in the viewer/participant. Because everything is on a standard curve of deviation, that means 90% of \"Art\" will be crap, i.e., uninteresting to you, and magically only a very little bit of what you see is going to really resonate with you. The way to \"get\" art is to see and experience as much as possible, so you have a better chance to be exposed to something in your 10% range. Don't bother trying to \"get\" any kind of art, contemporary or classic. Either you like it, or you don't. If something vaguely interests you, ask the docent or guard about it. They often have great background stories to hand. Ask the people around you about their reactions. After you see something you like, do some research. Once you like a thing, you've \"gotten\" it as much as there is to get. Let me tell you a story about a piece of art I own. It's an original work by an immensely talented friend. Her work tends to be in boxes, so naturally everyone lumps her with Cornell, but her work is genuinely contemporary. She made a frame, covered it in gold paper, put a spoon in the frame, also covered in gold, and a big red plastic gem in the middle of the spoon. The frame is decorated with stuff. Then another friend of mine (also ridiculously talented, this time as a writer) wrote a poem about it.  These two items, should you see them  would probably do nothing for you. They left me gasping for air. I wanted to buy the spoon, but I couldn't afford it, so my two friends gave me both as a present one year. I am still captivated by spoon and poem - every single day, when I walk into the house and see them. Here is the box:    Here is the opening of the poem: IT'S MOTHER'S DAY IN MERYL'S BOX Do you remember when you were a childAnd you were sickReally, really sic(well, actually you weren'tthat sick at allIt was probably just a cold or somethingBut it was the first time youwere ever sickSo you probably thought youwere dying,Or already dead(in your little-kid head) Box by Meryl Gross (http://www.invisiblebooks.com/MGshow.htm), Poem by Ed Chapman (he's online, but not with a specific site for his work to point you to. Also, Quora removed the color of the text of the poem, which adds another layer.) You might look at the thing and think, \"It's a spoon, with a big hunk of plastic in it.\"  To me, it's an incredible, mind-bogglingly awesome piece of Art. Look around - you'll see Art everywhere. And the more you see, the more likely you'll \"get\" something someday. ",

            "answer_text": "When people dismiss contemporary art as \u2018pretentious rubbish\u2019, the chances are they don\u2019t understand what contemporary art is able to do, and are instead approaching it with mistaken ideas, and the wrong criteria. It is like judging music by the clothes a musician wears, or assessing intellectual intelligence by a person\u2019s height: it\u2019s a form of very basic \u2018categorical error\u2019, and betrays an elemental misunderstanding. Contemporary art is not about classical aesthetics and museum standards of beauty and crafterly skill. Contemporary art is basically a form of narrative theatre, using artworks as props in a very mysterious and allusive form of \u2018storytelling\u2019, inviting you into difficult and different mindsets, using languages and forms of communication which are not always easily apparent, and which have nothing whatsoever to do with classical crafting and skilled academic technique. It requires the ability to be able to achieve various types of \u2018psychological congruence\u2019, in other words, to be able to join artists in their artistic mentalities and perspectives. This is not as difficult as it may sound \u2013 we lock onto other people\u2019s perspectives and mentalities all the time in ordinary everyday life. Illustrative example: the life and work of Joseph Beuys. Beuys was an oddball who, after WW2, made up a bizarre story about himself and who he was, and then spent the rest of his life acting out a weird mixture of sense, nonsense and impenetrable mystification. His art objects and installations make no sense whatsoever as classical museum pieces, but they make perfect sense as part of the \u2018Beuys artistic story.\u2019 And what is that story ? It\u2019s to do with German strangeness, and alienation, and intellection gone wrong, combined with the sinister possibilities of central European objects and symbols. It\u2019s all of those things, and more. It\u2019s impossible to reduce Beuys\u2019s artistry to an easily graspable meaning, any more than you could do the same with David Lynch\u2019s \u2018Mulholland Drive\u2019. And you don\u2019t get the Beuys story by decoding Beuys\u2019s artworks like a crossword, with a one-to-one correspondence between object and meaning, you get it by locking onto the totality of their weirdness, and their impenetrability, and their otherness. Beuys was effectively putting on an open-ended play, or a living film, involving a lifetime of performances and installations and confusing utterances. The real art of Beuys is not his individual art objects, it\u2019s the Beuys theatrical narrative. This doesn\u2019t mean that every piece of junk put forward in the name of art needs to be taken seriously. Genuine artistry of the sort presented by Beuys and Warhol and Jeff Koons (and a mere handful of others) is extremely difficult to achieve, and most contemporary \u2018artists\u2019 \u2013 even the rich and famous \u2013 are failures at what they\u2019re trying to do, but we can\u2019t condemn them for that. They\u2019re trying their best, and \u2018having a go\u2019 at a very demanding calling. Tracey Emin would love to be Marina Abramovi\u0107, but she can\u2019t manage it; Damien Hirst would love to be Jeff Koons, but he doesn\u2019t have the special talent required to orchestrate that kind of otherness. Koons does it spontaneously and effortlessly; Hirst is desperately underpowered and uncharismatic as an artistic \u2018character\u2019. For those interested, I\u2019ve written a book on the subject of how best to understand contemporary art. The true meaning of contemporary art is not something you can easily make a case for in few paragraphs, especially if you\u2019re having to try to overcome the widespread idea of art as \u2018classical crafting of the sort found in museums\u2019. The book is written in simple, jargon-free non-technical language, and is available from the various Amazon sites: Understanding Modern Art: Exploring the Strange and the Disturbing: Zaaiman, Jakob: 9798666230626: Amazon.com: Books ",
