            "answer_text": "I learned to play guitar on my own in the pre-internet days. I had fun doing so, and didn\u2019t find it too difficult. I already knew some music theory from playing piano and clarinet and could read music, which made things easier, because I was just learning how to play guitar, not how to play music. I actually don\u2019t recommend learning a bunch of chords and strumming along to songs. The people I know who learned this way don\u2019t actually learn to play the guitar parts of songs, they learn to strum along to songs, and strumming the chords that go with Johnny B. Goode is not the same thing as playing Johnny B. Goode. You are better off learning how chords are constructed than just simply memorizing one or two shapes for a particular chord. Learn to read tablature (it\u2019s easy) and find tablature of songs you like that have simple rhythms, are relatively slow, and don\u2019t have a lot of notes. If you know the song, your ear will serve as a guide on how well you are doing. I bought guitar magazines that had song transcriptions in them of songs I knew and liked. Now, you can find tablature all over the internet in various forms. Play with a pick, and play without one, using fingerstyle techniques. I played a lot of fingerstyle when I started, which meant I couldn\u2019t just strum chords, and had to be careful about properly fretting each individual note. When strumming, people can get sloppy because it\u2019s easy to hide an improperly fretted string in amongst the sound of the others. Finally, get a guitar with lower action. That\u2019s the distance between the strings and the fretboard. It\u2019s hard to learn to play on guitars with high action because you have to push a lot harder on the strings to fret them. This will hurt your fingertips and make it difficult to get a clean sound when starting. Action can be adjusted, so if yours is high, take it to a guitar tech to see what they can do to lower it. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a self taught guitarist. I believe that I am just a bit above the beginner level. I can play most of the chords (sometimes I have to look into chords diagram of course). Nowadays, I have started playing solo too. Well learning guitar without a teacher can be frustrating. However, if someone shows you how to play the major chords or rather how to position your fingers in a fretboard, things can be interesting. Long time ago, a friend taught me the basic major chords like G, C,D,E,A etc in open position. When you can play the chords without muting any string, you can be sure that you are on the right track. Of course one needs a lot of practice. When you feel that you can play these major chords well, you can start strumming your favourite songs. It will be much easier if you know the melody of the song. Try songs like 'Take it easy' by eagles. The ability to play a few songs will make the learning process interesting. You may not be able to play the songs flawlessly but that's ok. Gradually try the barre chords. You will need them in the future. Meanwhile go through some basic music theory related to guitar. You will come to know about notes and scales. It is not necessary to know the music notations for a guitar initially. Rather you need to improve your playing ability. Learn the scales. Start with C major scale. Try the different shapes. It will be fun if you believe me. I did the same. Now, I can play major scales. Practicing them increase your playing speed and you become familiar with the fret board. Nowadays I play some chords in progression and put them in the looper of my zoom processor. Then, alongwith those chords, I play the notes of a particular shape of a scale. It become a melodic piece !! Things have become quite interesting for me now and learning has become much easier. Hope this helps. ",
