            "answer_text": "If you consider only the ARM CPUs, the most powerful architecture is known by developers to be from Samsung. See at this benchmark results (quite poor, I'll try to get more devices with a comprehensive & reliable benchmark utility) :  http://www.glbenchmark.com/result.jsp?orderby=dvsg_best&brand=all&benchmark=glpro11&version=all&screen-group-value=0 Except the new entries from Marvell, (interesting thing btw, Marvell is coming back!) there is a lot of Samsung & Apple devices in the top ten. the Apple products have Samsung CPUs or Apple CPUs based on Samsung architecture. Considering the Samsung Galaxy S, in the first rank: is it the fastest smartphone? Well, the problem is that Android is quite slow and it is not a troll. It's a bit laggy, sorry to have to say that, and I use a Galaxy S everyday. So I think that the Samsung Wave is fastest because it has the same CPU and a very light OS. Unfortunately, with no *real* multi-task. And the iPhone 4 is very close to be as fast as the Galaxy S & the Wave. So, in my top 3 I put : Samsung Wave (bada OS), iPhone 4 (iOS) and Samsung Galaxy S (Android 2.2). We definitively have to bench some recent Nokia devices but I know they have slower CPUs (less MHz). I personally consider Texas Instruments as a good competitor & Qualcomm as an over-hyped semi-conductor supplier. ",
