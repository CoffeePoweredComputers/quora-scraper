Flying is VERY expensive. Most airports charge at least $100 for a landing fee. Unless you are just stopping for fuel. Licensing is also thousands of dollars. The days of \u201cBarnstorming\u201d were [\u2018back in the early 1900\u2019s. Any airplane must be licensed, and maintained with very strict regulations. It isn\u2019t like buying a car that you can get away with only putting \u201cThe key, gas, and \u2018Yo A$$\u2019 into\u201d. Just like \u201cPicking Cotton\u201d, manual labor is now very rare. Even hamburgers are cooked on a machine. The operator just places the patties on the cloth belt, and they drop into a container at the other end. Remember when the gas station attendant filled your tank, washed the windows, and checked your tires and fluids? I doubt it. I used to deliver newspapers to every house in the neighborhood. I haven\u2019t seen a newspaper in over 20 years. Let alone one being delivered. Yet today\u2019s high school graduates can\u2019t write their name, or do simple two number addition. Like How much is five plus zero? That was a girl that was a \u201cCollege Student\u201d working at Walmart as a cashier! How\u2019d she get into college? ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, we DO have robots everywhere. Just about every manufacturing facility is \u201coverrun\u201d by robots. Most things that use to be done by manual, human labor is not accomplished by robots. They are just not in the form you may be envisioning. A humanoid robot is very inefficient, hard to balance, and very limited in what tasks it can accomplish. Therefore, most robots these days are very specialized and designed for the specific tasks they are to accomplish. Everything from forging, forming, and cutting metal, to molding and assembly is done by specialized robots. There are already several answers as to why there are very few flying cars. The truth is that it takes a lot of energy to lift several thousand pounds up to any height and a little more to propel it in some direction, let alone stopping it in mid-air, where you need more thrust (energy) to stop it. The main thing that is stopping you (or making it very difficult) is the laws of physics, more specifically those pertaining to gravity and inertia. If you could ever figure out some way to defeat (or lessen) the force of gravity locally, your problem would be solved. BUT, people have been trying to do that since time began with little success other than throwing tremendous amounts of energy at the problem. ",
