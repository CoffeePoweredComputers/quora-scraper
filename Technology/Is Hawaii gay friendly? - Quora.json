            "answer_text": "Overall Hawaii people are very accepting. With almost 10 million new faces visiting the islands every year, it\u2019s hard to worry about such things as gay relationships. Also, in the local culture, there has been a long history of fluid sexual identification as per the term Mahu. As a LGBTQ visitor, if you come to Honolulu and Waikiki you can expect to be quite welcome everywhere. Waikiki in particular would be a very comfortable place, although local families may be joining you on a crowded beach and with a predominately Asian culture, I would advise against overt expression of sexuality. There was some push-back many years ago when the same-sex marriage debate raged on, and perhaps parents did not want to have to explain to a six year old why those boys are kissing. Neighbor islands may be a little tougher but I really don\u2019t know enough to say. So if you lay low, enjoy all the sights and sounds, and be civil in public, I can assure you will be treated well and respected. You may want to join the legions who marry here too. The scenery is gorgeous regardless of which side of the plate you swing from. I\u2019ve had a few gay real estate clients over the years and they have been among the nicest people I\u2019ve worked with.  Plus there is a great gay bar in Waikiki. See pic. My photo. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, particularly the area around Kapahulu and Kal\u0101kaua. Across the street from Kapi\u2019olani Park, the beach across the street is considered the gay beach. It\u2019s where the annual gay picnic is held. is located. Hula\u2019s is around the corner and across the street from the Honolulu Zoo, next to the Queen Kapiolani Hotel, on Kapahulu. Hula\u2019s is probably the oldest gay bar in Honolulu. Check out its website Hula's Bar & Lei Stand | Gay Bar, Beach View Dining, Dance Party.. I love this bar and go whenever possible. They\u2019ve got great drinks, good food, and a separate room for dancing. Hula\u2019s is the bar in the photo someone else posted. They also have catamaran cruises, FYI. Hawai\u2019i is gay-friendly, particularly on Oahu. Never had any problems with being openly lesbian in Hawai\u2019i even when my partner and I went there in the early 90s. I\u2019ve lived on Maui, in Hilo, on Kauai, and Oahu openly, with no problems. ",
