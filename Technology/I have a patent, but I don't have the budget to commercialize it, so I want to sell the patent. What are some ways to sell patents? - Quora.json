            "answer_text": "Here are some difficult truths\u2026 You don\u2019t sell patents. You license them. Find a company that makes something similar and offer it to them. You will likely be disappointed at their offer\u2026 I suggest that you take it anyway. Just because you have a patent doesn\u2019t mean it is commercially viable. If you don\u2019t have the budget to bring the patent to life then you probably don\u2019t have the budget to defend it in court and the patent means very little. The government will not do it for you. ",
