            "answer_text": "For the most part, you seem to have two broad options: 1) use your quotes on nice images to draw viewers to your website to get ad revenue or try to up-sell them on something else you sell, or 2) use your quotes on a physical product that you can sell through Etsy or the Kindle store or somewhere similar. A few ideas for physical products: Make your own greeting cards.Categorize the quotes into small ebooks and sell lots of them for not much money each.Make a nice coffee table book with photos or paintings or something similar so you can sell a few books at a higher price.Make special occasion books, like quotes for Mother\u2019s Day or recent graduates or someone starting their own business or get well soon.Put your quote collection in a journal with space for the buyers to write around them.Make special occasion journals for new moms or people dealing with long-term illnesses or newlyweds or others who need encouragement and space to reflect.Combine your quote collection with another skill you have (or hire someone with that skill). Burn them into wood hangings, etch them on glass ornaments, cross-stitch them into samplers, make stamps, etc.Sell stickers with the quotes on them, aiming for scrapbookers or bullet journalers.Add the quotes to t-shirts or tote bags. Plenty of companies let you upload your text, and they make it look nice.Go for high-end stationary. Wedding invitations, graduation announcements, baby announcements, notepads with a quote at the top, notebooks with quotes on the cover.",

            "answer_text": "Work as an account manager for a successful technology company. Then prepare very expensive price quotes for your biggest customers. Oh, you meant beloved literary quotes? Most of these quotes reside in the public domain and cannot be easily commercialized. You can copyright your pithiest quotes and assemble a small book of aphorisms. If you are lucky enough to find a publisher, and even luckier to sell some of those books (gee maybe as many as 5,000 copies) you might earn as much a a fifty cent royalty off of each pithy book. Or you could become infamous (like Donald Trump) and hurl insults at the rest of the world. Your outlandish insults would be re-quoted and allow you to raise the prices at your garish resorts. ",
