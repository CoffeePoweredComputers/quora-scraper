            "answer_text": "Do we really waste huge amounts of money on exoplanet exploration? What little money is spent, isn\u2019t it worth it to discover if there is another Earth somewhere? Quoting Carl Sagan: Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge. We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology. Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere. For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. I think that Sagan would agree no one can know what\u2019s possible or impossible. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball it, but consider technology 1,000 years ago, and look at the development of practically everything since, you realize that we don\u2019t really know if anything is possible or impossible. In the year 1020, even the most enlightened person could not predict, guns, central heat and air, planes, trains, automobiles, computers and cell phones. You might be burned at the stake for witch craft. The printing press is still 500 or so years away in 1020. Our current understanding of physics \u2014 astrophysics \u2014 chemistry \u2014 math and various other subjects may still be on the level of someone in year 1020 when viewed through the lens of someone looking back in 3020. Practically all technology around you today would have been viewed as being impossible 1000 years ago, you can\u2019t then say, that warp space drives or some other technology we can\u2019t even conceive today won\u2019t solve the problems. We don\u2019t know the questions to ask, let alone the answers. Consider a few years ago, very smart people \u2014 who in part are looking at the stars and wonder what\u2019s around them, now think that a vast part of the known universe is made up of \u201cdark matter.\u201d Something we don\u2019t know anything about other than it explains what we see up, an area that begins about 25 miles above you and reaches 13 billion light years. You can\u2019t know maybe exotic particles and dark matter can be manipulated to fold vast regions of space and act as a work around for the theory of relativity. Seems impossible today. 1000 years ago, the Sun orbited the Earth, it was preposterous to think otherwise. Perhaps just as preposterous as warp drives. Consider that the known universe exists at an epicly large scale on the one hand and similarly epic tiny scale on the other. We don\u2019t know what makes up the space between star systems or galaxies, and we don\u2019t know what makes up the space between the atoms that form your hand. The band width of our present knowledge is minuscule. We have at most a basic understanding of quantum mechanics. I know as much about quantum mechanics today as one of my ancestors alive 1000 years ago knew about the chemistry of boiling water. The real point of your question is if something seems impossible then why study or explore. The real answer is thus. Discovery is necessary \u2014 what\u2019s over the next hill or mountain is for those who dare. Some will stay behind doing noble work, but others will find a way to scale Mount Everest (1952). As for being better stewards of the Earth, you don\u2019t know that the next million discoveries won\u2019t result in ways that in fact make us Humans better stewards. ",

            "answer_text": " Science improves when people go to war or when people do basic research. That is the answer to this question. What do you prefer? World War III or some basic research? Do you know that the camera on your phone is the result of astronomy? The search for exoplanets is the effort that created the CCD detectors that you have on your phone!!! every new technology has to have someone to pay for the initial development. Apple waited until CCD technology was mature before they placed a camera inside their phones. The initial CCD was used to replace Film in taking pictures of planets, stars\u2026you know, astronomic observations. The same happened for Infrared CCD detectors. Now everyone has an infrared camera that can see in the night. So, anything about cameras, TV, detectors, etc\u2026 they all came from astronomical research. In other words, astronomical research paid for the initial development and made that technology available to the masses. That is how it goes. Nowadays, the Large Hadron Collider is paying through the nose for superconducting magnets. That paid for the development of the new oxide superconducting wires. These are expensive and someone has to pay for their development. Society pays for it. They are now going to be used in Small Fusion Reactors. Eventually, the price will go down so much that our subways will be superconducting maglevs. That is how it goes. THE MOST DIFFICULT, MOST STRINGENT REQUIREMENT WILL PUSH THE FRONTIERS OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE That is why JFK said: We go to the Moon, not because it is easy but because it is HARD!!!  Space research, Astronomy, Particle Physics, Fusion, the Frontiers of Science demands what cannot be done today - They push the frontiers of what is feasible!!! Because of that, societies prefer to invest in Science than fight wars. IT IS A GREAT INVESTMENT! PS- By the way, if you want to eliminate Famine, Wars, just stop having more than two kids, preferably one for the time being. Earth's population would be in equilibrium if we had, say, 700,000,000 human beings around. More than enough. So, if you are concerned with better stewarding Earth, support politicians who would support family planning and a smaller World Population. ",
