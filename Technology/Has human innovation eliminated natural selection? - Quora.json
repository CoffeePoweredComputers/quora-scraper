            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t escape natural selection. Survival of the fittest. Being fit is not being strong, or having a big dick or being blonde with blue eyes. It is being able to live and to reproduce. Everything is about the fitness to the actual environment. The real one. Not the fitness to a theoretical and fantasized environment, where people must be tall, blue-eyed and blonde. If you live in a world without saber-tooth tigers, saber-tooth tigers sensors are useless.If you live in a world with coats, fur is mostly useless.If you live in a world with guns and without hand-to-hand fighting, being tall is mostly useless (it is convenient for picking jars in the upper shelf, but we are in a world with ladders too).If you live in a world with antibiotics, a fit individual is somebody who tolerate antibiotics and who is able to survive an infection with the help of antibiotics. An unfit individual is somebody who don\u2019t tolerate antibiotics and who is unable to survive an infection without their help.If you live in a world with vaccine, a fit individual is somebody who don\u2019t believe in anti-vaxx propaganda.Fitness is about the real world. A world with vaccines, antibiotics, guns, cars and coats. Natural selection is not about being given a chance to pass genetic information, but about REALLY doing it. The selection pressure is very strong today. Contraception leads to the elimination from the gene pool of many \u201cunfit\u201d humans, inapt to reproduce (unfit in reference to the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d). When a human decide to don\u2019t reproduce because he don\u2019t feel it, or because he enjoy his childless life, or because it will cost money to rise a child, or because he think that humans are bad, he is removed from the gene pool. The strength of the selection pressure can be evaluated as the percentage of the individuals eliminated from the gene pool at each generation. The proportion of men without children has almost doubled in one generation, from 12.8% for men born between 1941 and 1945 to 20.6% for men born between 1961 and 1965. The proportion of women without children has also doubled in one generation, from 9% for women born in 1946 to 17% to women born in 1970. So we have a strong natural selection, with more than 20% of the men and more than 17% of the women eliminated at each generation. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. You are making assumptions that people have made for thousands of years that things will remain the way they are now. That is unlikely. For starters most human innovation that you are thinking of is much to recent to affect evolution.  Because of the length of time between generations in humans you need 3,000-10,000 years to get much of a change.  We have no idea if the innovations we have now will be around in 5,000 years from now. If you go that far back it is around the invention of writing systems. We do know that innovations, like keeping dairy cows, that have been around about that time span have cause evolutionary changes in some populations.  This is lactase persistence in adults.  It is an example of convergent evolution because it has happened by different mutations in different populations. The different evolved ways to resist malaria also come form this time period and are convergent examples. Many diseases need a large enough population base to survive and evolve to evade our defenses. As we lived in larger groups after agriculture, more diseases evolved to take advantage.  We in turn have evolved defenses. More are being discovered all the time.  There is no reason to think this will end.  The fastest candidate is antibiotic resistant bacteria.  If they spread and evolve and if they become bad enough because we live in such large groups then we will evolve defenses.  One way to think about the worldwide 1919 flu pandemic is that millions of people who might have had more kids but were unable to fight it off, did not leave as many offspring. This will happen again. In much of the world there is little medicine and increase in population are only increasing environmental stress and selection. It is unlikely to decrease. As populations increase disease and other problem will increase.  Those with traits that work better in such a situation will have more kids that survive.  In more advanced economies we are effecting evolution by increasing genetic diversity. High genetic diversity is thought to be advantageous if there is an environmental shift, which at some point there will be.  There are just more possibilities for some people to have a trait that  will help their offspring survive. We do this is many ways .  One simple one is glasses.  500 years ago (only 25 generations) there were no glasses.  People who were extremely myopic probably had less surviving children.  Some may not have had any children.  Now it is no disability. Whatever genes that cause it are not being selected against.  This is evolution.  The trait is spreading in the population.  There may even be certain advantages it has in other ways. Another way evolution continues is by social values effecting sexual selection.  An example of this is Genghis Khan. He lived 750 years ago. In the area that he ruled about 8% of the men carry his Y dna signature. That is because his being related to his sons and grandsons was for many generations socially powerful.  They had more surviving offspring. His dna was selected for.  There is no reason to think that similar situations will not happen again in the future in some societies. And the last way that I can think of is that we have vastly increased the number of people that live in widely varied environments. This means that if some catastrophic event happens there will be some environments where some people survive. Do to founder effect alone, those people will be different in different places if they go through genetic bottlenecks in different parts of the world. Perhaps the biggest thing to remember is how evolution works.  Social systems, sexual preference, and innovations, anything that changes frequencies of genomes over many generations are all are parts of evolution. It can't \"stop\" or \"be eliminated\".  It doesn't even really make sense to think it can. In no social system in the world with no amount of innovation do everyone have the same number of surviving grandchildren that in turn have kids. It just doesn't happen, there are always differences.  The factors involved in that are often genetic.  Those traits then spread or are reduced. The only imaginary way it could be partly \"eliminated'  is by some all powerful oppressive state that dictated that every single person had the same number of children for thousands of years and simultaneously provided the exact same health care for everyone and was able to end most illness.  This is unlikely to say the least.  And even then, evolution would not end. Some would still have less  or no kids.  There would be no way  to prevent miscarriage and other ways that one phenotype is born and not another. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I believe that humans have seriously interfered and destroyed many natural processes. Examples are: Antibiotics interfere viral and bacterial growth. Simple infections have evolved into non-treatable diseases. By shipping people from first world nations to third world countries, epidemic-class diseases have moved globally. Air pollution has directly killed other forms of life because there was not sufficient time to evolve into pollution breathing life form. Water pollution has caused the extinction of numerous plants and animals. This same water contamination has caused invasive species to different parts of the globe. We use chemicals to treat out food supply to force it to produce more. Humans alter genes to grow other food sources to meet climate and environment in which it was never meant to survive. Humans have upset their natural personal balance. This upset occurred about two million years ago when the Genus Homo began to form. Approximately 19,000 years ago, the Homo sapiens were sufficiently evolved to make a simple artificial environment. About 6,000 years ago cognitive processing reached a point for a functional artificial environment, and the Homo sapiens began extinction. 3,000 years ago complete artificial environment was achieved. 250 years ago artificial environment became the natural circumstances of the Homo Sapien sapiens. Homo sapiens will be extinct within 30 years.  The above timeline is the cycle by Homo Genus. At the present rate of excessive interference, the Homo Sapien sapiens will be extinct within 50 to 100 years. All of this is due to human intervention.When this occurs scores of plants and animals will cease to exist because human interference will no longer exist.  In my view, the human and a virus one thing in common. They both destroy their host if left in a natural environment. A virus survives by rapid mutation or evolution in a changing environment. A human can survive in only a custom made environment. ",

            "answer_text": "In order for a trait to be subject to natural selection, it would have to kill most of its phenotypes before they had a chance to reproduce. Among other things, this means that natural selection is not awfully good at deleting recessive genes, especially rare harmful recessives. In addition, please don't forget that natural selection has been operating for the entire duration of human history, with the last one century only as the exception (maybe) -- and even then only in advanced societies. Nevertheless, it is the case that some individuals who in the past would have died before reproducing are now living to adulthood. This doesn't include such traits as \"poor vision,\" which is unlikely to have ever been a fatal childhood condition. In fact, I recently read that only when printing and reading became widespread did humans realize they all had bad eyesight and everyone needed glasses. But even considering the people with once-fatal conditions who are now living to adulthood, there are still some barriers to their passing on their unlucky gene. ~ For one thing, it may be doubted that every one of these folks becomes a parent. A lot of them are alive -- but too sick to marry or have children. ~ For another thing, many of the genes causing these deadly diseases will be recessive. But even if we suppose that (say) 80% of all those afflicted with a dominant gene of (whatever no-longer-fatal childhood disease) do survive, and that 50% of those become parents, that is still a tiny number. Compared to the billions of people on the planet, even several thousand parents who had been rescued from certain death in childhood cannot ever have a significant impact on the gene pool. Ther are just too few people who meet all the criteria.  ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this question, I am compelled to make the obvious point, \"natural selection is a selection pressure that arises based on interaction of different individuals, different species and individuals/species with environment\". Humans are a species which is part of the biosphere and since have become over populated and moreover they have a definite advantage in terms of cognitive ability. It is very obvious that humans would shape/influence the process of natural selection. Humans have created environment which has greatly and certainly changed the pace of the evolution, for example has forced microbes to evolve faster into having resistance. Moreover humans have also steered the direction of evolution, as in development of several dog and horse breeds and incorporation of a gene from a bacteria into another organism. The chances of pekingese breed of dog to have developed on its own seems dim, similarly there seems tiny chances of transfer of gene from bacteria which is found at a great depth around oil bed to a organism which is mostly found on surface. Further humans have not sat idle and let some disease overwhelm any disease or microbes. The humans have escaped or at least fought strongly against selection of individual based solely on genetic makeup but has developed a new kind of adaptation which is not dependent on genes anymore and that is \"cultural transmission of knowledge\". And with this new power humans has been able to bend the nature in a way, so as favours Mr. sapiens. Dino's did the same thing buy curbing out most of the other species, or at least the big ones.But still all of these progress/change in allelic frequency or population frequency which humans has resulted in, can happen on its own, but as said before the pace would be definitely quite slow. And yes there is no certainty whether it would surely happen or not.  So humans have definitely influenced the natural population. Whether they have interfered or not, that still remains a question to be answered. ",

            "answer_text": "Resisting it?  We've practically abandoned it as a species. It isn't so much due to medicine and health conditions (though reducing infant mortality definitely plays a big role).  It's more like you said, passing on \"undesirable\" traits to our children because they no longer have an appreciable impact on our survival. Take the poor vision.  I myself am a case there - I am nearsighted and, without glasses or contacts, have trouble seeing anything more than a few feet away with clarity and sharpness.  Ten thousand years ago this could have been rather bad for me, reducing my efficiency as a hunter-gatherer, and making it hard for me to survive into adulthood, attract a mate and produce offspring.  My peers with better vision would be more suited to doing so, and probably have a much better chance than myself. It's not even that we have the technology to correct my problem (which we do), it is just that my problem is no longer fatal to me in today's society.  I don't have to be a hunter-gatherer, I can get a job and buy food at a grocery store.  Even without my contacts or glasses I could survive.  I could hold a job.  I could feed myself, and attract a mate and have children and pass on my defective genes. As a species, we are now free from the constraints of selecting our mates based on their fitness of their genes.  Sure, we still have some preference for \"good\" genes and people who are in generally good health are at an advantage, but we are just as likely to see non-genetic factors such as wealth play a factor.   Again, as a species, we just are not really subject to the pressures of natural selection anymore.  ",

            "answer_text": "Has human innovation eliminated natural selection? I am a Young Earth Creationist. I can still give a good perspective on this question. Evolution continues to happen, despite any advances. One first has to understand the implications and expectations of evolution. Expectations of Evolution include it must be happening at all times. A) It is supposedly a natural process, so it will occur. B) It has no way to know when it is to start and when it is to stop. C) The mechanism that drives evolution is random change of the DNA. One thing they also claim drives evolution, but this fails to drive evolution, is the variants allowed by the normal mixing of the DNA in heterosexual reproduction. This just causes variations already within the genome to be expressed. Natural Selection operates upon the choices offered in C to cause the increase and spread of the Evolution. C can be the result of Negative or Positive Evolution. Negative Evolution is the loss of function due to the corruption of the Genetic Code. Positive Evolution is the addition of new Genetic Code. Problem with Negative Evolution is it can be seen as Positive Evolution, if the loss of information creates a beneficial result. Some argue Sickle Cell Anemia is a loss of information on the formation of hemoglobin, creating a misshapen red blood cell, but giving the individual immunity to malaria. It is also thought most if not all of the \u201csuper bugs\u201d are the result of loss of genetic information that removes a vulnerability to our drugs, while removing or diminishing some characteristic they need. This enables their survival in the environment with the drugs, while making them less able to survive otherwise. Positive Evolution has not been definitely observed, but is Evolution by addition of new genetic information. If this added information does not have any helpful information, or information that can be understood and or acted upon by the organism it has no benefit and may be negative in result, especially if it replaces usable Genetic Information, becoming Negative Evolution. The above is a simplistic explanation of the expectations of Evolution. Now how does this work? The mechanism must be constantly happening. Our bodies have defences against this, and is constantly checking for and repairing the changes, but some slip through. The only ones that affect Evolution are ones to the Gametes, as only these changes are passed on. Another person\u2019s answer mentioned inbreeding. A common ancestor for both parents means a common source for any corruption of the genome to both parents. Therefore inheriting either Negative or Positive Evolutionary changes and having them expressed is more likely, and happens in fewer generations. If the change is either dominant or co-dominant, it will manifest in the first generation to inherit the change, but if recessive it will manifest no earlier then the second generation, but more likely, unless inbreeding occurs, in later generations like the fifth or later. Genetic changes may be detrimental, neutral or beneficial. The vast majority are neutral or detrimental, but an accumulation of the Negative Evolutionary changes adds up to death or extinction. Positive Evolution has not happened, or as Richard Dawkins says, it has been observed to have happened but not at a time it occurs. It is just that he claims the evidence for such is so overwhelming it cannot be denied. I differ with him on it having happened and on the evidence it has happened. The evidence is there, but what he and Young Earth Creationists disagrees on the interpretation of what it means. An example of evidence: Some species of snakes have joints for their legs. You may point out that snakes do not have legs. This is true, so the question is why do they have the joints for their legs? Some Evolutionists use this to prove that a creature that eventually evolved into snakes had legs, and these joints are vestigial remnants of the legs. Possible. A second option may be, using info I have already introduced, Negative Evolution, snakes may have had legs, but lost the legs, some keeping the joints. A third option would be snakes never had legs, but some snakes have evolved the joints. Sometime in the future they may evolve a preamble to legs and eventually may evolve legs. This option would, if proved would destroy Young Earth Creation, but the first two is impossible to distinguish. A fourth option may be evidence that Genesis three is factual, confirming God\u2019s curse on snakes. A fifth option is they may be seen as leg joints but are something else. There may be other possible explanations. Whatever the answer is, there are five options I have identified, can you say which option is proven by the evidence given? A lot of evidence is like this, but some evidence is more strongly for Young Earth Creation than Evolution, and little cannot be easily explained within the Young Earth Creation view, little is a clear answer to prove Evolution but not Creation. With this understanding, if Evolution is true, what is the answer to your question? Evolution still happens. Natural Selection however fails to have its full effect on the poor options on humans, because we strive to keep the poor options alive. I helped a family for a couple years with their two boys with Duschenes Muscular Dystrophy, in nature neither would have survived to my meeting them. The eldest was old enough he could have children, the younger was entering the age where he would be able to, though I am not saying either were involved with a female. I have seen Thalidomide Baby survivors, and I am sure many have seen others whom Natural Selection would have pruned well before they could pass their genetics onto a new generation. In this way we are expediting evolution, basically Negative Evolution. As to Positive Evolution, Gould\u2019s theory of Evolution is displayed in the Marvel Comic Books with the X-Men. I have not met any I know are mutants, nor have I heard of any, though CMI has aired reference to one who may meet this standard. If this is a true example of Positive Evolution, as per Gould\u2019s Punctuated Equilibrium, that will disprove \u201cYoung Earth Evolution. If the example is a hoax, that will not be evidence to rely on, if it is Negative Evolution or some epigenetic phenomenon then it can be accommodated within the Young Earth Paradigm. CMI is a Young Earth Creationist site, so they do not know what is going on with the young Chinese boy who apparently can see in the dark. The processes must be continuing if Evolution is true, as it has no way of knowing it is not needed. We do counter the negative effects,, to some extent of limiting the ability of Natural Selection to deselect the bad options, allowing Negative Evolution to have a greater impact and carry on its effect, growing in volume. Our compassion also slows down the spread of Positive Evolution, if it happens, as advantages of the Positive Evolution are negated in many ways in our modern society. This slowing down the effects of Positive Evolution may be diminishing, with the more open morality, since one male is freer to spread his genes with many females, allowing his advantageous genes to spread further and faster. A female may have children with more than one male, but the rate of reproduction for spreading her genetic information remains constant. Long answer, but it does explain the answer. ",

As with all other mammals, natural selection in homo sapiens is based largely on sexual competition : the richest men have the most access to sex because they prove their ability to provide for the material needs of their descendants, and to transmit competitive genes to these descendants. Men fantasize about beautiful women, because female beauty is synonymous with a better ability to procreate. Likewise, in our increasingly interconnected societies, natural selection in homo sapiens will be based, in the future, on social intelligence: the people who will be able to make as many allies as possible will be those who will succeed the most in life. While those who will have a low social intelligence (autistic, depressed, people who had helicopter parents in their childhood who did not push them to take risks in life ...) will be marginalized, will have great difficulties to have love partners, and will therefore probably be eliminated by natural selection. This is why we are pushed, from elementary school, to develop our network and our social skills. ",

Cars, cellphones, buildings... our entire culture\u2026 laws government\u2026everything around us that we have created is essentially a homeostatic layer for humans to operate within. This new \"Layer\" of evolution is essentially the same purpose as a birds nest... it's purpose is to ease environmental pressure on us in one respect or another. We could say it is ALSO essentially another layer of homeostasis\u2026 it changes the environment to suit us\u2026 to be consistent and reliable\u2026 less random, so to speak to allow specialization towards what is perceived to be beneficial. When conditions are consistent and reliable it allows us to specialize, we don't need to do everything, much is done for us and we can focus on specific specialties. Homeostasis is simply a result of cooperation to ease selective pressure on the group which allows individual specialization\u2026 which allows benefits for all. Again, we are creating the environment that we will evolve to fit.>> ",

For example, nations and cultures that practice inbreeding suffer from high rates of birth defects. Google \u201cincest leads to low IQ\u201d. Thanks to modern medicine, such cultures can still multiply and grow despite these inherent disadvantages. It is the same with infants who are born with birth defects or genetic issues. In the past, they would die and their genes would not be passed down to further generations. Thanks to modern medicine, it is possible now to prevent such deaths. Birth control and modern humanistic ideas is also interfering with natural selection. Birth rates in the developed world are falling dramatically. In places like Japan, they are in negative territory. Nations which are economically strong and population growth are paradoxically declining. In a way, this is natural selection at its best. The human society is instinctively responding to the environment.  It is rare to find large families, 3 to 20+ children, in developed nations. If this carried on, in a natural progress, then an equilibrium would be established. However, due to modern humanistic thought, developed nations accept increased migration, and the population growth is artificially increased. If the new immigrants share the same sort of societal values as the host nation, that is bearable. But if they bring with them and still practice incestuous marriages, and large family structures the human gene pool suffers. ",

In fact, in modern business, agriculture, industrial practice, pharmacology, or modern medicine, there is not a care in the world for what those natural principles might be. That humans evolved to move, run and climb has been replaced by sitting, sitting, sitting. That humans evolved to eat what is available seasonably in their environment, has been replaced by sodas, fruit loops, pizzas, and artificial foods of all kinds laced with pesticides.  In the modern world, it would be rare for anyone to eat the foods that nourish our bodies--because they have for millions of years.  Instead, we are fat, malnourished and die young.  And we turn to our manufactured \"Health Care System\" to find out why.  There are some incipient movements to recover natural farming methods that would save the earth Working with Nature, Not Against It | Ecology Global Network, but industrial farming cares not a whit about it.  They prefer to grow their manufactured crops on depleted soils, nourished with plastic sacks full of NPK.  They really believe those are all the nutrients that plants need to make them grow.  Soil structure?   Huh?   What for? But, health care professionals have no idea what  healthy natural man is.

Natural selectors are more random these days, depending on which country you live in during war or famine, rather than your particular mix of genetic traits.

Many natural selectors like cancer and heart disease happen later in life after reproduction, so these are not effecting the gene pool. That is, people are nor evolving to be better able to resist getting cancer or avoiding heart disease. Childhood disease still has considerable power to kill off susceptible peoples without natural immunities, although modern medicines are very effective.

            "answer_text": "No. Humans are still under natural selection. There have been several known cases of natural selection working in human populations over the last 10,000 years:1. 5 Signs Humans Are Still Evolving Lactose tolerance, resistance to diseases, loss of wisdom teeth, smaller brains, blue eyes 2. Where We Live Determines Our Height Technology has lessened the selection pressure. As you noted, technology is at the point where there is lower infant mortality (but not eliminated), fewer people actually starve (at least in the West), and modern medicine helps kids to survive. Thus, what is called the \u201cselection coefficient\u201d is less. That means the increase in frequency of a trait from generation to generation (due to natural selection) is much lower. But it\u2019s not gone. Another issue is that the human population is so large (over 7 billion) that it takes too many generations for a new traits to become \u201cfixed\u201d. \u201cFixed\u201d means that everyone has the trait. What this means is that the human species as a whole is pretty much in stasis. However, as the lactose tolerance allele shows, there can be a rapid increase in frequency of a trait within a population. Normally in evolution, natural selection works best on small isolated populations facing a new environment. However, now with much better transportation technology, there is travel and gene flow (mating) between the different populations. Thus, people living in the Andes and Himalayas are showing adaptation to the higher altitude. Left isolated, these people would eventually become a new species. But they aren\u2019t isolated anymore. Natives travel and move to the lowlands and mate with the lowlanders, bringing those alleles to the wider human population. There are very few truly isolated human populations left. ",

Humans die of cancer and arteriosclerosis caused by an abundance of food that is now rare. People are dying of the pathogens in our waste products. Our chances of dying from small pox has gone down and of E. coli is going up. We are over fishing the oceans, which used to be the main source of protein for most of the planet. People from different parts of the globe are traveling all over, exposing themselves to many habitats. Our patterns of mating, especially our courtship protocols, have changed. Clothes change the amount of UV radiation exposure. Other species of animals and plants, once important parts of our existence, are going extinct at an extreme rate. All the large predators are going extinct, or being isolated. People are more likely to be killed by killing each other than large predators. Humans no longer live in desert or savannah environments. Water is being transferred to people that live in the dessert. Forests, wetlands and savannah are disappearing. So these environmental changes have become the \u2018new natural\u2019. The word artificial implies some sort of control. Little of this is under our control. So it can\u2019t really be called \u2018artificial\u2019.

The reason we don't see randomness anywhere in the biosphere is because genetic changes are not random, not because alleged multitudes of misfits keep dying before anyone can see any evidence of the \"randomness\". It was always bad science to stake a claim on an excuse for not having evidence, but now that excuse is laid bare, as if it wasn't already. Humans get dozens of mutations per birth. Among the 7 billion extant humans there have been some 420 billion mutations at birth, so in a mere 3 billion base pair code, random mutations would have caused all genetic loci in our genome to change literally 140 times over, just with living humans. Yet all humans are within 99.9% of each other. The genetic changes are under and extremely tight constraint, not random at all. It would take an unthinkable amount of death for selection to account for this, as if the human race or any species could survive Neo-Darwinism if it ever happened. Yet human births are carefully documented in near totality the world over, so we KNOW the death is not happening and the genetic changes are not random. So why are there still Darwinians bloviating about randomness and selection? That is the only difficult question left. Selectionism makes the useless tautological statement that those with traits that benefit survival and reproduction will be more likely to survive and reproduce. This statement is pointless and non-explanatory, but it can't help but be true. So, selection still happens whether we live or die. It just doesn't DO anything helpful. What has been eliminated is the stupidity of considering selection an excuse for never seeing randomness in genetics. ",

However, natural selection simply describes the fact that species which survive and reproduce will pass on their genes. In the wild, this typically leads to the fittest species passing on their genes while the weak die. With more advanced technology, weaker individuals have a chance of surviving but natural selection still remains in place. It may no longer be a case of only the strongest surviving but if you die before having offspring, you don\u2019t pass on your genes. ",

Poor eyesight is no more as life threatening as has been out there in the wild. But whenever a tsunami or something less deadly hits you, those that are not well on their legs will be hit more severely. So, technology, hygiene, food supply, and medical help takes lots of burdens from us: we stay longer fit and live double as long than a century before (worldwide).  Evolution consists of: Mutation + Selection + Chances + Migration of the genes. Mutation is unchanged, maybe increased by mutagens we consume. Selection is largely reduced, it will always be, but to a minor to microer extent. Chances are ... I guess they are. Migration and mixing of genes is enormously stimulated. So the dices are rolling in a changed game. We don't fully understand but we changed the rules: With gene technology there will be a new player.  Faites votre jeu: Evolution is not over. It's just a NEW GAME. ",

As an example, look at how autism rates have been spiking in recent years. There have been many studies to see if there is some sort of environmental factor but the fact that High-Functioning Autistics are very good at computer-related jobs and the spike started about the same time computers became a household object leaves me feeling more than a little suspicious. I am not an evolutionary biologist but I am convinced that the rise in Autism is largely due to the evolutionary pressures of computers. ",

Maybe today having burly physiques and high level of aggressiveness may not be as important as better education and thinking skills; But this is exactly how natural selection occurs. The pressures of a certain environment favors some traits over others and those tend to better cope with life and perpetuate. Our environment is no more just made of trees and rocks and seas and sky. our existence may have expanded into more complex sets of behaviors. But this is the environment we live in and the best fitted to it will be naturally selected to propagate their genes, as it has always been. ",

But, as Steve Zara points out, what it did was change the criteria for fitness (\u201cnatural resistance to certain diseases\u201d was no longer a factor). Several writers have suggested that civilization itself has changed the criteria for fitness, gradually weeding out humans who were more prone to violence or less capable of cooperating in groups too large to know everyone. And of course the spread, in cultures that keep cattle, of genes enabling us to drink milk as adults is an example of evolution through natural selection. ",

So yes, our evolution by natural selection is over. I\u2019m just speculating, of course, but I submit that natural selection is the only way intelligence can develop ex nihilo, and that once an evolved entity develops to the point of inventing science and technology, evolution for that species shuts off, like the first stage of a rocket, and intelligent design takes over.

Inovation will not stop this selection force. In humans sexual selection might have been a more powerful selection than natural selection. We choose our mates. It is not 100% random. But today as said, the population is just so large that the rate of change is glacial at best. The said, humans will continue to evolve and quickly too. Today we are very near to having the ability to modify or engineer out own genetics. Like GMO corn, there will be GMO humans. Engineered genes can spread much faster.
