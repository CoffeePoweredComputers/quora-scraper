            "answer_text": "That depends on whether you mean technology in general, or Technology as a formal degree area. Technology as an area is effectively including everything that isn't within the liberal arts, math, and the social sciences.  Anything that is involved with the analysis and synthesis of artifacts is technology.  Thus, a general answer to your question is \"All the colleges specializing in engineering and applied sciences.\" There are some colleges that focus on use of technology as a major.  That is, rather than focus on the underlying science to analyze phenomena, or the engineering disciplines to make artifacts, they focus on the wide variety of applications of existing artifacts.   Community colleges and many for-profit trade schools effectively teach technology in this fashion, although they may not award degrees in that field.  Many baccalaureate programs exist, either in name or spirit, and they can often be found at polytechnics. Purdue has one such set of programs.  Ours was founded over 50 years ago as a complement to the engineering and science schools here.  It was named the College of Technology for a long time, and recently renamed as the Purdue Polytechnic Institute.  They award 4-year BS degrees in several areas of applied technology, including EET (electrical engineering technology), CIT (computer and information technology), and CGT (computer graphics technology).  The Purdue programs all tend to be highly ranked, and the job placement for graduates is outstanding. (For illustration, if you wanted to learn about the fundamentals of computation, including limits of computation, design of data structures, algorithms, and protocols, you would come to Purdue for the Computer Science degree, in the College of Science.  If you wanted to learn about building computer systems, including issues of component design, circuit structure, signal strengths, memory architectures, and embedding processors, you would come to get a degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering in our College of Engineering.  But if you wanted a degree in building and configuring enterprise networks, applied computer forensics,  business automation tools, and telecommunication design, then that would be Computer Information Technology in the Purdue Polytechnic Institute.)
