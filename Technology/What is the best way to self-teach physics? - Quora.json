            "answer_text": "The best way is depends on how you learn most effectively. For some, going to lectures and listening to professors explain concepts is most helpful. For others, it's more instructive to sit down with a textbook and comprehend the physics being explained. For most people, it's probably a combination of both. You're in luck, as you can access both means of instruction via the internet these days. As already stated in another answer, MIT OCW is a great resource. Walter Lewin's lectures are quite popular, but they are introductory level physics. If you've never done physics before, you'll want to start there. He's a dynamic lecturer and his videos are full of demonstrations. You can access the lecture videos, as well as exams, problem sets, and solutions for his class from the OCW page. There's also much more there if you advance beyond the introductory level material. If the time comes that MIT OCW does not offer material you're looking for, you might want to consider downloading iTunes and accessing the iTunes U section of the store. Multiple universities, ranging from Princeton and Harvard to Berkeley and Oxford, have uploaded full lecture series. All of this material is also available for free. There is also Khan Academy, which is also a great resource for self-teaching.  Of course, just watching video lectures is not going to make you good at physics. Lectures are best complemented by a good textbook and ample practice problems. Any introductory physics textbook should be full of practice problems. Fundamentals of Physics (Amazon.com: Fundamentals of Physics (9780470044728): David Halliday: Books) is a common one, and should cover basic mechanics and electromagnetism. As you get more advanced, particularly after studying a good deal of calculus as well, Kleppner and Kolenkow's mechanics text (Amazon.com: An Introduction to Mechanics (9780521198219): Daniel Kleppner, Robert J. Kolenkow: Books) is without a doubt one of the best because of its incredibly challenging problems. I'll second the Feynman Lectures series as great resource, but they're probably best read after you've had some experience with calculus. For intermediate level texts in E&M and Quantum Mechanics, I'll recommend both of David Griffiths' textbooks. Griffiths is a gifted teacher, and his prose makes any difficult concept comprehensible. Further, both of his texts are filled with problems, so you'll have ample practice to test your understanding. That should be enough to get you started. ",

            "answer_text": "Read the right books. However, realistically you won\u2019t make a good physicist without formal training. Here\u2019s a list of the right books: Intro physics: The Mechanical Universe <- you should master this book in skill in high school from your own studies since you probably won't get good training from your school system also master introductory calculus (i.e. integrate, differentiate, integrate by parts, etc) also master basic linear algebra (i.e. invert matrices, solve N equations, etc) more advanced: Introductory Quantum Mechanics (Liboff) <- difficult but intro physics major undergrad level Classical Mechanics (Goldstein) <- advanced undergrad or intro grad level Electromagnetism (Jackson) <- advanced undergrad or intro grad level Quantum Mechanics (Sakurai)<- advanced undergrad or intro grad level Even more advanced: Quantum Field Theory (Srednicki) <- advanced grad level General Relativity (Misner Thorne Wheeler) use white tabbed pages only < grad level Even more advanced again: String Theory (Polchinski) <- very advanced grad level General Relativity (Misner Thorne Wheeler) use black tabbed pages this time, as well as redo white tabbed pages to help remember things. Note the above sequence will take about 5\u20137 years of intense study. But you\u2019ll be up to speed on the basics, I.e., you could become a PhD student for a theorist and they could lead you into becoming a real theorist who writes papers that are not tinfoil hat papers. Note I have blatantly ignored major fields in physics that are unforgivable to skip, like statistical mechanics, basic materials physics, plus ignored the math that you will need. The math you will need: Classical calculus Linear Algebra (fancy version like in Apostol volumes 1 and 2) Partial Differential Equations Complex Analysis (method of residues in contour integration) Nonlinear Differential Equations Group Theory (physics version only) Tensor Calculus (physics version only) After this the physics is too different from the pure math so you basically will be using custom forms of math that are only used in specific fields of physics, and unintelligible to mathematicians. An example would be the graphs used in calculations in particle physics called Feynman diagrams. These are mathematical structures, not just pictures. You need the secret code to convert these diagrams into formulae though. This comes from taking a formal relativistic quantum class and an advanced formal particle physics class (that has relativistic QM as a prerequisite - only taught at a few top schools, not one that is lower level that does not require field theory).
