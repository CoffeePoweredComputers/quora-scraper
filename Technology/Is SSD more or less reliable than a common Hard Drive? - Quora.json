            "answer_text": "It depends on how you look at RELIABILITY. With every write to the SSD, you are taking life off of that drive. The HDD does not suffer the write wear and can be erased and written to with no memory wear down. The SSD memory is getting cheaper, not in dropping the price of the same memory, but in using a cheaper memory to get the price down. The orignal memory was super fast access speed and allowed about 300,000 write events before the drive would stop accepting writes. Todays memory is cheaper, is not as fast and the amount of writes it will accept is around 50,000 writes before it stops accepting writes. The Next memory is reported to be slower, and will have significant less write wear acceptance. No one knows what the life of the SSD can be, generally using the warrantee period as the drive life, usually up to 5 years. The HDD has been tested (in a group test) to last 7 years and up to 10 years. The usual argument is access speed. The SSD new has a fast access speed, and as as it gets older, as it fills with data, as the control programs are moving data around, the SSD starts to slow down even more. On the HDD side, usually a slow drive is caused by fragmented files. This can be reversed by running a defrag program. The HDD is a fast reading device. It is the mechanicals that have to move to located and read the data off the disk that adds access time. In short, the HDD is fast for access speed loading a few large programs when compared to loading a large group of small programs. For long term archiving, the HD can be used for 10 years, the SSD is recommend for storage for 2 to 5 years, and you have to refresh the SSD periodically or the memory will fade. Backing up the SSD is recommended to put the back up on a HDD. I strongly recommend you start doing some research and form your own opinion so you know why one drive is better than the other, you will know why the different memory that is used in the SSD will affect its speed and operation and life span. You will know what slows it down and why it does not speed up the computer speed, no affect at all. There is a lot of information out there and you really need to sit down and get the info you are seeking for yourself. If you are having connection problems, you need to explain your question better. Make your backups and consider making a System Drive Image Backup. ",

            "answer_text": "Both. In terms of lifespan \u2014 (yes, SSD\u2019s are limited to roughly 100K re-writes, but that\u2019s actually greater than the practical # of re-writes a mechanical drive can reliably sustain), performance \u2014 (continuous read/writes and, especially, seek times are much faster), and data integrity, an SSD has it all over a mechanical hard drive. It is also less subject to wear because of its lack of moving parts and lower power consumption \u2014 (less watts used + less watts wasted = less heat, the biggest killer of components). But\u2026 A conventional (mechanical) HDD has one distinct advantage: forewarning.You will encounter bad sectors, \u201cchattering\u201d (repeated read/write attempts), and other detectable anomalies before the drive fails completely, thus giving you time to back up your data (unless the on-board controller fails, which is rare). This will not be the case with an SSD (which can fail catastrophically without any prior symptoms). ",
