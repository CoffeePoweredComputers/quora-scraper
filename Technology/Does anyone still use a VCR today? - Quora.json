            "answer_text": "Very rarely and only for playback. So rarely that it is not even connected to anything including power unless I need it. I have some old archives of the kids I may want to watch, or some old rare VHS tape that has other sentimental content. And the times that I will use it, I usually digitize it so I wont need to pull it out again. I even have one of the multi-format global decks that will play or record any format (PAL/SECAM/NTSC/etc.). I haven\u2019t used that one in years. When they sit around, the rubber wheels and rubber belts can corrode, and the gear grease can thicken into brittle paste. ",

We own a grand total of two VHS tapes; my wedding 26 years ago and a theatre production featuring my daughter aged about 7. We haven\u2019t watched either in years, yet, that VCR sits there patiently, waiting and hoping I\u2019ll turn it on again. ",
