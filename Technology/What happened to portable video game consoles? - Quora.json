            "answer_text": "The niche once filled by the likes of the Nintendo Gameboy/DS and the other, less successful handhelds is now the domain of smartphone devices and tablets. Most people don't really want to carry multiple devices around with them and, as a smartphone makes a decent gaming platform for the types of casual games that were popular on handhelds, as well as being capable of playing music and browsing the Internet\u2026 the choice is a no-brainer really. 8n the 90s it wasn't uncommon to carry a Gameboy, a Walkman (tape or CD) , and perhaps a cellphone that might have \u201csnake\u201d along with the ability to call and send SMS messages while your Internet access was only available on the big beige box at home or in the office. Likely you would also have to carry a couple of packs of spare AA batteries for the music and gaming devices. The only real survivor in the dedicated handheld market now is Nintendo, who only recently stopped making true handhelds to concentrate on the hybrid, tablet sized, switch (the switch lite is still a true handheld but is still larger than the old pocket size devices).

            "answer_text": "There are two major reasons why handheld consoles have basically disappeared. The arrival of the smartphone and \u201ccasual\u201d games.Nintendo\u2019s domination of the space.The first means the actual handheld market is smaller than ever, and the second means whoever enters the market has an almost verticle wall to climb. Sony was best positioned to take on Nintendo in that space, they had successful home consoles, access to dozens of IPs, had a lot of experience making portable machines, and used the same play that worked so well years before \u201cNintendo is for kids\u201d but they ended up joining the likes of the Game Gear and Lynx So all that's left is Nintendo and small niche markets like retro handhelds  Emulation machines  And custom handheld rebuilds of \u201cclassic\u201d consoles  ",
