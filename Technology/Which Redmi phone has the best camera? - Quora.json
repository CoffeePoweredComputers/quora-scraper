            "answer_text": "None of the redmi series phones have a better camera. These types of phones are mainly targeted towards end users who are \u2018just satisfied' after using their phones. On the other hand manufacturers mainly skimp on the rear camera hardware (specifically for India) because people here are more selfie centric and it's one of the major cost cutting areas which altogether reduces the price of the phone. If you want a budget phone with great rear camera, check out for Asus and Sony. If you want a great front camera, then it's a hands down win for oppo and vivo. ",
