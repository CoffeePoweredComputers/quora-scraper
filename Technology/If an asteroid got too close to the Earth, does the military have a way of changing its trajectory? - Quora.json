In fact the use of nuclear weapons is about the worst thing you could do: there\u2019s nowhere near enough nuclear warheads on Earth to be able to reduce an asteroid to its component atoms, the best that\u2019s going to happen is splitting it into a few chunks. You will have turned a single armour piercing bullet into buckshot. Multiple very large impacts rather than one huge one. ",
