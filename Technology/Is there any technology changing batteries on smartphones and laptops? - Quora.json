            "answer_text": "Yes lithium batteries continually getting better for smartphones and laptops. The chemistry of the batteries with recent NMC is very good. The anodes and cathods are also getting better. There are new solid state batteries already being tested that will be in phones next year. They charge faster and have 2 to 3x the capacity of todays batteries. They will also last longer. ",
