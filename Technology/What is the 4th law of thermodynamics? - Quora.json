            "answer_text": "You are the among the first of many to read this observation. It is a theory and untested as yet. The fourth law of thermodynamics is the conservation of time. All of space, matter and energy is contained by time like a great bubble. Time is infinite and extends in all directions through a range of 1440 decimal degrees simultaneously and is flexible yet indestructible. It is a paradoxic element of nature but integral to its existence. Without time there could be no gravity, no matter, no space and consequently no energy. Time is the balancing force of everything. It is the other half of everything. Time fills the emptiness of space between subatomic particles and is a prevalent force in everything yet compresses around dense collections of energy. Time could be the reason that the universe expands continuously in reaction to an unknown cause. Infinity is a number and zero is a number. Mathematics uses calculus to calculate an approach towards zero and infinity but never reaches either\u2026 time is infinite and therefore we need to assist our concept of the cosmos as being not three but four dimensional. Time which is on the inside must be the sum and equal the of the outside. Time is in, around, forward and behind everything. Gravity is the energy differential between time and matter. Many have wondered what lies beyond the edge of the known universe and the answer is infinite time. Matter is effectively condensed time energy. ",

            "answer_text": "There are four laws of thermodynamics, which contain deep physical and philosophical meanings. Therefore, it is hard to give you a thorough understanding by using just a few hundreds of words. I will state them one by one and tell you my interpretation of their importance. Zeroth law: If A and B are separately in thermal equilibrium with C, then A and B are in thermal equilibrium. Importance: We are allowed to define a thermodynamic parameter called temperature such that when two objects are in thermal equilibrium, they have the same temperature. Background knowledge: When two objects are \"in contact\" and there is no net heat flow between them, we say the objects are in thermal equilibrium. Further reading: Zeroth law of thermodynamics First law: The change in the total internal energy of an closed system equals the heat supplied to the system subtracted by the work done by the system. Importance: It is a restatement of the law of conservation of energy: The total energy of an isolated system is constant over time, and energy can be transformed from one form to another, but it can neither be created nor destroyed. Background knowledge: A system is called closed if energy (but not matter) is allowed to be exchanged with the surroundings. A system is called isolated if both energy and matter are not allowed to be exchanged with the surroundings. Further reading: First law of thermodynamics Second law: In every natural thermodynamic process, the sum of entropies of all objects is either unchanged (reversible process) or increased (irreversible process). Importance: We can show that this law ensures that there is no perpetual machine, no perfect engine, and no perfect refrigerator. Background knowledge: For a beginner of the subject, it is sloppy but good enough to interpret the entropy as the degree of disorderness. Further reading: Second law of thermodynamicsInteresting question: How can we relate the three different definitions of entropy together? Third law: The entropy of an object approaches to a constant as its temperature approaches to absolute zero. Importance: We can show that it is impossible for any process to reduce the entropy of a system to its absolute zero value in a finite number of steps. Further reading: Third law of thermodynamics ",
