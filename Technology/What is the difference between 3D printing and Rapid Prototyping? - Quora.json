            "answer_text": "A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a CAD design built for validation, presenting, or marketing communication use. Rapid prototype, by its literal meaning, is an early sample made from rapid means. By dictionary explaining, rapid prototyping is a process to make physical model directly from a computer layer by layer. This definition is same to 3D printing. That is to say rapid prototyping is another saying of 3D printing. Maybe initially because rapid prototyping comes to use after 3D printing. Editers attached its meaning to rapid prototyping. In industry, rapid prototyping is always referred 3D printing and CNC machining, sometime vacuum casting. 3D printing and CNC machining are processes made directly from computer with CAD drawings. No extra tooling are needed. While vacuum casting is mainly applied in small quantity production to save cost. Only when prototypes of soft rubber parts are requested, there has to use silicone mold(vacuum casting) to process. Sharing is a happy thing. Feel free to discuss with me.

            "answer_text": "Defining 3D printing and Rapid Prototyping 3D printing is the right word to use when describing the process, but using additive manufacturing is more precise. Whereas, rapid prototyping is one of the applications that is used 3D printing or additive manufacturing technology to create new products. What is 3D Printing 3D printing is a manufacturing process that takes a digital 3D model and turns it into a physical object. In this process, a material is fabricated using a print head, nozzle, or other printing technology. What is Rapid Prototyping Rapid prototyping is a group of techniques used to quickly fabricate a scale model of a physical part or assembly using three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) data and a rapid manufacturing technique. In manufacturing, rapid prototyping is used to create a three-dimensional model of a part or product. In addition to providing 3D visualization for digitally rendered items, rapid prototyping can be used to test the efficiency of a part or product design before it is manufactured in larger quantities. Testing may have more to do with the shape or size of a design, rather than its strength or durability, because the prototype may not be made of the same material as the final product Example of Rapid Prototyping  Credits: Ethereal Halo - 5axis CNC & 3D PrinterTo know more about rapid prototyping check this pdf ",

            "answer_text": "3D printing is a manufacturing process like milling and turning. Its also known as additive manufacturing because you are adding successive layers of material instead of to remove material like milling and turning. Just be aware that is not the same process for create a 3D model for 3D printing than for milling or turning. Rapid prototyping is a method to quickly create a scale model of a part or finished product, using a computer-aided design (CAD) software. Manufacturing of the part is mainly done with 3D printing or additive layer manufacturing technology. Please don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch with me or contact the Fydiz community directly.

            "answer_text": "3D printing, presently it has turned out to be conceivable to think of restrictive structures. Earlier, there was an enormous hole with regards to planning different prints. Obviously, 3D printing gives greater adaptability. The traditional printing needs different stages to pass explicit structures. Such stages were relied upon computerized models and have such huge numbers of impediments. With 3D printing, it is conceivable to utilize advanced strings all through the creation procedure. Rapid prototyping is a gathering of strategies used to rapidly manufacture a scale model of a physical part or get together utilizing three-dimensional PC helped plan (CAD) information. Development of the part or get together is normally done utilizing 3D printing or \"added substance layer fabricating\" innovation. Earlier, there was a tremendous gap with regards to structuring exceptional prints. Obviously, 3D printing and prototyping gives greater adaptability. ",

            "answer_text": "Defining 3D printing and Rapid Prototyping What is 3D Printing 3D printing is a manufacturing process which takes a digital 3D model and turns it into a physical object. In this process, a material is fabricated using a print head, nozzle or other printing technology. What is Rapid Prototyping Rapid Prototyping or RP is an application used in additive manufacturing to create a model faster than the normal process. Rapid prototyping is mainly completed using 3D printing or additive manufacturing technology. From the definitions above, they show that 3D printing and Rapid prototyping are two similar terms being used in different industries. Furthermore, here are other components that make them different. Difference between 3D printing and Rapid Prototyping Price There is a significant difference between the cost of 3D printing and rapid prototyping. From machine depreciation, materials to be used, labour, system maintenance, etc. Rapid prototyping technology can cost twice as much as 3D printing. Moreover, maintaining a 3D printer can range to approximately a few thousand dollars per year. It is much cheaper compared to maintaining a rapid prototyping system which can cost up to $10,000 annually. Complexity of the printing method Using 3D printing requires less or even minimal training (depending on the complexity of components and supporting structures needed) compared to using rapid prototyping machines. With rapid prototyping, parameters are not so simple to adjust. However, with 3D printing, it is possible to create parts right out of the box. Again depending on required accuracy of components. The higher the accuracey the long it takes to print a component. Creating 3D drawings tends to be the hold up for 3D printing but once a drawing is created producing parts are cheap, fast and easily repeated at any time. Material choices 3D printing systems do not provide a wide range of material options unlike rapid prototyping. Even though the list of materials for 3D printing is advancing, it is not as available as rapid prototyping. 3D printing is limited to PVC and other plastic materials. Nevertheless, with the advancement of technology, materials such as ceramics may fully be available for 3D printing in the future. Level of accuracy When it comes to the level of accuracy, rapid prototyping systems can produce accurate and better finishescompared to 3D printing. Although both have similar features such as the size of parts and relying on a larger degree of geometry available, rapid prototyping system utilises more advanced specific part-accuracy technology. Moreover, 3D printers are limited to producing smaller parts that can only fit in an 8-inch cube. Since 3D printers are small, they have minimal room to create accurate parts from the 3D Printing machine. With RP systems, build chambers are at least 10 inches on one side and others have 3x3x2 feet or larger. Conclusion Whether 3D printing or Rapid prototyping is being utilised, both of these technologies could be a great help to your business. It could bring greater opportunities for product development. It will also allow you to explore and check complex designs, which is a competitive advantage for growth and productivity. If you need help with your 3D printing and rapid prototyping problems, a good starting point is to reach out to a reliable manufacturer in Sydney, Australia which provides services such as 3D design and printing, mechanical designs and drafting, rapid prototyping and many more prototyping techniques.

            "answer_text": "They are both essentially the same. Rapid Prototyping was the term used when I started using the process some 16 years ago and when it was only accessible to professionals in the product development business; a rapid prototyping machine could cost \u00a350,000 (yes). It was called Rapid as the machining, vacuum forming and casting methods used to take a lot of time for the orders to be processed in the prototoype worshops: queueing to get the job started, machining, making moulds, sand blasting, finishing by hand and painting. 3D Printing came into use when the process was reached by others who wanted to make 3D parts, not just for prototyping and when the machines came down in price and became more accessible. The term is more 'user-friendly'.  ",
