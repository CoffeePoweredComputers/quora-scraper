            "answer_text": "There is no process, because there is no such thing. If you mean lead and not LED, then it\u2019s simple: They\u2019re charged using a CV/CC method: constant-current charge,topping charge andfloat charge.The constant-current charge applies the bulk of the charge and takes up roughly half of the required charge time; the topping charge continues at a lower charge current and provides saturation, and the float charge compensates for the loss caused by self-discharge. Set your charge voltage to between 2.30V and 2.45V per cell. Try to keep the battery in ambient air around 20\u201325\u00b0C. ",
