            "answer_text": "Of course 5G is quite dangerous to humans along with all other living creatures, but\u2014like cigarettes and the weed killer glyphosate (or RoundUp)\u2014it\u2019s about MONEY. Anyone else remember how Monsanto, as well as several government regulatory and oversight agencies, assured the public that Monsanto\u2019s RoundUp chemical weed killer was completely safe? Remember how anyone who said otherwise was a conspiracy theorist or \u201ccompletely uninformed\u201d or how those questioning its safety weren\u2019t chemists or biologists like the people telling us everything was okay? Well now there\u2019s a large class action lawsuit against Monsanto by many people who were harmed by glyphosate (the hazardous chemical in RoundUp) but no one\u2019s taking public responsibility for this decades-long \u201cmistake\u201d or for misinforming the public about the chemical\u2019s health risks, like cancer. It seems there have been no human studies on the health risks and safety of the massive 5G rollout, just like there weren't extensive or sufficient studies regarding the safety of many pharmaceuticals that later proved dangerous or deadly to many people who trusted the FDA to protect them. This is the same FDA that allowed the sale of cigarettes (and still does) for so decades without the now-mandatory warning on the side of the box. Most of us remember the huge lawsuit settlements (and deaths) from lung cancer but apparently that hasn\u2019t changed some minds that things like 5G are clearly dangerous to people\u2019s health before the government \u201cofficially\u201d states it to everyone. Several scientists and engineers have admitted that 5G MHz millimeter waves are extremely dangerous to birds, bees, plant life and, of course humans. But you won\u2019t hear that widely announced to the public since so much money is at stake\u2014until the lawsuits again start happening. Only then will they admit they made another mistake\u2014 at the expense of many lives. ",

            "answer_text": "We know that 5G uses the same spectrum as 2G, 3G or 4G, except for future small cell application where approximately 10x the frequency (30 GHz ) will be used. These so-called Millimeter waves have an extremely short range, and will only be used in dense urban environments through small cells with a sub 1 Watt output power. Both, common decimeter and centimeter waves and the new millimeter waves are \u201cmiles away\u201d of any hazardous electromagnetic radiation. The dangerous part of the electromagnetic spectrum starts (ironically) on the high side of visible light frequencies (UV light). Below that there are only \u201cthermal effects\u201d \u2014 ie. probes will be heated up. Total power of mobile network radiation on the receiving side is in the Milliwatt and micro watt range, that is a million times less than the power of your home microwave oven (which emits radiation inside of the same kind and frequency) Despite all the alarmist claims that have been raised by conspiracy theorists and fear-mongers since more than 30 years, no surge in mobile related diseases have been detected. The International Agency for Research on cancer (IARC), a branch of the World Health Organization (WHO), has come to the conclusion that there is no harm caused by mobile phone radiation. This was based on the Interphone study, the single large study that was conducted over a period of 10 years, and stands all criticism. All the alarmist studies that have been published on the internet and in third class journals have been shred into pieces for their bad design, selection bias, and improper conclusions. Brussels is a city in Belgium, not in Germany. The German government is developing a plan how to roll out 5G country-wide at maximum speed. Frequencies have been auctioned and allocated to 4 operators. The Brussels decision is a decision by a single city council, without mandate and authority. On EU and Belgium national level this will be (and already is) rectified. And yes, we need the features of 5G. Speed and larger data volumes are driven by the markets. At current growth LTE cannot meet the projected demands in 5 years. Also 5G responds to so many more needs: machine type communication to support utilities, eHealth, logistics, ultra-reliable communication for security applications and autonomous driving. Note that these needs all come from society and industry. The mobile industry just reacts to demands. I suggest that people inform themselves properly before just echoing empty claims from internet and social media. ",
