            "answer_text": "Yes, you can transfer the WhatsApp chats from one phone to another, provided they are of the same OS. I\u2019m not sure if you can transfer from iOS to Android or similar, but between different Android phones, it is possible to transfer. The first method is to copy everything from the WhatsApp folder in your first phone and copy to the same location on the second phone. When you install WhatsApp on the second phone, it checks if you have a backup and prompts if you wish to restore from the backup, if found. Click on restore and all your chats, images n videos should be restored. The second method is to use Google Drive as the backup medium. First enable the \u201cBackup to Google Drive\u201d option on your first phone. Do a backup manually to let WhatsApp store the backup in your Google Drive. Install WhatsApp on the second phone and select \u201cRestore from Google Drive\u201d when prompted. The same Google account needs to be used in both phones, for this to work successfully. ",

            "answer_text": "WhatsApp local backup occurs at 2am every day and saved in your phone\u2019s internal memory or external SD card for 7 days. If you\u2019d like to transfer WhatsApp messages to a new Android phone via local backup, simply refer to the following steps: Run WhatsApp on your old Android phone, go to Menu button > Settings > Chats > Chat backup > Back Up to manually back up your most recent chats.Transfer this backup to your new Android phone: a) If it is in the external SD card and your new Android also has SD-card slot, just take the card out and insert it into the new phone; b) If the backup is stored in internal memory, you will need to transfer the backup folder from your old Android to the same folder on your new phone via computer.Afterward, install WhatsApp on your new Android phone and verify the same phone number that was used to create the backup. Then tap \u201cRestore\u201d when required. Once restored, your old WhatsApp chats will appear on your new Android.",
