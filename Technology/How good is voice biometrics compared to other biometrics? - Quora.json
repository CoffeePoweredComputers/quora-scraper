            "answer_text": "I have been practising for a while now, currently in my 7th year as a Biometrics Software Developer and as a Biometrics Integrations Consultant. So far, I have not had a Company, Organization, Institution or an Individual enlist for Help with Voice Biometrics like I have done with Biometrics Fingerprint Authentication and with Facial Recognition.  In my home country, we have a Mobile Money Service known as MPesa. MPesa is a mobile money solution that was pioneered by a company called Safaricom. It is such that you can send and receive money to and from another person in their phone. Recently, the MPesa company, that is Safaricom, introduced a Voice Biometrics Authentication feature to secure their mobile money services. This is the first time I got to use and interact with Voice Biometrics for a service rendered to me. To use Voice Biometrics with Safaricom Mobile Money services, a Subscriber needs to first enroll their Voice Biometrics with the Mobile Service Provider Safaricom thru their ( subscriber's ) handset. To do this, one dials a USSD code from their phone which guides them to a step where they are asked to read aloud and repeat a given sentence 3 times. In my case I was asked to say \u201c At Safaricom my voice is my password \u201d. Once a subscriber's voice is enrolled, they are then asked to re-enter their current security PIN for accessing Mobile Money Services and the Voice Biometrics enrollment process is finalized. After that, you are now able to use Voice Biometrics Authentication feature for the following; Changing PUK of your SIM card.Bar or Unbar your lineUnlock your MPesa account, that is to unlock your Mobile Money Wallet.Check your MPesa Mobile Money Account Balance instead of using Security PINAuthorize MPesa Mobile Money Transactions instead of using Security PIN.You can use Voice Biometrics for SIM Card replacement of your line.You can use Voice Biometrics to request for a Mobile Money Wallet PIN or Start Key.The are other advantages that tag along with use of Voice Biometrics Authentication on the Safaricom's Mobile Money Service Platform like e.g. if you have activated the Voice Biometrics Authentication on the Safaricom\u2019s Mobile Network, no one can steal your phone and use it to withdraw your cash from a Mobile Money Shop even if they cunningly mispresented themselves with all your Identification Documents and PINs. I could say, voice Biometrics was the best for use in the scenario in which the Teleco company, Safaricom adopted it for its Know Your Customer ( KYC ) in a bid to streamline its service delivery to its estimated over 20 million subscribers. Other Significant Advantages of Voice Biometrics in comparison to other Biometrics Authentication systems as used by the Teleco Safaricom company are, Voice Biometrics is less costly to implement and roll out in terms of Hardware Costs. No specialized equipment and devices are required for client side Biometrics Enrollment. In the case of Safaricom, they only used Subscribers's handsets.Voice Biometrics is less costly to implement in terms of Hiring Personnel to Enrol Subjects because Subjects will enroll themselves with little or no help from Company implementing Biometrics Solution.Little training or none is required as simple audio recorded or typed instructions from website help guide Subscribers on how to proceed with Biometrics Enrollment Process.No Specialized or Additional Biometrics Software is required for Client side Biometrics Enrollment Process.Quick and Easy to Enroll a Subject's Biometrics Data. Many Subscribers can enroll their Biometric Data at the same time at different locations and geographical regions.That is just about it. I hope you find this answer resourceful ",

            "answer_text": "The different forms of biometric are facial scans, fingerprints, iris scans, hand geometry, and voice recognition. The most preferred form of biometric identification is Voice recognition and this form of authentication engenders less resistance from users than other biometric forms of security because its easy to use and also non-intrusive. And people prefer familiarity and convenience while selecting a biometric technology.  In Voice Biometric Authentication, one needs to understand this kind of biometrics and the key difference between voice/speech recognition - which is a system's ability to process \"what a person is saying\" - and speaker verification, \"technology based on individual vocal physiology and behavior to validate a claim of identity.\" There is a difference between speaker recognition and speech recognition (recognizing what is being said). These two terms are very confusing, as is voice recognition. Voice recognition essentially means speaker, and thus not speech recognition. Voice recognition technology is possible after making a digital model of an individual's voice that can serve as a stored profile or template of that voiceprint. Words and phrases are broken down into various kinds of frequency patterns that, taken together, describe someone's unique way of speaking. There are some challenges that affect their accuracy. These include poor-quality voice samples; the variability in a speaker's voice due to illness, mood, changes over time; background noise as the caller interacts with the system; and changes in the call's technology. However, the voice does have some advantages, the user doesn\u2019t need a scanner, such as for iris and fingerprint recognition. It has a higher level of user acceptance. As far as accuracy is concerned, voice is no less secure than fingerprints, retina, or facial recognition. Essentially, voice is both reliable and convenient not having to be concerned with poor lighting or residues. It can also be used remotely over the telephone, it is particularly suitable for authenticating callers to a contact center. ",
