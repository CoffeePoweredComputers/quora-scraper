            "answer_text": "Undoubtedly the financials are strong and over 52% market share in domestic market. Owing to these, it trades at significantly premium price. Market cap of Asian Paints is above 1,00,000 crs. Indian Paint industry size is approx. 50,000 crs which is growing at around 10% rate. Indian players are trading at 3\u20136 times their Annual Sales, while global biggies are trading at around 2 times their annual sales. When the size is already so big and market size is not growing exponentially, it becomes difficult for a big company to turn out a multibagger. It will at all time give you decent profit and dividend, but expecting huge return may not be sensible. ",
