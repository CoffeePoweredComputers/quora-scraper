            "answer_text": "In general I find that Linux makes better use of free RAM for disk caching that does Windows. I find that having at least 512M for each processor core of the CPU, and having 1G per core is better. If you are using integrated motherboard graphics, then adding another gig is a good idea. Unless you have 32 or more core CPU, 128G of RAM is 2 to 4 times more than you need. One exception to this is if you are running a large database server, which can often utilize much more RAM to avoid creating temporary tables when creating large joins. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming you say 128GB of RAM, you can use it: to increase storage speed. Some technologies (like ZFS) can use RAM to improve storage speed.to host multiple VM. If you have a lot of RAM, you can use multiple OS at the same time using virtual machines. For example, you can run Windows on top of OSX or Linux. Having a lot of RAM would be required if you plan to use multiples VM at the same time.However, adding RAM on a PC which doesn\u2019t reach memory limit doesn\u2019t make really sense if you are not planning to increase memory usage.
