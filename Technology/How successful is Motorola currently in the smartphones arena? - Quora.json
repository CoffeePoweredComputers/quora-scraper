            "answer_text": "Motorola they were the pioneer of this mobile industry and also radio , waki taki and few other electronic gadgets . Then Motorola bought it in 12.5 billion in 2011 and then lenovo bought it in 3 billion dollar on 2014. Google had to bought it to save it's Android system because many of Android features were borrowed from Motorola and they were suing a huge plenty . Right now after aquaring by lenovo . It's in declining stage only. Moto g6 was a disaster due to his price. They launched one good smartphone moto one. Other than that their is no great news . Actually in my personal opinion I love Motorola phones they are providing security updates of moto g5 even now. They think of both software and hardware. Not just hardware like some other companies. But after sales services it's still sucks. ",
