            "answer_text": "Depends how it's approached. Homesteading can be a never ending money pit if you're not careful. Years ago, we were empty nesters looking to start a new chapter in our lives. Decided we wanted to get off the crazy train of the suburbian lifestyle and live more independently & economically. But not being totally committed to a lifestyle we were unfamiliar with, we chose to lease a small home on 12 acres. There's an old 3 sided barn, corrals, basic barbed wire perimeter fence, & an amazingly gracious owner. Number one rule we set for ourselves was that every animal we get has to serve a purpose, earn their keep. So we started with hens for eggs. They're free-ranged, so for 8 months of the year they get 80% of their food from the land. I wanted goats, so we bought 4 pygmy goats, bred them, then sold the sire & 6 kids; which covered the cost of additional fencing and a year's worth of feed. The now free goat milk is a bonus. The goats share a 2acre paddock with a recently added pair of American Guinea Hogs. The goats eat the weeds & woody growth, the AGHs graze on the grasses & a little rooting. We're expecting our first litter of piglets soon, some will be sold to cover feed cost & the rest put in the freezer (a year's worth of pork). We didn't want to invest in a tractor so we let a friend run a few young steers on the acreage. In addition to free pasture maintenance & manure (fertilizer), we keep one of the steers when he takes them to sell in the fall. We finish our steer with 4 weeks on grain then into the freezer\u2026 600lbs of beef for the cost of a month's feed. In fall, we grow out 100 meat chickens, they eat about 50% grain, 50% free-range. The last month they're contained in a 60x60ft area. We process them ourselves in October and have a year's worth of chicken in the freezer. The chickens scratched & ate all the grass from the pen and left it well turned & manured. We cover the area in old hay for the winter & it's ready for planting veggies in the spring. Early fall, after harvest, the next batch of meat chickens are put in the pen to prep next year's garden. We have meat rabbits we breed a couple times a year. We sell a few & put the rest in the freezer. We also harvest their manure year around for the gardens. Speaking of gardens\u2026 it's amazing how much produce you can get from a 3500 sq ft garden. I quickly learned to can, pickle, freeze, & dehydrate our harvests. Now, this is a LOT of food for just two people. So we split our bounty with our two grown kids & their families. Summary, We lease a rural home, barn, & 12 acres for LESS than our suburbia mortgage. We raise our own all natural, non-medicated chicken, pork, beef, & rabbit. We sell animals from each breeding to offset the cost of feed & care. We bargain for pasture \u201cmowing\u201d & our beef steer. We grow & preserve a lot of produce for year round use. We don't make a profit, hubby still has full time career. But by being cautious and following a plan, our homestead supplements the food cost of THREE families. So yes, we save a LOT of money.  ",

            "answer_text": "Homesteading is saving us lots of money. We eat a lot of eggs. To make our own free-range, pasture fed eggs costs us very little in grain, and we sell the excess eggs at my husband\u2019s workplace. Doing this, our own eggs are free as the money we make more than pays for their food. We have just started with meat rabbits, so far with 3 does and a buck we have 20 x 4 week old babies and 15 more new babies just born in the last 24 hours.  These rabbits will be ready to harvest at 12 weeks old - if they continue at the rate we are going, we will have 15\u201320 rabbits per month for our table. They cost us about $20/month to feed. We have a dairy goat that costs us nothing, but supplies all our milk. We have 4 sheep that we got for free as lambs, they are to go off to freezer camp at the end of the year. In the meantime, they eat grass and cost us nothing. Our vegetable garden is mostly grown from seed, so I can raise 50 plants for less than $5. Our garden is fertilised by the manure from our animals, for free. With good food preserving skills, some bartering and selling of your produce, homesteading will save you money. Many homesteaders also make money on the side with online ventures, like blogs, courses and ebooks. I have an article on my blog about making money from your homestead if you are interested: 52 Ways To Make Money Homesteading | Making A Profit From Your Backyard I think homesteading is a mindset, and you can do it no matter where you are.
