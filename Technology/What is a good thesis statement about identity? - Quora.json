            "answer_text": "Identity can be pretty broadly applied across several areas. I would look at the news to get some of the big topics in the world today. For personal identity: have a look at trans gender. This could centre around identity as a gender. Many studies in gender span all the way back through history so a look at the views from cross dressing all the way through to complete gender reassignment. There are a lot of support charities out there as well that I'm sure would be willing to aid you in conducting primary research. National identity: many countries in the west are seeing an increase in nationalism due to immigration. An in depth look at migration to see the levels and whether those emigrating wish to retain their citizenship or naturalise to their new country would be a good basis. Reactions of people show raw facts could be a basis for opinions on people's identity or views of the identity of others. Again looking through history to find comparisons of the current situation could give it a good grounding and give a good point for start of a change. Important historical background could be the U.S. Revolution or the later years of the Western Roman Empire. Religious identity: Following on from the previous point a look at modern religious identity could be a fruitful area of research. With a perceived increase in those with religious convictions becoming polarised or extreme it could lead to an interesting area of study. The identity of a person as formed by a religion as opposed to the view from the outside. Obviously this would involve a certain amount of theological research but priests, rabbis and imams (as well as other religious leaders) are well known for having an open door policy to discuss such issues meaning a little leg work could provide a wide body of research to draw from. Yourself: something that would be interesting would be studying your identity and what it means. Eg. I am white, male, heterosexual and British. So I would take each denominator and try to find out what they are and whether I should be identifying with those labels or not. The strength of those convictions being a good area to focus on. Does the research change your view or reinforce it? In which case how can we change our own identities through education and research. I hope the spread of topics is of use to you! ",

            "answer_text": "Your identity is the sum of who you are, thus meaning that there are many different parts of you that culminate in that summation. Therefore, making an identity statement is making and taking a clear, unambiguous, and evidence-based CLARIFICATION - through self-determination, self-definition and self-expression- of who you are and that you want other people to accept and respect about yourself; regardless of their views. Clearly because you are the most qualified expert on yourself to define yourself; and not other people, no matter how qualified they think they are to define you. I think therefore that an identity statement highlights the different parts to you and zeros in on your most important identity to which the research is dedicated. This may be your gender, ethnicity, faith or lack of faith, political, economic, or social ideology. So, initial clear, concise and intelligible clarification of the identity is critical to declaration of an identity. Not least because your identity is meant for people to be able to clearly tell you or your position apart from everyone else\u2019s.Although identity can be both impersonal (out of your choice or hands by reason of birth or history) and personal (your own conscious choice) it still has to be REITERATED and JUSTIFIED. Hence the whole point of the research. Not to persuade or convince people who make nothing of it because they don\u2019t understand it or think it is bizarre, embarrassing, and outdated, but rather to ask them to respect it, nonetheless, as the identity is intelligent and meaningful to the person or people who embrace it. All things being equal, the validity of your research findings commands that respect for your particular identity statement or declaration. Good luck. ",
