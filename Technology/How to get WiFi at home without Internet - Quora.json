            "answer_text": "How can I get WiFi at home without Internet? Quite simply: you buy a WIFi router and plug it in. You now have a WiFI network for your home or apartment. The speed of the network will depend on the WiFI standard your WiFI router and user device support. The 802.11ac is now common and cheap. 802.11ax is the newest, but can get quite expensive. If at some later date you wish to connect to the internet, you just connect your WiFi router to the modem or router provided by the ISP. Most will designate a specific port for that connection. ",
