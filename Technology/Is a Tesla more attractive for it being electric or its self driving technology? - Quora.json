            "answer_text": "For me, initially, it was neither. FIRST REACTION: My first introduction to the car was when my son bought one. The moment I sat inside it was **WOW** - the kind of Zen simplicity of the thing was very enticing to me - the continuous swoop of glass from front to back. The UI/UX of the display carries that through - soft, understated grey tones - with an occasional pop of blue (and VERY rarely red) conveys a feeling of relaxation. Then of course it does 0\u201360 in an amount of time that practically rips your face off! However, for some people - that\u2019s the thing: The whole calmness of the experience is the thing they hate the most. (Or at least the thing they THINK they\u2019ll hate the most - because I think the concern at not having a bazillion physical controls and ridiculous engine noise is WAY over-stated). SECOND REACTION: After that first impression - it was the quiet effortlessness of the ride - it\u2019s very fast - but that feels almost incidental. WHAT I FEEL NOW: I ordered my car with full-self-driving (which my son\u2019s car doesn\u2019t have) and that was right about the time when the capabilities of that software was just starting to ramp up. So that was something that\u2019s definitely grown up with me. Initially, I had lane-centering steering and adaptive cruise control. Now I can summon across a parking lot - the car will totally drive itself on freeways - it can auto-steer on any road with passable kerbs or centerline stripes - it\u2019s added stoplight/sign behavior - so it\u2019ll stop at a red light or stop sign and drive right through a green light\u2026and it slows automatically through school zones. It\u2019s also able to autonomously save you from near-certain accidents\u2026which is very cool. I recently drove 600 freeway miles without having to take over driving from the car even once (except when turning off the freeway to charge). It passes slow cars - handles freeway interchanges - copes with road-works - merges into traffic - slows to allow other cars to move into it\u2019s lane. Just about EVERYTHING. Some things were unexpectedly good - the frequent software updates are very, very cool. Every few weeks (typically) there is a software update. The car notifies my phone and it\u2019s almost like Xmas! Ooohhh! What new shiny gift did I get TODAY? So you tell the car to accept the update (using your phone) and 20 minutes later it goes *bing!* and you can read the update notes\u2026what go better in my car today? Mostly it\u2019s minor stuff - a new video game or that the car now speaks portugese - but often it\u2019s neat new things. Watching it slowly take baby-steps from noticing traffic signals to noticing how they are lit to warning you to stop - to actually stopping - to NOT stop when the lights are green\u2026every new release gets just a bit closer.

            "answer_text": "Probably neither. It\u2019s electric but the goal was to be better than other cars in its class, not just electric ones. So if I hadn\u2019t been looking specifically for an EV, I probably would have gotten one anyway, especially considering that electric makes it far more convenient and cheaper to operate. Since I did want electric, Tesla was my top choice, and it came down to what features it had. I looked into Tesla and ruled it out because of its ADAS features. I wanted at least ACC, which the car did not have back in early 2014. Then my car got totaled, I needed a replacement, and I ordered a Model S despite the lack of that feature. When I first got it, I missed the lack of ACC, but I also knew that my car had mysterious hardware that Tesla had yet to announce, and it wasn\u2019t hard to guess that I would have ACC added at some point. It turned out that I got a lot more, including all of Autopilot, which works far better than I had expected and does far more than I had expected. Tesla is still not self driving. My Model 3 has the self driving hardware and will have the software when it\u2019s available. It is far more capable than what my Model S can do. It\u2019s more aware of what\u2019s going on around the car, can initiate lane changes on its own, can change from one freeway to another, take the appropriate exit, and now recognizes traffic control devices on local streets. For practical purposes, until FSD is there, the intermediate steps are fun toys, but if I had to initiate every lane change on my own, and had to stop at red lights and stop signs on my own, it would hardly be a big deal. The car isn\u2019t really saving me from any of the fatigue of long drives, as it is with the more fundamental parts of autopilot. It does, in theory, give me more safety. It\u2019s theoretically more capable of detecting what\u2019s in my blind spot, including seeing a car far down another lane that the older hardware would miss. But I\u2019m supposed to check what\u2019s in the next lane anyway. The other advantage is that if I\u2019m not familiar with an area, using a navigator works, but sometimes by the time I hear it tell me that I need to take the next exit, getting to that lane could be an issue. Since the car will get me to the proper lane ahead of time, I\u2019m not going to miss an exit due to not paying attention to the navigator. If I didn\u2019t expect Tesla to improve the software until it\u2019s capable of self driving, and I had to pay for the current level of automation, I wouldn\u2019t find it compelling enough that I\u2019d pay extra compared to the original autopilot if I had other uses for the money. But the free Autopilot that now comes with the car does less than the original autopilot. Getting the car with nothing added would give me far more than I had on my \u201cmust have\u201d list before I owned a Tesla. I won\u2019t be able to give a complete answer until the FSD software is released, and right now, the biggest obstacle I see is bad drivers who will intentionally do things that they aren\u2019t supposed to, such as trying to block you when they see that you are changing lanes. Since you are supposed to signal well in advance, that gives other drivers the opportunity to bully a self driving car. ",
