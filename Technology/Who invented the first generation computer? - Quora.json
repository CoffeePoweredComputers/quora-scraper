            "answer_text": "The very first, first generation computers were all one-offs built for government or educational projects, such as ABC, Colossus, ENIAC, and Manchester Baby. Atanasoff\u2013Berry (1942) \u2014 first electronic digital computer (not programmable, not Turing complete), used to solve differential equations.Colossus (1943) \u2014 first programmable, electronic digital computer (special purpose, not Turing complete), used to decrypt the Lorenz cipher.ENIAC (1945) \u2014 first general purpose, programmable, electronic digital computer (Turing complete). Both the Colossus and ENIAC were initially programmed using plug boards and switches, and required rewiring to change the program. The ENIAC was converted to using a stored program (using read-only memory) in 1948.Manchester Baby aka Small Scale Experimental Machine (1948) was the first electronic digital computer to run its program from the same memory as data (Von Neumann architecture architecture). It was followed by the Manchester Mark 1 (see below).The UNIVAC I (UNIVersal Automatic Computer I) was the first commercial mainframe computer produced in the United States, in March, 1951. It was designed principally by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the inventors of the ENIAC. Design work was started by their company, Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC), and was completed after the company had been acquired by Remington Rand (which later became part of Sperry, now Unisys). The UNIVAC I had 5000 vacuum tubes, and 1000 12-bit words (1500 bytes) of memory using mercury delay lines. It also had up to 10 magnetic tape drives.  UNIVAC I However the world\u2019s first commercial mainframe computer was the the Ferranti Mark 1 in the United Kingdom, a commercialized version of the Manchester Mark 1, and delivered in February, 1951, a month before the UNIVAC. It had 4000 vacuum tubes (valves in the UK), and 512 20-bit words (1280 bytes) of memory using electrostatic Williams tubes. IBM made a number of first generation computers in the 1950s, including the IBM 650, IBM 701 etc. According to this list, there were 104 different vacuum tube computers produced between 1942 and 1963. The early relay computers could also be included here (Z3, Harvard Mark 1). ",

            "answer_text": "A Polish mathematician named Rejewski laid the groundwork for computing in the early 1930s when he was working on breaking codes used by other European military organizations to transmit secret or sensitive information. As WWII heated up, that knowledge was shared with UK\u2019s intelligence services MI5 and came under the astute management of Alan Turing, one of Britain\u2019s finest 20th century human products, and most unfortunately for him and the rest of humanity, an individual later broken and discarded by homophobia. Turing combined his brilliant analytic mind along with some rather sharp postal workers who had designed a card-punch sorting system to deliver London\u2019s mail, and together they produced the world\u2019s first generation computer, in secret, as a military weapon against fascism. Chinese toy makers came within an inch of achieving the same breakthrough but failed to make the leap to practical applications, probably because the right amount of anxiety had not been applied at the right time. For Rejewski, Turing and his postal worker associates, the big push came when WWII German military devised the Enigma Machine, a cryptographic scrambler to which the German\u2019s believed could not be broken as a code. They were wrong, and the modern computer was born. Many, many things changed between then (1940\u20131944) and today to bring us our PCs and cell phones, but the basic 0 1 code format remains unchanged as do a number of other basic codes concepts that quietly run behind the colorful interface of every Windows or Apple machine. Polish and British minds combined under immense pressure to produce a cybering machine and succeeded so well, they created a machine that would change our lives forever. ",
