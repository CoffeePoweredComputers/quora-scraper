            "answer_text": "First thing I\u2019d assume that, if you\u2019re comparing an Atom (I\u2019d assume there\u2019s an 8 core Atom in your smartphone) with your x86 laptop then the answer is: No. Even with the same instruction set architecture (x86), your phone\u2019s performance is nowhere comparable with your desktop. Because Atoms are basically stripped-down version of laptop processor with even more seriously power-saving. Therefore the smartphone\u2019s processor\u2019s peformance cannot cope with the desktop one. Second thing I\u2019d assume, if you\u2019re comparing an ARM-powered processor, then the answer may be a little more complicated. There\u2019s thing called big.LITTLE. Those processors (essentially SoCs) incorporate 4 powerful cores together with 4 power-efficient cores. So there you go, 8 cores. Manufacturers often advertise \u201c8 cores\u201d smartphone and make us believe that it would be more powerful. Somewhat true. 4 powerful cores do computing-intensive tasks, while the 4 remaining do background tasks, given that tasks are perfectly parallel-izable. But with smartphones that only have 4 powerful cores only, their battery life is shorter, and may be less-powerful. Compared to laptop, I\u2019d say they could match, but most time no. If the story is not about big.LITTLE, such as those Mediatek\u2019s True Octa-core processors, then I\u2019d say the performance could be equal in some specific tasks, and generally worse, or less powerful than your laptop is. Imagine you can do a job with both hand very fast, or you can utilize your foots too but slower. That\u2019s where the comparision comes in. Besides that, there is an important factor regards to your laptop\u2019s CPU. There are tons of dual core 2.6 GHz mobile processors. The performance of your smartphone\u2019s SOC is comparable with ~2007 CPU with LINPACK if I remembered correctly. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: no one knows. Longer answer: the performance of a CPU isn't just a result of its frequency and its number of cores. At all.As an example, take the AMD FX Series (for example, the FX-8350) against the Intel i5 series (haswell or skylake). In games, the second one will largely outperform the first one, even though it has a lower frequency and less cores. Why? Because of its architecture. I won't go into details because I simply couldn't (the specifics of hardware has never been my thing), but things like the litography (in nanometers) of the CPU play a huge role. In short, you can never guess a CPU's performance from its clock speed and number of cores only. ",
