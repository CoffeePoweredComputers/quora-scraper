            "answer_text": "Hello, RCM i.e. reverse charge mechansim hasn't been removed from GST. Rcm under CGST comes through the following two sections, its alike in IGST law: Section 9(3)of CGST or 5(3) of IGST - it talks about the RCM applicable on supply of goods or services or both which are notified by the department stating that RCM is applicable on it. Section 9(4) of CGST or 5(4) of IGST- it talks about the RCM applicable on supply of goods or services or both from an unregistered person to a registered person. Now, the question that whether RCM has been removed from GST. The department has deferred/stopped the applicability of section 9(4)/ 5(4) till March 2018. Hereby, meaning that only the RCM on supplies from an unregistered person to a registered person is not alive now and will be getting it's shape in March 2018. However, the applicability of section 9(3)/ 5(3) is still alive and RCM is applicable on the notified supply of goods or services or both. ",
