            "answer_text": "Hi, You asked, What influences you to make good choices? My answer is all the wonderful books I\u2019ve read, all the wonderful people I have met, including the people in my family, all the experiences I\u2019ve had, bad and good, all the information I have got from the internet. To give you an example of Family Advice I Am Grateful For\u2026  At challenging times, I have able to turn to your family for advice, precedent and example? Compiled below are some examples. My mother\u2019s example... Besides being a great writer (you can read one of her poems here), my mother was a model of compassion, generosity, kindheartedness and sacrifice. So the best advice she gave me was the example she set. My mother was everything to me growing up and I can totally relate to this quote from Susie Bright: I'm a Mommy's Girl - the strongest influence in my young life was my mom. Wise words to one immigrant sister from another... When I first came to this country, it was tough going. I didn\u2019t know how to cook. I didn\u2019t know how to drive. I didn\u2019t know how to do laundry. I didn\u2019t have job-ready skills like Microsoft Word & Excel. I was overwhelmed. To calm me down, the sister closest to me in age said \u201cthink of yourself as a tourist in this country- you can go back at any time\u201d It was sound advice because I was suffering from all the things that go with making a change. What Anatole France describes as follows: All changes, even the most longed for, have their melancholy; for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves; we must die to one life before we can enter another. When the best advice was to prioritize... When I was feeling low at one point of time and was distraught because I did not know what to focus on, one of my 4 sisters said to me \u201cPay attention to the one thing that is bothering you the most and ignore everything else\u201d. The prescription really helped. In telling me to do this, my sister was wisely echoing these words from Denis Waitley, who said: Don't be a time manager, be a priority manager. Cut your major goals into bite-sized pieces. Each small priority or requirement on the way to an ultimate goal become a mini goal in itself. Or these words from Russell M Nelson: Your life will be a blessed and balanced experience if you first honor your identity and priority. Reading: an asset you may not be aware of... There was a time I was between jobs. I was visiting with my oldest sis and told her about all the personal finance books I was reading. She said \u201cyou should put this on your resume\u201d. Ever since that pronouncement, I came to see my reading not just as a hobby, but as a strength. I began to dip into the books I read for ideas and topics, especially for my blog. I discovered I could attract new readers to my blog just because of a book I\u2019ve read and blogged about. Case in point: Wabi Sabi Simple. I read and did a post on it. Because of this post, a new reader (and regular visitor) started coming to my blog. So thanks to the one in our family we refer to as Mother Superior. As Russell Banks aptly said: But really, it was reading that led me to writing. And in particular, reading the American classics like Twain who taught me at an early age that ordinary lives of ordinary people can be made into high art. Stop trading, start investing... Once, I went to my B-I-L for investing advice. My head was full of theories like the Dogs of the Dow theory. He said been there, done that, handed me the Morning Star Mutual Funds Binder and gently advised me that index funds were the way to go. Like all novice investors, I did not heed this advice initially, though I did eventually (after some trading flare outs). Was it James M. Barrie who said - Life is a long lesson in humility? Analysis paralysis... Another B-I-L continuously spouts so much wisdom, it\u2019s kind of hard to settle on just one piece of advice from him to talk about, but I\u2019ll pick one. At one time, when I was battling a depression (you can read about it here), he suggested I get out of my head, stop reading so many books, and stop over analyzing things so much. At the time he said this, it was excellent advice and this quote by Karen Horney is the same advice clothed in different words: Fortunately analysis is not the only way to resolve inner conflicts. Life itself remains a very effective therapist. The Linus Pauling and Lance Armstrong of My Life... I valued my Madison, Wi sis and her hubby for their examples. In sis\u2019 case, it was her intellectual curiosity. Healthy curiosity is a wonderful character trait. With it, you acquire knowledge, grow in wisdom and dig up tons of stimulating blog material. Heck,yes! And besides, satisfying one\u2019s curiosity is a pleasure in itself. Of course, I am not the only one who thinks so and here\u2019s Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling for you: Satisfaction of one's curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness in life. In the B-I-L\u2019s case, it\u2019s the example he has set of leading a full life, where in addition to a long career as a statistical analyst, he taught at the University, played and reviewed War Games, enjoyed the best wines and cigars, wrote freelance articles, and more. He has never let anything get in the way of living an abundant life. Oh no! He is blessed with the same verve and spirit that Lance Armstrong displayed when he said: Through my illness I learned rejection. I was written off. That was the moment I thought, Okay, game on. No prisoners. Everybody's going down. Mr Fix-it... To me, the Trident chap (the B-I-L who had a business under that name) was Mr. Fix-it. If he saw a problem, he was not the kind of person who looked the other way and tried to go about his business. On the other hand, he gravitated towards problems and solving them. Being both a business and engineering whiz, he came up with inspired solutions as well. His attitude can be summed up by this quote attributed to Henry Ford: Don't find fault, find a remedy. And last but not least... How to be a Compassionate, Non-Judgmental, Ever-Giving and Ever-Loving Human Being This I learned from my brother David (who else) - whom I feel absolutely blessed to have in our family. I am sure all who have been on the receiving end of his kindness can relate to that - and also agree with me, the world needs more people who can be kind like David! Now, having said that, growing up, he did bully me quite a bit! But this is because we were close in age, and as Joe Williams puts it: Everybody has fights with their sister. ",
