            "answer_text": "It is expensive because it delivers a new form factor that previously wasn\u2019t possible at that price point\u2014it also packs acceptably powerful chipsets and 12 GB of RAM. My phone doesn\u2019t even have 12 GB of RAM and it is a relatively new device. The newest and grandest gadgets of all grandeur are always insanely expensive. It comes with the territory. If it is out of your budget, the positive thing to think about is that this form factor will become cheaper and more accessible within the next two years to a point where anyone who has saved up some money should be able to get their hands on one. I\u2019m hoping to see the competition of other companies drive the price down with similar offerings in 2020. It\u2019s an exciting time to be alive. ",

            "answer_text": "Samsung has been working on the concept of folding phone or flexible screen for quite some time now. After all the R&D, they now have a retail worthy device. They've spent a lot of time and money on the research and to be honest, they are first company to offer such a phone. So, its time to cash in the hard work. Since this is a new technology, and Samsung is the only company manufacturing it, there is no competition. No competition means Samsung can price the phone at their own convenience. Plus, the phone offers flagship hardware\u2014so naturally the cost will go high. Also, you get two device in one phone\u2014a phone and a tablet. Other companies, such a Huawei are also in the process of developing a foldable screen phone. I hope this answers your question. ",

            "answer_text": "Few reasons: It's a new piece of tech, the selling price has to somehow cover the R&D cost they have been doing the past few yearsIt contains 2 pieces of screens, 1 in front, 1 inside. Screen is one of the most costly part of a phone (I'm talking only about hardware here - not the intellectual properties)Right now only Samsung who has such foldable phone (Royole and Lenovo have as well but different model), since no /less competition yet, why have to price lowly and get low margin if you can see high price with high margin?",

            "answer_text": "One main reason is the fact that making the phone is expensive. It's a new area in display technology, and Samsung has spent a lot on developing and researching on their foldable phone. So, they need a return on their investment. Hence, they price the phone really high. Future models should have lower price. ",
