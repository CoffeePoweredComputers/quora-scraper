            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat are the effects of the Clean Air Act?\u201d I\u2019ll tell you one that I have noticed in my lifetime. I used to fly from Arizona to Los Angeles from my Dad\u2019s house to see my Grandmother. Flying into Los Angeles when I was a kid, you could see the smog as thick as soup. It looked like dirty brown fog, and it was always there, and always really thick. It\u2019s gone now. No more smog in LA. I mean, they used to joke about it all the time on the late night shows, like the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, yeah? Every night, he would do a joke about how thick the smog was in LA. It\u2019s gone now. When you fly into LA now, it\u2019s sunny blue skies all the time, except when it\u2019s cloudy or something. So I don\u2019t know about the science, I guess it says we did a good job, but I can tell you from personal experience, you used to be able to see the air in LA and now you can\u2019t. In my lifetime, it went from horrible to beautiful. ",
