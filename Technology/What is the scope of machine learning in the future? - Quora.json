            "answer_text": "The use cases machine learning can play a role in are seemingly unlimited but what's the future of this fascinating field? Where is it going? Machine learning is currently one of the hottest topic in IT. The reason stems from the seemingly unlimited use cases in which machine learning can play a role, from fraud detection to self-driving cars to identifying your \"gold card\" customers to price prediction. Five possible predictions here are: 1. Quantum ComputingQuantum computers will likely be very good at manipulating high-dimensional vectors in large tensor product spaces. It is likely that both the development of both supervised and unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithms will hugely increase the number of vectors and their dimensions exponentially more quickly than classical algorithms. 2. Better Unsupervised AlgorithmsUnsupervised learning occurs when no labels are given to the learning algorithm. It is left on its own to find structure in the input data. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself, such as discovering hidden patterns in data, or a means towards an end, often called feature learning. 3. Collaborative LearningCollaborative learning is about utilizing different computational entities so that they collaborate in order to produce better learning results than they would have achieved on their own. An example of this would be utilizing the nodes of an IoT sensor network, or what is called edge analytics.  4. Deeper PersonalizationPersonalization can be great, but it can also be equally annoying. We have all experienced recommendations that seem to bear no actual relation to anything that we may actually be interested in.  5. Cognitive ServicesThis technology includes kit like APIs and services through which developers can create more discoverable and intelligent applications. Machine learning APIs will allow developers to introduce intelligent features such as emotion detection; speech, facial, and vision recognition; and language and speech understanding into their applications.

            "answer_text": "Machine learning is a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which enables the computer algorithms to learn and interpret without being programmed to do so. By learning from the data and information, the system is able to automatically change and improve its algorithms. The learning algorithm enables the system to identify and build predictive models on the basis of observed data. One of the goals of machine learning is to get useful predictions and not perfect ones. Machine Learning practices are applied in sectors such as Education, Banking and Finance, Security systems, Medicals, and so on. Sectors where ML will be used in futures - Quantum Computing: As the applications of Machine Learning increase in the future, there is a need to adapt to the fast-paced environment too. Most practices of Machine Learning require the high processing power of computers. That is why we believe Quantum Computing could be important for the future. It is the process of employing Quantum Mechanics phenomena to achieve results. It is said that the use of Quantum Computing could reduce the power consumption of machines by 1000 times. The intersection of Machine Learning and Quantum Computing gives rise to Quantum Machine Learning. While Machine Learning is capable of performing operations on large amounts of data, Quantum Machine Learning will help systems to operate with more intelligence. Automated bots: Some of us use Siri or Google Tals. Some of us have used any other automated conservation. Now, these are software applications that use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning skills. With the application of the same skills, devices are developed for the purpose of assisting us. But we have been expecting the arrival of robots which could perform these functions for us. There could be some speculations revolving around, stating that the introduction of more automated robots could wipe out jobs in customer service. But, the truth is with any technological advancement, the world gets accustomed to it. We can see a future where machines and men could live in union and harmony. The introduction of automated robots could lead to practical applications of their own. Social Media: Right from personalized news feeds to better ad targeting, social media platforms are using machine learning for the benefit of both parties. Here are few such examples from your social media that are nothing but its applications. Machine learning is focused on understanding experiences. You often get recommendations to connect with certain people. These recommendations are provided on the basis of your profile visits, interests, workplace/college, etc. You upload a picture with your friend and Facebook instantly recognizes him/her. Facebook notices the unique features and matches them with your friend list. At the backend, the entire process is complicated but at the front end, it is a simple application of machine learning. Improved Unsupervised Algorithms: It is one of the applications of ML that you can witness in the coming days. Being used in multiple industries, improved unsupervised ML algorithms will certainly shape the future of Machine Learning. Machine Learning makes use of unsupervised algorithms for analyzing the results. Using these, Machine Learning makes predictions from the datasets when only input data is available without any corresponding output variables. Enhanced Personalization: Using Machine Learning algorithms to render enhanced personalization is an important ML application that is worth noticing. Machine Learning personalization algorithms are used to offer product recommendations to customers. ML algorithms read customers\u2019 patterns and behavior based on which they draw relevant conclusions regarding people\u2019s interests. Companies use Machine Learning techniques to know about a person\u2019s browsing activity on an online retail website. Using this information, companies send product recommendations such as personalized emails and messages to their targeted prospects. ML techniques help in understanding consumers\u2019 likes and dislikes which keeps them hooked to your services and products. ",
