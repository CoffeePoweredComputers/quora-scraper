            "answer_text": "G morning, First allow me to say that I have seen all kinds of things, more so now, with all the big boys working with skeleton crews. Am amazed the internet is still up and running, the only reason why that is so, is so people don\u2019t go crazy coping with covid\u2026 in a nutshell. Need to keep the masses entertained somehow. Now\u2026 With that out of the way, would of been nice to know if you are referring to a search result on first page on G? that is no longer there? that is normal. Other posts become more relevant with more authority and the one you saw in first page is now on 2nd, 5th\u2026 you get my drift. So it did not disappeared is just no longer in the place it was. Everyday normal. If you are referring to a search result no matter in what position? Yes still possible but that can be a number of factors about that specific post that G \u201chides\u201d and the reasons can be endless. Which to be honest way to early for me to name them all and am sure will forget a few, for that you can read G terms and conditions for posts and how they get ranked so on and so forth. Hope I answered it, coffee barely kicking in. If not hope there are more answers already with better info or same, which ever the case? Wish you a great day! ",
