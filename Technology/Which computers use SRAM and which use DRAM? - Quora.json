            "answer_text": "Any machine capable of being classified as a \"computer\" (from some toys to mobile phones to supercomputers) use both DRAM and SRAM somewhere within the memory hierarchy. Only the simplest of electronics may have SRAM only. The difference of SRAM and DRAM is specifically in the design of the storage array; what physical circuit is used to store each bit of data.  If measured based on cost per bit basis DRAM is more economical, but SRAM is much more adaptable and can be embedded onto a CPU for example in small amounts. Due to the cost advantage DRAM is used where-ever possible and SRAM is used where other design factors take precedence. ",
