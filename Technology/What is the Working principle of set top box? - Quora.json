            "answer_text": "The set-top box contains a tuner, that tuner decodes the broadcast signal and decodes it in to a format that can be output to a television.Set-top boxes perform functions that can't be or are not normally done in TVs themselves.The most common function not provided in TVs is tuning satellite broadcasts and cable TV broadcasts (although many European TVs can tune cable as well).The main function that set-top boxes provide is to provide subscriber management functions. Pay TV content is normally encrypted or scrambled to stop customers getting content for free, the STB device needs to decrypt the content and it receives 'entitlements' from the operator based on the customers subscriptions.A bonus function that STBs provide to operators is managing the order and appearance of the programme guide. There is significant value to channels for their position in the programme guide (and/or channel number). Interactivity and value added services are also sale-able features.",
