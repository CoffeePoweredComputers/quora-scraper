            "answer_text": "Interconnections \u2013 Radia Perlman This covers some very heavy-duty stuff regarding the real fundamentals of Bridging and Routing.\u2020 If you read and understand this book, I guarantee you that link state protocols will never be a problem for you again. What makes this book special is some of the anecdotes regarding standards committees and the sprinkling of completely off the wall quotes, including the one from Prince Charles about his preference for Bus technologies. TCP/IP Illustrated Vol. 1 \u2013 W. Richard Stevens Back in the 90s I came from a UNIX background thinking I knew TCP/IP, this book taught me how little I knew.\u2020 I still refer to it every now again, there is so much more to TCP/IP than addressing, windowing and handshaking. Network Intrusion Detection \u2013 Stephen Norcutt & Julie Novak Until I read this book I thought I was a bit of a Network Security specialist with all my knowledge of PIX firewalls and locking down routers. This book really goes into the nuts and bolts of TCP/IP weaknesses and vulnerabilities.\u2020 Some great examples of exploits. DNS & BIND \u2013 Cricket Liu & Paul Albitz The ultimate guide to the original Cloud Computing application. It\u2019s amazing how much DNS is taken for granted, and yet it is probably the biggest weakness in most networks. Programming Perl \u2013 Wall, Christiansen & Schwartz Early on in my I.T. career I realized I was never going to be a programmer.  probably a good thing in hindsight. However, there are a few things that I\u2019m envious of programmers: \u2020Perl scripts to automate repetitive tasks and put together complex combinations of regular expressions that in one line saves two hours of log analysis. \u2020However, I have to be honest I use this book mainly to reverse engineer scripts associated with MRTG. Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Network World \u2013 Bruce Schneier A really good read and explains why I.T. will never solve criminality. Bruce gives some great examples of how a lot of the security problems we deal with today are just copies of what was going on in Babylonian markets 3,000 years ago. Performance and Fault Management \u2013 CiscoPress Although there are large parts of this book that are seriously dated because they refer to LS1010 and dial-up technologies, it\u2019s still worth reading because it does exactly what it says on the tin. It helped me really understand Performance and Fault Management on network devices and was relevant on AS5100\u2019s and is just as relevant on Nexus 7000. Routing TCP/IP Vol 1 \u2013 Jeff Doyle Routing TCP/IP Vol 2 \u2013 Doyle & Carroll I wish I had these books when I was studying for my Lab. You wouldn\u2019t believe how difficult it was to study for a Lab with only the RFCs and the Cisco 9.1 Router Products Configuration and Reference guides.\u2020 Obviously things have moved on a lot in the last 10 years but these books are still great reference for the basics.

            "answer_text": "Go for,Computer Networks by Andrew S. Tanenbaum It is the ideal introduction to the networking field. This bestseller reflects the latest networking technologies with a special emphasis on wireless networking, including 802.11, 802.16, Bluetooth\u2122, and 3G cellular, paired with fixed-network coverage of ADSL, Internet over cable, gigabit Ethernet, MLPS, and peer-to-peer networks. Notably, this latest edition incorporates new coverage on 3G mobile phone networks, Fiber to the Home, RIFD, delay-tolerant networks, and 802.11 security, in addition to expanded material on Internet routing, multicasting, congestion control, quality of service, real-time transport, and content distribution. Authors Andrew Tanenbaum and Davis Wetherall describe the inner facets of the network, exploring its functionality from underlying hardware to applications, including: Physical layer (e.g., copper, fiber, wireless, satellites, and Internet over cable) Data link layer (e.g., protocol principles, protocol verification, HDLC, and PPP) MAC Sublayer (e.g., gigabit Ethernet, 802.11, broadband wireless, and switching) Network layer (e.g., routing algorithms, congestion control, QoS, IPv4, and IPv6) Transport layer (e.g., socket programming, UDP, TCP, RTP, and network performance) Application layer (e.g., e-mail, the Web, PHP, wireless Web, MP3, and streaming audio) Network security (e.g., AES, RSA, quantum cryptography, IPsec, and Web security) The book dissects and depicts the principles associated with each layer and then translates them through examples from the Internet and wireless networks.
