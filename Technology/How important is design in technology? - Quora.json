            "answer_text": "Yes, design is important. It's not just decoration, it is a competitive advantage. Look at any competing products today. 90\u201398% of feature sets are same. Also, consider the fact that complexity of your app will increase with each newly added feature. But after one point of time, you will also run out of features. When a user opens your app, they don\u2019t see your code, tech stack etc. What\u2019s visible to them is DESIGN. What they will be interacting with is DESIGN. Design in tech is a 3-level hierarchy Product Design - Create a product that solves a problem or satisfies a desireInteraction Design - Make it easy to understand and use.Visual Design - We eat with our eyes first. Make it beautiful.It is important to take care of above said hierarchies. ",

            "answer_text": " See this image? I Googled \u2018first computer\u2019, so we can expect this should\u2019ve been one of the first computers or at least what one of the first computers looked like.Would you want this in your home? Advanced and messy wires, cables and resistors everywhere? Now let\u2019s look at this image  or this  These are consumerproducts. These are the type of computers you would like to have in your home. Sleek, simplistic, sexy. All of this is because of design. Design is the super essential part to take a technology and reshape that technology into something every person around the world would like to have. The newest emerging technologies are developed by scientists and tech geeks, these people aren\u2019t really well known for their sense of perfection in the field of \u2018good looks\u2019. It\u2019s up to designers who see the potential of these emerging technologies and make it beautiful. So, is design really important in technology? No. It\u2019s essential. Without design most amazing technologies we get to enjoy today would\u2019ve remained home kits for geeks to build without ever expanding towards the masses. With this I want to thank all designers who make our world a little more visually appealing.  ",
