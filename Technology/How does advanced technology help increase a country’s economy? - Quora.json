            "answer_text": "How does advanced technology help increase a country\u2019s economy? Make it simple. Reduce the country in question to three people. Adam, Bob, and Cindy. All three live on a small island in the pacific. They have no predators on the island and no hope of rescue. Their three primary needs are food, shelter, and water. Each day all three wake and immediately set out to feed themselves. They wade out into the water to try and catch a fish by hand. They typically spend most of the day doing this before each has enough fish to survive. They each go to the river to drink and then they are too tired to do anything else. None of them have met a need for housing yet. One day Adam wakes up and is tired of the daily grind, so he takes the day off from fishing to fashion a spear. He\u2019s not good at it and it takes him all day, meaning he has no fish at the end of the day. He goes to bed hungry, fish spear in hand. The next morning he wakes up, wades out with the others, and within a few short minutes begins to spear several fish. He notices he has more than he can eat that day, so he eats his fill and shares with the others. Everyone has more fish now because Adam created a fishing spear, technology they did not have before. The next morning, Adam has an idea. He will catch Bob and Cindy their fish for the day if they will construct a lean to for him. They each agree and begin to set about working on some shelter. Adam brings home the bacon (mackerel? tuna?) and Bob and Cindy have a nice hovel for all three of them to sleep under. In this example we see that a simple investment of one day to create a fishing spear has helped the entire community by making the ongoing investment of work and time less in subsequent days. Everyone has easier access to food and now has shelter. There are more goods circulating in the economy for a lower price (in this case price is time and work). I can continue the example out to explain even more basic economics but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s all been heard before. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, it increases the countries efficiency. Immagine being able to produce 2 kg of wheat per square meter rather than 0.5 kg, just by having the technology to do it, or being able to produce and export more products, because the factories become more efficient. (maybe by starting to use robots) Also advanced technology, it increases the average quality of life, by allowing more services to the citizens, and therefore attracting world wide attention. Wouldn\u2019t you like to visit a country that has flying cars? or 3km high buildings? ",
