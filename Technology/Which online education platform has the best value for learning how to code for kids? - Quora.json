            "answer_text": "Hi, there are a lot of sites that teach programming to kids. Which site or platform has the best value to offer when your children learn to code does not just depend on the site or the platform. Each child is unique in the way they want to learn. First, know whether or not they want to learn how to code. But then, you can also not depend on young minds to answer do they want to code. Whether or not they like coding will depend upon how they feel about it after they have been exposed to coding in a way that is not boring. There are various platforms available today that have made the concepts of programming interesting for kids. If you are an involved parent and are most likely going to help your child with coding, you can go to free resources, such as Learn today, build a brighter tomorrow. Studio, Code Monkey, and so on. Your children can pick up skills in their own time, and you can mentor them. However, if you are the kind of a parent who wants a well-designed program for your children, you may need to find a more structured platform that offers to coach to young minds, starting from basic concepts to more complex curriculums. Platforms, such as Camp K12 and Whitehat Jr, offer 1:1 coaching so your kids can get personalized guidance. A dedicated teacher ensures that your child moves forwards only after they have mastered a concept. Personalized feedback helps them improve faster. Also, the programs are structured such that you can take up additional courses only if your child truly enjoys coding. Some badges and prizes help reward the kids for their efforts. Platforms like Camp K12 start with a block-based approach, which is similar to Scratch programming. Kids learn by arranging predefined blocks of code that are built for a specific use. After they have understood the basic concepts, such as the if-else logic, event handling, loops, etc. they move to advanced concepts and techniques that are in vogue today. Then there are others like Educode Academy, Toppr Code, Vedantu Kids, etc. Some of them are targeted towards younger kids, while others employ video-based learning of the existing concepts.

            "answer_text": "Hi there! Before directly moving with the platform, I would like to share what coding is and what are its benefits so you can know if the platform will suit you or not! Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things. Why learn how to code? We all have hopes, dreams, and plans for the future. Whether you\u2019re looking for a new opportunity, want to optimize your current job, or are searching for a new hobby, coding can help you get closer to your goals. And remember, anyone can learn how to code! Here are some benefits which could help in deciding to learn to code. Helps develop problem-solving skills. Coding is an excellent way to help your child think more logically. Called computational thinking, kids learn all the steps they need to solve problems and create alternative solutions. Opens up more job opportunities. 71% of all new STEM jobs are in computing. On the flip side, only 8% of STEM graduates have a computer science degree. That means there are plenty of jobs for the taking for those who have coding experience. Makes math fun. We're serious. This is a hard one to believe..right? However, if your child dislikes math, coding is a great way to help make it more fun. Why is that, you ask? Well, they may not even realize they\u2019re doing it. While they\u2019re using logical thinking to solve problems, your child is also putting math into action in a practical, hands-on way. Expands creativity. We\u2019ve talked a lot about logical thinking and problem solving but coding also involves creativity and inspiration. There\u2019s a lot of room for experimentation and creation. Coding is a language, and like other languages, it\u2019s a great form of self-expression. Kids are naturally curious and full of outside-of-the-box ideas. Encourages curiosity. Curiosity is a natural part of childhood, one to be encouraged and nurtured. It helps their minds develop and grow, and their emotions to mature. As rewarding as curiosity can be, it can also end in disappointment, which...believe it or not... is sometimes good for children to learn. Now, If you are looking for a platform that teaches coding to your child then this platform is one that teaches from scratch. WhiteHat Jr is a platform that connects kids age 6-14 to top early childhood coding teachers, all from the comfort of your home. WhiteHat Jr teaches kids the fundamentals of coding logic, structure, and algorithmic thinking to help kids generate creative outcomes. Your kids can use code to build their own games, animation, and apps, fundamentally changing their relationship to technology from consumer to creator. The Platform helps small age group children to learn computer programming and encourages them to create games, animations, applications, etc. The startup works with a live one-on-one online teaching format and a thoroughly researched curriculum. The subjects range from the data structure, app, and game development to machine learning and space technology. WhiteHat Jr. also offers free trial sessions, so you can view their teaching methodology before enrolling your children, you can also visit the site for more information. Thanks! ",
