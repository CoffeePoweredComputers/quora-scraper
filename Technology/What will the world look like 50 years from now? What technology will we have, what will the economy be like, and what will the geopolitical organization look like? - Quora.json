            "answer_text": "According to Ray Kurzweil, we'll be post-singularity by 2064, and therefore it's truly unimaginable what technology will change by that time. We may even have the ability to transcend our human bodies and live entirely in the cloud, but that's not to say we will want to do so on any large scale. A few of the safest predictions are: 1. Energy will be far less scarce. Solar is ramping up already in major ways and by 2064 I fully expect that devices like our cellphone PCs will be powered by nothing more than a solar-sensitive outer cover. For large-scale energy usage, Nuclear Fusion and Thorium fission reactors can handle everything else, no oil needed anymore. Battery tech is the only thing that can slow this vision down, but post singularity that shouldn't be a problem either. 2. Robots will be EVERYWHERE.  From ant-sized cleaning robots that wander your kitchen picking up crumbs, to package delivery drones, to guard drones, to pretty much the entire labor workforce of all developed nations, there will be either an AI robot, or a 'driven' robot running on telepresence by some developing-nation driver.  Butlers in your home will become the standard well before 2064, even for the poorest classes of a developed nation. The only question will be \"AI or human?\" Both options have their strengths and weaknesses, but eventually of course it will all be AI.  The most interesting thing about the robot trend that it will necessarily blur the distinction of being a lifeform byt 2064. Not only will AI be so good that they will have actual creativity and compassion, so we will be able to talk to some of them exactly as we talk to each other today, but most robots will be able to reproduce and die, and of course have their own bank accounts and keep up with their own finances. Bitcoin makes all of that possible right now. 3. Which nations will be the new \"1st world\" will be is anyones guess... It certainly will no longer be the USA though... The amount of debt our country is currently in alone is bad enough to wipe it off the face of the earth like it's been nuked well before 2064. Perhaps by 2024.   Most likely the richest countries in 2064 will still be the developing BRICS nations of today, but I get the feeling that south america will be the most comfy continent to live on by far. 4. Money & commerce will most certainly all be done on the bitcoin blockchain. Most every form of wealth will be on that blockchain, and it'll touch every single part of our lives. All business documents, healthcare records, ownership records, birth and marriage certificates, everything important will be there, because nothing else on earth is even a fraction as secure as it is on bitcoin's blockchain, nor as accessible.  5. Decentralization will be respected and desired in all things. Governments will still likely exist of course, but their habit of centralizing control over everything will come to an end simply because the trend in decentralization doesn't have any reason to stop with bitcoin and lyft and airbnb... Everything from insurance, air taxis, private police, private law, just about everything that governments and the private sector both do today, can be done in a fully decentralized and open source way that will change the very fabric of our economies and societies in beautiful ways. Corruption and bureaucracy can become words only found in history books. 6. Space travel will be a hotbed of news and entertainment in 2064. Private industry like Planetary Resources gathering minerals from asteroids are a good start, but things will really get rocking when we've got a moonbase that successfully mines the HE3 found up there and we can use that for the perfect fuel to hop around the solar system with. Perhaps even some Interstellar drones will be reporting back by then, but I'd think we'll simply be trying to colonize Mars, Ceres, Jupiter's moons, and Titan by that time and just getting around to doing the first warp-like drive tests. 7. With robots & AI taking most of the jobs, we humans will be freed to do more creative & fun tasks. It may sound scary in today's society for a robot to 'take your job,' but in 2064, it will be a whole different mindset, one where basically everyone is some kind of an entrepreneur and spending the least amount of time working equals the most quality in life.  8. For the extremely lazy or unlucky among us, the Universal Income standard will make sure they aren't truly impoverished, even the potheads that never leave their couches... They can spend their entire lives wasting away playing Halo 17 in complete VR if they want, it won't impact you at all, because you won't be paying taxes towards supporting them. Charity alone will be able to pay a basic income for all of them once we remove the waste in the current, government-run charity systems and replace them with the modern ones that will come along with the adoption of bitcoin. 9. School in particular will become something we cannot imagine yet. Certainly the government-run school systems will be universally seen as the evil indoctrination camps that they are and trends like MOOCs will go a long way towards replacing them. But since the internet will be able to put all information at our fingertips 24/7, even while we sleep, the things we feel we will need to be educated about will change, since the rest all can be accessed in a second on a whim. That might make school much faster and young kids will be walking around with Ph.Ds before long. 10. Medically, we'll have a Renaissance long before 2064. Big Pharma will not be lobbying anything important anymore and actual CURES will start to emerge on the market again, not just pain relievers. A dozen technological breakthroughs in self-monitoring and nanotech are able to vastly improve our life today, but all held back by Big Pharma and FDA legislation for years now. Simply identifying this cause to our suffering is enough to make lifespans double if not far more by 2020, and the new technology that could emerge by 2064 based on those improvements could very well make us immortal or even give us relative superpowers compared to what we can do now! If there is one trend here that all have in common it is that corporatism (governments taking orders from corporations) has held us back in all of these areas and must be eliminated for us to start making process. It is only a matter of time until that happens though; the decentralization movement is already becoming the major human rights issue of this decade and will do more to free mankind than all but a handful of humanity can contemplate yet.

            "answer_text": "This response will examine the changes I anticipate can be expected 50 years from now. It also will address what I don't think are reasonably likely changes, including specific changes mentioned in some of the other responses to your question. I have an optimistic view of the future in 50 years ; but I don't think it will be nearly as different from the present as some do. For example, I think most of what Luke Parker says in his response to this question, including his selected descriptions of Ray Kurzweil's predictions, will be as funny to us in the future as the the common predictions in 1880 about life in 1950 now seem. I think it will be humorous down the road to see he predicted, for example, robot Butlers! Why will a plastic nineteenth century manservant be desirable, when electronic \"smart\" appliances will place food, drink, cleaning and communication only a couple of steps and a few button pushes away? Robots will have no value to the future if merely toys. Whatever functions may be robotically performed, there will be no need for artificial men to perform multiple tasks when an entire house will be programmed to meet all major desires of its occupants. Some of Mr. Parker's predictions will likely require many hundreds of years of technological advances. For example, economically-justified mining of asteroids for their minerals. The lack of any current ability to do this, and the extreme cost of space travel, makes that prediction unlikely to come true in that time. The travel cost will exceed the value of the minerals mined, during this century. In 50 years, most of what an average person's daily life consists of will be greatly similar to the present, but with certain changes in the speed and ease of certain tasks resulting from advances in machines, electronic components, and certain systems of distribution of goods and services. The exteriors of most parts of town will be approximately the same, other than for much more digital advertising and far fewer retail stores. And most of our same homes will still be here, but will contain improved wiring, lighting and appliances; and be joined to a worldwide internet at all times. Someone born in the U.S. in year 2000 will still feel very comfortable in that future, and will not feel his/her life has been altered that much, although some of our current behaviors and technology will be obsolete. Most technological advances will be integrated into home construction and improvements, communication, entertainment and security advancements. Most major products (like autos) will still provide the same basic functions but do it more cheaply, safely and dependably. We still won't all have flying cars or personal spacecraft, as it makes no sense to develop goods and support systems that would be so beyond an average individual's budget, inherently unsafe, or need supporting systems so expensive that they exceed our willingness to be taxed to create the necessary custom roadways, air lanes or public transportation. We are extremely unlikely to have any technological achievements in areas where today no scientific explanations for the principles involved even exist, such as anti-gravity propulsion or miniaturized portable fusion power generators. Electric power will certainly be much cheaper, and we probably will invent a better way of distributing it (and internet connections) than we use now. Your question referred to Star Trek style transporters, but these were never more than a writer's imagination, and 50 years goes by like the blink of an eye when a proposed technology has no proven basis in known physical principles, other than the musings that if quantum mechanics theory is true anything is possible. A recent publicized experiment, suggesting transportation of a molecule or atomic particle was observed during an infinitesimally short moment in a laboratory, turned out to be the result of faulty equipment configuration, if I recall correctly. Thought control already exists, if you consider psychotropic drugs, brainwashing interrogation techniques, and the social programming of a generation from birth to believe an official mythology, like is now done in North Korea and has been done for hundreds of years by certain religious institutions I won't mention further here (because I am not interested in a fight with them nor in changing their doctrines or approaches to belief). However, thought control has not yet been shown to be guaranteed effective or capable of predictable results with any individual. My understanding is that attempts to use it have been abandoned as unscientific and of no value by the military, which would have had the most to gain. We just have a rudimentary understanding of the brain now, in 50 years we will know more but the brain is so much more complex than even a quantum computer will be that controlling it like a machine will probably be too complex in 2065. However, we probably will be able to correct certain serious brain illnesses by then with our new knowledge, like chronic depression, schizophrenia, phantom limb disease and other mental disorders we now know are somewhat physically based and involve identifiable groups of brain cells. Weather control would first require a tremendous advance in understanding the totality of the smallest details of earth's weather. Conceivably this could be a project for expected super advanced computers over the next 50 years. Even then it will only extend the time period over which the weather could be forecast, not open the door to significantly and predictably controlling, or changing, the weather. Messing with the weather system even 50 years from now is likely only to screw things up, and maybe even lead to the opposite results than expected. It's probably not worthwhile considering, for many, many years into this millennium. A lot more bang for the buck can be obtained from other scientific endeavors, so you can be pretty sure this won't happen within 50 years, because we don't really need to do much about the weather, other than to try not to screw up the environment and make things worse. Kurweil's prediction of a computer singularity in fifty years was either badly misunderstood or a huckster's promise. Speed of I/O calculations is a very different thing from human judgment and understanding. The only \"thinking\" the coming faster computers will exhibit is the thinking a programer did while writing the program the computer executes. The computer still will be only calculating probabilities, then moving some machine's switch to off or on. No awareness, ethics or sensations will exist within the computer. There will be only the illusion of electronic thinking, created by a programmer. Remember that Kurzweil and some other futurist authors had a tremendous personal interest in marketing themselves, selling their \u201cexpertise,\u201d or in some cases getting others to invest in stock certificates which they have hinted would give people shares in the assumed profit from selling \"thinking computers\" and their software. Much less likely in 50 years than even a thinking computer, is the ability to take a living person's consciousness (whatever that is, we don't even know this today) and then transferring it into a computer. That's laughable to expect to happen within thousands of years, if ever. Of course, a clever computer programmer may someday program a computer to appear to be speaking for a person supposedly uploaded into it. Once unmasked, that programmer will probably be sued for fraud, but it will be easy to fool many people. Mr. Parker's prediction regarding Bitcoins replacing current national currencies has already been proven absurd - by the fraud revealed this year to have been perpetrated by private, authorized bitcoin registries and the resulting instability of that currency. If the U.S. government can't keep its employees' financial secrets confidential from foreign hackers, don't expect banks and major financial players to risk everything on a privately created currency (Bitcoin) maintained in computers controlled by multiple, independent private companies around the world without any significant legal or regulatory control or supervision. In 50 years it probably will be that physical currency won't be in use. However you can be pretty sure that it will be the U.S. and Europe which control the digital money marketplace; because only they will have an over-riding interest in keeping the system as honest and neutral as possible so they don't lose the huge financial advantage of controlling the world's currency. China simply does not have a financially sophisticated legal system or the government checks and balances to avoid huge amounts of corrupt manipulation; take a look at its current stockmarket scandal and collapse of China's stock market a few weeks ago, bankrupting hundreds of thousands of Chinese investors. Those Chinese investors, and others worldwide, will put their money in U.S. currency, the euro, and U.S. and London stocks next time they have money to invest. That's because they value stability so highly. Incidentally, because of the strong future of the U.S. Dollar, paying off U.S. debt by our government will take little more than printing more Federal Reserve Notes to back its T Bills. A common mistake of futurists is to project the trends of the present too far, resulting in hugely erroneous conclusions. Present trends like elimination of government regulation of business, medical monopolies via patent extensions, and financial benefits to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class, when examined historically over hundreds of years, only reflect oscillating changes which reverse themselves by the growing power of opposition increasing over time, with the pendulum swinging the other way after the need for correction becomes obvious to enough of the population (at least in a Democratic Republic). The legal rulings, congressional actions and public calls for change will kick in in the U.S. and Europe and those abuses will be rectified. As for 50 years from now, the only safe prediction is that whatever the trends then will be, politically, legally and economic, they will be different from the present. As to life expectancy, although antibiotics and scientific understanding of anatomic processes and germ theory extended average life expectancy tremendously during the first half of the 20th Century, during the time since then much less time has been added to the average human life. Most recent improvements in life expectancy were caused by improvement in economic circumstances of our poorest populations, better and faster medical diagnosis, elimination of certain environmental and cultural dangers like standing swamp water, widespread smoking and unsafe vehicles and roadways. Most of the easy fixes have been implemented. Although understanding of the human genome may prove to be a boon to medicine, there still seems to be a natural life limit of 100 to 110 years. A breakthrough on that limit is pure speculation right now, sad to say. Major extension of that limit could come, but it may also prove elusive for hundreds of years. We just don't know. Internet shopping and coordinated low expense delivery will affect a huge elimination of retail distributions of goods and provision of services during the next 50 years, much more than we see today. Very few brick and mortar stores will still exist, and the revamped \"stores\" that do survive will exist primarily as meeting places for assistance in selection of products with explanations of their operation; and for interaction between prospective and current purchasers to discuss the products and enjoy the social exchanges resulting from such cooperation and discussion. The online sales model will be extended to perishables like groceries, with quality guaranteed. It will also be permanently in place for sale of all matter of professional services, such as attorneys, repairmen (who will diagnose and repair many problems online), pharmacies, physicians (with online diagnoses and recommended treatments), realtors and more. The need for many extended hospital stays will be eliminated by online monitoring, nursing supervision, physician consultations and similar electronically controlled home care. Another potential change will be elimination of many functions currently served by prisons. Those awaiting trial (and presumed innocent) will no longer need be confined in centralized jails. Even convicted prisoners, if sentenced for non-violent offenses and not deemed a social threat, can be ordered to remain home under electronic video supervision and interactive surveillance, assisted with GPS monitors securely affixed to the detainees, instead of jailed at public expense. This should make reformation more likely. The Court will maintain close supervision and adherence to a schedule of training and counseling, through its electronic jailers. This should be at least as effective as the sentences served in current prisons. The home-confined inmates will be subject to immediate police response and sanctions in event of attempts to flee their confinement, or other violation of their \"supervisor's\" instructions or rules. Furthermore, this will avoid the \"hardening\" of such inmates through contact with lifetime criminals, eliminate present-day threats of physical injury from hardcore or mentally deranged prisoners, and remove young offenders from the present prison gang culture that forces conformance with the rules of criminal ringleaders. In law enforcement and the criminal justice system, video surveillance and new electronic controls will save the public money, and provide safety and security. I have tried to touch upon the particular points discussed by the question\u2019s original wording and question a few of the predictions in other answers provided by other Quora writers. I am certain that I have overlooked areas which a person in 2065 may consider to be far greater changes than those I discuss here, changes I could not foresee in 2015. But I am fairly sure a large number of the daily preoccupations of 2015\u2019s men and women will remain the same preoccupations of the people in 2065; and that the general environment seen when traversing the neighborhoods surrounding most residential areas in the USA will be amazingly similar to today\u2019s, with some archaic elements removed and some new features added. I don\u2019t expect I will be alive to actually see it, but I wish I could somehow be there then, in good health. I don\u2019t expect the apocalypse, any collapse of the American way of life, or any zombie attacks; instead mankind will probably experience an incremental improvement in education, health, knowledge, morality and independent thought and communication, and there will be cause for optimism for those with realistic assessments of humanity\u2019s past.

Our DNA will be taken at birth and defects will be remedied, altered or catered for.Our physical and mental attributes will be assessed and compared with our parents and grandparents. On this basis predictions will be made of our likely physical and mental abilities.We will all be nodes in a network. Our heath will be constantly monitored via built-in sensors, wearables, and clothes.The Global networkOur houses, cars, suitable furniture, utensils, pets, and possessions will be networked. We will each be the centre of a mini-universe which is a form of 'Data bubble' that will be part of a system.TransportAll vehicles will be optionably  self-drivable, and all will contain Black boxes to record their status and diagnositcs.They will use clean energy, and it will be cheap or even free.Vehicles will be made of everlasting materials such as Graphene.Much of the transport infrastructure such as roads, will be made with built in safety and security features, and in some cases energy charging facilities.Public transport will normally have communication links built in, and transport stations will also cater for communication needs as well as tranport indicators for all reuirements.HousingHousing will become increasingly expensive to the point where buying a house will not be an option for most young people.They will resort to 'Tiny houses' which will commonly be transportable. Typically these will be attached to vehicles, or the vehicle will be habitable as with caravans.They will be fully wired, and all flat surfaces will be available as screens.Car parks and such will also cater for such vehicles by offering washing facilities, catering, etc.EducationSchools and Education centres will become Resource Centres that will supply marterials, equipment, and advice. There will not be 'Teachers' as such.There will be a choice of Home education, and Group education, and all courses will be available online.Forums, such as Quora, will divided into sections such as 'Quora Science', 'Quora Art' etc. and these will be subdivided for specific subject, with useful answers being put into a database.Information searching will be central to all studies.EmploymentCurrently in the West it only takes about 8% of the working population to provide all of our essential needs. That is food, energy, transport, housing, and basic utilities. With automation, robots, and Artificial Intelligence the work force will be reduced to a fraction of 1%.As most consumer goods will be everlasting or disposable, our needs will rarely require changing other than for fashion.A much greater proportion of work will be related to entertainment, sport, and studies related to creative or academic interests.ComputersQuantum computers and other varieties of information handling will be totally integrated in all of our possessions as well as ourselves.The convenience of this will be offset by our loss of privacy, though that will matter less then than today as many of the issues we currently prefer to be private about will be more socially open in the future.FoodIn the West we currently waste around 20% of the food grown, the food bought, and actually much of the food eaten. This aspect of food waste will be addressed by the environmental authorities.We will eat insects, and artificially created food, along with normally grown food. Red meat will be on the decline, and cattle farming will start disappearing.What we eat will be partly dictated by what our computers tell us to eat. We will know how much to eat, what it contains, and when we should change our diet. Our eating habits will be recorded and available to those who deal with our health.PetsOur pets, like us, will have sensors in their bodies, and attachements. Much money will be saved looking for lost pets, and curing them from ailments.We will have a greater variety of pets, and in some cases robot pets will replace live ones.SportSport will have reached a point where the outcome of games and competitions will be largely predictable.This will require such events to have handicaps or built-in conditions creating unpredictable situations.It will also change the nature of sport and even very young children will have their sporting potential predicted, so they will be advised whether or not to take up certain sports. One can imagine a form of a 'Sports IQ' which will suggest which sport you will be best at, and what level you are likely to achieve.EntertainmentThe nature of entertainment will have changed totally. With many more countries producing programs, all instantly translated to your native language, all categorised so you can select just those that you like, and have an endless amount of them, and all the ones you want automatically recorded, you will no longer regard entertainment as separate from your work life.You will carry your entertainment with you everywhere, and to some extent it will be part of your identityIt will be available at the touch of a button or a spoken command, and will include passive entertainment such as TV, music, etc. or interactive entertainment such as computer games, or being part of a music group while playing along.ReligionReligion is already on the decline in regard to those who actively attend meetings. Also, the churches will have their own online meetings for followers. It will also change from those who are religious on the basis of belief to those who are active in the various social areas of helping those in need.There will also be more tolerance in different religions as followers take on the global aspect that all pursuits have to adapt to.MarriageMarriage is on the decline in terms of how many couples have ceremonies.  Divorce is increasing, and furthermore, mainly being initiated by women.In the West cohabitation is now roughly equal to marriages, and cohabiting couples are much more likely to separate. In fifty years time marriage is more likely to be a matter of choice for the sake of the ritual rather than having any extra legal status. And laws will be changed to accomodate cohabiting couples, and even allow legal status to those having bigamous relationships.Women will have more choices to concieve without the direct help from men, and the law will have resolved the various moral issues relating to stored eggs and sperm, and also aspects of  parenthood on paternity.MilitaryThe Military in the West is increasingly involved in aspects of Space Travel, Search and Rescue, Terrorism, and Weapon development that has peaceful applications, such as drones and cyber security.The lines will be blurred in terms of what the Military does. It will be seen as a resource that trains and tests people and systems that can be applied to a range of social requirements, and will be regarded as a resouce to be politically available in that way.LawThe Law is ideally suited to be taken over by AI (Artificial Intelligence). Most contracts are suited to be written and checked by computers. Much evidence presented in courts is based on forensic details.Lie detectors can now analyse body changes, facial expressions, brain activity, speech variations, and the like to distinguish between lies and truth offered by witnesses. This will have improved in fifty years to the point where courts will not be required in the majority of cases. Courts of today will not exist in fifty years time.GovernmentsGovernments are basically people who decide on how we (they) spend our money. The fact they get it wrong so often mainly due to They don't really know what they are doingThere are people in and around the Government who manipulate it to their own advantage.Technology smoothes out the mistakes to a large extent. Predicting the outcomes of various economic initiatives will mean that the consequences of any decision will be more acceptable to all parties.There will be a point where 'the best decision' is based on the best available information, and the best information is not the opinions of vested interests. As technology is able to offer more and more reliable information, the role of the Government moves up to deal with larger issues, such as global aspects on hunger, poverty, disease, climate, space, etc.The MediaThe Media has its own needs to fulfill. It tells you what it thinks you should know in ways that is suited to your attitudes.There once was only newspapers, then radio, then film, then TV, then the internet. Each stage incorporates the previous stage and builds on it. What comes next?We know that already. We are the stage, the page, the laughter and the rage, the freedom and the cage, the naive and the sage. The centre where all information ends.In fifty years time we will have become the ultimate platform for all Media.All the worlds comedies and tragedies will sit in your pocket waiting for your applause or despair.AdvertisingAdvertising doesn't know all about you...yetIn fifty years time it will know who you are, who you were, and who you will be. It will know who you know and why you know themIt will know what you eat and what you likeIt will know where you go and why you go thereIt will know those fantasies that hide in the dark of your secret cupboardsIt will supply all your needsIn fifty years time you will say\" I want...\"and your digital slave will say\"We've got...\"It is the ultimate love affair. CrimePetty crime will almost disappear as houses will be very secure in the sense of locks and visual coverage. Also, anything that can be digitally marked will be traceable, and items that now have a value (watches, computer equipment, etc.) will be cheap disposable items in the future.Criminals who are the result of psychological problems are likely to be detected before that take up crime. As our behaviour, social contacts, medical condition, intellectual pursuits, etc. will be all interlinked and correlated, anti-social patterns will show up early.It is likely that drugs will either be legal, or there will be legal alterntives to drugs that are readily available.This leaves big crime to be dealt with. More likely to be Cybercrime in some form, but unlikely to be done by individuals as technical developments are increasingly the result of teams and demanding costly resources.MoneyMoney as a means of evaluation is good for bartering. If my digital watch is worth $200 and your bicycle is worth $200 then we can do and exchange without money changing hands.If a dollar is equal to 10 cybercoins, and cybercoins only exist as a virtual currency, then we can still exchange our items on the basis of cybercoins.Bartering is essentially based on matching needs at agreed values. If I need your bicycle but you don'e need my watch, but the computer can quickly find someone who does need my watch then we can still have a deal. To that extent bartering will become an alternative to a much larger extent than now. It will also extend to exchange of services. I will give you $200 worth of my time for your bicycle. I will even invent a barter unit for you to value all your goods and services with so we can make many deals.SexWe know for sure that according to statistics, pornography is the largest industry in the world, but we don't know how large. What we do know is that laws don't stop it getting larger.Entertainment is always pushing the boundaries, so we see more of it publicly. We know it is more available on the internet, and we know that more technology is being devoted to it in terms of viewing, and with new devices that satisfy our needs.The main problems with sex is that it impinges on others, and that is the basis for most of the problems. If it could be separated from this imposition then it would be seen in a different light.Already in the West it is part of schools sex education. The internet is separating it into categories, and there are authorised clinics that deal with the various negative aspect of pornography.In fifty years time pornography will be openly accepted to cater for all tastes, and without any aspect of denigration.It will be a subject any other that you can qualify in, either as a therapist or a performer. It will be a legal and organised industry governed by the authorities, and a large source of income to the Government.Social effectsIn all, technology will have changed every aspect of our lives in fifty years.It will have put most of us out of workIt will have largely undermined religion and all its tenetsIt will have largely separated sex from marriageIt will have largely put crime out of businessIt will have largely made the Military a corporationIt will have largely made Governments into councilsWhat   else?Is anything impervious to technology?YesLove, Truth, and BeautyThey always wereand always will beThe more things changeThe more they stay the same",

This would be ideal. 2) Extreme doomsday : We get mostly or entirely wiped out by misuse of technology. This is unlikely to happen in my opinion. The actual thing is going to be more \"average\" in my reckoning. Here are the things that will come to pass in another 50 years for sure.  Plentiful cheap non-polluting energy (I'm willing to bet it will be nuclear)Complete breakdown of totalitarian and fundamentalist communities. Everyone has a number of silver pieces for which they will ignore their \"cause\". It's hard to be well fed and still be a revolutionary or idealist.A major decline of religions' influence on people.Population stabilization in developing countries, due to natural disasters and migration pressure.Human level intelligence in machines. Driving cars, flying aeroplanes, cleaning house, manual labor, transport, everything will be robotized, and they will take instructions in plain EnglishGenetic patching to create \"designer babies\". The rich will be able to choose the kind of attributes their children have. This is likely to create massive social divide.Immersive virtual worlds (direct brain plugging in) and virtual currency will be the major place people live and the thing that people work for. The majority of humanity is unlikely to forgo customizable virtual experiences in favor of painful and imperfect real ones.Ethics will go for a toss, because you can do whatever you want in a virtual world, in a very \"real\" way.Whether it's a threesome, a sky dive or a ritual killing, someone will be willing to create that virtual expereince for you. Perhaps if we can record experiences, we could vicariously experience other peoples lives. Those of us who are not consumers, will be busy creating these virtual experiences that are marketable, either with software or by recording real life stuff. Lot's of the world will remain \"backward\" with primitive forms of entertainment like 2d movies and drive \"obsolete\" manual vehicles.Increased lifespan through medical procedures - At least 150 to 200 years of healthy adult life. Lots of social upheaval because of this.Lots will change, but humanity will remain mostly the same dopamine seeking fiend, because evolution works very slowly. ",

            "answer_text": "People have always been intrigued of what the future will look like. The answers are quite simple and here you have them for the next 50 years. How can we know what the future will look like? To be able to understand the future, you must know the past. What has taken us to where we are today and what has changed along the way. The world has changed a lot in the last 150 years, but we humans are driven by the same basic needs as we were 150 years ago, food, sleep, sex, the feeling of being appreciated and loved. Will this change in the next 150 years? No. What inventions have really made a difference in the last 150 years? If you take away all gadgets that people in some part of the world are using for entertainment, the inventions that have affected most people around the world for everyday living are the telephone, electricity, radio, television, computer, the car and the ability to communicate through Internet. Then we of course have a lot of inventions that have made life easier, like new medicine, faster transports etc. In general the inventions for the last 150 years have been a human strive for freedom and communication, to be able to get in control of the time and world. Since there is still much to do in this area, this will be the focus at least for the next 150 years. But why do we need to predict the future? Predicting the future is important for two reasons; first we need to start to think about what kind of future we would like for ourselves and to pass on to the next generation, and then we need to know what decisions we need to make today that will give the best result in the future. Will we ever get those flying cars in the future I saw in pictures as a kid? Flying cars is an example of a scenario that has been pictured for the future for a long time. It is a great and exciting concept, but is it realistic? To start with we must find out if there\u2019s a basic need for it, what are the pros and cons. Then we have to think about the system we have today, cars going on the ground, and the transition to a new system. To make it work in this example we need two parallel systems, with a road network for the flying cars simultaneousely as the common road network. Even if the flying cars are improved to be suitable for city traffic, the investments would be huge for a city to implement this, as well as for households to get that extra vehicle. So even if all the pros are there the practical steps for such a new route is too hard to overcome, so I\u2019m sorry, there will be no road network for flying cars in the next 50 years. How about the virtual worlds, do I need to go on vacation in the future or just have all the cells in my body experience an artificial vacation? It might be possible in the future to experience the sand between your toes, feel the salt from the ocean on your lips, hear the waves and smell the seaweed, just lying in your bed at home. But we will not be able to fool the mind in the way that no matter how real the experience will feel, you will always know that it haven\u2019t happen for real. That will make all the difference. You can tell people today that you have seen the pyramids in Egypt because you have seen a picture of them, but you will never get the feeling of being there. So, even if a great invention is there for an affordable price, it will never replace the common experience if it is not genuine. Please tell me we will get in contact with some aliens in the near future... It is most likely that there are other life in the Universe considered there are billion solar systems. In the aspect that our solar system is about 4.6 billion years, other civilisations could be 10 million or even 1 billion years ahead of us. With these numbers in mind there is no greater chance that they will make contact with us within the next 50 years than in 100,000 years, and with the size of the Universe we will not likely be able to make any contact with them during this time Article Source - NewsofFuture Thanks For A2A..!!

I have been of the opinion, to varying degrees of strength and/or weakness, that the voters of this county are ready to take control of their politics and run most, if not all of these idiots, out of town on a rail. The biggest challenge to the political system at the moment are (in no particular order) MONEY -- Citizens United, and the associated problems it has created.  Congress has rated poorly for decades and yet one correlation has remained true and constant, ALL of Congress Sucks (public opinion across the country) and yet, incumbents rarely lose.  MONEY... Due to the fact that Money, and the ability to attract it has taken center stage, maintaining the status quo, for Corporations, narrow Interests like the Koch's, etc has performed beautifully in keeping new blood OUT.  All the way down to the state and local elections, the power brokers keep new people, especially those that have managed to get elected in the first place, out of office. There is really NO Bench of new, bright, talented Political Thinking.  IF you Don't Kiss the Ring (MONEY), your finished. Change is being suppressed so that these people (the INS) won't lose til they want to, or, as is increasingly the case, til a son, daughter, brother, etc can take over. Income inequality, in my estimation, will get plenty of lip service for the next few years with little of no action.  MONEY... The rise of angst in Race Relations, \"Militarized\" Police, Guilty until proven Innocent, Fox News, MSNBC ridiculousness, etc Watch Income Inequality closely...IT will change the political landscape...sooner, rather than later I Fear...

            "answer_text": "Why do people always have to be so pessimistic about the future? It's like people don't understand that the reason this world exists is because it is not entirely driven by greed. I think this question needs an answer that isn't so pessimistic, nihilistic, and critical of the future as other answers might be, so here you go.  I think that given the current trends of globalization and interdependence, the world will have a significantly more improved standard of living, particularly of people in undeveloped places like many parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. Interregional cultural mixing will take place due to the increased trade, creating many somewhat unified cultures based on a wide mix of influences from many places. They'll all have a certain homogeneity provided by the influence of American culture that is widely loved and/or forced upon other people. The English language will be even more important due to the economic presence of America that it will be start to be taught in many schools throughout the globe. The Internet will spread many English phrases and figures of speech, so you could travel to any place in the world and hear someone speaking in another language say \"awesome\". American culture is the modern mainstream version of the old Hellenistic generic culture. It will be what unites the globe. We'll be so deep into our ecological crisis that in many ways, this is going to be the time that a very radical change in global economy works. This will certainly not be our demise, but it will knock all of us flat on our backs for a while. America, with its wasteful, highly capitalized way of life, will be most affected by far. America, despite having such a major unifying influence across the globe, will lose its place as a leader in the economy. It will no longer be a major exporter of agricultural products\u2014not even its vast wealth and power over subordinate nations can buy it out of facing its own consequences. America's spot on the world's list of favorite people won't be lost yet\u2014people world wide will still hold a near universal admiration for Americans, much like how Britain had much prestige while it was a global superpower a century ago. However, America's grip on the world's money will be on the decline and other nations will begin to fill the void america left behind, providing their own agricultural exports, manufacturing, and cultural influences. I'm guessing India will be a likely candidate for spreading its own culture and economic potential, though China will most likely still have a bigger hold on the economy. Africa, though seemingly unlikely right now, will see an enormous growth in every aspect. Its standard of health will dramatically improve thanks to relief efforts from outside as well as public health access improvements within. Armed conflicts will decline as they are doing already, and people will begin to build better lives. Access to education will improve, and we'll start to see African nations will become leaders in innovation and business. Unlike America which grew up in a time when the world was largely unaware that the earth had limits, Africa will grow in a time when environmental impact is a fact of life and will develop much more responsibly and sustainably. During these next fifty years, Africa is setting the stage to become the next successful continent in 100 years, as Europe has done before it(albeit with less colonialism involved.) While the answer to the question of how much power they will have is a mystery, the fact is very clear that they are already making significant advancements and they don't seem to be losing momentum.    I could definitely go on to list more ways I think the world will be like in fifty years, like the rights and social status of different groups in different places, population fluctuations, agriculture, the average standing of the average person, technologies, the state of peace, etc., but I think I'd better stop now.  In conclusion, though it is impossible to tell exactly what will happen, the general trends of the past and present do give a significant insight into our future. Things will be much different in fifty years, and will be exponentially more different in 100 years, but it won't necessarily be the end of everything. The end of some things, maybe. But it won't be the end of times. We'll be better off in many ways and worse off in some ways. Will the ecological crisis cancel out the positives of many trending social and economic changes? Will some unforeseen scandal or emergency in one place change the way the world will run unexpectedly? Will the general trend toward peace be interrupted by some atrocity? Only time will tell. P.S: Before you ask, no, unfortunately we will not have space tourism to the moon and Mars yet. Maybe in the half century after this one. ",

You will be able to get gasoline for your antique Ford Festiva, but it will be difficult to come by and you will have to plan ahead. It will be similar to what happened to vacuum tubes in the middle of the 1900's.  2)  self- driving cars will be ubiquitous. It will be similar to what happened to the elevator industry in the early 1900's.  3) home and work charging will be ubiquitous. It will be similar to what happened to the  movie theater industry with the advent of TV and VCRs.  Highway travel plazas will be repurposed as DC fast charging stations and have more amenities pecs use people will be spending 30 to 40 minutes there.  But that's okay, because: 4) battery capacity will triple, at least.  That means that a car like a Tesla Model S will have a range of  600 miles. Far beyond the bladder range of most people.   It will be similar to what happened to the smart phone industry over the past 10 years.  5) with less complexity in the drive train, there will be less need for auto repair facilities. Car dealer networks will have to either change their business models radically or die.  It will be similar to what happened to the TV repair industry in the last part of the 1900's.  6) solar energy will be ubiquitous. Most homes and public buildings will have solar panels and storage batteries for overnight. The central grid will not go away, but it will reduce the need for new fossil burning plants.  It will be similar to what happened with the telecommunications industry over the past 40 years.  7) having a driver license will be about as useful as having a pilot license is now. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear questioner, thanks to you for asking such a really thought provoking question.Before answering the question, let me tell you that my answer is based on the following two assumptions: I presumed that by 'world', you referred to our world, i.e. Earth, since 50 years is a too little duration to observe any significant physical or technological change in this world.I also assumed that any kind of apocalypse is not before 2064, since doomsday will probably spoil our advancements.Now, coming to your question, to comment on future 50 years, I analyzed the advancements in last 50 years a little and found that the development has been exponential. I drew the following image of our future Earth:  Physically - It will be as beautiful as it is at the present day.    Environment - I expect there will be sufficient flora and fauna till then. The loss due to technological exploitation will be so clear within next few years that we will have no choice than to plant trees. We will have environmental engineering and innovative ideas of forestation, as Mourya commented.Medicine and Biotechnology - In next half a century, we'll be having complete cure of diabetes and hypertension. But unfortunately we'll have to face newer kinds of ailments, like CQAD (Compulsive Quora Addiction Disorder), LOTS (Lack Of Time Syndrome) etc. Oh God why?Education - We'll see our grandkids gaining lots of their knowledge through internet, preferably Wikipedia, Quora and Khan Academy. They will be learning universal topics as they are and presently current affairs as history. They will be gaining knowledge from screens, as use of paper contradicts my point about the environment.Nuclear Technology - This will, till then, become the majormost source of power supply, followed by solar and chemical energy. Electricity will be cheaper.3D Printing - This presently new kind of technology will be near its peak around 2045. We, or better say our kids will be manufacturing their own smartest phones. Wow!Robotics- Having robots of many kinds, we'll, as such, not be using them for personal purposes. Humans are not manufactured to sit and rest all the day, relying on robots.Space Technology - A bunch of people would have spent around 5 years, 50 years from now, on the moon. The Mars mission is in advanced development stage, yet incomplete as the animal sent in 2040 could not return alive from the planet. We will be facing some communication issues due to growing sun storms. Don't worry, our scientists are working a solution.Other breakthroughs - Going through your question details, I think that teleportation will be achieved, but not for macroscopic things till then. We'll realize that nature is and has to be superior, we won't have climate control. Thought instructed devices will be history, as devices which can process thoughts will be developed. Robots, probably, will be looking in and after our brains.Facebook- Mr. Mark did his best but Facebook will have no mark. If you search Facebook from Google's ultra advanced search engine, you will see 'Did you mean Quora?'    And finally Quora: Quora - As already mentioned, Quora will become an ocean of knowledge for our succeeders. All idiot questions, probably, will be removed. My kids will be writing an answer for the next 50 years on Quora's app for Windows - Quora for Windows phone 28. Note - I hope you live long to check the validity of these expectations. Keep Quoring!  ",

            "answer_text": "In 2065: 1. Air:Definitely all the peoples are going to fit one oxygen cylinder on their back side to breathe good air as now we are wearing spectacles for our eyes. Because there won\u2019t be pure air due to many grown up industries and concern.  Now we are buying mineral water because good natural water is very rare. Same way in 2065 we are going buy good AIR as oxygen cylinder.  We can\u2019t able to get pure air it\u2019s going to happen. In this way the technology may improve by providing artificial air in some other method other than Oxygen cylinder.  2. Water:Even in 2015 itself in some countries water became very demandable property. In 2065 Natural water is rare. So they start produce water from air. So far they try to improve the technology to produce the water from air. In this way also the technology may get improve in 2065.   3. Food:In 2065, The human being never eats food. Each and every thing is Capsules and Tablets and capsules.  Water itself  very rare then how food is possible?. Then the technology will improve by producing one single tablet to satisfy the peoples hunger and also for other health improvement.  4. Money:There won\u2019t be paper money at all. Paper money is completed avoided and full and full e- Transaction. 5. Education:Student\u2019s education is on their Finger tip. I mean there is no note books, and books only tablets. This is also one of the technical improvements in 2065. 6. Small Living Creatures:Small Living Creatures like birds are becomes very rare to see them due to e-Rays. Even plants and trees become rare.  There may be artificial living creatures the technology will get improve by providing this artificial living creatures. 7.Child birth:Child Birth also becomes very rare. Even if it happened, it may born with some disease. This is also due to e-Rays.  But our technology will cure that disease. This is one of the improvements. 8. Transports and vehicles:May be petrol and diesel is avoided and solar technology get well improve.  And Road Traffic is much 6/24 hrs peoples will stay only in road inside their car. 9. Hospital:2065 the hospital may be changed to Human Workshop. They start to sale each and every parts of the body in which may be manufactured artificially in human work shop.  10. Agriculture:No Chance. The above 10 things may be happen in 2065 or otherwise within 2065 this world may destroy we can\u2019t guess it. How this Technology was before 1st century?.  Anybody knows?. I think some peoples may know. But I don\u2019t know. But my assumption is before 1st century, the technology may be advanced than the current technology. After that the world gets destroyed and after 1st century the technology may get developed from beginning little by little still now. May be this also happened.  Sorry for my Bad English. Thank Very much. By Dhamodhar Chinnu ",

            "answer_text": "Blurb: The world would NOT have recovered fully from the after effects of a full blown World War III erasing mist of the world population, but would have secluded the affected places and advanced greatly. After realizing the folly of the past system of 2030 of the world and UNO, which was the handy tool for the rich billionaire conglomerate, Earth would have got rid of all the geopolitically limited nation states and established - a JUST and REAL- WORLD GOVERNMENT of truly CAPABLE, JUST and GENTLE representatives from all parts of the world. It would be a world where EVERYTHING is properly taken care of! ALL FACILITIES WOULD HAVE BEEN GURANTEED TO ALL THE WOLRD CITIZENS! There would be a huge surplus of all resources and all the resources would be adequately distributed to all. Scientists would have greatly unravelled the nature of all invisible forces and nuclear particles and mastered the physics, chemistry, biology, etc., more deeply. Advances in biology and genetics would have ensured that only healthy children with no genetic defects are born into the world. So, a NEW/SUPERIOR healthy generation having disease resistance and being disease free would be walking in the streets and flying in the skies. Also, if any human body part got injured, it would be easily replaced by a lab grown body part with amazing space biotech. Average Life Expectancy would have crossed 100-years' mark. ALL DISEASES WOULD HAVE BEEN CONQUERED AND CONTROLED BY RESEARCHERS AND MEDICOS! ALL CRIMINAL TENDENCIES WOULD HAVE BEEN CONQUERED AND CONTROLED BY WORLD POLICE! Couple would be able to chose the height, build, color, hair/eye/skin color, qulities, etc. of their offsprings, before they are born. Most of the journey from one place to another would be by means of small personal FLYING CRAFTS. World would have been fully computerised. Everyone would be sporting Sci-Fi wrist-worn super computers which would serve all the purposes of communication in any part of the world with thousands of satellites circling around the EARTH providing full connectivity anywhere anytime. Each individual would have a personal transport (which would also be a personal starwar-like assistant) to take him anywhere and do all chores for him/her. Energy, water, tech service, etc. would be freely available to all everywhere. Individual state armies would have been eliminated and all leading to no wars between nations. The only irrestible army would be with the World Govt. which would be watching the whole world all the time. The real challenge on the earth would have begun as various planets would have been colonised (including Moon, Mars, Moons of Jupiter, Saturn, etc. Education, Health, Food, Residence, Job and Entertainment would be ensured FREE for all the world population 100% as there is always enough for everyone on this planet when properly distributed. The whole EARTH (excepting the war ravaged part) would be CLEAN, NEAT & EXTRAORDINARILY BEAUTIFUL! When everyone possesses all the basic facilities required for life, everyone would actually would be doing what one enjoys (work related) and would excel in it (so the world would be mostly filled with experts in all different things). All knowledge would be avalaible in multiple dimensions (more than 3D) in one single super Webcylopedia accessible everywhere for everyone. All learning and training would have been digitalized and stored in digital schools/colleges/universities with anyone being able to learn anything anytime anywhere. Education would have been 99% computerised and virtualized with only about 1% of it being doubts getting solved by human experts in all matters sitting at their home offices. Sports, Virtual Games, Entertainment, etc., would have reached their Zenith with everyone enjoying and exceling in some sport/activity of one's choice. There would be inter-planteary sports Olympiads held every year on MOON/MARS, etc. Abundant amount of food would be grown on suitable lands/water souces all over the globe by auto-farmerbots. Chefbots would cook and supply any required food everyone as per the client's orders. Nursebots would do most of the (@95%) of the initial diagnosis and treatments for patients whereas less than 5% would be done by human docs assisted by nursebots. All financial transactions would have been digitized with no cash transactions anymore. There would be great political selection process (as against elections and thus selecting of suitable administrators/diplomats from the pool of citizens by expert committee and by suitable recommendations by all politically interested enlightened world citizens). Media would no longer be misused and it would be 100% trustworthy in its reporting and would provide verified factually correct news only. Media will have gotten over sensationalism and would provide more useful and positive news to the world. International Legal system would have been established with swift justice (sometimes even within hours) would be provided to all as it would be the highest priority. THAT WOULD BE AN UTOPIA, A HEAVEN ON EARTH AT LAST FULLY BLISSFUL! Sorry. P. S. : I forgot to mention that all this would probably happen in about 400\u2013500 years and NOT 50 years! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Sheesh, ask a small question why don't you? I am inclined to imagine the world in fifty years time might be something like the one described in David Mitchell's book 'The Bone Clocks'; recommend you give this one a try, in particular the final chapter, set in the 2040's. Very broadly speaking, Mitchell's possible future sees the world fundamentally changed by a combination of economics, climate, environmental degradation and  other forces. In the wake of increasing climate instability (storms, jet stream, drought, flooding, etc.) global trade becomes increasingly difficult and in the face of this the USA becomes increasingly isolated from the rest of the world.  Mitchell avoids dealing with the complexities but there is an implication that American social order and government has broken down and the country is engaged is internal self-destruction, which results in the rest of the world slowly being taken over by China as the dominant surviving global force.  In many parts of the world it seems that social order, trade and economy have broken down to the extent that for many, if not most people, life has become more a matter of survival. The media is noted by its absence, as is culture in general. Law and order is a matter of local cooperation and occasional intervention by superior force. Life goes on, in some ways much has it always has, but in many ways, the indulgences of the twentieth century seem to have become less and less relevant, and the lives of ordinary people much more of a day-to-day struggle, and people have less autonomy and self-determination. It's all a bit bleak, but it does feel as if this is the logical conclusion of the pathway we are currently on. You might consider it a warning, rather than a prediction; it's up to you.  ",

I may have shuffled off to any approximation as little as 11.6 years prior. Possibly more. As for how to imagine the world. You can take any of several approaches already trail-blazed and construct your own from your favorite pieces of each. Non-fiction. Ray Kurzweil. The Singularity Is Near. For as much as I loved reading Ray's books, I have to admit I'm begrudgingly giving him space in this answer. The man has some interesting future thoughts. But beyond that, he expects to be present in that future. WTHF? He expects to live to 200+. As I've said elsewhere...quackery, that! He has quite a pile of predicitons and trends in Singularity that vary from believable to insane. Non-fiction. [Climate change denialists may argue this attribution, but I think it stands]. Al Gore. An Inconvenient Truth. I have a premonition that some day in the distant future when we're all burning everything we can find to stay warm and stay alive - a la The Day After Tomorrow - that the last book to be burned will be this one. I have another premonition that Al Gore will still be alive, and will be the one burning it.  All the carbon locked up in those pages. Fiction. Margaret Atwood. The Handmaid's Tale, Oryx and Crake, ... The word dystopian doesn't begin to describe the state of the world imagined.  Chickie Knobs.   Yum. Fiction. Ernest Cline. Ready Player One. We're already living in \"stacks\", just not quite like the ones he imagines in our future.  ",

We've kept an old refrig working that  doesn't tell the world what we're doing. I walk out to the kitchen, pour  myself a glass of milk that just this morning we milked from our cow. I have to shake it to mix the cream. Then I glance up at the holo to check my encrypted messages. My daughter appears in 3-D and sings one of her new compositions. Now: We're  being made to believe that we cannot have smartphones and internet  without intrusive oversight. I predict a strong counter-move among people  who challenge that paradigm. Give us our gizmos without snooping on us, unless we explicitly opt in.  We already see this happening in small ways. But the more pervasive the snooping--by the Googles, governments, and Zuckerbergs of the world--the more people will insist on high-tech alternatives that avoid this. Companies will spring up to serve them. Already happening. Many, even in forums like this, say \"Privacy is pass\u00e9, so what?\" \"I want my refrigerator to tell me when I'm thirsty.\"Then there are others like me who say, \"Leave me the hell alone!\" Remember the movie \"Wall-E\"?

            "answer_text": "Wow...  There's so much room for speculation here that I hardly know where to begin. About the only thing I can venture with any degree of surety is that cars will be using one of three powerplant designs:  organic diesel, pure electric, and diesel-electric hybrids.  We're never going to run out of organic waste oils and \"grease cars\" are already so numerous that city streets are beginning to smell like french fries and egg rolls.  Fuel cells and similar technologies are liable to result in 'self-charging batteries' which will be great for vehicles which don't see constant use.   IC engines beat electric hands-down for sustained (highway) travel while electric motors can't be beat for stop-and-go, low speed (city) travel.  City-use vehicles will lean towards all-electric while general purpose vehicles will favor the diesel-electric hybrid approach which locomotives have been using for decades - just using organic fuels instead of petroleum. If I'm still around, I don't think I'd want to be on the streets around self-driving cars.  There are simply too many bends in the pipe, so to speak, where even a minor glitch can result in catastrophe.  We're already going down a slippery slope with airbags, collision avoidance, and other features which are making people stupid (see Too Safe for Safety\u2019s Sake and the Volvo Effect). All the factors which led to large cities throughout most of human history have been losing their relevance over the past few decades, and we're already seeing a swing back towards \"Mid-Town America\" - big enough to have good cell phone coverage and high-speed internet, but no skyscrapers.  The Dakotas have already been rebranded as \"The Silicon Prairie\" because numerous IT firms are taking advantage of empty land and low cost of living.  Why spend $1,000,000 for a one-bedroom flat in Manhattan when $250,000 will buy a four-bedroom manor house in Fargo?  This last is liable to cause a swing towards something similar to 1950s suburbia and the rebirth of The American Dream. ",

            "answer_text": "it is really unimaginable what know-how will change by that point. We could even have the power to transcend our human our bodies and dwell fully in the cloud, however that is to not say we are going to need to accomplish that on any massive scale.A number of of the most secure predictions are:1. Power can be far much less scarce. Photo voltaic is ramping up already in main methods and by 2064 I absolutely anticipate that gadgets like our cellphone PCs will be powered by nothing greater than a solar-sensitive outer cowl. For large-scale power utilization, Nuclear Fusion and Thorium fission reactors can deal with every part else, no oil wanted anymore. Battery tech is the solely factor that may gradual this imaginative and prescient down, however publish singularity that should not be an issue both.2. Robots can be EVERYWHERE. From ant-sized cleansing robots that wander your kitchen choosing up crumbs, to package deal supply drones, to protect drones, to just about the complete labor workforce of all developed nations, there can be both an AI robotic, or a 'pushed' robotic operating on telepresence by some developing-nation driver.Butlers in your house will develop into the usual properly earlier than 2064, even for the poorest courses of a developed nation. The one query can be \"AI or human?\" Each choices have their strengths and weaknesses, however ultimately after all it can all be AI.The most attention-grabbing factor concerning the robotic development that it's going to essentially blur the excellence of being a lifeform byt 2064. Not solely will AI be so good that they are going to have precise creativity and compassion, so we are going to be capable of speak to a few of them precisely as we speak to one another right this moment, however most robots will be capable of reproduce and die, and naturally have their very own financial institution accounts and sustain with their very own funds. Bitcoin makes all of that doable proper now.3. Which nations would be the new \"1st world\" can be is anyones guess... It definitely will now not be the USA although... The quantity of debt our nation is at the moment in alone is unhealthy sufficient to wipe it off the face of the earth prefer it's been nuked properly earlier than 2064. Maybe by 2024.Most possible the richest nations in 2064 will nonetheless be the growing BRICS nations of right this moment, however I get the sensation that south america would be the most comfortable continent to dwell on by far.4. Cash & commerce will most definitely all be executed on the bitcoin blockchain. Most each type of wealth can be on that blockchain, and it's going to contact each single a part of our lives. All enterprise paperwork, healthcare information, possession information, beginning and marriage certificates, every part essential can be there, as a result of nothing else on earth is even a fraction as safe as it's on bitcoin's blockchain, nor as accessible.The above issues could also be occur in 2065 or in any other case inside 2065 this world could destroy we are able to\u2019t guess it. How this Know-how was earlier than 1st century?. Anyone is aware of?. I feel some peoples could know. However I don\u2019t know. However my assumption is earlier than 1st century, the know-how could also be superior than the present know-how. After that the world will get destroyed and after 1st century the know-how could get developed from starting little by little nonetheless now. Could also be this additionally occurred.",

Let us look at it this way , A fine day in 2068 might be like\u2026\u2026 You just woke up and it's 7Am, no wonder what put you out of sleep is a mattress alarm which vibrates , right after that a voice command like \u201cwhere is my coffee?\u201d will activate a automated coffee and house keeping robot , which serves your coffee, after your hot bath in an automated and voice operated bathroom which is connected to your WiFi and plays music in shower ,almost everything around you will have a tech included in it either the software or the hardware mechanical stuff , Mobile phoens and tabs could be simple transperent piece of glass which will display all the data you need(below is the patiented model of it ).  Televisions would be a strip bars adjusted to the wall, which project Ray's to form a layer display, watches and wrist bands apart from all body sensors , trackers they could track all your personal stuff including how much water you consumed the whole day !!  And running late to your office or don't feel like driving don't worry you got a solution! FLYING CABS yes what you heard is correct Uber has already made some tests for this and soon they are gonna be seen in Dubai and more good news : India is one of the shortlisted countries for flying cabs ! (Welcome to future)  Forget bullet trains and shit, Hyperloop's will run around ,increasing the speed and reducing travelling time greatly (Delhi to Hyderabad will take roughly an hour, Hyperloop's tested speed is 1220kmph) .  You might feel like Tony stark in his suit with just a pair of glasses ,which analyses anything and everything you seek info from and displays it to you ,who knows the person sitting next to you can just scan you face and know your history ! check the Google glass if you haven't .  Tring tring \u2026\u2026\u2026. Delivery! Yeah how can I forgot this ?? basic deliveries like food , goods and all the online orders will be deliveried through drones ! Everything at fingers isn't it ! Delivery drones  and with all the regular jobs being done by the some kind of tech (A.I+Robotics =Automation ) we humans will be definilty innovative and work with brains and skills , if you know what I'm talking about ! A.I bots  Save your money if you want to live 100 years+, just kidding for now ,might be a fact in future. As of now a company is working hard for a similar process but not exactly but similar and the process is called cyropreservation and Recently a chinese man claims to alter the DNA and produced HIV resistant babies (he is in jail tho), who knows futher studies can tamper our life time too \u2026\u2026..just imagine living for a couple of centuries .  With all advancements from finding new elements in periodic table, superconductivity, reactions and blends of materials, U.V Ray's , Electro-magnetic waves , un imaginable nuclear power to rarely used solar power, even a minute experiments and discoveries will create wonders that we cannot imagine, even controvesial concepts like teleportation and time travel can be proved ! Ufffffffffooooo\u2026.let me stop here with the tech, You just triggered my thoughts man! Coming to the economy and geopolitical organisations , no one can predict it ! If at all someone knew something about it , they would be making money some where out of it , cuz it's future bruh thats what we don't know !! All you have to do is wait for the days to pass by and who knows friends from Enceladus might give us company very soon! And if you are still interested in this stuff like me, go through this you will be amazed for sure . This is and article you won't regret after reading -We've seen the future, and it will blow your mind And here is a video for you enjoy!  ",

            "answer_text": "Jobs requiring repetitive tasks by humans have been completely automated. Shopping malls do not require sales men, but interactive systems which guide you to buy what you want by studying you. Billing counters have been replaced by self-billing systems, thereby no clerk is required to process the billing. People don\u2019t need to travel for work, study or shopping. People do all their jobs from their homes through internet, students learn all the stuff from the internet. We do not need thousands of people saying the same thing to a handful of students, thereby wasting loads of man hours, this work can be done by a single lecturer and be uploaded on the internet, saving loads of money and resources spent on building infrastructure, man power and daily commute. Since most of the stuff is automated, human productivity is highly multiplied, therefore people don\u2019t need to work for more than 2 hours a day for maintaining a comfortable lifestyle. Now they spent the rest of their time truly living their life. People can easily choose their jobs and their timings, all at the comfort of their homes. Since people don\u2019t travel for work, they find little sense in owning a vehicle they would hardly use. This would reduce the number of vehicles and the resulting pollution significantly, it would also reduce the load on the travel infrastructure like roads and metros. People will still need to travel, but this time not out of compulsion, but to enjoy their time or visiting places. For this a driverless pod like car will come to people\u2019s homes and after picking up the passengers, it would take them to the nearest station, where it would get connected to pods similar to it, thereby making a train which would go on a track, and get disconnected when the destination station arrives and will drive the passenger to the exact drop location. Since the human involvement is minimal in all sorts of works, the average income of the world would significantly increase, provided they reskill themselves, and prices of many stuffs would come down thereby making many comforts affordable to the common people, thereby reducing poverty significantly. Since people can work at the comfort of their homes for anyone in the world, they don\u2019t need to move out of their city/village/country to an expensive location. This would reduce the cost of living in big cities, reduce congestion over there, and since people would be bringing in money to villages they would also start seeing development. Such an approach will help everyone. Developed countries will see less immigrants, and therefore less inflation, developing and underdeveloped countries will have growth in their economies and stronger currencies because of inflow of money from developed countries, since people can work for anyone from anywhere. Since the economy gradually becomes uniform all around the world, the development status also becomes uniform around the world. Mass immigration gets highly reduced since people are not leaving their countries, which would also relax the visa barriers we currently have, making it easy for tourists to travel anywhere in the world with ease. Automation will help us in utilising our resources like fuel, real estate and most importantly human as a resource at least at a hundred times better than the current scenario. Economy will shift towards a sharing attitude instead of a hoarding based mentality we are having as of now. ",

            "answer_text": "We do not have a crystal ball, but looking at -the frenetic pace that life is hurtling along at the present time- looking at the way technology, which is meant to be a tool in human hands has fast become the master of man- looking at the 'I, Me and Myself' attitude that all humans are increasingly living under, we can make an inspired guess! Scenario 1: We will be living in the end scene of a virtual world, with all the remnants of all relationships carried on through the Net, the computer, and the Cell phone. Far from technology being extensions of ourselves we'll become extensions of technology. The point just before total self destruction. Scenario 2: If our misuse of technology does not do the trick, then we of course have other ways to self destruct. With our rampant consumerism and humongous, unending appetite, would have consumed all the world's natural resources and would be in an apocalyptic phase of hurtling towards complete annihilation of ourselves and the world. Like the cancer cell in a cancer ridden body. Scenario 3: Maybe if I have not got the time frames right and all this will happen faster than I estimate, then it'll all be over. The earth will be a desolate place, sans humans, sans all life, back to square one, perhaps waiting for the slow resurgence of life forms which happened billions of years ago. For a new life cycle to begin once again! Perhaps the best scenario, all things considered. ",

This will not just mean that computer games will run faster, but that we will be able to:a. solve intractable problems like protein folding, thus ending disease as we know it b. synthesise new materials we never dreamt were possible previously, e.g. ultra-light weight ultra resistant materials (especially useful in the aviation and transportation industries) and intelligent materials that can react to a variety of environmental conditions (e.g. increase heat retention in cold weather and heat dissipation in hot weather) etc... 2. Room-temperature superconductivity will likely to be accomplished, thus reducing our energy footprint to a ridiculously lower levels and relieving us of sound air pollution also even more talked forms of air pollution, 3. Nuclear fusion will be financially and theoretically viable, making it the primary energy source for humanity when it comes to near future 4. Planetary manufacturing will emerge from becoming a mental construct to an actual technology where organizations start building geoengineering and terraforming products, although in my opinion that in 50 years these types of technologies it's still within their infancy.

This will not just mean that computer games will run faster, but that we will be able to:a. solve intractable problems like protein folding, thus ending disease as we know it b. synthesise new materials we never dreamt were possible previously, e.g. ultra-light weight ultra resistant materials (especially useful in the aviation and transportation industries) and intelligent materials that can react to a variety of environmental conditions (e.g. increase heat retention in cold weather and heat dissipation in hot weather) etc... 2. Room temperature superconductivity will be achieved, thus reducing our energy footprint to a ridiculously low levels and relieving us of noise pollution as well as more talked forms of pollution, 3. Nuclear fusion will be economically and technically viable, making it the main source of energy for mankind for the foreseeable future 4. Planetary engineering will emerge from being a mental construct to an actual technology where companies start building geoengineering and terraforming devices, although I believe that in 50 years such technologies will still be in their infancy.

The house you live in now will pretty much be the same, apart from maybe a paint job or a few different plants in the front garden. Clothes will continue with the latest trends. There will be more buildings in the city. Cars will look pretty similar and the concept will stay the same. But most likely they would be electric and hopefully self driving. Technology will most likely be applied in the same concept, but with newer sleeker devices which are easier to use. Most of our generation would be enjoying retirement. True A.I will not yet exist.

At the present rate of environmental depredation I would imagine all coastal areas will be flooded, seas will be further polluted with plastic & contaminated with chemicals & radiation. Fish will be inedible in some areas, in fact this is already the case. Wildlife is in decline due to habitat destruction, this same destruction of woodlands & forests will effect humans as well. More carbons in the atmosphere, more global warming. Mining is a big problem & we are producing less food as mining is now a government priority. Money/wealth prioritises over human life as far as our government is concerned, hence the Genocide in West Papua which the Australian government is funding!!! The already wealthy will get richer, & the poor will get poorer. Unless in the next 50 years the people revolt & fight back & get rid of corruption, Big government & Corporatism, this world will be a mess in 50 years time. That is my opinion anyway. Keith. ",

            "answer_text": "In our world of both exponential growth and accelerating innovation, systems of repetition are \"doomed to collapse.\" We need to make radical changes to the frameworks in which we operate. The world is now an interconnected neural network, where problems are considered shared and where solutions are crowdsourced\u2014we're no longer living in silos. This power of connection has begun\u2014and will continue\u2014to reveal what we are capable of. We must work together to redefine what \u201cgrowth\u201d and \u201cdevelopment\u201d really mean. What will the world look like in 50 years? Dare to imagine... The Skoll World Forum reconvened for another year across Oxford's cobbled streets. During the opening plenary, Jeff Skoll, founder and chairman of the Skoll Foundation, Participant Media and the Skoll Global Threats Fund, identified 10 key achievements in social entrepreneurship over the past 10 years\u2014achievements that are a testament to the world's growing community of changemakers. 10) Technology drives social, and social drives technology. Skoll cited the increase in mobile phone ownership as having implications on society and the ways in which we design solutions to challenges. 9) We now have global government commitments to scaling up social innovation, particularly from leadership in the U.K., Canada and the U.S. 8) Muhammad Yunus (Global Academy Member) and Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \"for their efforts to create economic and social development from below.\" 7) Al Gore, Jr. and the IPCC were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \u201cfor their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change. 6) Deforestation rates are on the decline. Brazil, which was responsible for a third of the world\u2019s carbon emissions, has reduced these by two billion tons\u2014the single greatest reduction in carbon emissions in history. 5) Billions of people now have access to clean water. \u201cThe 2015 goal to halve the number of people without access to safe drinking water had been met in 2010, five years ahead of schedule,\u201d said Skoll. 4) Social Entrepreneurship has turned mainstream! There are now 40 million people with careers in social entrepreneurship, with more than 200 million volunteers lending a helping hand. Contrast this to 10 years ago, Skoll said, when the leaders of the social entrepreneur movement were \u201crogue disruptors.\u201d (For more on the evolution of social entrepreneurship over the years, catch Bill Drayton's conversation with Tim West from Pioneers Post.) 3) Global markets are steadily shifting towards sustainability. The future of business is social. Louren\u00e7o Bustani, one of Fast Company's 100 most creative people in business, has said that \"the tipping point was reached in 2012.\" 2) We have made significant progress against significant killers. Eight million lives had been saved from HIV and AIDS, parasitic guinea worm disease is set to follow smallpox as the next disease to be completely eradicated, and polio is in line to disappear after that. 1) Fewer people are living in poverty than ever before. Skoll says the \u201cdisappearance of poverty is tantalizingly close\u201d with the possibility that we could bring extreme poverty to virtually zero in the next generation. For the first time since poverty rates have been monitored, rates are falling in every region. This post was written by Felicity McLean (@flickmclean), the communications manager at Ashoka UK. ",

This will also affect a few other countries.Swearing will be so common in the fast-paced countries mentioned above that people will become insensitive to swear words and even teachers will be swearing in front of their school students. Politicians will be swearing on their political campaigns. Representatives at UN will be swearing at each other - emergence of a new kind of hardcore diplomacy.

Exploration of space will become rapid . Civil wars and conflicts will be a rare news . Economies of every region will become mostly stable and equal . Clean energy will be everywhere . As for negatives as long as we don't mess up in artificial intelligence and some big natural disaster doesn't happen I think as a whole ,world will be much more better as compared to now . If you asked someone in 50s about future he would have also predicted worst case scenarios relating it to atomic bombs. As for food and water .I think these problems will be solved with improvement in technology and with help of AI . ",

Someday, I think people will wonder how we managed to cut our lawns without robotic lawn mowers. Our grandchildren might laugh out loud if we told them that we actually had to plug our phones in to charge them! In short, I see a lot more automation with our daily tasks and I imagine that \"robots\" will roam the earth for more reasons than I have time to name! ",

This will stress America and China and my cause centers of power to shift north. It will also result in certain diseases expanding their ranges, suppressing economic growth in some areas. Technology is hard to predict. AI will make in roads but they may not be in industries that most people are aware of. Internal combustion engines are likely to still be relevant as it is difficult to come up with lighter, more compact, form of energy storage than hydrocarbons. Fuel cells might give them a run for the money, however. I feel like biotechnology might be game changer. It might be possible to increase the intelligence or other desired traits of children through various pre-pregnancy interventions but I doubt this would be popular because they would add too much artificiality to reproduction. Life extension technologies might also come on the scene. If they do they likely increase how long you can be healthy more than they increase how long you live as a disabled frail old person. Human space travel may happen more but will still be a niche thing without self-sustaining off-world populations. ",
