            "answer_text": "Where I was at MCC in New York, self-surrenders generally came in on Monday. After all the intake bull shit, I was escorted to my unit and brought to the bubble officer whose responsibility it was to find an open bed. There was no grand plan as if prison is a wedding with the bride and groom convening before the ceremony to figure out the seating. Whoever is working at that moment gets a fix on which guys are living alone and then decides where to put you. Generally, the officer will make a nominal effort to place a new inmate with someone he\u2019s more likely to get along with, factoring in race, age, appearance etc. But it\u2019s certainly not science. Essentially, he just wants to get it done and return to the bubble or whatever else he was doing. While as time went on, I noticed that inmates were generally placed with their \u201ckind\u201d (read race), it wasn\u2019t that way with me when I entered. My first two bunkies were black. One was civilized. The second was not. I never mistook it as a punishment thing. Because it wasn\u2019t. Locating new inmates was a pain in the ass for officers. I know because one of my best CO friends (he was one of a few who ran the kitchen) told me so. He related a story about having to find beds for 9 inmates on one shift and how each and every one was a fucking diva. In summation, arranging of cellyship is a haphazard and not particularly well thought-out process. At least where I was. Officers would check back after an hour or two to ask if the boys thought the partnership was going to work. Or officer Thomas did when he placed a stone thug with me, realizing he\u2019d mixed oil and water. Dave more or less told him the white boy was cool and we\u2019d be all right. Curiously, the officer didn\u2019t ask me what I thought. Changing bunkies was really easy. The CO\u2019s had no problem accommodating your wishes. All they wanted was for the moving inmate to write down his name, reg number, and to which cell he was going. And \u201cmake sure to include lower or upper.\u201d I never heard of an officer saying \u201cno, you can\u2019t move. You have to stay where you are!\u201d They didn\u2019t want guys slashing each other\u2019s throats in the middle of the night (something that had apparently happened at one point), and realized making guys stay together was a poor idea. And now to some intrigue. Our unit had 96 beds. At any one time there would only be 80 something inmates - which meant some lucky prisoners had a single. And I noticed that some of them were keeping them. When one of my bunkies was to be released and I would have one for myself, I decided to inquire about how to keep that single. I went to my counselor and said \u201cI\u2019m working 10 hours a day for you guys at an average of about 12 cents per hour. You think I could keep my single so I can get enough sleep to perform my duties efficiently?\u201d Amazingly, the counselor answered \u201cSure! We\u2019ll put you in as the last guy to get a celly.\u201d This blew my mind. How could it be that easy? My bunky was to leave in a week when I asked this question. Hardly believing my good fortune, I doubled back a few days later to confirm what he\u2019d said and not to my surprise, his response was different. \u201cCan\u2019t do it.\u201d I was not to be denied. \u201cWhat if I give Lurch\u201d (the name of the gorilla inmate who\u2019d been tasked with helping the bubble officer place new inmates) \u201cfood from the kitchen? Would that work?\u201d The counselor shook his head and said \u201cDon\u2019t do that\u201d\u2026meaning Lurch will take your food and then give you a bunky. Lurch was that kind of guy. He\u2019d cut the food line at almost every meal, grab his food and almost dare anybody to fuck with him. I continued\u2026\u201dso what I gotta do to get this done?\u201d prepared to pay whomever it took. Again, I knew there were a few guys who had an \u201carrangement\u201d and I wanted to know what that arrangement was. The counselor\u2019s response was \u201ctoo many mouths to feed.\u201d \u201cReally? Try me!\u201d was my final comment. The counselor gave me a look which said \u201ccase closed.\u201d Infer what you will. I\u2019ll not convey my thoughts at that moment. Chris left two days later and shortly thereafter, they moved Paul Manafort into my cell. And no, Manafort wasn\u2019t a grand plan who prevented me from getting my single, although I was more or less hand-picked for Paulie. But he was a special case (ya know\u2026high profile inmate) so they were careful about who to place him with. They didn\u2019t need to be as it turned out. Paulie could handle himself fine. They could have put him with a gangbanger and he\u2019d have managed. ",

            "answer_text": "When you initially go to a prison they screen you. They ask you straight out, \u201cwho do you run with?\u201d If you are a gang member (or a non-affiliate like I was), you would need to tell them you\u2019re a Crip or Blood, or whatever at that time. They would look at what was in your file and then decide to house you with whichever group you claim to \u2018run with.\u2019 From then on they will house you with someone who is where you\u2019re from. Someone who is from the same gang as you. If, at some point, you and he become incompatible you just need to fill out a \u201ccell move slip\u201d and turn it in to the watch office or your own units officers and it is usually done in a very short time. If they want to see you crash and burn because they dislike you for whatever reason (that could be because of the case you\u2019re in there for, an argument you had with the guard in charge of making cell moves, or you might simply be litigious like I was), they will make the move take long enough that you and the guy will end up resolving it the old fashioned way. By fighting. That\u2019s added time, but you don\u2019t ever have to worry about them putting him in your cell again. Most times, however, it\u2019s not very difficult to get a cell change. ",
