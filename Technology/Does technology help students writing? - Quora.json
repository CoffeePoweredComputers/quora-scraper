You may use certain apps such as - Grammarly, to help you write better. This is just one of the many apps available for free on your system. Your teacher can also use a large number of tools available for teaching writing to you or your class. Nicenet is one good application. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know what programs are online for writing and language, but I suspect that good programs would be great for writing\u2026IF the program highlights incorrect words, tenses, and verbs; makes the student re-choose a correct word AFTER reading why their choice is incorrect. It would teach, check, and correct errors. The harder part would be finding programs that check specifically for technical writing or \u201chow-to\u201d narratives versus programs that check creative writing or descriptive stories and check for adjectives and adverbs that make clearer pictures of the story setting and characters. A good job for \u201cGirls Who Code\u201d program to design. ",
