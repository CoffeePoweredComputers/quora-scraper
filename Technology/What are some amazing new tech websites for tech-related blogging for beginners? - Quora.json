            "answer_text": "Well, if you\u2019re a beginner I\u2019d suggest you to make your own free blog! Or you can also wait before stepping into blogging and do a set of guest posting on other blogs or Quora spaces. That'll make you realize whether you\u2019re really interested or not. Although I\u2019ve been associated as a freelancer for many tech-related blogs, I\u2019ve been very fascinated by it. There is a certain way you need to write to make it more appealing. So a little bit of research will help you in there. Then, you\u2019re good to go with your own blog. However, engaging the audience without a marketing plan is tough. I\u2019ll wish you good luck with that. I\u2019ll attach some of my technical blog writings here. Do reach out and follow me for more doubts! I\u2019ll be there to assist you. These are some excerpts from Tech-Wonders. Not only I loved the blog, but the content and topic choices are commendable! https://www.tech-wonders.com/2020/07/free-graphic-designing-software-for-beginners.htmlWhat Are Deepfakes and What Are Their Applications?Oh, and hey, I\u2019m the founder of a lifestyle and narratives oriented blog called The Blogger Monks! I hope this helps! ",
