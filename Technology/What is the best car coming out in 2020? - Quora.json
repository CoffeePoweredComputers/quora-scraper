            "answer_text": "Buy a used car! Set your budget (cash) and stick to it - but buy the best car (with the lowest mileage) you can afford. That's the only secret. Consider funding a repair account, too - put aside some money every month so you cover something major if you needed to. Just one example-- four new tires (five if you have a spare) is a big expense these days. Cars are not an investment. New cars lose value the minute they sell. The vintage car market is unpredictable and not a safe bet for making money. Treat a car like a good pair of shoes or an important appliance - keep it clean, maintain it regularly - but don't expect it to increase in value, or last forever. My current car is a 1994 Dodge Grand Caravan. I bought it in 2015 for $1,200 cash, and it had 76,000 miles on it. I don't drive a ton, but it has still taken me and friends on road trips all throughout the Midwest. I budget about $1,000 every year for replacement parts and repairs. One year, that meant upgrading the suspension; last year I put on all new brakes. The van has about 125,000 miles right now. I love it because the shop has never had any trouble fixing it. Yes, it's more than 25 years old, but parts are still readily available for this model. I'll give another example. When I was 16, I bought my first car: a 1973 Triumph GT6, a tiny British two-seat roadster in \u201cFlame Red.\u201d I bought the car for $1,700. I had the car for more than 15 years, and I'm sure I spent more than $15,000 over that time on repairs and upgrades. But when I finally decide to sell it in 2018 - in better condition than I bought it - I only got $1,000. Presumably these cars were even more rare in 2018 than when I bought it, but the market for them shrank even smaller. So, I lost tons of money, but I learned a lot repairing it, and it was lots of fun to drive. In my mind, money well spent. One more note: why buy a car in cash? Buy a car in cash and get mid-level insurance, but make sure you're funding repairs, too. If you have a big loan on a car, and someone T-bones it the next day, you're out a car, *and* you still owe money to the bank. Unless your insurance is fantastic, you're going to be responsible for making up the difference. ",

            "answer_text": "My Best Car Of 2020 is Ferrari GTC4Lusso  The GTC4Lusso, a replacement for the less attractive, four-wheel-drive FF, is Maranello\u2019s latest fine-tuning of the shooting brake coupe (a sportwagon, in other words) concept, providing four-seat accommodations in a more streamlined, tapered shape that gives it more of a fastback-like profile. Its 4,922-millimetre length makes back-seat usage possible if not always practical. There\u2019s actual luggage space, too, up to 800 litres. Like its predecessors, the GTC4Lusso is fully capable of leaving devastation in its wake thanks to a 6.3-litre V12 pounding out 690 horsepower. This, says Ferrari, makes the car the most powerful in its segment. The GTC4Lusso\u2019s brilliant 4RM Evo system is now integrated with rear-wheel steering. 4RM-S (four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering) system was developed around the fourth generation of the Side Slip Control (SSC4) and now also encompasses the E-Diff electronic differential and SCM-E suspension damping. Later in the year, Ferrari will introduce the rear-drive GTC4Lusso T powered by a 610-hp, 3.9L turbocharged V8. ",
