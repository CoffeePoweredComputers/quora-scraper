            "answer_text": "I'm sorry, I must have misunderstood your question\u2026. What do you mean she refuses to delete the app? How did she refuse? How could she refuse? Did you die? Is she in one country and you're in another? Is she locked in a safe room and never coming out? Is she surrounded by security guards? Is she protected by the Secret Service? I'm confused. How is she refusing? HOW IS A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL REFUSING?!! Explain this to me. Slowly. Because I do not understand. I'm stuck in this part of the question. Do you know what I would do to a thirteen year old that would LOOK like they were about to THINK about REFUSING ME?!! CHILE! OOOH! Orange would be my new black. But she would meet her Maker that day. Lord, Lord, Lord! Okay. Deep Breaths. You do realize that sexual predators are on the prowl looking at your daughter RIGHT NOW. You want to be her friend or want her alive? I don't have time to be gentle with you. You are placing a child in danger with this foolishness. If you cannot be bothered to put basic parental guards around your baby girl then for God's sake give her to someone in your family who will! She is in GRAVE danger! I cannot stress that enough. Sex Trafficking is VERY real! I am involved with the Minnesota Coalition against Sex Trafficking and receive the reports. Did you know that each year between 15,000 to 50,000 young girls and women each year are kidnapped and caught up by sex traffickers? However, that is just an estimate. We believe the numbers are much higher. Because they don't include the numbers of young girls forced into prostitution each year or caught up into a life of drugs through the internet. Or who become runaways because they take off of their own accord because they find so-called boyfriends on the internet. Then these boyfriends rape them, drug them and force them into a life that they have never known. So if I seem a bit harsh, it's because I'm trying to save your daughter's life. You don't have time to be your daughter's friend. You don't have time to be lenient. You don't have time to give her what she wants. The only thing you have time to do is take whatever she's using to access Tik Tok. Tell her little spoiled behind that the next time you find her on Tik Tok you and her are going to have a go round. Begin to monitor her, let her know that since you cannot trust her, (and trust me you, CANNOT TRUST HER!) then that means that she's going on lockdown just like the entire country. She hasn't got school to go to right now anyway. Then lock down all access to the internet so that the only way it can be accessed is through a password. Make sure that password is not words but a combination that only a hacker could break, cut her off. Take her cellphone. Track the numbers that are on there. Have them traced by the the cops. Make sure that you get to know every single number on there and make sure that they are all under age. I would be tracking down every single person on there. Trust me if the person on the other end of that telephone number wasn't legit I'd be up in their face before the end of the week was done. If they were a predator they would be on the run. IN CASE I'M NOT MAKING MYSELF CLEAR REPORT ALL CONTACT YOUR DAUGHTER HAS WITH OVERAGE MALES OR FEMALES WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE TO LOCAL SEX TRAFFICKING AUTHORITIES. You will find them through your local police department or the CIA. Track her internet usage. Find out who she's been talking to. Find out what his name is. Report it to the local sex trafficking division immediately. They will take it from there. You don't have time to make friends with your daughter. Save. Her. Life. You can take her to a psychiatrist later. Right now, cut this off at the root. Jail his behind right now. Whoever this joker is that she's dealing with right now should be in jail anyway. That's a baby he's trying to molest. I hope this helps. I pray you listen. Because if you don't your baby might soon be a statistic and I do not want to see that. My blessings and prayers to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's go at this from a sane point of view. I'm the parent of a teenage daughter and I\u2019ve raised an additional four other teenagers, male and female. So with that said here's my take on things. Your daughter is 13 and is beginning to figure out who she is and who she is going to become in her adult life. TikTok, just like any social media app is full of inappropriate material for a young teenage girl. That's why you as a parent have a responsibility to talk to her about that kind of content and why it is not appropriate for her or anyone under a legal age limit. Explain internet safety to her. Explain the dangers of internet predators. Explain the risks she is taking and why as a parent you are concerned for her safety and well being. Explain that while you understand her need and desire for her freedom and online interactions with what I am sure she finds perfectly normal, that you would prefer that she hold off on viewing such content and again enforce why you feel it is inappropriate for her. Suggest a compromise, she is 13 she is mature enough to handle this part. She can have access to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. But, here's the catch she has to delete TikTok until she can prove that she is responsible enough to avoid the content that you feel is unsafe for her. I fully get why you are at in impass with her. You allowed her to have access to the universe by giving her a phone and internet access, of course you did, we all do, it's the world we live in right now. She wants to be mature and an individual and feels that since you trusted her to have a phone you've invaded her privacy by going through it without her permission. You feel, as her parent that it's your right. You are both right. She should have a right to privacy, you should have the right to protect your daughter. If she doesn't understand why it's an issue she is going to continue to fight you. You can take away her phone, you can ground her, you can keep trying to punish her in some way\u2026 or you can treat her like the young adult she is and explain the danger she is putting herself in. Then and only then tell her the ultimatum, of loosing access to her phone if she does not comply. Exain that she is going to have to earn it back by proving her maturity. If that doesn't work, show her live cases of young adult abduction and internet scams directed at young women to get their information and hurt them. She might start to understand. My youngest is 13 now. She doesn't have TikTok because she had no control over the content that was being suggested to her and she came to me and had questions about what she was seeing. We agreed that it was inappropriate and deleted the app. She does have social media and is responsible about it. She always asks permission before adding new apps, following anyone, joining groups, etc. We have an awesome relationship. But, part of that is a mutual respect and my treating her like a young adult and not a child. I wish you both the best of luck. ",
