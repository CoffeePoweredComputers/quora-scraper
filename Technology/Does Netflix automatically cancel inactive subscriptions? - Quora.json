            "answer_text": " Video streaming platform Netflix announced this Thursday that it'll cancel the subscription of all accounts that haven't been used for a year. Netflix informed via a press release that it will send out emails or in-app notifications to all inactive account users starting this week, asking if they would like to keep their subscription active. Sometimes we happen to subscribe to services that we end up not using. A change in mindset, schedule or lifestyle wastes membership money. While the amount spent on your gym membership is as good as gone, you can at least save some money over your unused Netflix account. \u201cIf they don\u2019t confirm that they need to stay subscribing, we\u2019ll automatically cancel their subscription,\u201d Netflix said. \u201cThese inactive accounts represent less than half of one per cent of our overall member base, only a few hundred thousand, and are already factored into our financial guidance,\u201d it added. The streaming platform said that if anyone changes their mind later, they will easily restart the subscription. If such a user, whose account has been cancelled, rejoins within 10 months, they will still have their favourites, profiles, viewing preferences and account details intact. ",

However, what is not clear right now is when will the company actually start sending those emails and whether it will cancel the subscription after just one email warning or multiple email warnings (let's say four email warnings over the course of two months or so?).
