The music industry is in a totally different stage of existence from the same industry even 10 years ago . I can only suggest thhat you check studios for their work opportunities , and join internet companies that post any new jobs in the creative sector . Don\u2019t expect to find anything that offers a good salary at this time , and be prepared to wait . ",
