            "answer_text": "If you put aside the exploding Note 7, Samsung has been making great looking, reliable phones for many years. Many people, me included, moved away from Samsung when they eliminated the removable battery and the micro SD card slot as those two features are very important to me. The beauty of Android is that you can select a phone with the characteristics that fit your needs. Now they have reintroduced the micro SD card slot. Too late as I shifted my loyalty to LG and the V20 has both features I was looking for. Now, one thing that Samsung does NOT get right is what people call \u201cbloatware\u201d. They load up the phone with software that is mostly useless. And to make it worst, they don\u2019t let you easily remove it. I don\u2019t know a single person who uses \u201cBixby\u201d over the Google Assistant. I don\u2019t know anyone who prefers Samsung\u2019s Music app over all the other much better apps available in the Play Store. ",
