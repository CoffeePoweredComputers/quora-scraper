            "answer_text": "I for one don\u2019t have a 5G phone, so their radiation can\u2019t reach me!! That statement that I just made is irrational. The power level of the frequencies that 5G is so small that they can\u2019t cause any damage. As the Sun puts out more power than any radio system on earth, even with a magnetic shield that the earth provides, you receive more total energy in that band than what a 5G cell antenna puts out. You and every other living creature on the planet have evolved to not get much damage if any from it. These trolls that put out that disinformation on 5G need to get a life and stop unnecessarily scaring people. ",

I have outlived more than half of my high school graduating class and remain in good health. Don\u2019t let FALSE conspiracy theories rule your life. ",
