            "answer_text": "What is \"this institution\"? The closest \"this institution\" to me is the Tampere Yacht Club, because I have my own small sailboat in N\u00e4sij\u00e4rvi as a kind of summer cottage. It has just been raised on the beach for the winter. I don't think the Tampere Yacht Club has much of an impact on global economic activity. The picture below shows my little boat. On a beautiful summer night, we sit on the rock of a small island by a small campfire, frying sausages, drinking beer and chatting. Global economic activity is far from our (campfire) institution as well.  I miss this little institution now that the nights are getting longer and blacker, the days shorter and grayer, and the air is getting colder. ",
