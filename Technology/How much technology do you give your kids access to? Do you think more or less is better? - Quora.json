            "answer_text": "we worldschool, so sometimes when we cannot access books easily (due to country, language etc..) we will search topics together online. Our kids also create their own books online and we publish them on Amazon. They both have kindles which they have hundreds of books on each and can have as much time on these as they chose as it is only books. I think kids definitely learn more being present and in nature, socializing etc\u2026 but in this ever changing world I think technology skills are important too. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there needs to be a happy balance between family, education, electronics time, and exercise. Technology is great and kids need the time to explore it. After all, everything in our lives revolves around technology now. But, kids need to exercise more than just their electronic area of the brain. Education, physical exercise, and family time are all important to a stable life as well. ",
