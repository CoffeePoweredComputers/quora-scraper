            "answer_text": "Academically, according to the US-CERT forensics publication, \u201cDigital forensics is the discipline that combines elements of law and computer science to collect and analyze data from computer systems, networks, wireless communications, and storage devices in a way that is admissible as evidence whether during an investigation inside any organization or in a court of law.\u201d What Digital Forensics sought after is digital evidence when a crime/security breach is committed. This digital evidence is information stored or transmitted in binary form that may be relied on, in court. It can be found on a computer hard drive, a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a CD, a flash card in a digital camera, and many other places. \u201cDigital evidence is commonly associated with electronic crime, or e-crime, such as child pornography or credit card fraud. However, digital evidence is now used to prosecute all types of crimes, not just e-crime,\u201d as the USA National Institute of Justice described it. In digital forensics, it is super important not only to trace the data, but also to look at the means followed to do so. Not everything is allowed when cracking down other people\u2019s devices, as data can be easily manipulated along the way. That is why there is a really strict procedure that cannot be skipped or omitted, called Chain of Custody. This basically lays down all the steps that an investigator must follow to make sure the that data is genuine and as such can be used in a court of law. It is a must-do procedure to record evidence documentation in chronological events. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, In order for you to understand what digital forensics is all about, you need to understand its purpose, especially the end result you want to achieve. The word \u201cforensic\u201d basically means \u201cfor court\u201d which in essence describes the purpose of which ever discipline it is applied to as well. In other words, the only difference between a forensic pathologist and a normal pathologist is that the end result for the forensic pathologist will be to be able to explain his processes and stand up to scrutiny of how he came to his conclusion of the cause of death in a court of law. Same can be applied to digital forensics. Your end result or findings in lieu of an investigation you have done, be it in terms of a criminal case or a civil matter, has to be transparent and be able to withstand the defence poking holes in your procedures used to acquire the relevant evidence to either prove or disprove your case.
