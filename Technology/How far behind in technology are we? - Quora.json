            "answer_text": "I don't think that you're asking a fair question. It's just about impossible to gauge exactly what is being asked. Medical technology could we fit more transistors onto a chip? Quantum computing? Anti gravity? Certainly, we've lost some information due to dogmatic beliefs, but we've also made progress in other areas because of them. We could much more quickly expand our medical knowledge by testing on living human beings, but I shouldn't have to say we shouldn't do that. Why? Because morally, to us right now, it is wrong. Some of Hitler's scientists had no problem doing it, and they made a lot of useful discoveries, but I think that everyone would be fine with scientific progress being \"impeded\" rather than the alternative. So, the church trying to halt some things isn't necessarily a horrible thing to have happened. During the dark ages, we might have lost some \"progress\" in Europe, but the Arab world and most of Asia was still progressing. Your question is impossible to answer unless you very, very specifically define \"progress\". It is not as if no new scientific discoveries were made. It's not entirely possible to measure what impact things had on our level of technology, either. The biggest spurts in technology have seemingly been during the largest wars, but that doesn't mean that it would be better for us to be in a constant world war. Let me try to rephrase the question into something more sensible. Maybe like \"If humans focused exclusively on scientific pursuits instead of wasting time with religion, art, music, or anything that doesn't get us measurably ahead as a species, how much cooler would my car be?\" I think you can quickly see why it's not a fair question: progress made in things that aren't science is progress as well. Would we have discovered the usefulness of electricity earlier if the church didn't want to burn people? I don't know, but it's a critical thing for virtually all of our technology now (even things which don't use electricity require it to be manufactured or designed). I suppose you could break down your question into things like 'what if we discovered most electrical properties 200 years earlier than we did, and no religious institution got in the way'. In which case, I don't know, it's a question for a history major who has really studied the emergence of technology over time, not a scientist. Here is a brief personal opinion: If all humans were medical researchers, physicists, engineers, or at least DIY/tinkerer types, and had been since the end of the Roman empire... I have literally no idea how much farther we would be, because nobody knows where we're headed. We would hopefully have eradicated nearly all disease, hunger, and thirst from the world, but that's dependant on society more than our technology. We have the technology to do the last two already, at least. I don't know if we'd have cooler spaceships or colonies on mars- it might not be practical to even do that- but, again, that's more dependant on society than technology. With the technology we have right now if NASA had a much larger budget (maybe continued heavy funding after the moon landings) we could be doing all those things fairly easily. There's no huge reason why we couldn't make a manned mission to mars, or To one of Saturn's moons (I'd go to Titan). It's not that our technology isn't there, it's more that the funding isn't. (Aside from a few small problems like increased radiation and prolonged periods in microgravity, both of which could be solved extremely inefficiently now but potentially get better later). So, another thing to look at would be how much our level of technology would be different if we had increased funding. We're going to hit the point where we have the max number of transistors placed as close together as possible on a chip. We're going to expand that further into 3 dimensions and still hit a limit where we can't get them closer, we can't make a more efficient architecture, and we can't cool them fast enough. That point is going to hit us soon and we'll turn to quantum computing, or who knows what else. If the government dumped a lot of money, put a lot of people onto trying to progress faster, we would go faster. I just wrote a lot of poorly organized thoughts out, but the main point is this: your question is not a fair question, nor is it answerable. It's impossible to know all that we lost or to measure how much scientific progress was impeded because of religion, or morality. It's impossible to guess how much further along we could be unless we know exactly what things will emerge in the future. ",
