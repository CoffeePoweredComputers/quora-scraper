            "answer_text": "Not everyone agrees that knowledge can be found in works of art.[1] [2] The problem is that when we think of knowledge we often think of \u2018scientific knowledge\u2019. Artists working today may find themselves in an uneasy position unsure of where art fits in a modern scientific world. Artists may feel the heat to compete with the sciences and prove that art is valuable in the sense that it can also provide knowledge. Here, I aim to persuade you that art is indeed capable of providing us with some kinds of knowledge of our world. Let us first be clear about what scientific knowledge is. Scientific knowledge is testable knowledge: it is factual knowledge of our world that we can talk about. Scientific knowledge is also empirical: it can be measured through observation and experiment. This could be something as simple as knowing the answer to questions such as: \u2018How many sandwiches did you eat today?\u2019 or \u2018Has the temperature changed over the last 100 years?\u2019 Given the current trend for combining art and science you would be forgiven for thinking that knowledge from art and knowledge from science held an equal footing. However, it is important to remember that while science has strict guidelines for transferring knowledge, art has none. Art does not just affect us, it informs us. Like all information, we can use art to build a rich picture of the world beyond which we interact everyday. One way art does this is by giving us a kind of conceptual knowledge: knowledge about our own concepts.[3] Conceptual knowledge can include our own feelings or mental states, such as having empathy for others.[4] Art then, cannot only inform us of our own mind but also give us a feeling of \u2018what it is like\u2019 to be someone else. Art can be a way of walking in someone else\u2019s shoes. ",
