Phones in my town had just converted to dial service from operator service. It was \u201cThe Black and White era\u201d. I remember my first day back at the \u201cSchool House\u201d and I had on my brand new shoes, pants and shirt! I was high-falutin! Once a year I got new school clothes, unless my older brother hit a growth spurt and outgrew his clothes. Some kids showed off their new haircuts. Bill Newman arrived one fall morning I would guess in \u201859 at our brand new school, sporting his Mohawk!!! I was lucky enough to see him that morning. As my memory shows, his hall locker was near mine and there he stood. Putting his coat and lunch in his locker looking PROUD! He was so \u201coutstanding\u201d his do was noticed by the teachers. I can only imagine the rest of what happened. He was escorted to the Principal\u2019s Office. Asked one question: \u201cWHYYYYYYY\u2026\u2026??????\u201d The next time I saw him, the next day, he looked \u201cnormal\u201d\u2026 Original Question: Older generation, what was the equivalent during your time to showing off a sleek smartphone like today?

Traditionally, for the 16+ crowd, this would be filled by the automobile that the person owns, unfortunately. It was this very attachment of a costly environmentally destructive item that really extracts loads of ongoing money from their owner that -ahem- \u2018paved the way\u2019 for the scum who make combustion engine automobiles and run oil companies to become the cancerous stain on civilization that they are. In fact, as I recall from propaganda footage, cars were billed in the 1950\u2019s as synonymous with \u201cfreedom\u201d. Do note that this was done in a nation which fancies themselves by their long passed national character of \u201cthe land of the free\u201d. Genius bit of advertising that will land some folk in a very deep dark pit in Hell. So yeah, \u201ccars\u201d were the cell phone of the boomers, and I suppose game consoles were the cell phones of Gen X-ers and Gen Y-ers perhaps it was personal computers, which leads us to Millennial's for whom the cell phone was the cell phone.
