            "answer_text": "One of the safest places to be protected from radiation is a major medical facility such as a hospital, clinic, etc. Their use of x-ray machines, radioisotopes, etc., assure that there are locations that are limited to qualified and credentialed personnel. These areas are clearly marked with the yellow and magenta radiation signs and restricted to the majority of hospital workers. Furthermore, the use of x-ray machines, radiotherapy linear accelerators and handling of radioactive materials are limited to trained personnel. Radioactive materials, in particular, are locked in their proper storage areas. Their handling and preparation are in designated areas and these procedures must follow the letter of the regulations for their use. When they are in use, only approved medical staff may be present. Violation of the institution\u2019s radiation safety regulations and protocols usually lead to termination of privileges and/or employment. Essentially, the medical center, facility, clinic, etc., protect the medical staff from inadvertent violations of its radiation safety protocols. In other words, if not assigned to radiation risk areas, keep out. ",

            "answer_text": "Typically by exclusion. That is standing is designated areas which are behind shielding. The shielding can contain mechanisms that also manipulation of radioactive components behind the shield. I if ever had x-rays performed, the operator stands behind a shield when the machine is actually operating. In veterinary medicine when animals do not remain still on their own, the persons holding the animal wear a dosimeter to measure radiation exposure and wear lead-lined aprons and gloves. To minimize radiation exposure in the veterinary medicine field, anesthetizing the animal is now preferred vice people hold the animal. ",
