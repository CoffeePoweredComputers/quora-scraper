            "answer_text": "It\u2019s largely a question of scale: you should outsource more when you\u2019re smaller. There is always some added value to taking more control of your infrastructure. It\u2019s not necessarily a big benefit, might not be worth it, but there always is some. Being in the cloud inherently means you\u2019ll be exposed to some threats that you won\u2019t face in a colo. And being on-prem eliminates some threats you face in the colo. Of course, you also take on costs and responsibility. Cost is fairly easy to analyze: you need to be confident that your physical security is better than at the colo, that your network is tight, you need to plan for upgrades and maintenance, etc. Responsibility is an interesting factor, since corp-heads will inevitably want to outsource that: to hire someone to blame, CYA-style. A competent bank, of sufficient size, should be better at security than a colo or cloud site, though. After all, security is the purpose of a bank. Yes, it\u2019s entirely possible to imagine a colo or even cloud site that was specialized to provide bank service. You\u2019d expect it to be substantially more expensive, and specifically to avoid non-bank customers. By the principle of market equilibrium, its price would be very close to the cost of in-sourcing. ",

            "answer_text": "Should banks build their own data centers, migrate to the cloud or go with a colocation provider? Banks do build their own data centers. Often, those same banks, will also use co-location providers (such as Switch). Depending upon the application and the data type, they may also use some of the Hyperscaler (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.). Regulation for data locality for the financial industry is its own thing, too, and compliance is a big deal. As long as you\u2019re in compliance, the actual physical manifestation of your solution can vary. Banks - even small banks - are not immune to these regulations and have to ensure that the data protection and security are compliant, which means that how the physical location is formed (locating the physical servers in a building that they own or that someone else owns) isn\u2019t as important.
