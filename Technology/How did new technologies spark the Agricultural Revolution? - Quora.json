            "answer_text": "The new technology involving the horse and plow made an enormous difference.It enabled a farmer to increase the land being cropped by several orders of magnitude. The Industrial Revolution gave rise to the motorized tractor, which increased the ability to farm land several more magnitudes. The development of specialized seeds, soil management, crop rotation, more advanced machinery increased production much more.
