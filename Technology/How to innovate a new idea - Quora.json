            "answer_text": "First, there is a sense of urgency I have a set of changing goals, things that need to be solved. I have a gift few have, the ability to make connections. What I will do is fix all the elements in my mind and then do something else. I have a little pillow and I may lie down for a bit on the floor. I have learned to catch little thoughts as they occur and write them down on a notes app on my phone. As a marketer, you want to understand what is going on with your category. Is it new or old, is it growing or declining? Why does it exist? When did the category even start? What are the basic needs that someone is trying to solve when they are in your category? How well do the current solutions do the job? Is there a gap you can exploit? How do they feel about your solution? The biggest challenge for most new marketers is to set aside all the well-known truths about your category and the common myths believe by your superiors and coworkers. That takes fundamental guts but this where research can help you. You want to get enough money to do research to validate your position and direction. Then build from there. Dig, dig, dig. Back in the early 80s I got the Tropical Blend Suntan business. Everyone thought that dark tanning days were over. It was hot in the mid to late 60s but all those people are now 40 years old and concerned about wrinkling and the overall time commitment to getting a dark tan. I believed there was still a market out there and it would be worth it the company they have a re-stage of the Tropical Blend Brand. Through secondary research, I was able to find what the distribution was of melanin content in the skin. With good melanin, you could get a dark tan. About 10% of population had elevated levels of melanin. They didn\u2019t have to spend a long time in the sun to get a tan and look beautiful and different. My position was the segment of high melanin skin tanners was big enough to target. Together with my artist, we developed new packaging and new formulations, which included more moisturizers and a lighter fragrance to pay for it all. That year sales rose from $13,500,000 to $22,000,000 after declining for five years in a row. Never let someone shoot from the hip when it comes to your business, quash them with research. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are a few principles to guide you in your innovative thinking: Change where you're headed Learn to have a vision of the end state. To push innovation, set goals that are a stretch. Let me share an example: the Rocky Mountain Flatbread Company, worked with Canadian nonprofit The Natural Step to create their vision of a sustainable restaurant. That vision included deriving 100 percent of their energy from renewable sources, having zero waste and zero carbon impact, and encouraging people to live more sustainably. Today, Rocky Mountain's three restaurants are carbon neutral, use local produce for their zero-waste menu and purchase green electricity -- efforts that earned the company a big helping of green business awards. Try using \"back-casting,\" not forecasting. For radical improvements, start with a vision of the future and work backward to today. This type of goal-setting is called \"back-casting\" and is the opposite of forecasting. Forecasting examines what happened in the past to plan for the future, and it delivers only minor incremental improvements. Try lots of stuff See what works. Emphasize the up on stuff that works quickly. Quickly kill stuff that doesn\u2019t work. Learn, revel, and repeat. Start small Peter Drucker once wrote, \u201cEffective innovations start small. They are not grandiose.\u201d He was spot on. Take a look at any big thing and, inevitably, it modest origins. Microsoft became one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies by focusing on software, an area so inconsequential at the time that IBM was willing to write it off. Apple made a splash with the Macintosh in large part by capitalizing on innovations that Xerox tossed aside. The great thing about thinking small is that you can risk failure because failure is sustainable. You can falter, pick yourself up and try again. Eventually, you\u2019ll get it right, and when you do, there are no limits. If you can survive, you can thrive. Think broadly: Game Changing Ideas ... What is Holding Yours Back? Challenge conventional wisdom Ask employees for ideas and remember no idea is unworthy of consideration. Your employees see opportunities every day for saving money or doing things better. Ask for their ideas. At the U.S. Postal Service, 850 employee-led \"Green Teams\" helped save $52 million related to water, energy, fuel and waste and generated $24 million in new revenue through recycling. Place priority on getting outdated knowledge out of your mind Challenge the way you've always done things. Maybe you could get materials from sustainable sources or buy wind- or solar-powered electricity. If it used to be too expensive to use hybrid vehicles in your delivery fleet, maybe that's no longer the case. Connect the dots While we like to think of innovators being lonely men on the mountain, only coming down, like Nietzsche\u2019s Zarathustra, to proclaim great revelations, the truth is that important breakthroughs usually come from synthesizing ideas from different domains. One famous historical example is that of the discovery of genetics. In 1865, when Gregor Mendel published his groundbreaking study of inheritance of characteristics in pea plants, it went nowhere. It had taken nearly a half century before the concept was combined with Darwin\u2019s natural selection to unleash a torrent of innovations in medicine and science. A more recent example is the Apple ecosystem. There were plenty of digital music players around when Steve Jobs launched the i-Pod, but he combined his player with i-Tunes, which made content both more accessible and palatable to music companies. He then threw new products into the mix \u2013 the i-Phone, i-Pad, and Siri \u2013 creating more combinations and greater value.
