            "answer_text": "In marine power system projects I have seen in recent years there has been a lot of interest in energy storage to help with the power systems bridging the period while there was a problem with the prime source of power. In every case the only viable technology has been some form of battery. With the current technologies the costs only allow either very short term power or longer term control system power. There is a great deal of money being invested in battery technology but as yet its too costly for larger capacities. ",

            "answer_text": "There are. You can pump water to a higher place and store energy in the form of potential energy, then you can discharge it by letting it flow back through a generator. You can also store energy in capacitors, or by stretching a rubber band. There are many other ways. Batteries (storing electrical energy as chemical energy) just happen to be the best for most applications. And there is obviously a lot of research into making better batteries. ",
