            "answer_text": "I think a big part of \"science\" is discovery, observation, & testing a hypothesis you have developed. I just gave a \"Scientist's Notebook\" sort of thing that I made up for a little 9-year-old's birthday gift. I had all the things at home! I had a fabric (stiff--like an artist's portfolio holder) file folder w/handles.  It had about 8 folder dividers that you could label.  Inside I put 2 very fine-point black ink pens that my husband uses in his research notebooks at work; I told him that w/practice he will get used to writing w/the fine-pointed pens. Then I had a graph paper notebook the size of a steno notepad (anyone here know how to write Gregg's steno symbols? Probably not! I excelled in high school & the dictaphone!!).  I told him how to write his notes for each day including any sketches or graphs, etc. & at the end of the day to draw 2 dark lines at the bottom of his entry & date it, sign it, & have a witness sign it (for patent protection). Index cards were included for him to write his sources when he writes a scientific paper or a creative writing project that he had to do research. Included also were a nice grade white sketch pad w/colored pencils to take on hikes & walks to sketch any observations you make that are interesting or exciting or just plain gorgeous. Let's see if I can remember everything else:  A pair of safety glasses; a magnifying glass w/a handle; different sizes & colors of post-it type sticky notes to mark pages in books & to write notes on those pages that you can't use a highlighter on; highlighters in different colors; latex-free gloves for handling \"specimens\"... I can't remember all else, but we have had fun going out on scouting hikes to see what we can discover.  I told him if he discovers a new species that no one has ever identified before, he can name it. ",

            "answer_text": "-Get them reading.  That's a fairly general answer, but if they are readers, put appropriate material in their way -- books on dinosaurs, planets and so on.  My own interest was nurtured by Isaac Asimov.  If they're not readers, start reading yourself where they can see you, and they will imitate you and learn that reading is an enjoyable activity.  Make reading something that family does together, then add science and profit!  Zoobooks and National Geographic World are two good children's science magazines -- Zoos sell them and you can get subscriptions. Engage in activities.  Visit museums, planetariums and zoos; explore the local park or campground; watch an anthill or a worm; stargaze; watch airplanes and ships pass by.  You can see quite a lot of stuff in the night sky even with fairly inexpensive binoculars, and if you flip them around and look thru the big end they double as microscopes. Engage in active play.  Dig in the back yard; build paper airplanes and boats and try to improve them; make paper windmills; build towers from blocks; construct things with straws and paperclips; watch a garden grow; run a race; learn to swim; play with water. I recommend any books by Sara B. Stein -- especially The Science Book and The Evolution Book.  They're packed with games and activities for kids.  Mostly out of print, but your library may have them.
