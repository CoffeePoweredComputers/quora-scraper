            "answer_text": "Most of human civilization has been developed in the last 50,000 years or so, but I wouldn\u2019t consider it advanced. The advanced (not naturally occurring) stuff has only been created in the last 200 years or so. If an advanced civilization developed on earth sometime in the past, it might have developed in less than 50,000 years, and the advanced part of that may only have lasted 200 years or so. That\u2019s the needle. (If it was an alien civilization from outer space, it would have been an advanced civilization from day 1, and would only have been present for the duration of their stay.) If we limit our search to only those civilizations which may have developed during the two most recent geologic ages (the Quaternary and the Neogene) then our haystack is only 23 million years long. It\u2019s at least possible there\u2019s a needle hidden in there somewhere. Let\u2019s turn this question around and look at it from a different point of view. How would we (as 21st century humans) go about leaving evidence of our existence to be found by a future civilization (or perhaps space travelers) 23 million years from now?  Small artifacts (like a monolith) would be impossible to locate. Large physical forms (think pyramids, canals, man-made lakes) would likely be unrecognizable after 10,000 years. Continents can completely re-form in the space of 200 million years or so. The best bet would be something like the global carbon dioxide levels. The changes we\u2019ve make in the last 200 years are severe enough to have only a single likely cause, and broad enough to be found by any future civilization no matter where on earth they look. But I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d be able to tell the difference between an unusual but natural Extinction event (like a huge comet impact) and a self-induced man-made one. We\u2019d all be dead anyway, and they probably wouldn\u2019t care. Or, as Asimov put it: Silly Asses ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it's a possibility\u2026. Not that we would be able to tell. Our species has been around for 300,000 years. Apart from scant bodily remains, stone hand axes, the odd cave painting and some arrowheads, there's precious little evidence of us before roughly 10000 BCE. We only started to impact our global environment a couple of hundred years ago with the Industrial Revolution. That's a blink of an eye in geological time. If our civilisation died out tomorrow, within a few thousand years nearly all evidence of our ingenuity (and hubris) will have decomposed or have been worn away by the weather and by geological processes. The only things that would remain on Earth would be our spent radioactive materials and certain plastics. This too would be gone in a few million years. In our absence, any man-made changes to the planet's terrain, biosphere and climate would quickly revert to a wild state. The only lasting monument to our civilisation would be the abandoned wreckage from our expeditions to the Moon and beyond. Effectively we would have arrived, prospered and departed in a geological instant, with almost nothing to show for our existence. Assuming our civilisation is typical of past advanced civilisations (which we don't know), this could mean that any evidence of past advanced civilisations would be lost just as quickly and absolutely in deep geological time. If we are in fanciful mood, we could look at the geological record to look for 'civilisation markers', for example periods of rapid global temperature increase analogous to the climate change we are creating ourselves. One example is the Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum roughly 55 MYA, where a global warming of 5 to 8C occurred over a 20000 year period following the injection of a vast amount of carbon dioxode into the atmosphere. Unfortunately correlation doesn't imply causation. The PETM is more likely to be a consequence of a temporary imbalance in the Carbon cycle creating positive Climate change feedback than the action of intelligent beings. Ultimately we are in similar territory as the search for extraterrestrial life. Just because something is possible that doesn't mean that is likely, especially when there is zero evidence to support the assertion. ",
