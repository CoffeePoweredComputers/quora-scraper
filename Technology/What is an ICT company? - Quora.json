            "answer_text": "What is an ICT company? Let us tackle the term / concept of ICT first. ICT as a term does not have a standard definition or it is not part of a standard or a framework. It was a necessity based invention by organisations and industry bodies to convey an \u201cintegration\u201d or centralisation of solutions from two mainstream technology based industries - IT and Telecommunications. At least that\u2019s how it seems to have started. Broadly ICT (which stands for Information and Communication Technology) can be said to comprise of 2 main areas: Information technology \u2013 this area relates to technology and technical mechanisms for processing, transforming and managing information to suitable means to aid business processes. This also encompassing managing and administrating systems and IT equipmentTelecommunications technology \u2013 this covers cabling, wireless, switching, transmission, radio frequency, and optical communications media and internet protocol networks. Electronic communications is a means for the information to transcend network boundaries - go from a point A to point B.For the last 3\u20135 years we can also consider a third facet of Digitalisation or Digital transformation, which is the practise of converting information in a physical format to a digital one ( which can be extrapolated to converting manual tasks to technology based electronic tasks) as part of the ICT concept. ICT as a term originated as a need for companies to address growing client requirements for end to end IT and communication technology solutions. Typically we would not see companies provides all possible services in both IT and Telecommunications space, it would be a business risk to dabble it too many different and distinct technologies - ICT companies could provide technology or device supports or advisory support to client needs in one of the two core areas. Essentially ICT does not replace IT and Telecommunication industries. ",
