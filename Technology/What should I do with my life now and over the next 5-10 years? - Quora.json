            "answer_text": "So I am a 21 year old kid who just got suspended from a CSU in Southern California for a year. I'm about a sophomore and a half as a Mechanical Engineering major and I'm looking to take summer classes/classes at a different institution to catch up. I also enjoy DJ'ing and am learning to mix/master House/EDM music. I have had sex 1 time since turning 18 and would like more of that, but I don't seem to click with anyone besides this one girl who I fell deeply in love with since I was 19 and she's who got me suspended because I wouldn't leave her alone (media-wise/digital-contact wise). I just got over a phase of psychosis that lasted until just recently after taking 8 tabs of strong acid in a year. I've done plenty of drugs (nothing with needles or crack or meth or extremely fatal shit). I've already met many people and I have experienced lots of things like a DUI (on record), suspension from school (on record), and partying (off-record lol). I feel like i'm set back because of this suspension and I have a few passions like: JDM'ing my Honda Civic, music, DJ'ing, staying healthy, finishing my Mechanical Engineering degree and becoming a famous EDM artist. I am also very healthy and sober, but sometimes I want to do drugs and have sex. But haven't in about 2 years. My dreams are to drive a JDM'd Honda Civic which I'm almost close to, becoming a professional producer which I believe I can do within 5 years, and working as a hot shot in a large building for engineering. Oh ya, I also want to get laid a lot by girls but I'm afraid I'll never fall in love with another girl (referring to the one who got me expelled). I am about to turn 22 and I'm goodlooking, 5'10\", smart, and artistic. I tend to panic though and feel like I'll never become anything if I'm not pursuing my goals 24/7 and I lost lots of friends now. Almost all my 500+ friends I made in college think I'm weird or crazy. But I'm just nice and feel the need to work to become successful. Why am I so lonely? And will I have time to become successful? And if I want to be somewhat successful when I'm older what should I do now? Haha am I worrying too much? Please give me life advice so I can have sex, do very seldom drugs, have friends, be successful, and accomplish my dreams. ",
