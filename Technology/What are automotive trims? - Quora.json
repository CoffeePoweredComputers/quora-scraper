            "answer_text": "Automotive interiors mainly known as automotive trims are largely made up of plastic components. Thus it requires one to have good knowledge of plastic parts, mold design and some crash worthiness standards for his/her advantage. To further exploit opportunities in automotive interior trims, one should have good knowledge of CAD tool (may be CATIA) along with fundamentals of plastics, plastic terminologies, molding practices, manufacturing processes etc. Most of the plastic parts are manufactured by injection molding. These parts mostly have lot of styling involved. One should have good hold on tool features like surfacing, sweep / multi-section, model parametrization and assembling.
