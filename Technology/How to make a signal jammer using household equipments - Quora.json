            "answer_text": "It would be easy for somebody who knows electronics and radio. If it was powerful enough to jam anything at any distance authorities would triangulate on it in a second and be on you like a duck on a june bug. I was headed to a harbor festival in my boat some years ago when the mike on somebody\u2019s boat was stuck open and effectively jammed vhf channel 16, the international hailing and distress frequency, in the bay near the busy harbor. All we could hear on the channel was a loud outboard and people having a good time. Within a very few minutes a couple of coast guard and a police boat converged on him and the frequency was clear. It was an accident so they just let him know his mike was stuck. If it had been malicious he\u2019d be arrested and charged with a felony. If you want to jam cellphones or other receivers, maybe you can build a Faraday cage around your abode or place of business? That\u2019s a passive device, can\u2019t be detected from afar. The room for our EEG rig in grad school for neuro psych was built with copper wire screen in the walls. It sucked the RF out of the air and put it into the ground. I\u2019m not sure if a Faraday cage is illegal anywhere, but jamming is illegal everywhere\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Your question: \u201cHow do I make a signal jammer using household equipments?\u201d It is not difficult if you have the right electronic equipment. But the phrase \u201chousehold equipments\u201d [sic] might make it difficult if it is not ther appropriate electronics gear. And the success will depend on the frequencies you are trying to jam and how far. However, and this is very important, making and using a signal jammer is illegal in all countries. The regulatory authorities do not like people who disrupt communications in this way and will take action. And, btw, It is pretty easy to track down a jammer \u2026 they are after all transmitting their location pretty obviously! ",
