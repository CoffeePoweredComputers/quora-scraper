            "answer_text": "There are too many animals that came before and after the dinosaurs to single out each species that was dominant in its environment during its time. Dinosaurs were an entire group of animals, not a single species. The idea of a single species that dominates the entire world is somewhat wrong in fact, given the many diverse environments that exist (one could argue that humans do so, tho even then there are areas we cannot access). Lions may be one of the apex predators in the African savannah, but in other areas they don\u2019t exist, simply because they wouldn\u2019t be able to thrive there. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t find lions in the rainforest for example. But I\u2019m getting off track. The point I\u2019m trying to make is that dinosaurs were a very large and diverse group of animals and there was not a single species that was dominant throughout the entirety of the Mesozoic and that they weren\u2019t even dominant in every environment (dinosaurs never ruled the seas and the skies were mostly dominated by Pterosaurs).That being said, just like Dinosaurs as a group were the dominant animals on land during most of the Mesozoic, there were other large groups of animals that were dominant before and after them. The easiest Era to find the answer for is the Cenozoic, the time after the dinosaurs. As it should be obvious, the dominant life forms during this time were the mammals and they still are today. Now, as I mentioned earlier however, there are some exceptions to that. Especially during the early Cenozoic, crocodiles still had a very important role. The Sebecosuchia for example were terrestrial metasuchians that existed until the Miocene. For a long period of time birds, namely the Phorusrhacidae, were the dominant predators in South America. And Megalania was a giant monitor lizard that lived in Australia only around 50.000 years ago. So as you can see, while mammals were overall the dominant group of animals after the death of the dinosaurs, there were other groups of animals that challenged their supremacy in more isolated environments. Regular birds are still easily the dominant species in the air, despite the fact that flying mammals exist. Finding a dominant group of animals for the Paleozoic and Early Triassic is much harder tho. During the earliest stages of the Paleozoic, land was uninhabited. The dominant groups of that time were invertebrates such as molluscs and arthropods (trilobites, eurypterids). As time went on fish became a much larger presence and while there were some animals that ventured out onto land, it took until the Devonian that one could really see diversity in terrestrial life. While arthropods started to take over the land during this time, the Devonian is known as the Age of Fish, since fish started to establish themselves as major players in the water (a position that they never gave up, despite the fact that reptiles and mammals all have groups that adapted to and thrived in the ocean). At the end of the Devonian, the first fish started to crawl on land. Even with that, arthropods continued to dominate during the Carboniferous with amphibians being important as well. The time of the reptiles eventually came with the Permian. The massive forests of the Carboniferous disappeared, the giant arthropods went extinct and so did many of the large amphibians. The drier climate lead to the dominate groups being different types of reptiles. Synapsids, the ancestors of the mammals being of great importance. Pareiasaurs, large anapsids thrived during that time as well. Then the Permian mass extinction took place, ending the Paleozoic and starting the Mesozoic. The Triassic was simply a weird time. There were groups of synapsids still around (Placerias and Lystrosaurus for example), while archosaurs started to take over various niches. Phytosaurs, Aetosaurians, Rauisuchians and eventually the first dinosaurs. So basicallyFirst arthropods that eventually took over the land while fish started to rule the sea.Amphibians started to share the land with large insects, fish remained dominant in the sea.Synapsids and other reptiles flourished in the dry climate of the Permian, fish stay in the water, arthropods and amphibians lose importance.Archosaurs start to take over various niches while synapsids start to lose importance.Out of the various groups of archosaurs, the dinosaurs managed to gain the advantage and spread across the land, leaving the skies to pterosaurs and the water to different types of reptiles, which claimed the spot as top predator together with sharks.Dinosaurs go extinct and mammals rise.Crocodiles and birds remain top predators in isolated environments until the Late Cenozoic.Whales and seals adapt to fill niches in the oceans, where fish remain one of the most important groups nonetheless.
