            "answer_text": "Sensor Technology A sensor is a device that detects some kind of input from the physical environment and gives feedback. Specific input can be one of a large number of light, heat, speed, humidity, pressure or other environmental events. The output is usually an indication that converts sensor space to human-readable performance or is broadcast electronically on a network for reading or further processing. The Internet of Things (IoT) could not exist without smart sensors, and the growing use of smart technology is already transforming how manufacturers implement the IoT. Smart sensors are also bringing more connectivity and analytics to the supply chain. There are some things to know about how and why this is happening. First, smart sensors are the indispensable enablers of the IoT and the industrial IoT. Smart sensors, including radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, serve three broad purposes. They identify items, locate them and determine their environmental conditions, all of which have major implications for the supply chain and manufacturing. Smart sensors are particularly useful in plants or warehouses because they can keep track of temperature and humidity, log data for historical records and quality management, or be used as triggers for alarms or process management. Second, smart sensors impact the supply chain by being embedded in products, which can help improve the manufacturing process or the products themselves. sensor can live inside products to create same products and new revenue sources from the enhanced features. They can also permeate the manufacturing process to monitor, control, and improve operations, or be added to logistics to streamline how products are delivered. There are a number of specific purposes of sensors, such as measuring temperature, humidity, vibrations, motion, light, pressure and altitude. Companies will need to develop new applications to take advantage of all the big data that the sensors are generating. Read more ",

            "answer_text": "A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The specific input could be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure, or any one of a great number of other environmental phenomena. The output is generally a signal that is converted to human-readable display at the sensor location or transmitted electronically over a network for reading or further processing. The studies of neuroscience and engineering show us how the human brain and sensors are similar to human-made computers and robots, as far as their functioning. New findings show us that mathematical principles similar to those used in human brains and systems are useful for electrical, mechanical and biological engineers as they continue to devise better robots, computers and sensors. Engineer-designed sensors are used in a wide variety of applications, examples include speedometers, touchscreens, microphones, baby monitors, nightlights and medical ultrasound imaging. In growing fields such as biological engineering and systems neurobiology, engineers are becoming increasingly involved in human body research and efforts to replicate the functioning of its many systems. For instance, engineers are designing walking robots with sensors, artificial organs such as hearts and livers, and bio-sensors that monitor sugar levels for diabetics. Computer programming is a component of many modern engineering designs. As students design robot programs throughout this unit, they must have a \"goal\" or \"concept\" of what the program solution needs to do and how, before they begin writing the code. Then, the process of working on the code and \"debugging\" it inherently constitutes \"revising and improving their designs based on the results of testing.\" Thus, the thought processes required to code programs that meet problem constraints are very similar, if not identical, to the thought processes required for traditional engineering design of physical objects and products.
