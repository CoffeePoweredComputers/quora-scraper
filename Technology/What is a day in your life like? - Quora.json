(20 minutes) 9.20 am: Talk to manager about night production, do my daily accounting entries on computer & take out necessary printouts. 10.00 am: Take bath, get ready. 10.40 am: Leave for office, self drive, listen to romantic music. 11.30 am: Reach office. 11.30 am to 12.30 pm: Take a round of factory, inspect final products, check current production status, talk to workers, give fresh orders, take stock if necessary, make deliveries. 12.30 to 2.00 pm: Reach office, Make calls, make sales, do all entries, update my records, important planning, stock procurement, updations. 2.00 pm to 2.30 pm: Lunch, watch Travel XP, NDTV Good Times, History TV and other travel channels. 2.30 pm to 5 pm: Working hours again. 5 pm to 5.30 pm: Prepare my daily balance sheet to calculate value addition. 5.30 to 6.15 pm: Another round of factory to check proper functioning. 6.15 to 7.00 pm: Plan for next day. 7.00 pm to 8.00 pm: Drive back home. 8.00 pm to 12 am: Me time (until and unless monthly accounting has to be done) I may do any of the following activities- Go to mall, go for a short walk with wife, visit a temple, watch YouTube, write on Quora, visit In-laws, eat dinner, drink tea with wife, drink a little beer or scotch (only occasionally), talk to mother.

            "answer_text": "On a weekday? i'd wake up an ungodly hour of 5am and lumbers off to the kitchen and contemplate on life as I brew coffee. As the brewed coffee filled the air in the kitchen, my grandma would wake up and turn the radio on while she makes breakfast. I'd talk with her while making my own bento lunch box because I am more often too lazy to leave the office to buy food down on the ground floor of the office building. The *ping* sound of Kakaotalk would be the minor background notes while I eat breakfast. After some quick chatting, I'd take a quick shower, hastily wear a decent outfit for work, shove my wallet, ID, and other essential stuff in my bag. Grandma would hand my lunchbox and I am off the front gate of the house way before my cat escapes and follows me. Once I catch the bus that'll give me at max, a 45min commute to the office. I'll leisurely take my time to walk from the bus stop to the building while listening to some music. As I get to the building, the security guard would tap his hat up to say \u201cg'morning\u201d and I'd give a quick nod before dashing to the elevator. The stainless steel doors would've showed my haggard reflection of myself as I pressed the button for the 10th floor. My hair is obviously windblown from the long bus ride, the shadows under my eyes seemed more prominent in the morning as I'd only gotten several hours of sleep. When I turned down the hall, the door to the office would be unlocked, and my co-workers would had probably begun eating breakfast and gossiping about their weekend. Work would have begun by 9am and being an hour early, I would get on Quora and start answering questions. Often through the morning, it would be a busy time writing up copies for clients, phonecalls from printers, edits from clients to be redirectedti the art department, and sneaking peeks into Quora when not busy. When lunch time rolls in, I'd eat lunch on my table watching an anime or kdrama, all while half listening to my co-workers and boss chatting near the pantry. By 12:30nn the office would have rec time. Most would play the viral questions game that would let them earn points. I don't necessarily play, but I would watch them, and often they would ask me for the answers too before the timer runs out. After the game the lazy afternoon begins. The long hours of 1pm to 4pm are rather dull, but writing kept me busy. In between work load, I would place an hour or so time to continue writing the stories I am doing. However it does depend whether my co-worker directly beside my desk would breathe down my neck like an annoying hawk. On a slow day, I could have finished my work earlier and write fiction till the bell tolls to say work is done. By 6:30pm, I'd head to the bus stop again, and catch the night bus to go home. With a longer commute with all the sluggish traffic along the main highways, I tend to sleep it out. By the time I'd wake up at my stop, it'll be two hours later. Though the peacefulness of the evening made the long walk from rhe bus station to the tricycles that would lead me home made feel at peace. At 9pm, I would had been eating dinner with my grandma and tell how my day went. I'd then change clothes afterward, and then do the dishes before I plopped on my bed and go online. I would be on the internet through only a couple of hours before going to sleep..then i would repeat the cycle again. ",
