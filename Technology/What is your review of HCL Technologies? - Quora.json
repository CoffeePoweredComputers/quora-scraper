            "answer_text": "\u2605 I joined HCL as a fresher in 2014 for the post of \"Software Engineer\". I had joined on 22nd August 2014. According to me, it is the most useless, pointless, worthless company I've ever worked in. Then I left HCL on 30th Nov 2015. In HCL, more than 85% projects are of Support: according to their HR. HCL is not a place for sincere and talented people. Their policy \"Employee First Customer Second\" is a total fake. Probably, it is the most \"Kanjoos\" company of India. If you are good in coding(especially competitive coding) then HCL is definitely not a place for you. Their role-based CTC is the Worst policy I've ever came across. Pre-joining phase:When I received shortlisting mail - it read \"3.25 LPA all fixed no variable\" after which there were some interview rounds. After selection, I received, the Letter of Intent(LOI) which just said that our(me and people from my batch) CTC would be \"3.25 LPA.\" Then after accepting the LOI, I received an appointment letter which stated that the CTC would be \"upto 3.25 LPA.\" Naturally what I and others understood was there would be some portion of CTC which could be performance bonus and that was natural. But when I received the joining letter(JL), it read that CTC would be \"upto 3.25 LPA\" and other portions of the letter stated that the CTC would depend on the role. More so, the joining was 3 days later after receiving it. \"I felt cheated.\" After joining phase:For the first 3 months, I did not received any specialized training but were put directly into the project, worked on projects but received the salary of trainee which was INR 18000 and even this salary had numerous components like PF, Performance bonus etc. All in all, I and others received some 14.5k in hand. Since the beginning, they started putting people randomly into the projects with random roles; most of people from my batch were put into Support role(CTC 2.75LPA), some into QA profile(CTC 2.75 LPA) and some others into Development role (CTC 3.0 LPA). Not more than 2 people out of our 190 odd batch, they put into ERP/SAP profiles (CTC 3.25 LPA). This trend continued in the later batches also. Over the period June 2014- February 2015, there were approx 6-7 batches and I observed that the same thing happened. I did not met a person who was receiving 3.25 LPA CTC and was not in support. Besides, all this allotment was totally random. They were no tests conducted, which decided where were to be put. And that aggravated our cause because, were deserved equal salaries and salary equivalent to 3.25 LPA. They had no justification as to how the people were differentiated. All they would say is that it was according to business requirement. So does Business requirement means you cheat with an employee? In the 5th month's salary(Dec salary), they deducted our salary because till the 4th month we received salary according to 3.25LPA and so, they deducted \"whatever extra was paid in the previous month.\" So those who were in Dev received 2K less than the previous month's salary and those in Support/QA received 4K less. Anger rose among us because from the date of Induction till the 5th month, no HR explained us \"role based CTC clause\" and some HR had even assured that CTC would remain 3.25 LPA for our batch and it is just for the later batches. In the later batches, HCL started informing candidates before hand that CTC would depend on role. A mistake that they learned after we started protesting. There were many rounds of discussions with HR but we were not listened. There is huge story behind what I've written above. This is just the gist of what HCL really is. The atmosphere is pathetic there. Literally. The quality of working is equivalent to any state level government office. I saw engineers less and \"babus\" more. No proper training. And yes, not to mention, the politics. The bigger the company, the higher the politics. If you want a relaxed life, you have a family. If you are a married person, and you are looking for some managerial post, then the kind of environment might suit you there for once. But if you are new, you have lot of dreams in your eyes, you have a passion for technology, you are hardworking, then HCL is BIG NO from my side..!! Still, HCL is a better place for girls. HCL is also okay for non-CS/IT grads. For people from other specializations like ME, ECE, EN, etc, HCL may be cool. And you can get Night Cabs also if you've worked late. And that made me give 1 star. That's it. But if you have done B Tech from CS/IT, then avoid this 'Lala-company'. Money wise, I repeat, HCL is a fraud company; a miser company. They were so many components to reduce the take-away(in-hand) salary. My friends from Infosys and TCS received far more in hand. My friends from Accenture, had nearly the same CTC yet the in-hand was atleast 2.5k more. Comparing with Cognizant, Accenture and TCS, they pay their employees far more for those working in Night Shifts. You can just compare the payslips and you would know the difference..! Besides, the reputation of HCL is diminishing among the clients also. Lot of good projects have ended. Many of the good clients that were probably once there, you could get to know via grapevines. Perhaps, the lazy breed of people in the company are their HRs and the WPC Team. Just to mention here, me and my HR got bored of seeing each others face. After all, it was her duty to listen to employee's grievances. But she was more often than not, helpless. I found her attitude to be very negative most of the times. This reminds me of one more thing that HCL has a Grievance Redressal system which is again, of no use. Managers would play with your career. No matter how good or bad you are, unless you know how to do flattery, you won't survive long in a project. Of course, buttering and flattery were never a part of my life..! I've already written enough expressing my frustration during the period I was in the company, so I won't write anything bigger here. What you may learn to do is how to fill your Time Sheets where in you have to fill 9 hours regardless of however much you've worked. So if you've worked for more, chances are your manager would not accept your Time Sheet causing a block. Absurd things. They initially give you a system which is 2GB RAM running Windows 7, on Pentium M/D series processors. Any ways, the 'system hang' would become a part of life, that those things which seems to be dull, or things which are bland, could become a second nature. Posting leaving:I broke the bond, and left HCL to join a company were in I am able to utilize my talent and learn something new, finding exciting opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge base. All things which I mention on my resume. :P Trust my words, HCL is the biggest ..........! ",
