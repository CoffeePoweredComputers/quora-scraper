            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve found that there\u2019s no actual \u2018free\u2019 phone. \u2018Free\u2019 phones attached new cellular carrier plans are often leased and you still get charged a monthly lease fee. About the only exception to that are lifeline programs for low income households. If you are in a low-income household, you may qualify for a subsidized or free phone, but it\u2019s not going to be a new $1000 phone. It\u2019ll be a cheap or reconditioned one. Verizon used to offer the HopeLine Program for domestic abuse survivors, but discontinued it in 2018. They now connect people who dial #hope with a domestic abuse support line. If you decide to buy your own unlocked GSM phone, you can get some good cheap phone service by searching around online. Many MVNOs offer unlimited talk and text for as low as $30/month which is a lot cheaper than any carrier that has you paying a lease on your phone. Adding mobile data will raise your rate, but if you live in a well populated area, you likely don\u2019t need a huge data plan because you can access Wifi. You can also save money on your cellular plan by running all your calls through Google Voice. Through GV, you can get free call forwarding, free voice mail, along with other functions that cell carriers would charge extra for. You can follow tricks on YouTube to get free cell service from FreedomPop (runs over AT&T bands). I would not rely on free FreedomPop service for a primary phone, but I do use it on a backup cell and it\u2019s fine for that. You could also use your phone as a Wifi-only phone and sign up for Wifi calling. ",

            "answer_text": "Get a subscription from a mobile carrier. Let\u2019s say Verizon. You agree to a subscription. In exchange for your money, Verizon will alow you to use their data plan, the ability to call and text. You pay in advance for the following month to come. You set this agreement for two years. For two years you agree to pay monthly . Let\u2019s say you pay 10 $ . IF you were to have a Pre-paid SIM you would pay 6\u20137 $. But for your extra buck, You get a lease phone. For the duration of the two years, the phone belongs to Verizon, but you\u2019re using it as a part of your subscription. If you cancel the subscription, you give the phone back. If you fullfill your part in the subscription and the two year period ends, t he phone is yours to keep. Free, but not free. You pay for the phone as if it were rented to you. But you get to keep it afterwards. ",
