            "answer_text": "In T3, it\u2019s revealed John succeeded in destroying Skynet (nuclear detonation), and then was killed by a T-800 that looked just like the one who bonded with in T2. The implication would be, without Skynet, the Terminators would soon be picked off, and for ll we know, the machines might just surrender. We\u2019ll never know, because right before death, Skynet sent the T-X back in time, so this Terminator had to follow, and thus has no further info on the future. Humans still had Kate to lead them. So they still had a bit of an advantage. Of course, that history got replaced by T3\u2019s new history, where Skynet is uploaded to the Internet, so he can\u2019t be killed. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The humans had won. Skynet was forever destroyed when the first Terminator was sent back. That's why it was sent back. The only outcome in which Skynet was not destroyed would be if John Connor never existed. Reese tells Sarah all of this in the first Terminator movie. Ironically Skynet would not exist if the Terminator did not return to the past, since the technology was reverse engineered from the Terminator parts left behind when Sarah crushed it. ",
