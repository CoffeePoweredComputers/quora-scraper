            "answer_text": "Technology part 2[1] Hey friends, today I have brought for myself people Technology Last I had talked about technology in my post, what is the meaning of technology and how technology is used in us. Today, friends will tell you the types of technology How many types of technologies are there and what are their uses. How our live scores will influence and in future Let us know what are the types of technologies. First of all we will talk which are based on technology machines and whose speed of calculation is like a computer.  1-information technology 2-network technology 3-Sensor technology 4-Internet of things 5-Transport technology 6-Energy technology 7-Agriculture 8-Architecture 9- Entertainment and media 10-Art and music 11-Industrial machines 12-Clothing and accessories 13-Medical Technology 14-Assistive Technology 15-Science 16-Space 17-Robotic[2] 18-Artificial intelligence 19-Super intelligent 20-Assistive Technology Advanced technology If we talk about advanced technology, then it improves and is dynamic because our needs keep changing and technology changes accordingly. As our hopes grow, so does technology. Information technology currently occupies the most important place in the twentieth century because information information technology has changed the whole world. Information technology is completely responsible for changing our small business as they have a different market in competition. He has made a place of importance which he had never thought possible.  Communication technology Communication is such a technology that takes information or data from one place to another, assuming we are sitting in India and we have to talk in America or send information, then through this technology we reach that person in seconds. Can give information. We can use this to make our words visible to each other and lighten our mind. And in this, through which humans exchange their things with each other, among them there are mobile phones, computer email messaging and many such applications with which we contact each other. Communication technology has an important contribution to grow your business. Education technology If we talk about education technology, earlier we used to have slate today to read in our square, slowly changed its form into 1 notebook and converted to 10, now it has taken its form as a mobile phone tab. Now we can get all the subjects we need in minutes, in the matter of what we need in seconds, for our subject, he should not be subject to anyone else in the meeting. Knoloji is to get through. Education technology has changed in this way. It is changing the way we learn. It motivates students. Anu helps in learning now very easily.  entertainment technology If we talk about entertainment technology, its form has changed too. Today we have a video game for entertainment. We can do various types of jam entertainment that too. We can play 3D games and play 5G games. That which looks like reality, it seems that we ourselves are in it and it is moving. If we talk about movies then today 4d 7d movies are coming which have provided a reality. It seems to us that we ourselves are inside that screen and acting which has changed our way of thinking and feeling. The view has changed this technology has changed the whole world, in the coming time, technology will be so much affected that no human will remain untouched.  Medical technology Talking about medical technology, it has made a lot of improvements in human life without changing the world of medicine itself. Earlier, we used to detect diseases, a person died, if we talk about this time, then we can also detect it immediately. Through technology our treatment has also been possible. Has brought reform and changed the world of medicine. Due to which people are making full use of it in their lives and it is revolution which has changed the whole world. information technology If I talk about information technology which is a set of hardware software but connects our communication to each other, information technology provides the right information at the right time and the ability to make decisions.  If I talk about technology, the world is changing very fast, in the coming times, it will change the nature of the world itself, which we have not even imagined, we will get to see all of it, maybe we have seen in some movies or we have We have felt or our thinking has gone to that place, such a technology is coming in front of us in such a world that we can only imagine that we can see it. Some will say if I talk about 20 30 40 50 years ago, some people said that it is difficult to reach the moon but they are reaching. It is only due to this technology that there are some such advanced technologies.Read more[3] \u2026 Footnotes[1] AnikaSandeep[2] AnikaSandeep[3] AnikaSandeep",

            "answer_text": "The implications of recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have spurred heated debate globally. As science fiction starts to become reality, AI products are slowly infiltrating homes and workplaces. This is raising concerns about the potential detrimental effects of AI on the job market or even about the dangers of an AI singularity,where sentient robots take over the world and destroy humans. While these are all valid discussions, I believe that the focus of AI should not be just on cool home gadgets or on process optimisation and automation. Instead, AI can be used to fundamentally rethink how we solve the world\u2019s problems. AI has the potential to greatly improve things like healthcare, education, poverty and security. AI machines can do some very beneficial things already today that humans will simply never be able to. If we leverage that to augment what humans do well, AI could positively impact society, business, and culture on the order of magnitude of the internet itself. I call this using AI to scale the human mind, not replace it. The human brain is the most elegant computer in existence. We process millions of sensory inputs automatically and constantly, allowing us to learn and respond to our environment. But the human brain only contains about 300 million pattern processors that are responsible for human thought. What if we could complement all of our amazing ideas with not just more data, but also orders of magnitude more data processing capability? Imagine how we would rethink every single problem that exists today. Even with today\u2019s primitive forms of AI, there is enough technology out there to start doing exactly this. The examples below draw from a variety of industries to illustrate the magnitude of social impact possible when we couple AI with human skill and ingenuity. 1. Precision Medicine AI is driving the adoption and implementation of precision medicine Think of it as a type of medical personalisation. For example, around 25,000 people in the US are diagnosed with brain tumors every year. Traditionally, they might all be given the same course of treatment to see what might work in a one-size-fits-all approach. Precision medicine will allow doctors and researchers to predict more accurately which treatment and prevention strategies for a particular disease will work in which groups of people. 2. Cybersecurity There were around 707 million cyber security branches in 2015, and 554 millions in just the first half of 2016. The impact of just a few of these attacks, such as foreign governments potentially biasing US presidential elections, is truly scary. Security teams struggle today to work through the increasing number of alerts generated by traditional tools. The self-learning and automation capabilities enabled by AI can increase effectiveness and reduce costs, keeping us much safer from terrorism or even smaller scale identity theft. AI-based solutions already in the market can be more proactive and can preempt attacks in the pre-execution state by identifying patterns and anomalies associated with malicious content. Securework uses the predictive capabilities of AI for advanced threat detection on a global scale. shiftscience,cylance and Deep instinct are using it for fraud preventions and for endpoint security, like smartphones and laptops. These technologies will dramatically expand the scope and scale of security professionals and allow them to detect threats hopefully well before they actually attack.  3. Precision Farming The world's population is expected to increase significantly over the next three decades, but our capacity for production will struggle to keep pace. AI is driving efficiency in our current farming methods to increase production and reduce wastage without adversely affecting the environment. Systems such as Johns deers auto treanable huge machines to plant crops in a far more uniform and accurate way and can reduce overlap in agricultural processes such as tilling, planting and fertilising, which in turn reduces the use of chemicals and increases productivity. Cainthus, a machine vision company, has another approach. Using deep learning, it has created a facial recognition system than can identify individual cows by their facial features in just six seconds, enabling huge herds to be monitored with minimal human involvement. Soon, they will be able to detect early signs of lameness in a cow based on its body shape, and alert the farmer accordingly. As sensors proliferate on farms and drones capture real time imageof the condition of vast amounts of farmland, AI machines will be able to help farmers foresee what their crops and farms are going to need potentially over a year in advance, giving them more time to react to adverse conditions. AI can be applied to many more problems and markets. In fact, it should be thought of as a fundamentally new approach to every problem. Those decisions will be made by humans who want to change and improve the world, and who now can scale their minds to address ever-expanding frontiers. ",
