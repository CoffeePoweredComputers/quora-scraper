            "answer_text": "Not necessary illegal, depends on legislation. The informal sector, informal economy, or grey economy is the part of an economy that is neither taxed, nor monitored by any form of government. Unlike the formal economy, activities of the informal economy are not included in the gross national product (GNP) and gross domestic product (GDP) of a country. Practiced by most of the world's population, informal economy includes barter of goods and services, mutual self-help, odd jobs, street trading, and other such direct sale activities. Informality has at least three faces: Evaders, Avoiders, and Outsiders. Evaders are covered by the law but do not comply. Avoiders adjust so as to put themselves outside the remit of the law. Outsiders are those simply not covered by the law. Consequently, the same activities can be legal or illegal in different countries, or if done in different scale. For example, certain work legislation may touch only companies with more than 9 workers. Whereas not necessarily illegal, informal economy goes together with or enables harmful and sometimes illegal activities such as tax evasion, corruption, money laundering, organized crime, bribery, barter, sub-standard working conditions and salaries, and the stealing of state property. This is a worldwide problem especially in the developing countries. But every country, including those in the \u201cfirst world\u201d, has a significant portion of their economy stemming from the informal sector. Schneider\u2019s study of 110 countries found U.S. is equal with Switzerland with the informal economy making up only 8.8% of the GNP, Italy with 27%, Albania with around 50% and Georgia with 67.3%, just to pick some examples. Perhaps paradoxically, considerable portion of the black money earned in informal economy can legally end to Switzerland, which until recently has been a highly regulated heaven for anonymous earners. According to International Labour Organization (ILO) the informal economy comprises more than half of the global labor force and more than 90% of Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) worldwide. Informality is an important characteristic of labor markets in the world with millions of economic units operating and hundreds of millions of workers pursuing their livelihoods in conditions of informality.  Source: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/06/why-we-need-to-rethink-the-informal-economy/ The informal economy comprises diverse workers and entrepreneurs who are not often recognized or protected under national legal and regulatory frameworks. Viewed through the lens of what the ILO defines as Decent Work, the informal economy can be seen to encompass a broad range of vulnerabilities, such as limited access to social protection, denial of labor rights, and lack of organization and representation. On average, informal workers earn far less than formal workers. In other words, most informal workers suffer from significant decent work deficits. Elimination of grey economy is difficult for two reasons: 1 It is beneficial. In most countries grey economy gives subsistence to a considerable proportion of population. Radical change in regulation would easily lead to economic disaster for these people. There are opinions, additionally, that grey part of economy is the most flexible one and offers a buffer against recessions, etc. In South Eastern Spain, Almeria, majority of country\u00b4s vegetable production takes place. This is done by 20-30 000 illegal seasonal workers from Africa. Eliminating this opportunity would collapse the economy of the whole area. 2 It is an amoeba. Grey economy, corruption, organized crime, etc. are so ingrained in many societies, and the links lead to so high positions in the state organization and business life, that decreasing grey economy is next to impossible. See case Brazil, where it seems that the law enforcement has to sue all top 1000 people starting from the president. Problems with international terrorism have recently stepped up the effort of blocking money laundering. Along with that becomes more tight regulation regarding source of funds posited in banks, or increasing use of electronic transactions instead of cash. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies have offered criminals a whole new way of financing their activities, and dark networks keep all transactions anonymous. This is a world in flux. ",
