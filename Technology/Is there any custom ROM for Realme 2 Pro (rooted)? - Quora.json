            "answer_text": "Realme has not released the full kernel sources yet. So can't make the custom ROMs. Realme is going to release full kernel sources on third or fourth week of Feb. After that custom ROM development can be possible. You can try the gsi ROMs for this device. Right now the havoc OS is near to stable or you can try it. I'll be providing the links for the above mentioned roms https://sourceforge.net/projects/havoc-os/files/arm64-aonly/Havoc-OS-v2.0-20181027-GSI-ARM64-Aonly-Official.img.xz/download (GSI) Treble fixes for Realme 2 Pro - VoLTE, Brightness, and more Do note that these roms are not fully developed yet ,may contain many bugs and may make your device unusable so proceed with caution Also I do not recommended you to go with these roms as they are in their initial phase of development ,I suggest you to wait until stable versions release Source:Forum XDA developers/realme2pro Hope this answer helps Have a great day :) ",
