            "answer_text": "The Inca Empire came to an end when it was conquered by the Spanish empire. The empire was actually already weak when they arrived as the Inca were in civil war; fought between Hu\u00e1scar and Atahualpa over the succession of the imperial throne. Francisco Pizarro landed in Peru in 1532 with 168 men and 62 horses, and Atahualpa was advised to kill them. Cinquinchara  believed they were evil, but Atahualpa could see little evidence of that despite what others had heard, he agreed to meet with Pizarro. On 15 November 1532, the Spanish met with the Sapa Inca Atahualpa at Cajamarca. He happen to be quite hospitable to the conquistadors, despite not understanding their intentions. 6,000 followers had also come with Atahualpa. All unarmed. The Spanish troops were hidden at the time and then suddenly attacked. 2,000 Inca were killed that day according to accounts, as volley fire and Calvary charges devastated the Inca to the point where it was just a massacre. Most  of the Inca army was stationed in Cuzco, the capital. So there was little to prevent Atahualpa\u2019s capture. He was treated well. However, overwhelming numbers of Inca troops could not be sent to help, otherwise the Spanish would kill the Emperor. However, after meeting the demands of the Spanish by giving them even more gold and sliver then expected, they understood how important Atahualpa was, so they killed him in the end. The death of the Sapa Inca meant that the Inca army was paralyzed. And in any rate, they were outmatched by the guns and armor of the Spanish, and more particularly the horse. There was nothing the Inca could do to beat off Calvary attacks, and having Calvary meant the Spanish could move troops around a lot faster. Most of the conflicts the Inca were involved in happened in the north, in which the enemies of the Inca joined the ranks of the Spanish, who were marching with perhaps 500 men as well as horses towards Cuzco, the capital, which that laid open. Manco Inca Yupanqui lead a rebellion against the Spanish in 1536, resulting in the siege of Cuzco, in which 100,000 men had been assembled for it. There were less then 200 Spanish in the city, but no attack was launched. The Spanish received reinforcements that forced Manco Inca to end the siege and retreat. The rebellion was done. The Battle of Ollantaytambo in January 1537 resulted in a Inca victory, but once again, Spanish reinforcements caused Manco Inca do abandon Ollantaytambo and fall back to Vilcabamba. The Neo-Inca state of Vilcabamba came into being, and is known as the last remnant of the Inca. It survived until 1572. And one of the largest factors was the diseases that the Spanish brought from Europe. Typhus, influenza ,smallpox ,diphtheria and measles absolutely devastated the Inca population. The massive and efficient road system of the Inca got these around quickly. By the time of the completion of the Spanish conquest in 1572, possibly 90% of the Inca people were gone. The rest would remain for a bit longer, in which the last of the Inca empire were gone by 1620 at the most. ",

            "answer_text": "(I have to expend and correct Ryan\u2019s answer at some parts). Lack of unity - too many locals joined Spanish. Most of the battles was actually fought by locals against locals, not locals against Spanish. One city-state of Cuzco did become large empire durin just 100 years, what means it was unstable. Inca influence wasn\u2019t well established in all regions. It was also very diverse, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural state. Consequently, it was unstable. Spanish arrived in the worset possible moment Civil war between Atahualpa and Huascar wasn\u2019t fully resolved, yet. Atahualpa\u2019s wictory wasn\u2019t decisive, enemy was still up and running, Huascar alive, conflicts of interests\u2026In addition, Spanish arrived during harvest - it was customery among local culturec, to cease warring during this time. So, most of the officers had taken their leave. Now, to last inka Atahualpa. The conflict between him and his brother runs deeper than just a conflict ower succession. There was, as it seems, deeper division. Death of Atahualpa\u2019s and Huascar\u2019s father was just a switch. It would have happened sooner or later. As mentioned abowe, incas were actually far from all-powerful, especially Atahualpa. Some nobles supported him, some didn\u2019t and some had their own plans. When Spanish captured him, it just stirred the watters even more. His execution nor capture wasn\u2019t in fact even a decisive moment. There were many other occasions, battles, uprisses etc. through the whole time of Spanish reign, but they all tended to fail - most frequently due to treachery and inner division. For example, another Atahualpa who started uprise (he claimed to be inka Atahualpa\u2019s descendent) was newer defeated, but one of his concurents shot him in attempt to prove he isn\u2019t immortal. Manco\u2019s siege of Cuzco: Manco, in fact, managed to seize Cuzco, except of 2 buildings and defeated 3 reinforcements send to brak the siege. Siege, battles and skirmishes continued for cca. 10 months, before Manco decided to lift the siege and retreat both from Cuzco and Ollantaytambo. His reasons aren\u2019t exactly clear, there were many factors at play, but the fact his army was gradually growing smaller - soldirs just kept on leaving for some reason-was probably the main one.
