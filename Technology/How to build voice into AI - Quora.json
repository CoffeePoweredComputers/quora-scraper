            "answer_text": "Voice and natural language systems are an important step toward making our digital servants serve us on our terms. We went from punch cards to green screens to GUIs and eventually to touch-based, palm-sized, location- and context-sensitive computers in the form of smartphones (not to mention those annoying smart-car panels). Now we have Apple`s Siri, Amazon`s Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, and Google`s Assistant answer our needs. To build voice and natural language capabilities into your own applications, you have several cloud options. For Alexa, you can tap into an open API at no apparent cost beyond AWS charges; the same goes for Google, although the Google Cloud site is as clear as mud on this point. Microsoft even lets you reuse your Alexa skills package with Cortana. For Apple, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an API, along with the $99 cost of becoming an Apple Developer and publishing an iOS app. ",

            "answer_text": "Voice synthesis has gotten pretty good lately. For a good example of voice synthesis, we should look at the computer programs known as \u201cVocaloids\u201d.  Video: Vocaloid \u201cOliver\u201d singing the song \u201cGoing Home\u201d. A Vocaloid is a computer program that mimics a human singing voice. They are VERY popular in Japan, to the point of basically being pop idols in their own right. I avoided using one of the many popular Japanese songs and decided to show Oliver\u2019s singing voice instead to show what they can do in English. It\u2019s quite nice, but it\u2019s still clear it\u2019s a computer program in a few places. How do they work? First we have to understand what a \u201cPhoneme\u201d is. A phoneme is to speech what letters are to words. They are singular sounds that when combined form whole words. Examples would be \u201cth\u201d and \u201cee\u201d to form the word \u201cthe\u201d. English has over 40 phonemes, which can be quite tricky to work with. On the other hand, despite Japanese having a much larger alphabet, even if only in Hiragana, they have a smaller collection of phonemes, which make it an easier language to create things like Vocaloids in. Making a Vocaloid involves making a recording of every phoneme in the language you\u2019re working in. You can do this either by separately synthesizing it, or simply having a real person record their voice. Once this is done, you make a program that can turn words into strings of phonemes, like we showed with the word \u201cthe\u201d above. The user can then pitch the phonemes up and down, stretch them, shorten them, add vibrato, falsetto, and so on and so on. In our \u201cVocaloid\u201d example, a user manually does this to create a song, but in text-to-speech, such as what is used by AI, you need to have this done automatically, otherwise you\u2019ll just be left with a monotone voice. To mimic an individual, you might have to study their speech patterns and try to copy them, otherwise, you might use data on speech and try to mimic general human speech. Once this function is complete, an AI can generate appropriate responses in the form of text strings, then shove the strings through text-to-speech. ",
