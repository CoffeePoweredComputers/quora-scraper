            "answer_text": "Robots have a very broad definition e.g. machines working in industries are also termed as robots by some measure. I am assuming you refer to human like robots that are also known as humanoid robots. No matter what the definition is, we do need robots in all its forms. Here are some of the reasons: I dont want to do boring repetitive tasks like dish washing, laundry, cleaning my house etc. I would rather spend that time on some intellectual, creative or even leisure.There are tasks not safe for humans to do like inspecting volcano or hazardous places. Japan is using robots for inspecting and cleaning Fukushima nuclear complex after disaster in 2011.We can save 1.3 million lives lost in accidents yearly by developing self driving cars that are also based on robotic technology. Similarly, if developed, robots can do better surgeries than humans since they dont get tired and have no attention span problem.There are many more applications like elderly care, security, entertainment associated with robots but in my opinion, above three are the main reason why we need them sooner than later.

            "answer_text": "No. But corporations would like robots to replace pesky human workers the same way tractors replaced horses and oxen. No thought was given to the horses and oxen. It is nice to think that everyone will have their own private robot butler, maid, chef, bodyguard, but that isn\u2019t likely. Where will the average unemployed person get the money to afford one? The principal output of the new robot economy will be to provide high luxury to the rich in very small quantities and the most basic needs to poor people in large quantities. The rest will be a strong police force to protect the rich from the poor, who will have too much time on their hands, be restless, and malcontent. ",

            "answer_text": "Robotics and especially artificial intelligence can be considered as one of our major innovation. Indeed, since the creation of robots, we have had some real benefits in industry and science. However, the perpetual evolution of these technologies may as well lead to some ethical problems. First and foremost, the initial major use of robots was in the 1960s. In fact, it was then utilized for industrial purposes. The first industrial robot was sold to General Motors to provide its factory in New Jersey. Since then, many industrial sites all over the globe have used automated machines in order to gain time and efficiency in terms of production with a view to increase profits. This phenomenon has considerably contributed to the cut in production costs. Moreover, scientists have made some huge progress concerning AI since the 1960s. Some robots are so sophisticated that they almost behave like conscious human beings. Nevertheless, making robots resemble us as much as possible is almost giving them a complete autonomy. If they can do good like humans, it means they can also do harm like humans. In the future, this advance technology could become more intelligent than us and thus, uncontrollable. At last, although we cannot deny the benefits of robotics in our societies, ethical issues regarding AI must be discussed. The progress towards this technology should not exceed a certain point where moral principles can be harmed. ",
