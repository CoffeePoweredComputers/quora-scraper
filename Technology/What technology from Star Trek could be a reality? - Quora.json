            "answer_text": "What comes to mind immediately is the idea of the holodeck, and some version of the tri-corder medical scanner. In my lifetime (70+ years) medical technology has advanced very quickly. During the nearly thirty years in which I\u2019ve been a heart patient (terrible genes), cardiac tech has moved from treadmill-only cardiograms to nuclear scanning, and from basic sonographic scans (very similar to the earliest sonograms used on pregnant mothers) to the full-color 3D images I get of my heart every year. I also used to have to get plugged into a rolling ECG cart, but now my cardio people use wireless contacts that feed directly to their computers. Every year I make the same snarky remark about the direction medical technology is moving toward (tricorders), and every year the techs and the docs agree that it\u2019s just around the corner. Holodecks are also getting closer. Maybe not as sophisticated as what we were introduced to in the very first episode of TNG, and maybe not \u201cjust around the corner,\u201d but getting there. My first experience with 3D imaging occurred about 65 years ago with my grandmother\u2019s steroscope; less than two decades later I was using a contraption for archaeological research that sat over stereoscopic photos and which gave the viewer a 3D view of a landscape. This hasn\u2019t apparently been completely supplanted by LIDAR and other scanning technologies, because my husband recently gave me a really cool book with stereoscopic images of the moon. Although I\u2019m not much of a gamer any more, I was captivated in the \u201990s by Myst, with its then-amazing 3D worlds. And, of course, graphics capabilities in games have just kept growing. A couple of years ago, the New York Times sent me a cardboard cradle to hold my iPhone and that enabled a 3D experience of some nifty videos. Even though I\u2019m not really interested in donning some big-ass helmet that would greatly enhance my experience of virtual reality, it seems pretty clear that before too awfully long there will be ways in which we can approximate the kind of experience a holodeck provides\u2014even if it\u2019s only visual. But I don\u2019t really have to \u201cfeel\u201d the rocks to be able to be gobsmacked by the ability to \u201cwalk\u201d on Mars\u2014and I hope I\u2019ll be able to do that before my tired old backside shuffles of this planet. Thanks for this question! ",

            "answer_text": "Several, actually. We've recently developed the prototype to a tricorder thanks to Qualcomm and Final Frontier Medical Devices in April 2017. In David Batchelor's paper The Science of Star Trek, he notes that matter-antimatter generation and impulse engines are very possible. David also points out that communicators and ships computers are already here in the form of cellphones and actual computers. We actually already have a one up on Star Trek's away teams as we can take photographs with our phones instead of just reporting what we see like they had to. You'll also be interested to hear we are very close to Lieutenant Commander Data from The Next Generation. You have to look no further than the android Sophia, who was recently granted citizenship by Saudi Arabia and is progressing very well in becoming more and more human. Going back to Batchelor again, he notes that the army already has a stun like weapon similar to the phaser in development. Given that this article was written in 1993, we can reasonably assume that this technology has been developed even further since then. Also, while Holodecks on the whole are still beyond our capabilities, we know that virtual reality like experiences are very much within our grasp. Take the HTC Vive's Star Trek: Bridge Crew as a perfect example of immersive, almost Holodeck like virtual reality. Its very surprising to note just how much of Star Trek's technology is both within our grasp and what we've also already surpassed. As we continue our way towards The Undiscovered Country, I do believe we'll continue to boldly go towards several of the technologies that are used on The Final Frontier.
