            "answer_text": "As another answer suggests, do not lower gas pressure. That's a quick trip to carbon monoxide land. What you're asking is called \u201cde-rating\u201d a furnace. If gas, you can remove and plug orifices, which also requires relocation of the flame sensor and likely, a couple safeties. If electric, disconnecting sequencers will do the trick. In both cases, it should be done by someone who knows what they're doing and licensed. In both cases, the blower speed should be changed to maintain delta. ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t. Unless it was designed that way by the manufacturer, to operate at a lower level, you are stuck with the listed output. The only thing you can do is cycle the furnace on and off, which gives you a reduced output over time, but is hard on the equipment. So after it fails, considerably sooner than it would if operated continuously, replace it with one with a lower rating! ",
