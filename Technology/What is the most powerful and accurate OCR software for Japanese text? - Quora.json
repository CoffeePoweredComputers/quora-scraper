            "answer_text": "I looked for the answer to this question last year. High-quality OCR software that can meet business needs is expensive, and I was looking for software priced at $3,000 or less. I found WinReader PRO (http://mediadrive.jp/products/wrp/), which fit my budget and requirements. It excels at accurately recognizing Japanese print and can process a large amount of material automatically. However, it does not recognize handwriting very well. ",
