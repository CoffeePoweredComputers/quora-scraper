            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat would people think if they could read my mind?\u201d Well, I think that whoever it would be that could get in there, would find it rather traumatic a place to be. Dark and gloomy and slippery, even slimy in some places, with tons of closed doors that I suppose would appear and vanish just as fast. These are the doors that leads to my various vaults. Locked away inside these rooms would be where I keep my most treasured memories. Once inside one of these rooms, you would find vast encompasses, just massive spaces with no ceilings at the top. Some rooms might be just a jungle. Blue skies, tropical paradise with wildlife and colourful maccaws to boot, but beware the striped tiger that looms within there, for he be the keeper with the golden key around his neck. Other spaces, another room, might be filled to the brim with drawer-upon-drawer of files. Beautifully organised and colour-coded by year, date and time. These could be where I keep my childhood memories, my stacks of research on various topics or just general information I store on people that I might have to recall again someday. Neat and easily accessible. Oh I could go on and on and on\u2026 describing each room and it's function, but who here even has the time to read through all of that? The point is, I don't think anybody else could handle the amount of things that goes on in my head at any given time. I am used to what goes on up in there, since I have created it, after all. Most times it's a truly wonderful place to be trapped within, it's the other times\u2026 Those are the times when it could drive the perfectly sane, into the perfectly insane.  ",
