            "answer_text": "There are several, but the most shocking invention to you might be that attributed to the Wright brothers. After their European demonstrations, Wilbur Wright gave up all aeronautical work and focused exclusively on litigation, suing everyone left and right for perceived violation of his patents. His notorious methods severely hindered the progress of aviation, because an airplane is not a fax machine. It needed improvements in several areas, but every one of them was blocked by the Wrights\u2019 lawyers. Glenn Curtiss, one compatriot, was one of those who suffered, and it is recorded that he was blamed by the Wright family for Wilbur\u2019s death by typhoid. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is so top secret that it probably can\u2019t be proven. Vimanas or flying saucers that existed 5,000 years ago in India were primarily used to travel to other planets and beyond. The ships were easy to operate and used artificially intelligent navigation systems. It also overcame the time/space continuum, aerodynamics, and other amenities needed for space travel. Don\u2019t be surprised if one day Earthlings wake up to billions of Vimanas from all over this Universe surrounding this tiny insignificant planet. ",
