            "answer_text": "We need to discover/invent magic first, since lightsabers are clearly magical artifacts. And even if we do invent magic, I think we\u2019ll create broomsticks, dragons and sentient portraits long before lightsabers. Lightsabers, as seen in the movies, don\u2019t make sense. They are impossible. Basically they are just a super-powerful battery strapped to some crystal, which by mysterious way generates a self-contained blade of something that looks like plasma. The only non-magical way in which I can see a real-life lightsaber working is if the hilt contains a portal to a pocket universe filled by that hot plasma-like substance. Then you just have to open the portal, let the stuff flow and then contain/focus it with some mechanisms. That would explain why lightsabers don\u2019t need gas cannisters like a blaster, and why they don\u2019t blow up when you drop or damage them (I mean, you just can\u2019t contain the output of many nuclear reactors in a AA battery and keep it stable) Maybe there\u2019s your answer. When we\u2019ll be able to create this wonderful fantasy swords? When we learn how to manipulate the fabric of space with precision, with enough skill as to create pocket universes, tear controled holes in space, or enclose huge spaces within small weightless volumes. Magic basically, according to Sir Clarke\u2019s famous quote. ",

            "answer_text": "Impossibly far. First, lightsabers aren\u2019t actually made of light. According to Star Wars, they are actually made of plasma that is contained by a magnetic field in such a way that they don\u2019t expend energy until they make contact with something. The first problem is having a sufficiently dense and efficient energy source. It takes massive amounts of energy to turn anything into a plasma and it would take even more to maintain the magnetic field needed to contain it. The second problem is that having zero energy expenditure prior to physical contact with the blade is a physical impossibility. The blade itself emits light, which has energy. The electrical components all have some measure of resistance, which causes a loss of energy. And it takes energy to maintain the plasma itself. Sorry, lightsabers are pure fantasy fiction, not science fiction. ",
