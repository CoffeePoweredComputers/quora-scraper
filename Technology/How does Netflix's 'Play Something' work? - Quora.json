            "answer_text": "The video streaming service Netflix is currently testing a new feature that'll help you, well, find some content to watch. Netflix is testing a new 'Shuffle Play' button, with which it hopes to help people watch something instead of just scrolling through the content and pass out. Some users seeing this new 'Shuffle Play' button on their account. It's not called Shuffle Play, though. Netflix is planning to call it the 'Play Something' button, which seems appropriate. Obviously, letting Netflix decide what to watch will not yield the best results but, at least, you won't blame yourself or your friends for recommending a bad show or a movie. It's on the algorithm. Hope this helps!! ",
