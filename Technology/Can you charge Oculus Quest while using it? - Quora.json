            "answer_text": "Not sure what you mean exactly by \u201cthe\u201d Oculus as there are multiple different varieties out now. The Oculus Rifts are a corded headset plugged into your computer so they will always be powered as long as your computer is on. If you\u2019re referring to an Oculus Quest yes, you can charge while playing but it kind of defeats the purpose of having a wireless VR headset (unless you\u2019re just using it for development purposes then it might make sense) Not sure about the Oculus Go as I do not own one.
