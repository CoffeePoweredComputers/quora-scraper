Now u say u get hurt everytime. U need to focus on that first. Why u get hurt ?? The answer is very simple even though it does not look that simple. The answer is that you are expecting and hoping certain things from your partner. If you stop doing these things you'll never get hurt again. You have to remember this equation...No Hopes + No Expectations = Happiness \u263a Good Luck. ",
