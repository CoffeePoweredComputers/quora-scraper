            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a couple of answers for this, but in short, it depends if the diagnostic equipment is manfucturers own, often costing thousands, or a generic scanner that is considerably cheaper and readily available. Generic OBD2 (On-Board Diagnostic2) scanners such as those found on eBay will generally read all DTCs (Diagnostic Trouble Codes) that a vehicle (of any manufacturer) will have stored in the various control modules dotted around the vehicle. These DTCs, also known as \u201cfault codes\u201d, will often provide basic direction for anyone attempting to diagnose a fault with the vehicle. The cheap generic scanner will then match the fault code generated by the vehicle to a pre-defined list of sometimes vague, non-specific faults that essentially point you in the right direction, but rarely provide you with a conclusive answer on what the fault actually is. In contrast, manufacturers own systems such as Ford IDS, Jaguar/LR WDS, VAG\u2019s ODIS et al not only communicate with the vehicle to establish which DTCs are stored, but they also provide a far greater level of interpretation as to what the fault actually is. This is why so many times main-dealers have to get involved with complex auto-electrical faults as they hold the very expensive brand-specific kit that will tell them things the generic kit won\u2019t. It\u2019s like having a builder come round your house and give you a general diagnosis of where he thinks an electrical fault may be lurking in your house, and then having a qualified electrician come round afterwards and do the same. Both guys know what they\u2019re talking about, but the electrician will have the better understanding of the whole system and will have the edge over the builder when it comes to the diagnosis. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer is yes. The general range of codes are all well defined and there is no reason a tool would somehow misinterpret what it reads short of some kind of programming error when the tool was made. Longer version is they\u2019ll recognize whatever they can correctly but different tools will have different levels of capability and different manufacturers will have a mix of standard and custom codes so not all tools will necessarily have all codes. Also, most tools can read ECM codes but not all can read codes from other modules such as the body control module, electronic braking control module, transmission CM etc etc so some will not report back errors that are stored on those modules or might report back a generic error code the ECM has stored that basically just means its been notified of an error in a different module, one that particular tool might not be able to read. Best bet for any particular application is to go to the forums / fb pages for that make/model and see what is popular in those communities, they\u2019ll usually have a good idea of which models of scan toll work better or worse with their particular car of choice. Or shell out the big money for a tool from snap on or the like which will come with a broad range of capabilities out of the box ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, if you use them correctly. You must have read my post saying I\u2019m not sure about the codes. A reliable tool sold at a reputable business should get you a diagnostic tool that produces the correct codes, you just have to have the manual to read them correctly. It outputs p codes, which are written in some language beyond my intelligence. The p codes are universal. It only produces the p codes, and nothing else. So, for example if you have a p code of 1301, it reads that code only, it\u2019s up to you to decide how to interpret that. That\u2019s my apps fault to think that it knows what that means. That 1301 code is a random misfire on the number one cylinder, that\u2019s pretty standard. , but what is the real fault? Bad coil pack? Bad spark plug? Bad distribution center? it just thinks it knows. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. All the tool does is give you a \u201cwindow\u201d into the control modules in the vehicle. What those modules see from their sensors is then seen by the diagnostic tool. It simply allows us to know what the control modules are seeing which enables us to diagnose and repair them. There is no reason the tools would be inaccurate unless they are made as ripoffs of the real tool or made using extremely low quality parts. I\u2019ve never seen such a tool so I\u2019m just throwing that out there as a possibility. ",
