            "answer_text": "No\u2026 with a little explanation. Any two 4K televisions will have the same 3840 x 2160 UltraHD resolution. The smaller the television, the higher the image density, aka, the pixels-per-inch. That suggests the smaller display is going to look better. And it will\u2026 as long as your eye can resolve the pixels. If you\u2019re looking at a 32 inch 4K television and you\u2019re just at the edge of being able to resolve the pixels, looking at a 65 inch television at the same distance, you\u2019ll see things that look unpleasantly pixelated. That\u2019s the theory. In practice, you\u2019re going to need to sit at about two feet from that 32 inch television to see any pixels. If you sat that close to the 65 inch television, you would see pixels, but you could not possibly see the whole screen. So that\u2019s a ridiculous viewing position for the larger unit. For the 65 inch televison, that critical, don\u2019t-get-any-closer distance expands to a little over four feet. But how about viewing a good 4K picture, rather than trying to see the pixels \u2014 the point at which you\u2019ll start to want an 8K TV? For that 65 inch TV and with average eyesight, you\u2019ll see the benefits of 4K sitting five to six feet from the TV. If you sat at that distance with the 32\u2033 screen, you will not notice any difference between that television and a plain old 1080p HDTV. The extra resolution will be a complete waste. You\u2019ll need to sit at three feet or closer to the 32 inch television for your eye to actually resolve the 4K resolution.  And that is how we normally view television: we sit at a specific distance from the screen. So figure out where you sit, versus the television, and size the screen for appropriate 4K resolution. Otherwise, you\u2019re far more likely to miss out on the extra resolution of the screen than you are to see pixels. ",

            "answer_text": "Theoretically, with all things being equal, a smaller pixel on any medium will result in greater detail. Now, the real world poses many wonderful factors to consider beyond just size. Generally, the more you spend, the better the picture quality will be. Generally speaking, the distance from the display can effect how much detail difference you notice. And mostly, the source material is super important. What are you going to watch? In what room with what lighting conditions? How far away will you sit from the TV? How much do you want to spend? How much do you like big displays? Good example is USA Network on Dish/DirecTV, Cable. It is supposed to be 1080i but it is soft and almost blurry. So an old 720p TV of the plasma variety probably looks best. On the other end, there are new 4K displays that upconvert everything fed into them and they look really cool. A newer Apple TV or Roku or Fire TV device can give you decent 1080p and some 4K with more coming, but you\u2019re back in the boat of what is the exact source? Do you watch 4K blu rays? Those can blow your socks off, but again, not all are equal. So, if an academic pursuit of the best possible image quality is one way to go, I recommend dialing in what size of display you want and your budget therein. I just installed two TCL 55\u2033 TVs that sold for less than $400. They look pretty great with Roku built in. Now, the Samsung QLED that was right next to it on the showroom floor was clearly a better picture, but at home for almost $1,000 less I think the cheaper set is a better buy. As with everything, your mileage may vary. ",

Not sure if that\u2019s a good or a bad thing. IMHO, below 40\u2033 4k makes little sense with normal viewing distances of about 8ft. 4k on small screens is a blinking waste of resources. An alternative way of talking about it is: I\u2019ve discovered that people who dismiss HD and 4k because \u201cit makes no difference\u201d and therefore \u201cnot relevant\u201d are the same persons who exclusively view their video entertainment on their puny <6\u2033 mobile phone screens. At that size, all resolutions indeed look the same. You need to have a really big TV, (65\u2033 and above) to see and appreciate 4k images. ",
