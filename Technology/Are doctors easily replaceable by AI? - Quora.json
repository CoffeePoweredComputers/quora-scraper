            "answer_text": "In the future absolutely. There are already small subsets of medicine where where AI outperform it\u2019s human counterpart (e.g. radiology). Even though A.I will outperform a human in an increasing number of small subsets of a doctors skills, AI will likely lack the general intelligence to replace a doctor in the near future (lets say 10 years). So before we start replacing doctors AI is more likely to become an indispensable tool in the doctor\u2019s arsenal helping to get to the right diagnosis rather than replacing them all together. But eventually the inevitable will happen, medical wearables will keep track of your vitals and markers and any anomalies will be send in the cloud for analysis and all of this will happen even before you even feel sick. Extreme cases will be transferred to the human specialist, but slowly the doctors role will erode. Sure some of the older folk will insist on getting treated by a human, but as the new generations grow up driving around in self-driving cars replace the older generations they won\u2019t care, getting to the correct diagnosis is all that matter. This is either exciting or scary depending on whether you wear a coat or not. ",

It\u2019s true that there are fewer farmers and carpenters today than 100 year ago because productivity has grown faster than demand. We can only eat so much or build so many houses. There may be fewer doctors in the far future. But demand for healthcare will increase for some time so I don\u2019t see this happening too rapidly. Healthcare will likely grow as a fraction of total GDP. Healthcare is one of the most important things in our lives and we\u2019re far from doing it optimally. Imagine not having to suffer from cancer, strokes, Alzheimer's, genetic ailments, common colds, flu, venereal disease, malaria and mental illness. Consider how much value that would create for the world: tens of Trillions of dollars per year. ",

It would also be possible for it to check its model and figure out what additional evidence is most likely to change or clarify the diagnosis, and order a test to gather that evidence. You would still need someone to perform all of the tests, and input the symptoms in. This would require some level of training itself, though not as much as a doctor. Still, it would not be a trivial program to create, and the creators would be at a high risk of liability if it prescribed the wrong treatment. You would also need to get the legal system to accept this program as an acceptable substitute for a doctor, get clinics to buy this substitute doctor, then have patients who are willing to go to it. That last one is particuarly a hard sell since you would lose the human aspect; you want a human to explain what is wrong, be able to offer comfort, understand any special needs you may have, break bad news properly, etc. ",

Artificial Intelligence for RadiologyThe salary of radiologist will be less than half of what it currently is.Phase 2(2030+) Brain implantations will be done by Robotic appendages making it much cleaner, faster and more accurate. NeuralinkNeurosurgeons will be much less important to surgeries.Phase 3(2035+) Deep Learning algorithms will be able to deduce problems using given symptoms with better accuracy and a smaller margin of error.Most of the medical consultational jobs will start to see the final s=face of depreciation.By this time most of the jobs will be unavailable and a Universal Basic Income will be established.Just because medical jobs vanish does not mean that you will have no salary in fact by the time medical jobs disappear most of the blue collar jobs and several of the white collar jobs including the ones belonging to the creative facets will be taken over by AI. FYI: You won\u2019t be able to work as a doctor but you won\u2019t have to worry about money.  If your curious about the countries which may be affected. These are the sponsors to some of the ventures. ",

A journalist did not lose his or her job because print became digital, instead they use twitter and the internet to communicate better. Doctors will similarly adapt to technologies that help them. I dont imagine it to be a \u201cno human doctor only machine scenario\u201d but rather a good fusion. Routine/monotonous tests say like blood tests, temperature monitoring, first aid, common fever diagnosis etc will be automated first. Nurses will be replaced before doctors. AI advances are meant to do tasks that humans find routine and boring. Robots may provide a preliminary screening test. IMO this will free up more time for doctors and they can work on more intellectually interesting stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question and there are efforts to deliver some of the diagnostic work with AI. Startups such as Babylon Health offer a chatbot system that can make simple diagnoses based on questions and answers, and that was trained from datasets provided by real-life doctor-patient interactions. The principle of this is sound: get symptoms, search database for matching diseases and conditions, suggest diagnosis. The problem is that human beings often don\u2019t know how to describe their symptoms accurately or - worse - actually lie about the severity of their symptoms which can lead a diagnosis off-track. Human doctors will be better at handling that type of problem for a while yet, but AI doctors could help deal with the burden of persistent time-wasters. In the UK, that\u2019s actually a big problem where AI can really make an impact. Long term of course, AI will get better at coping with human quirks and emotions so most triaging and basic diagnosis will be able to be handled by computers. ",
