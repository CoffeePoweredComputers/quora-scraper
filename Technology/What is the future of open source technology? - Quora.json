            "answer_text": "I think it looks pretty good on the whole. The amount of open source code certainly continues to grow. Early on open source was viewed very suspiciously by non-tech companies, but now that has changed entirely and it is preferred by all but the most regressive companies. I think the one area that is evolving is the area of \u201chard tech\u201d projects. Early open source was generally either simpler things, or re-implementations of existing systems (e.g. Linux). These worked pretty well on a purely volunteer basis. In the last decade a whole set of \u201chard tech\u201d problems have been solved in open source. By that I mean big, complex, original systems that require huge amounts of development and testing to get right. These seem to require really focused investment (many full-time engineers) to be successful. And, empirically, that seems to be very rare to sustain on a purely volunteer basis. If you look at the set of new innovative data systems or computational layers: most are open source, but virtually all that succeed have some backing company willing to fund development. There are always other proposed solutions (Micropayments! Donations! Blockchain!), but at the end of the day if you want to organize a group of people to do something really hard a company remains a pretty good approach. There has been general meme that \u201copen source companies don\u2019t work\u201d, but actually this doesn\u2019t seem to be at all true. Companies like Elastic and MongoDB have been quite successful. Confluent has also done quite well. The Hadoop companies struggled a bit, but this may have more to do with Hadoop as a product than with open source. So the open core model certainly can work well to build software businesses. But this doesn\u2019t translate well to the cloud which is essential for the future viability of these kinds of companies. I think the licensing changes you\u2019ve seen from MongoDB, Confluent, and many others are actually a really good solution to this. It gives the company a clear path to monetization, but you can still take the software, modify it, and run it yourself without needing them if you don\u2019t want their service. There are definitely people who feel very strongly that these licenses are a very bad thing. Our experience at Confluent has been that the license change didn\u2019t seem to cause any decrease in adoption and gives us a clear way to continue growing a healthy business and investing back in making the software great. I\u2019ve written about this in more depth here. ",

            "answer_text": "The same as it has always been. Open source is the de facto standard. What changed is the license to use the source code\u2026 The earliest Unix versions, for example, were distributed as open source so end users (companies with room-size computers) could compile the operating system for their own hardware, making adjustment where needed. Various universities were also given a license for this source and the Berkeley university decided to make a Unix clone called BSD. That was over 40 years ago! Binary distribution is only possible if everyone uses the same hardware, but when the first PC\u2019s became available, it became a possible option for developers to just provide binary versions. These days, the number of operating systems is becoming bigger. Next to Windows, MacOS and various Linux distributions there\u2019s also various BSD distributions, Android, IoS and several other operating systems. More and more of these systems are becoming open source as more and more different hardware is being used. But due to virtualizations and bytecode compilation, there will also be room for binary distribution. Android makes good use of this as it can run on various different hardware, yet all apps work fine on all of them, in general. Even though the apps are only distributed as binary bytecode. But in the past, the license for the various products would prohibit further distribution. These days, there are restrictive licenses like the GPL that put restrictions on redistribution and non-restrictive licenses like the Apache and BSD licenses. The non-restrictive licenses are gaining popularity these days\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Today the majority of open source contributions are made by IT workers and software engineers working for businesses. It is cheaper and quicker to use open source building blocks to build a new software product or web-based service than to do it using completely proprietary components. 4\u20135 years ago the number of software companies using open source components was over 90%. For Microsoft alone some estimates put the number of their employees that contribute to open source projects at over 15,000. Microsoft, Google, IBM, Intel, Apple are all heavily reliant on open source software now. In the USA so is the Government. And the military. And the stock exchanges. And the banks. And the telecommunications industry. And the healthcare industry. And the insurance industry. And the Internet, let\u2019s not forget that one. Every new business and every new technology product relies heavily on open source software as some level (they may not even know it). As long as there isn\u2019t a global meltdown of major economies open source is here to stay. ",
