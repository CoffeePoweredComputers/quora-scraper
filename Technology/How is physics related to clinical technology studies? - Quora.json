            "answer_text": "Clinical technologists (sometimes known as medical technologists) are responsible for maintaining, monitoring and operating complex, specialised equipment used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Modern day medicine utilises an increasingly wide range of cutting-edge technology in various areas, such as radiotherapy, bio-engineering, dialysis, laser procedures, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear medicine and ultrasound. ...maintaining, monitoring and operating complex, specialised equipment used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. There is an increasing demand for people with the correct medical physics knowledge to service, check the performance of, and gauge any environmental effects of this equipment. ",

            "answer_text": "In ancient time the then doctors (vaids) were using their clinical sense by simply observing the symptoms of patients for diagnose and treatment , but now the medical science has completely changed. Now doctors depend on the various medical equipments. All of these equipments are designed on principle of physics. From general properties of matter, heat, light, magnetism, electricity to nuclear physics, these principles are applied in designing equipments/machines. In IITs there is a branch named \u201cBio-Technology\u201d. So physics is directly related to clinical studies. ",
