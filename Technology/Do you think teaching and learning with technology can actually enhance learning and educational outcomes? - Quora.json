            "answer_text": "Yes, but my definition of technology is very broad. Imagine that the only way you can learn is by memorizing songs or stories from your teacher, or experiencing things firsthand yourself. You will be pretty limited in what you can learn and remember. Now let\u2019s say I give you a stylus and a clay tablet, a board and chalk, a pencil and paper. Now both teacher and student can learn to read and write, and cover more than they could in an oral/rote memorization model. The downside is that we have few bards anymore, in the sense of storyteller/singers who can entertain and inform a crowd by performing this way. Computers and the internet are just another technology. I would argue that some of the best uses of computers are doing research and doing virtual labs on subjects students couldn\u2019t actually do at their school for technical and safety reasons (e.g. how far will various types of radiation penetrate various materials). Another benefit is asynchronous learning, so that students can e-mail a question at any time, or have a discussion board with other students in different time zones. Whatever technology you are considering should complement, not replace older technologies and lively discussions, even songs and mnemonics. Personally I don\u2019t find Powerpoints to be an enhancement in lectures, as they let the instructor go too fast, and some tend to read their slides. I would prefer to record a video lecture with Powerpoints (for students to watch before or after class) and draw on the board during class, so students can actually keep up with my lecture (and they better be taking notes). Some people believe in 4 learning styles: visual, auditory/oral, reading/writing and kinesthetic. Actually most people learn by all of these styles, but may have a dominant and/or preferred style (not always the same, some like reading/writing, but actually learn better by speaking/listening). Technology tends not to serve kinesthetic learners well. It\u2019s a simplification, but most students do learn by the kinesthetic (doing stuff) modality. If you are relying heavily on computers for your class, I encourage you to try to incorporate some kinesthetic activities, and perhaps have students do a few projects that involve a choice of drawing, singing, producing a skit, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "If you look at schools in Scandinavia as having some of the best results in the world, their advancements have a lot to do with recognizing how the brain works best - at least a 10 minute break every hour that promotes physical activity and other periods of time where free activity that still is social and requires some interaction and cooperation and that lets kids explore their interests are parts of the solution. They have done a lot of research that more time in classes of the sort we have had in North America (we are leaning away from the past in some jurisdictions but not all) is actually reducing success in producing adaptable, creative, cooperative young people at the end of high school. Technology is a tool and how well it is designed and implemented are important but so is the overall approach to education. That\u2019s a much bigger fact (that and funding for education). I have seen helpful and unhelpful large technology projects related to education and the difference often times was in what was the objectives, the approaches, and the details of implementation. There\u2019s no one answer - in some cases, technology has been useful, in others not, and usually both at once (pros and cons). Any generalization will be inherently flawed. ",

You can teach virtually anything through online games and classes. Technology allows us to have a single expert teaching hundreds of different students from all around the world without leaving their office. Have you ever been in a classroom and seen the kids so excited to play Kahoot!? Kids love mass participation and class contests. And now it's all easily at the push of a button on a phone or computer. ",
