            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve done a lot of stupid things with tech, but I\u2019d say the time I created over 50,000 copies of a PDF on my school-issued iPad and completely rendered it useless takes the cake.  Near the end of ninth grade, leading up to finals, I had a lot to study for. Naturally, that meant I would be procrastinating just as much, if not more. One of my primary ways I put off studying, or really work in general, was reading. I downloaded a few PDFs for various books, to an app called Notability, which we mostly used for note-taking and worksheets. Among the PDFs I\u2019d downloaded was a 1000+ page book, The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson. After reading all of the books, I was too lazy to get more, so I decided to poke around in Notability. Not long after, I discovered a feature I hadn\u2019t really paid much attention to previously: the duplicate function. The duplicate button allowed me to duplicate all of the files within a single folder.  Click the button, and that 512 becomes 1024. Curious, I decided to place my 1000+page PDF into a folder on its own, and duplicate it, giving me two copies. I duplicated it again. 4 copies. Again. 8. I continued this process for a while, wondering if there was a file limit for the folder. 16. 32. 64. 128. 256. 512. I noticed a bit of lag as the file rapidly multiplied, taking a couple seconds longer for each duplication, but I dismissed it. 1024. 2048. 4096. The lag was now noticeably worse, taking over a minute to get to 2048, and approximately twice that for 4096. It looked like this, but with about one hundred times the files, and one hundred times the lag.  8192. The app was very visibly slowing; I couldn\u2019t do anything but wait as the file count gradually rose, until it finally reached 8192. I hit duplicate again. The app froze, but I figured that it just needed some time. I waited a while, but the file count was barely rising. Oh well, I thought, Maybe I\u2019m being too impatient. After a little over half an hour, I finally reached 16384. Finally. Then, I duplicated all 16384 files, again. It lagged for a second, the count not increasing at all. Hm, maybe it didn\u2019t work? I tried again, with no response. I tried one last time. The app promptly crashed. I tried reopening it. It crashed. I restarted the iPad, and tried opening the app again. It crashed. I tried a couple more times, with varying amounts of success; however, every time, the app crashed before I could do anything. To my horror, this issue wasn\u2019t contained to that one app, either. Everything on my iPad was slowed, and some apps, including Safari, were constantly crashing. I was starting to panic. All of the notes that I had taken throughout the year were on that iPad. Losing them would be catastrophic. During my lunch period, I went to my school\u2019s tech support center and asked for help. Although they were initially taken aback at my statement that my device had been rendered dysfunctional due to creating over fifty thousand copies of a PDF, they agreed to help. However, by the end of the period, the issue still wasn\u2019t resolved. In fact, the number of files seemed to be increasing, the tech center told me, as they watched the iPad\u2019s storage capacity fill up. After trying several other methods, to no avail, they decided that there was only one option left that would allow me to have a functional iPad: Completely reset the iPad, and lose all my notes. Reluctantly, I agreed - it was my only option, and a reset iPad was better than none at all.  Actual photo of my newly reset iPad that I took at the time Thankfully, I was able to obtain notes from other people, and didn\u2019t fail my finals, although numerous photos, notes, and various other documents were lost. In the end, I\u2019m just glad nothing worse happened - I was actually half afraid the iPad would explode, given how much it was overheating. ",

            "answer_text": "My mom found out I drink due to technology error. I grew up in a religious household and in no way has drinking ever been acceptable. I drank in high school and I told my mom about it a couple of times but once I went to college we never discussed it again. I knew she\u2019d be angry and figured she didn\u2019t need to know. Fast forward to when I was 23- I was having my friend over and he also invited a mutual acquaintance to come have a wine and movie night. I didn\u2019t like this person at all and knew I\u2019d consume a moderate amount of booze to make it tolerable. When the hang out was over my best friend and mom texted me the same message at the same time, \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d. I clicked my best friend\u2019s name, my phone glitched, I didn\u2019t double check anything and sent off the reply, \u201cit was good after I wasn\u2019t sober.\u201d It went to my mom. That text changed a lot of stuff that night and I still cringe thinking about it today. ",
