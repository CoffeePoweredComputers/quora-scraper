            "answer_text": "The possible causes of pollution by industries may be due to these reasons: Lack of effective policies and poor enforcement drive allowed many industries to bypass laws made by pollution control board which resulted in mass scale pollution.Toxic chemicals used by industries in processing and manufacturing are the biggest contributors to industrial pollution.Industrial end products such as electronics, car parts, plastics, metals, and chemical utilities such as petroleum, paints, sprays, and cleaning solvents created for human consumption are a major cause of pollution.The industrial waste stream contains numerous chemical substances that are defined in terms of reactivity, ignitability, toxicity and corrosivity. The waste generated is always somewhat hazardous and coupled with the lacking waste management systems, the environment is periodically exposed to high scores of industrial waste pollution.Industrial energy use during production emits high scores of carbon dioxide gas into the atmosphere, making it a leading source of CO2 emission. CO2 emissions around the world arise from energy use in commercial, production, processing, and power producing industries combined.The number of small-scale industries and manufacturing activities has been doubling at a fast rate. The major challenge for small scale industries is that they want to operate, but with limited capital. So, they opt for crooked and dangerous means of manufacturing in order to maximize output at the expense of observing environmental laws. In most cases, they operate illegally thereby promoting illegal dumping. Consequently, they release huge loads of toxic pollutants and dangerous chemicals into the environment.A number of industries still utilize technologies of the past in their production processes instead of embracing cleaner and green technologies.",

            "answer_text": "Hii Naina , The Main Causes Of Industrial Pollution Are: Lack of policies to control pollution\u2013 many industries bypass laws made by the pollution control board because of lack of effective policies and poor enforcement. This is usually done to avoid the higher costs of disposing wastes correctly or installing waste treatment facilities.Unplanned industrial growth\u2013 As development and economic growth takes precedence over environmental or health concerns, rules and norms are flouted causing unplanned growth of industries.Use of out-dated technologies\u2013 This is again done to avoid the higher cost of updating technology. Older machinery produce larger amounts of wastes and it are always good to take advantage of the advances in technology though the initial costs are higher.Presence of large number of small scale industries\u2013 These usually don\u2019t have enough capital and rely on government grants to run their day to day business. When they are classified as small scale, they do not have too many regulations to follow and hence end up releasing more toxins /wastes into the environment.Inefficient waste disposal\u2013 Untreated wastes cause water and soil pollution directly.it lowers the quality of air in surrounding areas. Industrial pollution is major cause of chronic health problemsLeaching of resources from our natural world\u2013 This is the feature of the mining industry which extracts raw material from the earth. At the same time much of it is spilt, leached and in case of radioactive materials, radiation is released. Oil leaks during transportation are also cause of much of the marine pollution.",
