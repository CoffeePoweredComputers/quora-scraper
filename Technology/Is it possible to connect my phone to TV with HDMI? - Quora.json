            "answer_text": "It depends on the phone (I once had a tablet with a micro HDMI port that could connect to a TV all by itself), but for most phones these days, the answer is: A dongle.  Also called a \u201cUSB-to-HDMI adapter\u201d (or \u201cThunderbolt-to-HDMI adapter\u201d if you speak iPhone), it\u2019s a little device that you can plug into your phone\u2019s charging port and plug the other end into an HDMI cable to your TV, and your phone\u2019s screen will automatically show up on the TV screen. Easy! Make sure the one you get has the right USB end, of course. If your phone uses USB Micro, get Micro. If it uses USB-C (or Thunderbolt 3), get C. But that\u2019s it! No apps required. If you\u2019d rather go wireless, many HDMI streaming devices have a setting to connect over Wi-Fi to your phone or tablet and mirror its display on the TV. Like the Roku Streaming Stick, Miracast, Apple TV (iPhone only), Chromecast or Amazon Fire Stick (Android only), and so on. Plug the device into the TV\u2019s HDMI port, connect it and the phone to the Wi-Fi network, and go to town wirelessly. Some newer phones and Smart TVs even have something called DLNA Certification, which allows them to connect to each other directly, without a separate HDMI streaming device needed. But if you don\u2019t mind the cord, and you\u2019re looking for cheap, you can\u2019t beat the dongle. ",

            "answer_text": "If your television has an HDMI input port, there are smartphone to HDMI cables you could buy depending on the type of connector your phone uses (Micro USB, USB type C, Lightening connector, etc.) using which you can view your phone's display on TV. This should be a better option than wireless (Cast / Mirror, etc.) because a cable connection has more bandwidth and offers better quality output than cheaper wireless alternatives. Also, less battery charge consumption. ",
