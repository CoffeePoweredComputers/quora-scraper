            "answer_text": "I have several answers. But first, consider where you use plastics and how long they continue. While more natural than wood, I built both a fence and my deck out of wood-like products made from plastics. They will survive longer than three or four made of wood. I think that is a good trade-off. Next, consider where you use plastics the most. If you should get a lot of plastic bags at stores, and especially if you do not reuse them, consider bringing cloth bags to the store. Or, even bringing used plastic bags that you got when previously shopping. AND, don\u2019t be embarrassed, even the person in line behind you won\u2019t care and won\u2019t notice. (The thing that will annoy them is holding up the line, not how you pay or what bags you use.)Buy bags made of corn or soy instead of plastic. In my experience they cost no more than paper or plastic bags, and they degrade quickly in the landfill. When I lived in Urbana, IL., the city\u2019s yardwaste recycling program required we use bag made by (Decatur IL based) ADM because they degraded in just a month once subjected to the natural rain and other environmental conditions. At that time (1980\u2019s) they cost about a nickle more than paper bags, about 1.50USD for six bags. Granted, they probably cost just a bit more now as do paper yard waste bags, but I think it was a price worth paying.Consider using a metal drink container instead of buying water (or other drinks) in plastic. Most bottled water is just the city water from the town in which it is bottled, though possibly filtered depending upon origin. buy a metal water bottle, fill it at home if you need filtered water, and you can fill it from drinking fountains (etc.) during the day if you wish.Related to the above, if you insist on flavored drinks (which I will confess I like), buy flavors in small flavoring tubes (like Snapple, or whatever flavor you wish), and add them to your bottle when you fill it.Also, reuse bottles, both glass and plastic. Given the above, you may guess that I like Snapple drinks. While I\u2019ve found that their switch from glass to plastic bottles has damaged their flavor, I find that reusing their old (glass) bottles but adding their flavor packet works well for me.if you purchase one or two items that will be easy to carry, just tell the cashier that you will not need a bag. I do this all the time when I buy just a couple of things at a gas station, fast food drive-thru, or convenience store. I mean, really, do I need a bag for the burger that I will be eating in just a minute?Finally when you do get plastic, think of ways to reuse it. When I worked, my lunch bag always was a plastic bag I got when shopping somewhere.I know this will not save the world, but I am certain it will help. I know this is neither a complete nor possibly even good answer, but I hope these little ideas help. ",

            "answer_text": "There are plenty of ideas, and I could just answer: come to my shop and take a pick ;) But I have a better idea! Think how people lived before 1950s when plastic became an everyday thing. It\u2019s not that long ago really, everything was pretty much as it is today, people had cars and radios and could refrigerate food. So how did they survive without plastic? They bought drinks in glass bottles (we can also use stainless steel which is safer, more sturdy and lighter than glass), They used reusable bags for shopping, They used fabric towels, cleaning cloths and hygienic items such as nappies. Tools and kitchen utensils were made of metals or wood. And lets be honest were more durable and healthier that way. Windows and house construction elements and furniture were made of metal and wood. OK, I think you get the gist. The idea is simple: see plastic? Think how did it look before plastics came into our everyday lives. Obviously mobile phones or other electronics will be excluded ;) But all other items existed. a couple examples ;) Hemp wash gloves instead of plastic foam sponges  Games and toys made of wood instead of plastic  Stainless steel coffee making drippers instead of plastic capsules or plastic filters  Paper sandwich bags instead of non-recyclable foil ones  Ceramic containers  Containers made of bamboo or rice husks pulp  Stainless steel or glass drinking straws  Metal shaving equipment  Wooden combs and brushes  Bamboo, felt and wool clothing  And even buttons made of wood :)  ",
