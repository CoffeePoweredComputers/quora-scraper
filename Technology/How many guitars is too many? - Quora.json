            "answer_text": "Old joke\u2026..how many guitars does a guitarist need? One more. I have a friend, a famous rock musician and hit songwriter, who has 100 guitars. Two or three are in his studio at any time and the rest are in cases in his basement. When other guitarists come to record he offers them their choice of one of them but most of them use their own anyway\u2026it's what they know. Does he need that many? Hell no. Some of them are vintage collectibles that almost never get played. But he's rich, can afford them and it makes him happy so who am I to argue. I once saw Fleetwood Mac live and Lindsey Buckingham changed guitars between every song. I walked over to the sound board and saw, next to it, a rack with about 20 guitars. They were all the exact same make and model! I can understand two or three in case he uses different turnings but 20? I personally have three acoustics, two electrics, one bass, one Dobro, one lap steel and one mandolin, so that's nine, if you include the mando. I pretty much just use the Martin D35S and can do almost everything I want with it. I bought my Martin cutaway for when I'm accompanying someone on lead because of its easy access to the upper frets. I have a Seagull with an all mahogany body and top which just sounds fantastic for blues. And of my two electrics I mostly play my Peavy T-60. I can get virtually any tone I want from it (it has a unique tone control, look it up) and its maple neck plays like butter. I mostly do acoustic sets now and depending on the gig I may only take the D35S. If I need to change to another tuning I can do that pretty quickly while carrying on some banter with the crowd. Here's the thing: often audience members will tell me they like my playing. Rarely does someone comment on the actual sound of the instrument and those that do are usually other musicians or gear heads. I admit, years and years ago I played mostly for the approval of other guitarists but now I play for the audience. I think it's more important to hone your technique to get the different tones you need from one guitar than to own a ton of instruments. And BTW, it drives me nuts to watch a guitarist keep fiddling with his or her controls. You know, they play a phrase, move their tone pot, play a phrase, move their volume pot, play a phrase etc. etc. Just play the damn thing! At a certain point in your career, if you haven't figured out how to adjust your tone from the get-go maybe you should switch to drums. ",

            "answer_text": "When the door to your house won't close any more. Sorry, stupid joke. Way back in the dim recesses of the 1990's, when I first started learning, I was told by the older \"professional\" gentlemen I played with that, \"You only need two guitars, kid. A Strat and a Les Paul.  If you can't do it with one of those, you ain't tryin' hard enough.\" For the most part, that's basically true.  Most modern, electric guitar related music today was created using one or both of those guitars. A Strat can grab all the single coil tones: hard rock, regular rock, extra rock, rock extra dry, jazz, country (it has the same pickup set up as a Tele, save the middle one), etc. and a Les Paul can grab all things humbucking under the sun (solo work, chugging metal, warm-ish jazz tones, southern rock, etc.)  What more do you need? Well, first...you don't need a Les Paul, you need the humbuckers but, not necessarily the Les Paul that's attached to them.  From what I've seen, played and made, a Les Paul's \"signature\" sound can be found in the quality of it's humbuckers.  The same goes for a Stratocaster, though not humbuckers of course, but single coils. So, really, what you can use is a solidly built guitar with a duel humbucker configuration and an  equally, solidly built guitar with a three single coil configuration.  So, if you want to cover a lot of sound...uh...ground, those would be the best two to get a hold of.  Now...here's where things get tricky. I'm a firm believer that tone wood on an electric is useless, it's all about the pickups for the most part...and even then, it's all about what they're made from...and even then, it's just about the magnet strength, wire gauges and winds (that's winds, as in winding a clock).   So, generally, I have a few guitars that have different pickup configurations...such as  And  And  among others. This explanation, of course, leaves out the many control options, such as pots, wiring variations, bridge types (tremolo, fixed), split coils and combining pickups via switches and the like that also affect the sound going to the amp (which is another monster altogether) obviously, but you asked how many is too many, which is...for me...a very hard question as there is an endless array of variations. I would say, however, that it's limited to your budget, physical spacial limitations, the leniency of loved ones and your imagination. For me that number is 10.  The number is 10. I hope this helps.
