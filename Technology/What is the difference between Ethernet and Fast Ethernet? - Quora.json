            "answer_text": "A2A: Although this is not technically correct, nowadays a non-formal reference to \u201cfast Ethernet\u201d would probably be for a connection supporting gigabit speeds. Most new computers do support 1000Mbps. Very few modern devices fail to support 100Mbps. So if you hear \u201cfast Ethernet\u201d you might need to check whether the phrase is being used in the formally defined sense or to refer to what is commonly the fast version now. ",

            "answer_text": "Ethernet is the most common communication protocol standard used in current LAN. Ethernet can be divided into standard Ethernet (10Mbps), fast Ethernet (100Mbps), high-speed Ethernet (1000Mbps), and 10mb Ethernet (10000Mbps). So Ethernet and fast Ethernet are subordinate. Fast Ethernet is one kind of Ethernet. ",
