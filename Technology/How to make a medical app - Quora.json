            "answer_text": "On a regulatory level, the FTC maintains a list of mobile health app best practices to help developers create high-quality apps that align with industry standards. When identifying the apps best-suited to their organization\u2019s needs, healthcare stakeholders should look for apps that possess the following features, as outlined by the FTC:  1. Minimal Data Collection Patient data collection requires careful scrutiny of industry regulations. The FTC recommends that mobile health apps collect data only if the data is integral to a product or service. Additionally, a well-developed app must be able to secure, transmit, store and eventually delete the data. 2. Limited Access and Permissions In an era of smartphones and apps that access everything from locations to contacts, many consumers don\u2019t question why an app would need to pull certain information. A responsibly designed app will use trusted user interface as much as possible, as opposed to direct API access, and use those trusted components only when it makes sense, in order to minimize unnecessary data collection. 3. Secure Authentication Healthcare records and information are valuable to patients, healthcare professionals and, unfortunately, hackers, so using authentication as a method of improving application-level security should be a primary concern during development. From the beginning, developers and owners should invest in designing, implementing and testing app authentication. If the risk of illegitimate access is high, options such as multifactor authentication should be considered. 4. Compatibility Mobile platforms differ by API, security features and permissions. A well-built app should be developed only after researching these differences, and it should adapt codes as needed to protect user data. These questions become more complex when third-party service providers are introduced. Responsible developers work to ensure data is protected, and they communicate their expectations and requirements to any entity they\u2019re working with. 5. Application-level Security Well-developed mobile health apps are built by companies that prioritize security from the ground up. At the minimum, one person is responsible for data security, if not an entire team. Engineers behind the app should have experience in secure coding practices or be trained as needed. Data security should be a priority at every stage in the app\u2019s lifecycle, from design to development to launch, all the way to post-market. Since healthcare threats are always evolving, security measures will need to do the same. 6. Resources for Security Improvements Security is a concern across the board, so naturally, multiple resources for improving application-level security exist. These come in the form of software libraries, software development kits (SDKs), cross-platform toolkits and free tools that can be used to improve encryption, navigate pre- and post-launch testing, check password strengths, test interfaces and reverse engineer programming code. 7. Clear Communication A well-designed app talks to its users in a clear, simple way. In healthcare, it\u2019s especially important to avoid jargon as much as possible. Developers should acquire clear consent before gathering any information, both during installation and at any point afterward, and the app must include an easily accessible privacy policy. 8. Compliance With Regulations For mobile health app developers, this can be especially challenging, since laws ranging from the FTC act, HIPAA and the FTC\u2019s Health Breach Notification Rule, to the FDA\u2019s Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act could apply to all, or parts, of an app. The collection of financial data, the data of young children (under 13) and even state laws will be factors in developing an app that is compliant with the proper legal environments. There are many other recommendations provided by organizations such as the FTC for creating the best mobile health apps possible. Wise developers, healthcare providers and businesses should review these best practices closely, as 2018 presents an exciting opportunity for the development of mobile health technology that produces truly positive outcomes. But if you ask me, then I suggest you to go with Uber Clone app company. They provide you 100% customizable script which is inbuilt with all latest features which are used in an healthcare app nowadays. But still if you want to add or remove any thing from the app it can be done easily. To check the demo version of an script visit play store and download Call'a Doctor app. And to know more about the cost and development connect with the team. ",
