            "answer_text": "More blades are the scam of the century! There is no way that multiple blades can do better than a single blade except in one specific area. Having multiple blades on a razors allows the consumer to cut more hair with one swipe. That is the only thing the improve about a shave. But there is a trade-off occurring when you add blades. That trade off is irritation potential from removing more skin, and the changed angle of the cut due to having more blades. For most  the trade off is totally unknown. Because many have never shaved with anything other than multi blade razors. But for those of us who know better the best shaves always come from a single blade used in the proper manner. This single blade gives the closest, most comfortable, and longest lasting shave of any type of hair removal. It can be accomplished with a straight razor, a single edge injector style razor, a Safety razor, or a disposable single blade razor.The key to the closest and most comfortable shave is in the preparation and the products used to shave with. You can't use canned shaving creams and do a once over the face shave and expect anything good. You need to learn the art of \"Wetshaving\" as it has been practiced for centuries before. The idea is to get the beard and skin fully hydrated by keeping the face and beard wet for 3-10 minutes before beginning to shave.Once the beard and face are fully hydrated then one would use a shaving brush and shaving soap to make their own shave lather. This lather will be wetter and better for the skin than commercial shaving creams that are premade.  And then the shave will be done using short light strokes on the beard. The razor is NEVER pushed against the face. It is rested against the face in the proper angle and simply guided along. The weight of the razor doing the work. Hair reduction is the goal not total hair removal. To complete the shave multiple passes over the face are used. But remember that you are only passing a single blade over the face each time so the effect on the face is MUCH less damaging than that 5 blade wonder razor.For most wet shavers two or sometimes three passes over the whole face are all that is necessary to remove all the beard and leave the face smooth and irritation free.When learning to shave properly in this manner it takes some time to unlearn the bad habits that modern razors have taught us all. And there are nicks and cuts sometimes as you learn this new way of shaving. But if you take the time to learn the process and practice, the very best shaves you have ever experienced are soon coming to you.The trade off for this type of shaving is that it takes a bit longer to shave this way because of the prep and the two or three whole face shaves. Expect to take 20 minutes or so when learning. But once you have learned how to do this style of shaving the total time spent will be down to 10-15 minutes total.The best part is that you will have the satisfaction of knowing that the shaves you are getting are the very best that can be done by anyone.To learn more about traditional shaving visit the website: http://www.badgerandblade.com/ ",

When's the last time you seen a single bladed object get clogged? Less blades, I found, makes it easier to shave, even with longer hair, I don't need to use my trimmer with those dual blades, but it does help with lest strokes and saves time. If I tried it with a 5 blade, I'd get it stuck in my beard again. Even when daily, I didn't find the more blades getting as smooth as using less blades, but that's just my experience. If you do use less blades, you will have yo be more careful, I've come myself with replacement blades before, and with the dual blade I did go the wrong direction when looking in the mirror shaving my head, very easily took about a 1mm\u20227mm chunk of skin off my head, and that was a heavily used on, too.

Since the male perspective has been taken care of, I'll put in my 2\u00a2: As a woman, switching to a Quattro, I swear, changed my shaving habits.  I used to shave my legs only if I was sure they were going to show, because all the blood and guts and stinging afterward, etc. wasn't worth it to me. Tried all the messy options like waxing and Nair and hated the fuss, so I just gave up unless it was bathing suit season... and even then, since my leg-hair is pretty light, I wasn't terribly diligent. Now\u2014smooth legs all year 'round, whether anybody but me will see 'em or not, because since I switched a few years ago, I have not had a single cut. Ever.

Yes, there will be a point of decreasing marginal return, where each blade does noticeably less and less, but that point is not yet.  6 has been better than 5, which was better than 4, than 3, than 2.  I didn't say \"than 1\" because there are safety-razor fans out there, and they do well, especially since they change their blades constantly.   I'll add that the vibrating handles on some now haven't been a gimmick either.  I even bought the vibrating ones that Sharper Image put out 20 years ago (and everyone I gave one to was afraid to use it.) I'm not self-aware enough to comment on whether the moisture strips have helped me, but the strips that change color when it's time to change the blade have done their job.  And I will mention that at times I've gone on kicks buying the women's versions because they have bigger handles, with the bonus of rubberized grips and more moisture strips. Day to day I use a Gillette Fusion Power -- with 6 vibrating blades, every morning is like carving turkey at Thanksgiving.  :) Now, for your reference, I'm \u00bc Cuban, \u215b Danish, \u215b Irish, then the other \u00bd is vague mutt-ery that is probably biologically English, Scottish and French -- all that to say I don't have a five o'clock shadow or coarse hair.

Tons of people discover that a traditional double edge (DE) razor, properly used not only yields a far better shave, but saves tons of money. I was recently in the drug store, and saw a 10 pack of multi-blade cartridges for $27. For me, those would last 2 - 3 months. For the same money, you could buy a 100 pack of DE blades that would give you a way better shave and be far better for the environment. Factor in another $40 or so for a solid razor, and for under $70 you can shave for at least a year and a half. ",

They and only they are able to fit 7 blades to the frame because of the way they insert their blades. Three works great and all that you might ever ever need. Four is sort of pushing the limits, but hey ok\u2026 we all want to suck in once in a while. 7 blades\u2026. you're probably the guy who is buying the new iphone every year! But seriously, it does not add to the shaving much, but deletes a lot in being too unwieldy. ",

Think about the multi blades, if the first blade was a good one then there is no requirement for the others. Another great advantage of the Derby blade is that they are so inexpensive. ",
