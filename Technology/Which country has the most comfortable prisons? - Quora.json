            "answer_text": "San Pedro Prison in La Paz, Bolivia!It's its own little city within those walls. The prison has eight sections, \"ranging from miserable to luxurious\" (BBC). The more money you have, the better 'cell' you can BUY. All inmates buy themselves a cell, they aren't provided. Once the own a cell they can do whatever they like with it... install televisions with cable, kitchenettes, sometimes even internet; you can do whatever you like as long as you have the money for it. To generate some income the inmates start up their own businesses within the prison: restaurants, food stalls, hair dressers, etc. San Pedro Prison is also said to be the place, in all the world, where the purest cocaine is made. At night, the cocaine is made in \"laboratories\" and then sold both internally and externally of the prison. The prison also has its own political system with each section democratically electing its own representatives. Families live together within the prison... if the father is locked up, his wife and children will come to live with him in the prison. The children are allowed to leave the prison everyday to attend school and the wives and come and go as they please.The prison even has community events like football matches and celebrations on holidays.I read a very interesting novel about San Pedro Prison (not very well written but the information about the prison itself was fascinating), called Marching Powder by Rusty Young. For a quick idea of what the prison is like, here's a link for a \"photo journal\": http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/06/americas_inside_a_bolivian_jail/html/2.stm ",

            "answer_text": "I am not very familiar with prisons I do know that the Netherlands have a prison system that allows weekend leaves (even for sex offenders); cells tend to have television, catered mails, good medical care ect, If prisoners are well behaved they can have take-away ordered every so often. I believe the key is whether a country's legal system is set up to rehabilitate and resocialise it convicts or too have a more drastic system; that is focussed to keep a convict in and deprive or take way its humanity. Another factor is maybe whether a prison is run by a government or an investment group, I suppose the conditions and circumstances might be very different, but not by default ",
