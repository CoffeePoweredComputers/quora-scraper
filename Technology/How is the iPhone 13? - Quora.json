            "answer_text": "iPhone 13 series will launch in September-2023. Currently, Apple is going to release iOS 13, iPhone 11 series & Apple Watch Series 5 on September 10th, 2019. I assume you are referring to iOS 13 which is in the final stages of the beta program and will release after a week. Apple introduced tons of new features in iOS 13 like Dark mode, Natural voiced Siri, faster FaceID, smaller app updates, faster app launches, swiping in default keyboard, new 3-finger gestures for undo, redo, cut & copy, etc. It will be really good. So, I recommend you to upgrade to iOS 13 as soon as it is released to the general public. ",

            "answer_text": "Mine is GREAT I love it with the new AR technology, very good as I might say the least tho a glass backing is kinda prone to breaking and the paper thin design is really annoying , but 6 cameras (4 in the back and 2 in the front) and 2 screens on front and back give your photos and videos more depth than ever with upgraded tech to fit the future of iPhone, the battery last for over 1 week making it the longest lasting iPhone ever to go on the market. The iPhone 13 has revolutionized the world of smart phones and will continue for a very long time. ",
