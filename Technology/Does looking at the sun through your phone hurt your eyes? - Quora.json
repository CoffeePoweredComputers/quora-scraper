            "answer_text": "No. But staring at the sun for long periods should be avoided. Solar retinopathy occurs when looking directly at the sun. The suns rays are concentrated and focused on the retina by the crystalline lens inside your eyes. Think of lighting a leaf on fire with a magnifying lens. The magnifying lens is your eye and the leaf is your retina. Indirect viewing of the sun while probably not great when practiced at great lengths is not a risk for retinal damage. As always there are exceptions so please no one try and prove otherwise. Your eyes are fine. Don\u2019t worry. ",

            "answer_text": "It hurts the phone. The camera on your phone will focus the sunlight on the chip inside the camera and fry it. You will either see permanent spots on your pictures from then on, or the camera will just not work anymore. The screen of your phone cannot put out as much light as direct sunlight. So unless you look past your phone and directly at the Sun you will not hurt your eyes, just the phone. ",
