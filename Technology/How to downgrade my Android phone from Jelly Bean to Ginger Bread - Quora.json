            "answer_text": "This depends upon your requirements! First of all let me tell you that the jellybean os is any day better than Gingerbread.  Reasons: 1. Better ram usage2. Better battery 3. More app compatibility  So in case you need to overcome the problem on your phone, do one of the following : 1. Try to root your phone using the tutorials given in XDA threads. Then try to flash a custom jellybean os or a custom gingerbread os( u May have lesser options with gingerbread anyway). Samsungs OEM jellybean sucks with a shit load of bloat ware that consumes so much ram and battery though you may not use those shit. I remember the apps such as kies, game hub etc., pure shit they are and I have never even opened them. 2. Another method is that if you are a huge fan of Samsungs official gingerbread , then you can download the firmware for your region from sites such as samfirmware for ur phone and then flash the phone to factory settings using Odin flash tool. Again the steps will be available in XDA threads. Personally I would suggest you to flash jellybean after rooting your phone! Learn what rooting is from various sources , understand the potential of a rooted android phone.  I would like to warn you(but don't worry rooting and flashing is just fun) that rooting voids your warranty. So whatever you do , follow every step very carefully.  A final piece of advice, whatever firmware u download , before flashing check if it is actually meant for your phone . Then use some app to check the md5 sum of such zip files and then proceed to flash. Following these precautions you will finish the process with ease.  You should have kitkat for your device by now. Just check for that too! ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "You need to root your phone and install the custom Android OS. For the exact steps you can visit XDA developers forum and search for your phone model and follow the steps mentioned in the forums. It will void your warranty if you root your phone but this is the only option. ",
