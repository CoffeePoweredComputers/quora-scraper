            "answer_text": "Seems to me that you want to shed your armour, or at least some of it. The recipe I have is for becoming your true self, which may be too naked for you. You could start by shedding some outer layers, and see how that affects you. The classic Zen koan path would fit the bill, but you would need a qualified teacher to do that. The Zen monk has to pass 400\u2013500 koans, it is compared to a chicklet pecking at his egg from the inside while the teacher helps from the outside. The first beginner's koan is usually Muji, or Does a Dog Have Buddha Nature? The answer is MU!! but you have to demonstrate it to your teacher\u2026.. There is a shortcut. Genpo Merzel Roshi promises to enlighten rich dudes for like $5000, using some techniques he has collected. I think it includes a week or so on Maui, so not a waste of time\u2026.. ",

            "answer_text": "Practice being open and honest with other people. Use your judgment about which of the people in your life will be most receptive and kind. If you have a significant other, start with them. You're with them for a reason. If you don't have one then start trying to connect with people you find interesting. ",
