            "answer_text": "None, all inventions have a use that very often transcends their initial purpose. The invention of nuclear physics opened up the world of mass destruction but very quickly moved into other areas. Granted that chemical warfare is a hugely damaging invention if you look at specifics. But taken as a whole it has gone so much further. Some of The biggest evolutionary inventions come at times of great stress, this is when the worlds monetary influencers are shoved to one side and others with what has proven to be great inventions get listened too most eagerly. Which is in itself a crying shame. I have shared an enormous idea that will take VR to unseen before learnings into the human. As yet I have seen no reaction. This could lead me to think in many ways. None of which are favourable to those I have shared it with. This is so wrong on many fronts. It may just lead me to share publicly. Which is a good thing but it also leads to a lack of ability to get funding for a novel project. One day someone will have a serious discussion with me about how to travel at the speed of light. I have the outline sorted. But as my IP attorney said. It will be hard to protect prior to it being held as plausible. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not really an invention, more likely a discovery. History of tobacco - Wikipedia does explain very well, how a simple plant transported from the Americas to Europe has become a menace, very hard to remove from humanity again. Being loaded with heavy taxation, some nations are excusing their \u201cremoval effort\u201d ( \u2026or not \u2026 ) with the income this product is bringing to their budget. The addicted are paying for their own treatment. Smokers are dying before they reach pension age for which they have contributed hard with intense labour throughout their life. Let them smoke. It will save the nation heaps. I have witnesses several of my friends to go that way to classify such neglect only next to the behaviour of the military in WW I, sending one wave of soldiers after another into their certain demise of machine gun fire. Conscious slaughter. Accepting tobacco products, especially cigarettes laced further with the addictive nicotine, is nothing different to that unsocial behaviour. ",
