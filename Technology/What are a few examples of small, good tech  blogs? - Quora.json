            "answer_text": "Those are great tech blogs for sure, and there are plenty more out there that fly under most of our radars but deserve a mention. Here are a few of my favorites: Ghacks - Martin Brinkmann writes about topics that most other tech blogs tend to ignore. His posts are well written and informative. Redmond Pie - Although the name would have you believe this blog is all about Microsoft products and technologies, it actually covers a wide range of tech topics including products and news from the worlds of Apple and Google. RicksDailyTips - Disclaimer: This is my own blog, so take that into account when you read the following: RicksDailyTips is all about making technology simple and easy to understand. It offers thousands of \u201cHow to\u201d posts covering a wide range of tech topics. Reader questions are also answered in a truthful, straight-forward way. Winaero - This one really is all about the Microsoft Windows ecosystem. You\u2019ll find plenty of timely Windows tips, tricks and news here. ",
