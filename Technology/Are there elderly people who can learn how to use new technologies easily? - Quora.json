            "answer_text": "If by \u201cold\u201d you mean those over 40 - then certainly. They abound, you meet them everyday and probably report to one, or your boss does. If on the other hand you mean people over 90 - no. Our UI\u2019s are too stupid for them. \u201cOld\u201d means deteriorating physical coordination that starts in your 70\u2019s. Most \u201cnew\u201d technologies require good vision to handle increasingly complex interfaces, high levels of manual dexterity for typing, tapping or making gestural signals. This - combined with an array of complex menu options (Think- Not Alexa) require users to navigate a complicated menu tree that often fails to produce the desired results. While the pre-pubescent set will pound away until they have chased down every rabbit hole, the elderly take this as a sign you don\u2019t really want then to do any useful work and give up. In Japan - with the focus on an aging society - interfaces are smarter, simpler with fewer choices and much more intelligence behind the screen than in front to anticipate and react quickly to the needs of \u201cThe Silver Set\u201d. Not so much in the US. Complexity is not the sign of a great interface designer. Ask Jony Ive. ",

            "answer_text": "If by \u201cold people\u201d you mean people in their 50\u2019s, then there are definitely people who can easily learn to use new technologies. I\u2019m in my 50\u2019s and I\u2019m far better at learning new technology than I was in my 20\u2019s, because I have the benefit of 30 more years of learning and perspective that I can apply to every new technology. (Hint: Most \u201cnew\u201d technology is just a slight tweak to old technology.) If by \u201cold people\u201d you mean people in their 80\u2019s or older, then there are definitely people who can easily learn to use new technologies. I know folks in their 80\u2019s who regularly use new gadgets, software, mobile apps, and Web sites. Age really has nothing to do with ability to learn, but experience does make learning easier. I suspect the stereotype of old people being unable to learn new technology is because they\u2019re unwilling to learn new technology; not because they can\u2019t, but because they\u2019ve got better things to do.
