            "answer_text": "Actually, it is the exact same price for the phone but since the phone isn\u2019t the only cost, there is still big money to be saved on the plans you are now eligible to choose from/between. This is where people are making their big mistake and overpaying for the next couple of years often by a thousand dollars or more depending on your individual circumstances. Family plans by the big boys tend to be less of a ripoff. Assuming you bought an unlocked iphone (and IDK why you wouldn\u2019t if you were buying outright, isn\u2019t that the point?). The result will be you will not be making payments that pay off the phone to the company you bought it from, which essentially is tying you to that carrier and their current plan offerings until the phone is paid off. If you buy outright though, you are now eligible to pick from all the different providers and their different plans. I don\u2019t just mean the big boys like Verizon, ATT, Sprint and T mobile as plans directly. However, the pay as you go plans ride on those very same networks meaning you get get the same coverage at half the cost. Iphones have both cdma and GSM antenna so you don\u2019t have to worry about your unlocked phone and your network. Pay as you go plans are much cheaper especially for people particularly for those who aren\u2019t on any family plans but even in that situation it is almost always cheaper YMMV. Most services offer a bring your own device plan. This often scares the uninformed away but depending on you choice of carriers you can often get the exact same plan for half the price and you are still using the networks of the big boys. For example The Cricket network rides on the ATT network (so you get the same coverage area) currently their top of the line plan unlimited everything at top speed (some lesser plans will throttle your data plan down after you pass a certain usage point but still unlimited) for $60 roughly half the price of big guys unlimited single plans so over the next two years you will save $1,4440 . At the very least that savings pays for your next Iphone X (or whatever the latest version is at the time of your need) the next time you need to replace it. I don\u2019t currently know all the plan prices exactly all I know is my choice of buying the iphone outright for the last 5 years has saved me thousands. The phones have now gotten to the point that the upgrades for the latest model, over the last model or two are often just aren\u2019t worth it. If you wait to buy the last model (but still new) at the point when next release has been announced often times the stores give gift cards of as much as $300 store credit (they won\u2019t discount the phone as apple prevents them from doing that). So buying the iphone outright isn\u2019t about saving money on the phone it is about saving money on the plan. ",

            "answer_text": "Cash purchase on paper is cheapest as the Upgrade Program includes AppleCare. The trade-off is you don\u2019t get a new iPhone every year. But let\u2019s look at the math (Assuming a 256GB at $1,149): Upgrade Program: $57/month ($684 annual), Apple Care included Purchase: $1,149 paid up front, No Apple Care A year later you want the new phone: Upgrade Program: Turn in your X and get the new one, resume monthly payment of some amount around $57/month Purchase: $1,149 - <trade in or sell your X (EBay?)> = ??? If you can guarantee a high resale number then you have a chance to do better but I still think if you want the new phone every year its a better choice to get the Upgrade Program. Keep in mind, the carrier purchase programs are also very good and a little less expensive than Apple. Good Luck. ",
