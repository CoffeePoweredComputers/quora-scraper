            "answer_text": "You need to re-ask this question. Blackberry is an oversimplification. You need to be more specific In this scenario...there 3 types (generations) of blackberry. BlackBerry os 5,6,7 phones- Older more traditional blackberries that most people are familiar with. The bold and curve series are good examplesBlackberry os 10 - theres no BlackBerry os 8 or 9. Bb10 is like a reinvention of the phone with more mainstream hardware and soft ware. This is when blackberrys started becoming all touch screen and have a ui similar to iphone and android with touch gestures. TheExamples. BlackBerry q and z series , passport. The phones were very good. A major number of people found it better than iphones. They just lacked the right amount of applications. They tried to fix this issue by enabling the installation of apks. But it just didnt work outBlackberry android - This is the current generation of blackberry phones. This is where blackberry had finally given up making hardware. Now the phones re made by tcl and blackberry modifies the hardware a bit. The phones come with stock Android but blackberry adds various features like gesture based input to make it more like bb10, productivity hub, free blackberry hub+ services,the dtek app e t c. They claim their android phones are the most secure android phones around. Examples BlackBerry keyone,dtek50,60, priv. Etc.Now I think you need to consider your question again.

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of corporations which still use Blackberry phones for day to day usage. It's not something new. However , with the advent of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) people are able to get their own android or iOS devices which can be configured to get the mailing part or any other useful apps. BB\u2019s are still in business at a corporate level owing to their really good exchange mailing devices popularly called BES. At my workplace, like many other camera mobiles are not allowed and hence I use a Bold 9900 cameraless mobile. And I use Z10 otherwise. I do love these devices as they have a very streamlined and stable OS. The market share may be less but BB\u2019s are still in business. ",
