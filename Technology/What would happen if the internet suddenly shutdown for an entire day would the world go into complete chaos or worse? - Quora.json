            "answer_text": "Not for 1 day. If it was gone for 1 week, yes the results would be very negative for the world economy, financial markets and stability of the world. But for 1 day many companies would lose a lot of money, consumers would be frustrated and many employees would be sent home (those who only work with Internet). Humanity would survive, and we would survive.. As I said, if the interruption lasted for more than around 1 week, then it would be problematic. People would start rioting, requesting Internet to be back online as soon as possible People would not be able to book airline tickets, buy online goods, etc, but that\u2019s ok. Manual procedures (offline procedures) could be brought back temporarily. I also think that some opportunistic people would profit from this situation, though I\u2019m not really sure how. Maybe they would try to convince people that Internet is back online (when in fact it is not) and screw people\u2026(must be researched). But apart from teenagers and Web addicts to Facebook and Instagram, the consequences for 1 day would not be too great\u2026 Companies would suffer the most! ",

            "answer_text": "No\u2026 Most companies still uses, Telephone operators, Fax lines! Mail services is improved very big! I think we would just see more manual labor jobs emerge and many roles being shifted until the outages resumes! I would still game\u2026 but not multiplay game! Internal networks would still work, PBX system can easily communicate or replace IP phone systems with a day or weeks work of conversion times depending on the circumstances! Basically even if we lost electricity, we would still find a way, even if its Madd Maxx in the Thunder Dome! ",
