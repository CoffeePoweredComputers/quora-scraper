            "answer_text": "I love and appreciate business history, so if we're going for the top 10 greatest entrepreneurs we should at least consider entrepreneurs throughout the 20th and 21st century. That knocks out guys like Ben Franklin, John Jacob Astor, Andrew Carnegie, Marshall Field, etc. My list is also biased to the United States, otherwise I'd have to consider the history of the world.  I'll also bias this list towards the creation of economic value, as well as the impact the entrepreneur had on their industry, on other industries, and in the creation of other significant companies. Without further ado, here are 10 of the greatest entrepreneurs in history:  J.D. Rockefeller: his brilliant insight to consolidate the oil industry via Standard Oil, and realize the benefits of scale, made him a force to be reckoned with. Perhaps more importantly, consider his philanthropic impact with his role in founding several universities, as well as the scope of his foundation's work while he was alive and even after he died. JP Morgan: in 1907, he singlehandedly saved the U.S. economy from collapsing. People forget this, but imagine a guy like Warren Buffett leading all our recent bailout packages and that's the kind of impact JP had. JP was the finance function of the United States. Plus the partnership that he founded was responsible for the financing of several important businesses that impacted the broader economy, including many of the railroads. Via the HBS case on him, from 1902 to 1912, they were responsible for $2 billion in corporate issues (GNP was $20 billion... so they impacted 10% of the economy). Also, JP Morgan played a direct role in the formation of 5 giant companies: GE, AT&T, Federal Steel, US Steel (world's first billion dollar company), and International Harvester. Lastly, JP Morgan is now a $150 billion company. That it survived over 100 years is incredible, that it's that big is even more impressive. Edit: one more thing which Kyle Doherty suggested to drive the point home is that Morgan Stanley came out of JP Morgan as well. So add that market cap to JP Morgan's current market cap.Henry Ford: he created Ford, which democratized cars for everyone. In the process, he created an incredible company which is still a +$40 billion company today. Think about that: a company endured over 100 years. He is the godfather of assembly-line manufacturing, but he was also a prescient employer who was famous for paying above average wages to his workers. Many of his insights influenced his competitors in the auto industry, but also throughout modern manufacturing.Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce: Fairchild Semiconductor, the company that spawned a huge industry (semiconductors) and whose workers went on to do things like found Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia Capital, and several important semiconductor companies. If that wasn't enough, then they went and started Intel.Sam Walton: Wal-Mart. The strategy here was incredible, by going high volume and low margin. Their scale has had an incredible positive impact for consumers by saving them billions every year. They do $250 billion in sales now out of a humble start in Arkansas. Bill Gates: Microsoft. Their IPO in the 1980's created thousands of millionaires. They changed an entire industry, though I have to take away points for their monopolistic tendencies. Just the wealth creation here is impressive, but consider what Bill Gates alone has managed to do with his wealth via the Gates Foundation. That's all because of Microsoft.Jim Clark: why do so many people forget what this guy did? He founded three multi-billion companies: Silicon Graphics, Netscape, and Healtheon. His co-founder at Netscape, a young precocious technologist at the time, went on to found Opsware, Ning, and a VC firm currently shaking things up. That young guy's name is Marc Andreessen. Sergey Brin and Larry Page: Google. Incredible wealth creation and in a really fast amount of time. They haven't just changed search, they've done an incredible amount of open source work in addition to their initiatives in mobile, etc. Caveat: the Google alums are perhaps more famous as investors, since as entrepreneurs I can't think of a Google alum who went on to found a company that sold for more than $50 million.I hated that I couldn't add someone like Jeff Bezos, who brought the scale and benefits of Walmart but to the internet via Amazon. I hated that I couldn't add a guy like Mark Zuckerberg, who may be on this list one day, but I didn't want to add him because it's still too early in the Facebook story. This list is really a list of the greatest modern entrepreneurs in the United States. The fun thing about this list is that we can debate it endlessly. ",

            "answer_text": "Today I'm sharing a list featuring 11 of history's most famous entrepreneurs. From Oprah to Hans Christian Anderson, we're sharing these tales of past and present entrepreneurs who had to claw their way to the topToday 1. Oprah Winfrey  As you're probably well aware, Oprah is the richest African American of the 21st century, and with a net worth of over $3 billion, she is regarded as arguably the most influential woman in the world. Her incredible success is all the more impressive considering her rough upbringing. The daughter of an unmarried teen who worked as a housemaid, Oprah grew up in extreme poverty. Her family was so poor that, as a child, Oprah was teased at school for wearing dresses made of potato sacks. She also was the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of family members, which she discussed with TV viewers during a special episode of her show. Oprah's first big break was her gig at the local black radio station. Stations managers were impressed with her oration and passion, leading Oprah to work her way up the ranks to bigger radio stations, eventually resulting in her appearing on TV as well. It was actually Robert Ebert who convinced Oprah to sign the deal that launched The Oprah Winfrey Show. And the rest, folks, is history. 2. Walt Disney  Walt Disney started off as a farm boy drawing cartoon pictures of his neighbor's horses for fun. When he was older, Walt tried to get a job as a newspaper cartoonist, but was unable to find one and ended up working in an art studio where he created ads for newspapers and magazines. Eventually he grew to work on commercials, became interested in animation, and eventually opened his own animation company. Disney's first original character creation was Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, but it was officially owned by Universal Pictures because he was working under contract at the time. When Walt walked out on Universal Pictures after getting a pay cut, he needed to create a replacement, which is how Mickey Mouse came into being. Disney was wildly successful with his animation company, but he wasn't satisfied. He was determined to make the biggest and greatest theme park ever seen, saying to a colleague, \"I want it to look like nothing else in the world.\" One of the biggest entertainment moguls of all-time, with an unrelenting spirit and commitment to his vision, Disney is undoubtedly an entrepreneurial all-state. 3. J.K. Rowling  Today J.K. Rowling is a household name for fans of the beloved Harry Potter book series, but she wasn't always gifted with magic. The fact is, J.K Rowling was at her rope's end before her misfit gang of witches and wizards saved her. Before her bestseller cast a spell on readers, J.K. Rowling was living on welfare and struggling to get by as a single mother. Today she is estimated to have a net worth of $1 billion. Rumor has it she's also the president of Gringotts Wizarding Bank, although it's a bit of a secret among the goblins. Did you know that some people believe that J.K Rowling sold her soul to the devil in exchange for the Harry Potter inspiration? When you're so successful people think you're making deals with the devil, you're a pretty big deal. 4. John Paul DeJoria  Today he's known for his Paul Mitchell hair products and for Patron Tequila, but John Paul DeJoria started off at the bottom. A first-generation American, DeJoria was born to German and Italian parents. He was sent to live in a L.A. foster home, and he even spent time in a street gang. When he first created John Paul Mitchell Systems, he was selling his hair products door to door while living out of his car. It all paid off, though\u2014today John Paul Mitchell Systems earns over $900 million a year. John Paul DeJoria proves that things have to get worse before they get better. 5. Madam CJ Walker  Sarah Breedlove (aka Madam CJ Walker) was one amazing lady. She is regarded as the first black female self-made American millionaire. Born in 1867, her parents and older siblings had been slaves on a Louisiana plantation. She was the first of her family to be born into freedom (that's some lucky timing!). Madam CJ Walker started her own line of beauty and hair products specifically designed for black women. She saw a market that wasn't being met, and created a solution to a problem no one else seemed interested in solving. As you can imagine, during her time she had to fight tooth and nail for every step up the ladder. A smart, strategic, and enterprising woman, she perfectly embodies the entrepreneurial spirit (with stylish hair to match). 6. Steve Jobs  You can't really make a self-respecting \"famous entrepreneurs\" list without throwing in Steve Jobs. Jobs dropped out of college because his family couldn't handle the financial burden of his education. He unofficially continued to audit classes, living off free meals from the local Hare Krishna temple and returning Coke bottles for change just to get by. Jobs credited the calligraphy class he stopped in on as his inspiration for the Mac's revolutionary typefaces and font design. Jobs went on to have an unbelievable career, eventually forming the Apple Computer Company with his childhood friend and electronics expert Steve Wozniak. Often referred to as \"The Grandfather of the Digital Revolution,\" Jobs forever changed the consumer electronics industry. At the time of his death, his net worth was over $8.3 billion, and his influence will be felt for many digital generations to come. 7. Andrew Carnegie  Just hearing Andrew Carnegie's name brings back yawns and daydream distractions from high school history class. I had no interest in Carnegie back in school, but today he serves as a pretty amazing example of entrepreneurship. Carnegie had a really rough life growing up. He spent his childhood working in factories, and at night he forced himself to sleep as a way to forget his constant hunger. Carnegie eventually worked his way up to becoming a superintendent for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company before creating several of his own businesses, the most successful being the Carnegie Steel Mill. Despite being one of the richest Americans of all-time, he also serves as a class act example of generosity. Following his belief that \"the man who dies rich dies disgraced,\" Carnegie donated nearly 90 percent of his wealth to various charities and foundations. His is widely considered one of the largest benefactors of libraries and educational institutions across the country. Thank you, Carnegie, for giving a second home to us nerdy kids who practically lived in our local libraries. 8. Benjamin Franklin  Only an entrepreneur would conduct some of the wacky experiments old Benny was always up to. Franklin is credited with creating the lightening rod, bifocals, and the Franklin stove (yeah, that last one might have been a bit of a flop). Like many famous entrepreneurs before and after him, Franklin was a man of a thousand hats. Scientist, printer, politician, inventor, author, diplomat, and savvy businessman were just a few of his many trades. 9. John D. Rockefeller  Even though we give these Gilded Age guys a lot of tough love for being so filthy rich, you can't say they didn't do good with their fortunes. One of the world's wealthiest individuals of all time, Rockefeller was born the son of a traveling salesman. He showed early entrepreneurial promise selling candy and doing odd jobs for neighbors, eventually going on to become the founder of the Standard Oil Company. There's no business quite like oil business, and it made Rockefeller filthy rich. While Rockefeller is accused of using shady business tactics to wipe competitors off the map, over his lifetime he donated $500 million to philanthropic causes (which he was inspired to do by Carnegie). 10. Hans Christian Anderson  Hans Christian Anderson's fierce determination and self-starter mentality make him another great example of a famous entrepreneur. Anderson grew up poor, but set off alone to Copenhagen at 14 when a fortuneteller told him that although he would suffer early on, eventually he would become famous. Those predictions came true, as Anderson first tried and failed to become actor and singer. Seeing something special in Anderson, the director of the Royal Danish Theater took him under his wing and attended to his education. Anderson was teased terribly at school and harassed by students and a hateful headmaster, and he considered those some of the darkest days of his life. After leaving school, Anderson began to publish his writing. His fairy tales became immensely popular and eventually earned him the fame he was promised as a child. He never forgot his initial poverty\u2014The Little Match Girl was inspired by how his mother was forced to go begging in the streets as a young girl. Today Hans Christian Anderson is still beloved, known for rich fairy tales, many of which have inspired Disney animation classics (which, it should be noted, have much happier endings than the original tales). 11. Bill Gates  Bill Gates is one of the most famous entrepreneurs of our era. The richest man in the world, Gates has a net worth estimated to be over $79 billion. He's held the title of \"world's wealthiest individual\" for 16 of the past 21 years. Co-founder of the world's largest PC software company, Microsoft, Gates was one of the defining figures of the personal computer revolution. Gates showed an interest in computer programming at a very young age, spending all of his free time creating programs on the teletype terminal computer his school had donated. Gates went on to create Microsoft and develop the Windows operating system, which continues to be tremendously popular. Bill Gates is, like many other famous entrepreneurs, also known for his philanthropic activities, donating very large amounts of money to charitable organizations and scientific endeavors. Gates established the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000, a private philanthropic foundation dedicated to reducing poverty, enhancing health care, improving education opportunities, and providing access to technology worldwide. Gates himself has donated over $28 billion to the foundation, which he continues to work for. Have these famous entrepreneurs inspired you? Maybe you'll be next on the list. ",
