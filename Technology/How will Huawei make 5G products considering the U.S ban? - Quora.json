            "answer_text": "Trump wants to avoid business with Chinese tech firms, but no American company makes the same wireless equipment As U.S. officials have pressured allies not to use networking gear from Chinese technology giant Huawei over spying concerns, President Trump has urged American companies to \u201cstep up\u201d and compete to provide the next generation of high-speed, low-lag wireless service known as 5G. There\u2019s just one problem: Barely any U.S. companies manufacture the technology\u2019s most critical components. The absence of a major U.S. alternative to foreign suppliers of 5G networking equipment underscores the growing dominance of Huawei, which has evolved into the world\u2019s biggest supplier of telecom equipment, sparking fears within the Trump administration that a 5G network powered by Huawei\u2019s wireless parts could endanger national security. And it throws into sharp relief the years-long retreat by U.S. firms from that market. Carriers such as Sprint and Verizon have moved swiftly to launch 5G services for consumers. But the wireless networking gear the industry relies on still comes from foreign suppliers: four companies, Sweden\u2019s Ericsson, Finland\u2019s Nokia and China\u2019s Huawei and ZTE, account for two-thirds of the global market for telecom equipment, according to analyst estimates. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has signed off on letting Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei help build \u201cnon-core\u201d parts of the country\u2019s 5G infrastructure, including antennas and other network components, according to The Telegraph. The decision was made today by the National Security Council, of which May is the chair, and has drawn considerable criticism from other UK politicians who fear Huawei\u2019s supposed ties to the Chinese government may open British citizens, companies, and government agencies to cyber attacks and other forms of espionage. GCQQ head Jeremy Fleming, who has warned against cyber threats from China and Russia in the past, is said to have given a speech in Glasgow, Scotland today to members of the intelligence agencies of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US warning against such threats from foreign adversaries, according to The Telegraph. Other members of GCHQ have expressed concern over the use of Chinese telecommunications providers. But the organization\u2019s official position appears to be that the threats can be managed and minimized due in part to Huawei\u2019s involvement centering on \u201cnon-core\u201d network infrastructure. The decision is a notable departure from other members of the very alliance Fleming is said to have addressed today. The Trump administration has tried pressuring allies to stop using Huawei equipment after banning domestic government agencies and contractors from using the Chinese companies\u2019 products in official work capacities. Australia and New Zealand have both banned Huawei products from working on domestic telecom infrastructure projects in the respective countries, while New Zealand has gone so far as to prevent a domestic company from using Huawei equipment as part of its country-wide 5G rollout. The White House was mulling over an executive order that would do the same as of December of last year. When Trump announced a new 5G spectrum auction earlier this month, he was silent on the administration\u2019s position on imposing a trade ban on Chinese telecom equipment, but it is reportedly still on the table.
