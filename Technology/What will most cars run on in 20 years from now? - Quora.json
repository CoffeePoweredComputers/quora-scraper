            "answer_text": "Electric vehicles today are like cellphones in the mid 90s. They were too expensive, battery life sucked and they lacked infrastructure. The wildcard is the battery. If the price/performance can be improved so that they have decent range and cost about the same as an equivalent ICE vehicle, there will be a tipping point and consumers will rush to EVs. EVs are inherently superior to gas guzzlers. They are cleaner, far more efficient, simpler (meaning more reliable), cheaper to operate and get torque at zero RPM (resulting in far better acceleration). So, if their shortcomings can be addressed, they will win hands down. Another wildcard is self driving cars. If they become widely accepted, this opens up a business model called transportation as a service. Essentially, without the driver, self driving electric taxis become cheap enough that people give up private vehicle ownership altogether. Nothing is as hard to predict as the future! ",
