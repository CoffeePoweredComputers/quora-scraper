            "answer_text": "You ask \u201cIs it possible for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved?\u201d I am not an expert in such matters, but I have opinions. Strong opinions, as you may judge from the following. In my opinion, the SDGs are not achievable. Not at all! But, nevertheless, I do take some hope from the fact that they have been established as global goals. It does mean the the only real \u201cWorld Body\u201d of governance is taking seriously the impending problems that derive from our modern global society. I have read through the SDGs in some detail, and read some of the analysis about them, and some SDGs are better than others. But my doubt about their achievability does not come from the details of the wording of any one SDG. My doubt comes from the apparent assumptions that seem to lie behind all of them. It appears to me that the United Nations has organized two groups of experts who do not agree on their vision of the future. It appears to me that those experts who report to the IPCC (International Panel on Climate Change) are hard scientists who know about physics, chemistry, biology and ecology. They look into the future and see a coming period of serious crisis that will challenge the ability of humanity to survive. On the other hand, it also appears to me that the experts who develop and report upon the SDGs think that a few incremental tweaks to the way we do business will put us on a course to maintain a population of nine to ten billion or more people sustainably. The SDGs cannot possibly contain or reverse the effects of climate change. Many argue that a tipping point is imminent. In my opinion, we have passed the \u201ctipping point\u201d and have started a long and painful period of radical change that will dissolve all of our current political and economic systems. It is a built-in characteristic of the human species that, no matter how bad the situation is, we remain hopeful. This resilience of hope in the face of unavoidable disaster has no doubt been a factor in the survival of the human race in the past, as civilizations have risen and fallen. Those who did not give up hope, I would guess, were more likely to survive personally, and having survived, the genetically hope-inspired children then helped to rebuild the human population after those difficult times. So we have all inherited this genetic trait - to be positive in the face of threatened doom. But, I fear that, under the present circumstances, mere hope of surviving is insufficient to ward off the danger to the human race. A back-of-the-envelope calculation will show that the Earth has sustained (in the past) a population about 1 billion, the size of the pre-1800 population, supported by a flow of Sunlight. We are in a massive state of overshoot created by our access, over the past 220 years, to immense quantities of free additional energy flows in the form of fossil fuels and hydroelectric resources. For example, we are now consuming approximately 90 million barrels of oil per day to sustain this global economy, and that is just the flow of energy from oil. Those flows will eventually dry up, and we will be back to the pre-1800 carrying capacity of the Earth, give or take 50%. (My estimate.) So, the way I see it, the work on the SDGs is being done by well-meaning hope-inspired people who believe that some tweaks are needed, and are seriously trying to identify the needed tweaks and implement them, in a world that seems to care less. I approve. I even applaud their ethical motivation and their diligent efforts. They see the dangers ahead, and they are taking action, trying to ward off the dangers and manage the results. But, they do not fully understand the deep irreducible problems that loom ahead. I know that it\u2019s a tired old tale - and possibly a false tale - but I will use it anyways because there is a kernel of truth in it about human behaviour. Those members of the crew of the Titanic who were responsible for the happiness of the passengers - they rearranged chairs on the deck of the ship and organized a band to play entertaining music, doing their best to fulfill their moral and contractual duties, in the face of dire and obvious danger. They are NOT to be sneered at. But the engineers on the ship would be very quick to realize that making the passengers happy for the next few hours would not save the company from everlasting shame. There was a gash in the hull of the ship that could not be closed, and there were too few life boats. That would seem to be analogous to our situation now on planet Earth. There are three closely related global problems that the SDGs do not seem to acknowledge or address adequately: (1) the population of the Earth is in extreme overshoot - it has radically exceeded the carrying capacity of the Earth, having received a temporary boost from temporary energy flows; (2) We have extracted all of the resources from the lithosphere and the biosphere that are easiest to extract, and of highest quality, leaving only the dregs of resources for follow-on generations; and (3) there is an immense flood of pollution and waste flowing into the life-giving biosphere that is killing it rather quickly. The IPCC has marshaled a team of engineer-like people to stop the flow of greenhouse gases that will cause climate change. This is like firing up the bilge pumps without closing the gash. In my opinion, the SDGs are overlooking the real problem - too many people. And the IPCC is addressing only the effects of the real problem - too much pollution, without serious discussion of the causes. The governments of the leading countries of the world only perceive the problems as potential planks in a policy platform. But, being ever hopeful, I do hope that they will soon understand the depth of the coming crisis, and react more responsibly, for the sake of humanity\u2019s future generations. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes But are they goals that should be achieved? There is a debate within academia whether the SDGs should be treated as outcomes or processes. That is- a point to work towards, or a guide to help us reach somewhere that we don\u2019t yet know about. This is important. Why? Because the SDGs are contradictory and when analysed they make very little sense. This is because they were not designed systematically, but were a compeomise between hundreds of actors and millions of stakeholders. Can they be acheived? We would need new innovations to move beyond the contradictions. That is both new social structures and technologies. I, and others like me see this as possible? But I wonder. Are these goals all we want from the future? If we treat them as a guide. More of a conceptual model for all the makor issues we need to tackle, and the opportunities that will be born from this. Then we can end up somewhere better than anyone has yet dreamt of. ",
