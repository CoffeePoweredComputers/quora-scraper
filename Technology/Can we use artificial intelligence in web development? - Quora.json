            "answer_text": " Now technology is getting ready to give life to our imaginations. Earlier Artificial intelligence and robots were only seen in Hollywood movies but now, the advancement in technology has helped us in bringing all those science fiction into our real life. 1) Replacing web coding with a self-learning algorithm Artificial intelligence can make web programming easier. It can automate various basic tasks such as adding, updating the records to the database, predicting which bits of code are most likely to be utilized for solving the problem and utilizing those predictions to help web developers in finding the right solution. Moreover, AI algorithms can be used to create self-modifying codes from scratch without any human involvement. This helps developers to build smarter apps and bots at a much faster rate than before. 2) AI virtual assistants make it easy Designing layouts and templates for web pages is always a tedious job. To ease this process, AI tools such as virtual assistants are being used. So after receiving the right data the AI virtual assistants will create personalized content with the required combination of brand, design, layout, and content required by that end-user. Adobe Sensei - which can automatically analyze the entries and recommend design elements to the user. 3) AI for predictive SEO Predictive engines built using Artificial Intelligence technologies can generate ideas that can point developers about the errors in the website architecture and also highlight the bad content which affects SEO. It also provides better solutions to connect with the target audience. Market Brew is the first Artificial Intelligence Platform for SEO team\u2019s help developers create precise, relevant conclusions based on the platform. 4) Automating client data collection By using an AI-powered chatbot you can automate the process of collecting your client\u2019s requirements and end-user stories without any human intervention and errors. Kore.ai is one of those platforms that empower decision-makers with the information they require to drive the business results. 5) Providing best user experience with AI AI integrated chatbox can take user experience and interactions to the next level. It can simulate a real conversation by learning from user interaction in each conversation with the user and adapting the responses and actions accordingly. They can improve visitor participation by responding to queries, commenting on blog posts and providing real-time assistance and customization. A chatbot is one of them, it builds AI-powered customized chatbots with the presentation of knowledge, conversational abilities, personality traits, and context-sensitivity which can easily respond to customer-centric queries. 6) Testing & quality assurance made easy Currently, software development teams are adopting AI to execute testing tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming. .They not only bring speed but also ensure accuracy while processing massive chunks of data to derive meaningful inferences. The identification and repair of errors/bugs will no longer be a long and slow process. Thus getting a great app to the market becomes easy here. CHATBOTS - The next-generation digital assistants!  The rise of AI-enabled software has the potential of revolutionizing how customers interact with online enterprises. In the near future, a chatbot is going to be the first point of contact between the customer and the online enterprise. The chatbot will analyze the needs of the customer based interaction, whether it be product query, troubleshooting, or sales.
