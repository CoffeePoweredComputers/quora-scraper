In easy you mean: \u201cachieved without great effort; presenting few difficulties.\u201d Well, the registration can be simple if you use an agent, it can cost 20,000 RMB or so and take 3\u20136 months. You can also find funding and grants by the governments in different cities who are trying to attract foreign talent to China. My company has won the phoenix grant thanks to Beijing, so that was great. China Admissions awarded the Phoenix Grant from Chaoyang District, Beijing \u2022 China Admissions Do you have a business plan? In terms of doing the business, thats a totally different question. If you are asking this question on quora I guess its going to be hard for you. You\u2019d better get over to China and ask some people face to face to find the real answers and check the real opportunities. As a foreigner you probably have no relationships in China. Thats your biggest disadvantage when you first come. I suggest enrolling in a good university. Take your time and understand China first, build up relationships with Chinese people, and learn Chinese first. It will go very far when you want to do business when you tell people that you studied here already, and you will have lots of connections and mutual friends Being able to speak some Chinese will be great for relationships and thats so important. Look at what people like you succeeded at and learn from them. I know because this is the path I took, I studied at Peking University and founded China Admissions. Study in China at China's Top Universities | China Admissions You can find Chinese programs here: China AdmissionsAnd MBA or business programs here: 12 Top MBA's in China for International Students \u2022 China Admissions ",

            "answer_text": "Is it easy to start a company in China? Yes, it is easy. All you have to to do is to register a company. Foreigners can register one of 4 types of companies here in China: WFOE - Wholly Foreign Owned EnterpriseJoin VenturePartnershipRepresentative OfficeHow to register? Some cities allow foreigners apply directly, but most local governments prefer through the agencies they\u2019ve approved to make things easier both for them and the investors. Because the application process is in Chinese, and even if the foreign investor(s) is fluent in Chinese, the agencies still know the local requirements and policies better, they also have relationships with the governments and it makes the whole process much faster and easier. Is it easy to run a company in China? Yes, if you know Chinese. Not so easy, if you don\u2019t know Chinese, but still it\u2019s manageable, i.e. knowing Chinese is NOT mandatory to run a company, especially in foreigner-friendly location in China, for e.g. Shanghai, Shenzhen etc. You can also hire a local employee(s) if your target is Chinese customers. And get yourself a local accountant to file your taxes. Hope this helps. Good luck! Checkout our WFOE package - startup package for foreigners in China:  ",
