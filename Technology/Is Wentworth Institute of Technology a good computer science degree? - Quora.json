            "answer_text": "I\u2019m currently taking the Computer Science program at Wentworth, and I have to say that they teach you many nice things. I learned and am learning valuable things whenever I pay attention, and there are many great opportunities to go things outside of class. It goes beyond the surface level - My Algorithms teacher has made the experience fun while providing an insight into not only how the algorithms discussed work, but why as well. They additionally provide a good background in Mathematics, which is useful for Computer Science. The Applied Math Minor is very easy to achieve for C.S. students, only requiring that you take one extra class (Differential Equations) and as such many students choose this minor as well. Wentworth is an information and progress hub, and many students collaborate with each other outside of class in an effort to create what they want to create (and potentially impress employers). If you would like to work with other people, there are many channels to do so. Additionally, there is the Wentworth Computer Science Society which hosts workshops every other week. Four days from when I write this, I will be doing a presentation on the creation of Discord bots! Of note also is Wentworth\u2019s co-op program. It is exceptional. There are two mandatory co-ops to be performed in your Junior and Senior years, and an additional optional co-op which can be done in the summer of your Sophomore year. This ensures that by the time you graduate, you already have some industry experience under your belt (and if you\u2019re smart, very few student loans.) All in all, I would say that Wentworth Institute of Technology provides a very good Computer Science degree, but you only get what you put it. After all, as they teach, \u201cGarbage in, garbage out.\u201d What more could you ask for? ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know much about the computer programs, as i\u2019m in mechanical engineering, however i know it\u2019s a great small school. Small classes, therefore you get more interaction with the professors. The professors are great, there may be a few that are oh not so good but for the most part great. Lots of equipments available to the students. Cheap compare to the surrounding engineering schools. Parking and food are not the greatest. ",
