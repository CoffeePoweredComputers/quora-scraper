Keep at the scare tactic and ensure it will occur in 2 months. So unless they can provide coverage I'll need to change carriers.If you've got a really good plan like I did, either give it away for free, have a friend or familyMehmet take it over, or put it up for sale.

Unfortunately this doesn't happen very often. If you can show a documented history of service issues sometimes people are able to get out. If you move outside of the carrier's service area or out of the country. If you get called up to active duty military service or deployed overseas. Also, as far as I know T-Mobile is still buying people out of their contracts.. ",
