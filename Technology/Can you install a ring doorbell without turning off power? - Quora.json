It wont kill you but the jolts will sober you up quickly. You are dealing with low voltage so about 16Vac at the button outside or the bell. The voltage at the Transformer going to the MAIN is 120Vac, that will kill you. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but I wouldn\u2019t do it. The Ring Doorbell contains a microcomputer, and the act of attaching the wires would be applying power to the microcomputer several times in a few seconds until the screws are tight. This could, though not likely, damage components in the doorbell or erase some of the program in the memory. I.E., you could brick it. ",
