            "answer_text": "Are 5G antennas smaller or larger than 4G ones? Antenna size is dependent on frequency, not modulation standard. Neither 4G or 5G have a specific frequencies. They are standards that are applicable to a wide range of frequencies. The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength, and the smaller the antenna. 5G is a standard that is designed to be capable of operating at higher frequencies than 4G. *IF* that is the way it is implemented, the antenna can be smaller.

            "answer_text": "The question is not correct. Long history short, a radio wave has a length, and this length depends on the frequency used. The higher the frequency the shorter the length of the wave. Antennas are designed based on the frequency/wavelength they are going to serve, whether is sending/broadcasting a signal or receiving one. Therefor, a 5G antenna (or any antenna for that matter) size will depend on which frequency it will function. And the frequency it will function will depend on the country AND which frequency the operator got permission (i.e payed) to work with. With that said, 5G is expected to be working (not exclusively) on frequencies higher than 24 GHz (again, this depends on the operator and country), which qualifies as millimetre wave. In order to work with these frequencies, antennas have to be put in arrays called MIMO. But that\u2019s another subject :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, They are smaller. Can hang them on telephone poles. AND they will also need cable, (fiber, coax, or CAT).AND each carrier, will want to hang antennas independently. Imaging ATT, Verizon, T-Mobile, Spectrum, and others peppering the cities redundantly with 600 5G antennas for each 4G antenna in use today. This adds complexity and new management problems for the electric companies that often manage the poles. It\u2019s a dubious mess. A 5G/4G mix will be in place for another 20 years. I don\u2019t think 4G will go away. There is no way we will have a cost effective US deployment. The advertising and media are propagandizing this because they need government support to seize right of way (eminent domain) and funding. Add to this, your 5G bill will be double or triple the cost to 4G. ",

            "answer_text": "Outdoor macro 5G antennas will be mostly integrated with the radios mainly because of the massive MIMO design (such as 64-way). Some models will have smaller sizes (less than a meter in length) than whats being used in 4G cells (as big as 2.7m, multi-port antennas). It really depends on the design. Micro and nano cells will have almost the same size or antenna as the 4G. ",

            "answer_text": "The size of the antenna is to a great degree independent of the standard; it\u2019s more a function of the frequencies being used. That said, 5G is set up to use mmWave frequencies (which implies smaller antennas), and also \u201cmassive MIMO\u201d which implies larger arrays of antennas. Meanwhile, there is a movement towards multi-band antennas, which tends to make for fewer, somewhat larger antennas. ",
