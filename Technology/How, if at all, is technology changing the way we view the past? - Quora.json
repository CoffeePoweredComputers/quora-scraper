            "answer_text": "The past is the past for a reason. It cannot be altered. But we can look at it and see somethings in it, that we can base our future on. I was born in 1948, my parents 1918/1920 respectively. In that era, they were being raised by people born in the Victorian era, but a lot of their external influences were coming from the technological revolution that came out of the late 19th Century, to mature in the first 20 years of the 20th Century. The Millennials of their generation were throwing off the shackles of the Victorian era, and the Roaring 20\u2019s were the result. There are a lot of resemblances to that era happening now. Where people are looking back at the Victorian Era with nostalgia, just as people are looking back at the 20th Century. Even the last decade of this century, which had it\u2019s roots in the 20th Century, is looked back on, by older people as a last Golden Era, that they want to see repeated in 2021\u201324. Ignoring the pleas of the present generation. This is no different than a Victorian Era person hearkening back to the simplicity before the Car, Telephone, Electricity, Planes etc. The World was moving too fast for them. We hear the same complaint today from \u201cOk, Boomers\u201d. Why can\u2019t we be satisfied with the present or even give up some of our technology. I grew up in a rural part of Canada, and I heard the same complaint in the 50\u2019s and 60s. If it was good enough for my grand pah it is good enough for me. Just by me using this medium, I am using technology to change peoples view of the past. Just as it has helped change mine. With it\u2019s plethora of information coming at me, like a Niagara Falls, with me at the bottom. As it happens, we are at a knee curve, just like those people 100 years ago, and it\u2019s going to get crazy. For instance, the democratic candidates for president, have each got a policy platform to expand the internet broadband to millions of Americans, while upgrading others. That is laudable, and the FCC has spoken about this and has required Satellite Internet providers to address it as well. However, I have yet to see the candidates or the ground based ISP companies, address the elephant in the room. They are looking back at the old ways, the old technology. SpaceX is building 7 satellites per day, 5 days a week, 4 weeks per month. They have 10 new Falcon 9 boosters on order for 2020. They want to launch 120 satellites a month. With basic coverage over all of the US/Canada by January 2021. That\u2019s before the new President is in office and to have full coverage by 2024, World coverage by 2027. What is that equivalent to 100 years ago? Practically any technological change you can name, and with it society. It\u2019s 2022, grab your coat, and let\u2019s jump in my Cybertruck for a trip to see the new Starship Cargo Rocket launch to the Moon. That for me is how Technology has changed the way I view the past. Welcome to the NEW Roaring 20\u2019s. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a 1950 model human being. I have enjoyed my run of this lifetime but I do not like the lies coming from my generation of political and financial controllers. In 1901, in Australia, there were still Indigenous tribes in the deserts that had never seen white men. They would have known that we were on their land mass as they had higher consciousness abilities with relationship to Australia, their own brothers and sisters in Australia and Tasmania, their incarnated relatives experimenting as trees or animals and their dreamtime connections with the Pleiades. They were spiritually, way in advance to myself. I did connect with the trees and the bush though. Our technologies of the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s kept everyone's mind on perfecting them and I became mechanically minded and an atheist. The spiritual way of life was bullshit to many like myself. In 2016 I woke up to myself and realised the spiritual aspect to life is life. Our technologies work at around 70% efficiency and the other 30% is poison either from the technology or it\u2019s creation. People like Elon Musk are working at a breakneck pace to try and get enough satellites around the planet so that \u201cThey\u201d can box us in and eliminate the useless eaters. \u201cWe, the People\u201d are awakening around the planet at an exponential pace. Musk and his people will not entrap humanity. \u201cWe\u201d will view the past based on the truth of \u201cWe, the People\u201d of the past. Not from how our educators and their masters want us too.
