            "answer_text": "How To Get 1000 Youtube Subscribers A DAY - 7 Tricks That Work Would you like to learn how to get 1,000 YouTube subscribers a day quickly? So don't go, because I'm going to explain 7 psychological tricks that will make people subscribe to your channel. This strategy is called PSICOSUB! And I assure you that it works, whether you want to get your first 1.00 subscribers or if you have been for a while but want to increase your subscription rate! Trick 1.- SVR or Variable Reward System The SVR or Variable Reward System is being applied in many fields. It is something that is seen a lot, for example, in the video game sector. And it is very addictive and can be somewhat \"sketchy\" because the possibility of getting a reward is very engaging . And we can apply the same to get subscribers, yes, in a less \"dodgy\" way. You will see it clearly with an example. Put yourself in the situation: If you know that one of your favorite YouTube channels publishes a new video every Tuesday at 6:00 p.m. What are you going to subscribe to? You already know when you will find new videos and that you will not miss anything. But if your favorite YouTube channel publishes one week on Monday, another on Friday, one week two videos, another none\u2026 In the end, it will create insecurity because you don't know if you are going to miss something. The only way to make sure that you don't miss out on anything interesting is to subscribe. Trick 2.- PsychoCTA CTA stands for Call To Action or calls to action. What comes to be the typical \u00abSubscribe\u00bb. But to that classic CTA, we are going to add a psychological component so that the subscription rate increases. YouTubers usually ask people to subscribe at the beginning and end of the video. Evil. For one thing, asking for it at the beginning of the video only makes sense to you. It is something selfish that suits you exclusively because people have not yet seen the video and have not received anything of interest yet. You are asking them for something without having contributed anything yet, so this usually generates the opposite reaction. Conclusion: DO NOT SUBSCRIBE. On the other hand, if you ask for it at the end, two things happen: First, the vast majority do not reach the end (I will explain how to increase retention). Second, it is so typical and so many YouTubers do it that it is tiresome and people ignore it. Conclusion: NEITHER SUBSCRIBES. What should you do then? Well, apply psychological strategies so that every time you make a call to action it really works. How? Here you can bet on various formulas. ",

            "answer_text": "There is nothing more satisfying than hitting a milestone with your videos. One important one is your first 1,000 subscribers. This is important because YouTube offers live streaming once you have achieved this milestone and you have an account in good standing. 1. Post Useful Content Consistently This is one of the most difficult things to do as a content creator. If you take a look around YouTube you might think that every video under the sun has been created and that is most likely true, but you can put your own spin on a popular topic. 2. Name Your Videos Strategically One of the most difficult things is to name your video. You have the name in your head, but it may be something complex or too long. My rule is to keep it basic and use the YouTube autocomplete to name the video. There is nothing wrong with your video having the same name or something close to a popular video, as long as it\u2019s relevant. 3. Spruce Up Your Channel Design Most visitors first impression of you is from your channel and your design. This is where visitors interact and get to know what you are about. Create a engaging header and show off your brand. On my channel, we were intentional about our design making it fit into our overall branding strategy. The key takeaway is to design with purpose. 4. Show Your Lighter Side Lighten up and laugh at yourself. Bloopers make you more human and show something different than an ordinary talking head video. Also, switch up the video and catch your viewers off guard so they don\u2019t know what to expect. 5. Shoot In Various Locations I believe that shooting in various locations can lead to more interest. I understand that may not be possible or you may have a set, but try to change a background or even use a green screen. Like the clich\u00e9 says, \u201cvariety is the spice of life\u201d so mix it up with your backgrounds and locations. 6. Create A Custom Thumbnail I have seen my subscriptions and views increase by adding this step. I use impact font that is seen on many internet photos to grab attention and I format the photo using Adobe Photoshop. 7. Use Annotations Annotations are those annoying things that pop up during videos, but they can be a content creator\u2019s dream. I add annotations to every video and make it easy by creating a link for them to subscribe. This is extra work, but once you see your subscription rate increase you will continue to add them to every video. 8. Ask For Subscribers This is very basic. At the end of every video ask viewers to \u201clike\u201d and subscribe to your channel. You should also tell them why they should subscribe, for example if you are a DIY Home Improvement channel I would say, \u201csubscribe for my DIY projects, tricks and insider tips delivered to you weekly.\u201d Remember, be careful what you ask for, because you might get it. 9. Be Yourself You are the best you\u2014you can be. Being on camera was difficult for me at first because I compared myself to others who are natural on camera talent then I realized, \u201cI just have to be me.\u201d Let your personality shine in your videos and I guarantee someone will connect with you. 10. Create An Engaging Channel Trailer With the new channel design, YouTube gives content creators a great opportunity to create a trailer to share what your content is about. Have you ever attended a movie without viewing a trailer? Not me, because you want to see what it is about. Keep your trailer under 90 seconds and show scenes from your other videos and provide a strong call to action of why a viewer should become a subscriber. Keep people coming back by putting some effort into your videos. Don\u2019t just sit back and relax. ",
