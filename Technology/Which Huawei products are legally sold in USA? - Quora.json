No Huawei or Honor product is officially sold in the USA anymore like they used to (Huawei started off selling cheap budget Android phones).. but you can certainly import the phone and buy it through a 3rd party seller.. it's not illegal to own a Huawei phone (just government officials can't use it).

            "answer_text": "Huawei products are not allowed for the federal government for use or from companies receiving federal fundings. The carriers also don't sell them for this reason. You can though through sites like ebay or amazon can purchase them. They are not selling an American market targeted device but they can be universal versions that should work with most networks there. ",
