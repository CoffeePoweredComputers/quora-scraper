            "answer_text": "That\u2019s hard to predict at the best of times, and more so because we don\u2019t know what the outcome of the 2020 election will be. At the very least, one of the two major parties will go through some amount of contested primaries to find their candidate. If Trump loses in 2020, the Republicans will need to find a new candidate for 2024, just as they did in 2016. If the Democrats lose in 2020, they\u2019ll need to do the same. A re-elected Trump wouldn\u2019t be able to serve a further four years, so there\u2019d be some question over who should succeed him, and depending on how things go for an elected Biden, there may be much the same question there. In the hypothetical event that the Democrats win but Biden only serves one term or less (due to his age), there\u2019d be the question of whether whoever he names as Vice-President would be the automatic pick behind which the party falls in line, or whether there\u2019s a sort of \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d in the party as well. The type of candidate each party will gravitate towards is likely to be impacted by the 2020 outcome as well. A re-elected Trump will have another four years to shape the Republicans in his image, so while Mike Pence (as VP) would seem to be the logical next man up, there may be some challenge from a more \u201cTrumpian\u201d person. A Trump losing in 2020, particularly if he loses badly, may find that a lot of Republicans are very quick to say that they never knew him, so a much more \u201cregular politician\u201d type of candidate may surface. On the other side, there\u2019s still the question of whether a genuinely progressively-minded Democrat could win, and that could flare up again 2024 depending on what happens this year. ",

            "answer_text": "Biden will not seek re-election and will endorse his Vice President, the first female Vice President the US has ever had, for President. The Republican Party will still be struggling to pick itself up and redefine itself after the resounding defeat in 2020 in which they lost the Presidential election and control of the Senate. They will understand that Trump tapped into a previously ignored portion of the electorate with his extreme rhetoric, but also acknowledge that that rhetoric pushed away moderate Republicans. Donald Trump, Jr. will try to mount a campaign from prison. The primary season will be ugly and the winner of the nomination will come out scathed and detested by half the party. The Democratic candidate will win and become the first female US President. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on who wins. If Trump wins in 2020, most likely the Republicans will nominate a female candidate such as Nicky Haley. I think she has a lot of class and would make a great President. If Biden wins, then it depends on how much money is funneled to his son and brother from China. If Hunter and Robert Biden make millions from Chinese business interests while Joe is in office, then we\u2019ll have to see whom the Chinese will permit to run for President. I don\u2019t think Joe Biden will run again in 2024 because a tell-all book will be published by a Secret Service agent complaining that she was \u201cforced\u201d to change Joe Biden\u2019s diaper while Joe insisted on smelling her head and blowing in his nostrils.
