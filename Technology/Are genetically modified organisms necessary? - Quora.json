            "answer_text": "That depends on the context. In food, GMOs help improve crop yield and resistance to certain environmental issues that adversely affect crop production; grapefruit, for example, presently faces huge global industrial challenges with greening. In the U.S., the USDA mandates growers to destroy certain crops affected by greening, and some of these trees can take 7-10 years to grow to fruit-producing maturity. This can obviously have a huge impact on supply and how much grapefruit they are able to grow. They have developed genetic hybrids with other citrus to help find a faster growing, more greening-resistant variety of grapefruit.  In other situations, such as GMO chickens, it is for effiency. Treating chickens with certain genetic testing and manipulation can improve meat yield from one bird, make it easier to slaughter or raise them, or make it quicker for them to reproduce, for example. Farmers and growers use genetic manipulation for good as much as evil these days, as sometimes it's a need and sometimes it's all about money.  In humans, the argument is certain babies can even be considered genetically modified as in cases of IVF wherein they can choose eggs/sperm/embryos based on certain genetic markers and then manipulate them and pair them with other eggs/sperm/embryos for fertilization or implant strategically to improve the odds of a fetus developing with (or without) certain genetic traits or characteristics. Is it necessary to have a 75% odd of having a kid with blue eyes? Maybe not. Is it important to know your child may only have a 5% chance of being born with a deadly genetic trait like Tay-Sachs as opposed to an 80% chance? Yea, maybe. ",
