            "answer_text": "Small businesses have moved towards the technology trend of utilizing machine learning integrated data. It was common in the past for small businesses to rely on spreadsheet based reporting but now businesses have moved to integrating all of their data onto one unified platform. Small businesses that transition into data integration software, are able to organize their data and maximize insights about their business. My favorite machine learning data integration software is SimplData. SimplData was created to eliminate the need for spreadsheet based reporting and simplify data analysis so anyone can use it. It provides AI/BI technology where it will provide powerful insights to improve the business. It also has a lot of features to enhance customer experience and personalization. Some of the common data models it provides is: Factors Affecting Churn: where you can discover specific factors that may be causing customers to churn.Cluster Analysis: so you can distinguish customer segments and market to customers properly.Product Recommendation: so you can increase sales by targeting customers who are more likely to buy.Order Value Prediction: so you can keep track of how much your customers are buying and know individual spending habits.There are many more features SimplData provides, which you can check out on the website here. In the end, small businesses want to do what's best for their business. By eliminating spreadsheet based reporting, they\u2019re one step closer to growing their business. I hope this helps! ",
