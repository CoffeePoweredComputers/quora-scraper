            "answer_text": "I occasionally plug my phone into my computer via USB for file transfer. I occasionally connect my phone to my computer wirelessly for file transfer. Sounds like your question is asking how, so here it is: My computer is on my local LAN. My phone is also capable of connecting to my local LAN via wifi. The first step is to turn wifi ON on my phone. Once connected, it is on the same LAN as my computer. On my computer, I host an FTP server. Since my computer is on a local LAN connected to the internet through a gateway router, the FTP server is not accessible from the internet \u2026 it is only accessible from the local LAN. Once my phone connects via wifi, I run a smartphone FTP client app. The first time I run it, I put in the IP of my desktop, and the username & password configured in the desktop FTP server. I only need do this once, and thereafter my FTP app will remember them to connect again. I can now transfer files from my computer to / from my phone wirelessly without needing to connect via USB, or even being by the computer (or even in the same room). ",
