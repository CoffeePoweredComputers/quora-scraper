            "answer_text": "Drones have the potential to cut down inspection costs in the insurance industry significantly. Now, a manual post-storm damage assessment inspection of a single building tower can take several days and cost more than $5000 in men-hours and equipment rental per day. Some inspections are particularly difficult, just imagine that inspectors often need to climb onto the roofs of damaged buildings to assess the damage, document cracks, take pictures, etc. On top of that, they need to make sure that which damages are new and which have existed before. No wonder drones are game-changers in this profession. The thing is, drone images are not enough - all the objects captures on them need to be analyzed, and when done manually, it also takes lots of money and time. However, using the power of drones combined with automated object detection, the amount of time spent solving a claim can be reduced between 25% and 50%. And the good news is, insurance companies don\u2019t need to create in-house data science departments to be able to do that. With the Picterra platform, it\u2019s easy to train and run a custom detector that provides the results 100x faster than when done manually. Here is how the process looks like: Capture aerial images using your drone and create an orthomosaic with a photogrammetry software (e.g. Metashape, Pix4D, DroneDeploy, nFrames, correlator3D, etc.) and upload it in TIFF format to Picterra Platform. We\u2019ve done it with two orthomosaics captured over two areas after a disaster, one is located in Japan, and the other one in Dominica. Build a custom detector for ruined rooftop buildings that you can later use for your own insurance claim project. In our case, after running the detection, there are 201 ruined rooftops in Japan and 106 in Dominica. It represents a surface roof damaged of 27\u2019872 meter square distributed throughout the images. The whole detecting process only takes us about 30 minutes with one person that oversees the work.We hope it\u2019s clear!

            "answer_text": "REMOTE SENSING Drones can carry sensing equipment to assist with any number of functions. Geological surveying, agriculture, archeology, and several other industries can benefit greatly from the myriad of sensors that can be packed into a drone. Here are just a few examples of how the agricultural industry, for example, uses aerial sensors: Drones \tcan use Lidar to measure the height of crops.Lidar is a \tremote sensing technology that measures distance by illuminating an \tobject with a laser (near-infrared or UV) and then measuring what is \treflected back.Heat \tsensors detect the temperature of livestock, the presence of water, \twater temperature, and for surveillance and emergency response (if \tsomeone is injured in a remote field away from heavy equipment).Multi-spectral \tinstruments can count plants (crop density), check the health of \tplants, and even assess water quality.Visual \tspectrum sensors make it possible to survey and map land.Biological \tsensors can be used to take air quality readings and check for the \tpresence of specific micro-organisms or organic compounds.COMMERCIAL AERIAL SURVEILLANCE When you hear surveillance, chances are good that you think about security cameras designed to catch lawbreakers. Or possibly spying and monitoring of your personal movements and actions. Here are just a few ways that aerial surveillance can be helpful: Farmers \tuse drones to monitor livestock on vast spreads of land.Fire \tdepartments can use drones to track and map wild fires.Private \tcompanies can use drones to monitor their infrastructure such as \tpipelines, buildings, and so on.Using \tdrones to inspect power lines, towers, tall structures like chimneys \tand roofs would save businesses vast amounts of money and would \treduce liability exposure from having humans in harm\u2019s way.COMMERCIAL AND MOTION PICTURE FILMMAKING In 2014, the Motion Picture Association, backed by seven companies, petitioned the FAA to allow the use of drones in video and filmmaking. Drones dramatically reduce the cost associated with gathering action or aerial footage that up until now would require expensive equipment like booms and dollies or even helicopters or other manned aircraft. In September of 2014, the FAA issued permits to six film studios for the use of drones in filmmaking. Drones are also being used to gather footage in sporting events because of their ability to maneuver into locations that cable-suspended cameras cannot reach. Most recently, drones were used to gather footage of the skiing and snowboarding events in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. OIL, GAS, AND MINERAL EXPLORATION With the help of specific electromagnetic sensors, drones can be used to gather geological information to help geophysicists identify and better approximate the location and presence of minerals, oil, and natural gas.
