Trust me, that is probably the best decision you\u2019ll make. There\u2019s a very high scope for your future if you carry this skill along with you. Well, I understand your situation very well. I\u2019m a 14 year old and I went through the same thing a year back. I was really interested in coding but every platform taught coding like they\u2019re teaching a 5 year old. I mean, just the basic stuff. I was really confused and wasted quite of my parent\u2019s money until I stumbled upon WhiteHat Jr on day.

            "answer_text": "My kids are both enrolled in coding classes with WhiteHat Jr. They\u2019ve been on it since schools were closed due to the pandemic. They\u2019re 7 and 13 years old. I was actually going to enroll my 7-year-old only because he was insistent that he wanted to learn how to be a better builder on Minecraft. And I don\u2019t even know if coding has anything to do with that, but I found that he and others he met on the game we're talking about it there. Since he was going to be without school indefinitely, I agreed. At least he\u2019ll learn something new. Nope, it\u2019s not a kiddie class that won\u2019t teach you anything about coding. WhiteHat Jr. seems to have some of the top instructors in the field and they really have those in-depth lessons that will force you to learn otherwise you won\u2019t move forward. A few weeks in, my son already had what looked like a mobile app prototype. At first, he won\u2019t admit it but my 13-year-old finally said that he wanted to join the classes too. I think he was pretty impressed at what a 7-year old can do after just a couple of weeks or so. Although my eldest doesn\u2019t have any prior coding knowledge, he still received a different set of lessons but the goal to learn to code is still the same. It appeared that they adjust those lessons according to the learning and comprehension capability of a child. Don\u2019t worry too much about being around pre-schoolers when you start coding classes. WhiteHat Jr is worth checking out since they make studying interesting and enjoyable. At the same time, it\u2019s not all fun and games. You will learn something and if you take it seriously, you might just become an expert by the time you complete their courses\u2014that\u2019s something I look forward to for my kids as well. ",
