            "answer_text": "This seems to be an interesting question. All of us have heard about IQ (Intelligence Quotient), EQ (Emotional Quotient) and now a days HQ (Happiness Quotient). This does sound something more. Innovation Quotient is not the measure of anyone\u2019s intelligence and neither a criterion to judge anyone as an average, below average or above average. It is quotient that defines how aware you are of your surroundings. It calculates how you embrace and fathom the offerings made to you since birth. Whether black is black or it is the darkest shade of grey. Or maybe blue. Whether a circle helps brings people closer or a box does? It measures your \u2018out of the box\u2019 thinking. No, it is not IQ. It does not measure your intelligence. It measures you as an individual. It measures you as a personality and the hidden creative mind behind those beautiful pair of eyes. It is an assessment to promote the healthy environment provided to an individual where he/she can captivate much more through his/her observation skills and create.. a new invention! There is something called an InQ Program (inqu.co.in) and an InQ 360 App on Play Store. It has a series of questions which seems to define your Innovation Quotient. It soon can become another, maybe the most significant variable to analyse individuals. \u0004m\u001c\u0011\b*\ufffds{\ufffd\u001e\ufffd ",
