            "answer_text": "First and foremost, I like to preface my response to the question with this elegant quote: \"Insight is the understanding, wisdom and intuition you bring to a situation. It is the result of your experience, your ability and willingness to consider alternative ways of viewing the world, and exploring the deepest, enlightened levels of your thoughts.\" ~ Sherrin Ross Ingram, author of 'Wealth Mentality: Program Yourself to Get and Keep the Wealth You Wan For me, insight always happens in a flash, like a flash of lightning. Some people may like to call it the Aha! experience. Or the eureka moment. Or the jolt of inspiration. Metaphorically, it is the light bulb flashing in the head.  Consequently, it is quite right to call this stage the illumination or inspiration stage as well. However, the flash is always accompanied by a feeling of exhilaration, as well as certainty of a possible solution to a problem or a great idea is born. Interestingly, if we look at the word origin of 'insight', sight or seeing comes immediately to mind. Let us take a look at other related words to 'insight':  'foresight', 'hindsight', 'farsightedness', 'vision', 'perspective', 'introspection', 'illumination', 'visualisation', and even 'imagination'. Amusingly, how about the word 'seer'? All these words have visual references or connotations. No wonder, the outcome of the insight process is often associated with: - \"seeing the world with new eyes...\"  - \"seeing something that doesn't exist yet...\"  - \"seeing things in a different light...\" - \"seeing what others do not see...\" - \"seeing old things in new ways...\"  - \"seeing the ordinary as extraordinary...\" Isn't that interesting? So, how and what we see can actually affect our personal creativity.  As a matter of fact, and taking a deeper probe, the word 'idea' actually derives from Greek word origins, which also denote a visual reference. One quick but crucial question comes to mind, especially during the creative process, can you see it? From the way I have experienced in several creative endeavours, e.g. turning my personal hobbies into small entrepreneurial ventures during the early nineties, what this implies is that we need to be sensitive to what's happening in our physical environment. To put it explicitly, what we are often mulling about - that's incubating - can often be triggered further by what we are seeing around us. That's to say, something out there, especially when we least expect it, can often ignite the bubbling of the creative idea from the 'unconscious processing' to the 'conscious awareness' of our mind... crossing the threshold of the invisible, the unknowable, into the visible, the knowable, so to speak. American philosopher & educator Susanne Langer (1895-1985) once described the phenomenon as follows: \"Most new discoveries are suddenly-seen things that were already there.  A new idea is a light that illuminates presences which simply had no form before the light fell on them.\" For example, when I am mulling over the best approach to tackle a question on Quora, I find that inspiration often comes from a visual trigger, which somehow appears from my other readings and net surfing activities, generally not related to the question. Sometimes, it comes when I am engaged in some other mundane tasks, like commuting. Or running on the treadmill or riding the stationary bicycle in the gym. Or from a walkabout out in the neighbourhood.  That's why I always have a pocket notebook with me at all times. Sometimes, I may just write a rough draft and continue to chew over it. Sometimes, when I feel like it, I may even rewrite the whole draft, and even sit on it for a while.  This 'ding-dong' endeavour can go on for some time.  For me, time is not of the essence, because I am under no personal obligation to anybody. I would consider it to be the most exciting stage of the creative process. In a way, it is that part of the creative process that seemingly makes all the efforts in preparing and incubating worthwhile. In the business context, it is the moment an entrepreneur recognises an opportunity, which to me, is best exemplified herewith:  \"Everyone is surrounded by opportunities.  But they only exist once they have been seen.  And they will only be seen if they are looked for.\" ~ Edward de bono, author of 'Opportunities: A Handbook for Business Opportunity Search'; \"You are surrounded by simple, obvious solutions that can dramatically increase your income, power, influence and success.  The problem is, you just don't see them.\" ~ Jay Abraham, author of 'Getting Everything You Can Out of All You've Got'; \"Successful opportunities for innovation and growth are right here, in front of us, and we often can't see them or don't act on them.\" ~ Erich Joachimsthaler, author of 'Hidden in Plain Sight: How to Find & Execute Your Company's Next Big Growth Strategy'; So, in final response to the thrust of your question, we just need to constantly sharpen our perceptual sensitivity or enhance our sensory acumen, which holds the vital key to attaining strategic insight!
