            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question. I am not sure. I will try only to answer the question by saying why the Old World might be more prone to having more diseases around, and more infectious ones to humans. From thus, one can infer that there would be less diseases, and less infectious diseases, present in the populations of the New World. Wikipedia says rinderpest was a parent precursor to measles, and that was prevalent in cows, buffalo, giraffes and other animals. The Old World had a lot of cows, intentionally bred, and close to humans. Rinderpest - Wikipedia There seems to be a writer here, who attempts to answer your question more directly, but there is still a paywall, by New Scientist, even though the article was written in 1992. How Columbus sickened the New World: Why were native Americans so vulnerable to the diseases European settlers brought with them? As for smallpox, there may have been a rodent to camel transfer, or to cow, then to humans, as the article below suggests. The Origin of the Variola Virus I will try to develop this answer further, with more time spent on research, but to hazard a guess right now, yes there probably were some diseases transferred from New to the Old World, but I don\u2019t know which ones yet. I assume, though I cannot confirm, that the Old World had larger and more dense populations, and also practised more densely populated animal husbandry, livestock farming e.t.c. These two reasons, of population density and high farm animal density and proximity to humans, could easily favour a spreading of disease, from say bats, or rodents, or mosquitoes, onto these farm animals, and then due to our interacting with these animals, onto us. I also assume it is less easy to pick up a disease from plants than mammals. I assume this is simply because any diseases the plants have are tailor made for the genetic make up of that plant, and that their genetic structure and form, is far too different to the human genetic sequence and code. A rat however, or a cow, or bat, or any mammal really, has a genetic sequence far more similar to our own. This could allow a diseases to hop between different types of creatures more easily, in theory. Larger food stores, can easily attract rats near to human populations. This begs the question, from where did the original mammal pick up the disease ? From a plant, from a fish, a frog, ? And if so, then where did this new precursor species pick it up from ? From algae, from excrement ? I don\u2019t know. If it is excrement, then large human settlements and all the sewage in a close proximity that creates, is a reason why smaller, indigenous populations of the New World would have less diseases. But if we already speculate that high density populations, and unventilated spaces, are two ways in which diseases can easily spread and therefore can easily be continually passed and around and thus the disease does not necessarily die out through having a lack of hosts, then we could start our search for diseases in mammalian groups that live in highly dense, poorly ventilated spaces, or conversely, avoid entering these areas like the plague, forgive the pun. I guess it is also worth saying, though I am not 100 % sure, that bacteria seem to be able to thrive in plants and decaying plants and soil, in the hot, in the cold, in places with or without oxygen, due to their diversity of type. This means diseases of bacterial origin could in theory begin here, in the earth. Viruses however, as far as I am aware but I hope to be corrected on if I\u2019m off course, aren\u2019t so much a fan of decaying matter and the nutrients and minerals and chemical constituent elements in soils and poo. I speculate that they sort of prefer to live on things that are in a growth phase, like a growing human or plant. Saying that, I realise that bacteria are living and growing. So wouldn\u2019t it be logical to suppose that viruses can live off bacteria, like, get inside the bacteria\u2019s cell ? I will look into this more, and hope to be informed more in the comments, about any suppositions I have made here. ",
