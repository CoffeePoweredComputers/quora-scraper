            "answer_text": "#1.AirtelThe most reliable one with the best QoS in Delhi NCR,but pertaining to availability of its broadband connectivity in your local region.Tad bit costly as Compared to other ISPs but has no compromise in providing seamless connectivity with least faults. #2.Mtnl The Omnipresent broadband in all regions of Delhi ,it is up for grabs in all the nook and corner So at my rank 2nd list ,the data rates are comparably somewhat higher than reliance and other service but Data service is good above the 1mbps bandwidth subscription.People wanting a mandatory landline connection should go with MTNL as the combo deals are very attractive here,also nowadays the Customer Service for the new connections is upgraded and a 24hr guarantee is also given.I myself use MTNL@\u2026#3.Reliancethis particular service is also available as per the locations ,but have a highly competitive data rates ,recently my friend had got a 2Mbps Connection with a bill @Rs.700 approximately,which is awesome.The customer Support is abysmal here so sometime people discourage it.I would say this one's an economical connection up for grabs. #4.Hathaway Recently has become on of the quality broadband providers not like the ones of the three above,it has its own ISP set up without provision of telecommunication services rather Qos like,cable,IPTV etc.They are rather more cheaper and you can refer the rates too.Its like 50mbps in 900rs. But.But these speeds might be vaguely articulated for advt. as the might be showing the connection too peer ratio and not p2p. which is 1:20,1:10 somewhere. So ultimately choose wisely and make sure the availability of the ISP s in your Locality First.Best of Luck.! ",
