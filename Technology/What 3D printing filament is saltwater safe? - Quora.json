            "answer_text": "PLA, ABS, and PETG are the most common filaments used in 3D printing. All of them are saltwater safe, but not necessarily UV safe (if this is outside in the sun) ASA is a type of plastic closely-related to ABS that has more weather resistance, and you can get it pretty easily: Want to Use ABS in Hot Sun? We Compare ABS vs ASA Filaments However, the best choice here is nylon filament. The only issue is that it can be expensive, and is very difficult to work with: How To Succeed When 3D Printing With Nylon | MatterHackers I hope that information helps. ",

            "answer_text": "To a point\u2026 PLA is saltwater safe. PLA is a corn starch based plastic that will biodegrade over a few years and seawater might accelerate that. PETG is easy to use in a 3D printer and it is highly resistant to salt water. ABS will resist the saltwater pretty well. We could look up each filament type that might work in your printer and rate them as to which is the best for use in the desired environment\u2026 I don\u2019t want to work that hard. Its not my project. ",
