            "answer_text": "Alexa IS NOT AI - yet. It\u2019s speech recognition, natural language processing, Human voice generation. all cool stuff in the hand of everybody. I find it pretty cool. But it is actually not INTELLIGENT. Check out the book Alexa Skills Project. You can relatively easily program \u201cskills\u201d and let it run. Here you will recognize exactly the boundaries of its capabilities and why it is not AI. Everything it can do is procedural. You give it options and it can \u201cunderstand\u201d what action it is supposed to do based on your program. There is an ELIZA skill and it cannot do more than ELIZA that was coded already 1960 to simulate sort of an interaction models. Even the more sophisticated Alexa skills are using decision trees like IF THEN ELSE\u2026 For comparison look for \u201cAlphaGo\u201d on Netflix if you can. You will recognize where AI actually begins: 1) Taking inputs from the outside and based on feedback understand success and failure. Alexa can\u2019t do that and non of the following.2) Memorize success pattern to use it for decision making processes in the future.3) Ability to construct its own scenarios of experimentation to learn more.4) Ability to accept failure as in complex situations you cannot calculate any possible permutation.5) Making decisions with a high likelihood of success while accepting failure.6) Processing something with the hope to finish with a final success. Using type A1 to A4 make actually no more sense when describing Artificial Intelligence. Reactive machines with limited memory is still something every computer can do with or without \u201cAI\u201d. Those are amazing enhancements but not AI. The real magic of AI is it\u2019s ability to analyze huge amounts of data by leveraging highly sophisticated algorithm which actually look for key \u201cfeatures\u201d in the content (images, sound waves or text) and so forth.Then processes those results to relevant results in no time based on yet other highly sophisticated algo. Then work on the actual objectives, making decisions based on again highly sophisticated algo and pumping out results. None of that is in Alexa - yet. The algorithms used in the software that run the AI - making it learn and \u2018create\u2019 a model of understanding - is what it makes an AI. But as Amazon is updating their Alexa Skills Kit and the corresponding Lambda it may actually get there sooner or later. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s any kind of AI. We used to have a saying - until you solve the problem, it\u2019s AI; once you solve it, it\u2019s just good engineering, or \u201cjust software.\u201d Some examples: Chess playing used to be considered a hard AI problem - until people started writing chess playing programs that got very, very good. Now, it\u2019s just software.At one point, character recognition was considered AI. Now OCR is just an off-the-shelf technology.It\u2019s been a long time since basic speech recognition has been considered AI. Siri, Cortana, Google Voice, and now Alexa are simply reasonably good speech recognition, married to some good parsing and text analysis code.Having said that, Alexa, et. al. incorporate various machine learning algorithms do incorporate some techniques that are more generally considered AI, such as: Machine learning to improve results over time.Analyzing sentence structure and \u201cmeaning\u201d to provide feedback to voice recognition.",
