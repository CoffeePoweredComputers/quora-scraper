            "answer_text": "Computers. In the early days of personal computing, before the Mac, computers were not graphically based. There were no \u201cWindows,\u201d not even a mouse. You had to know how to type in commands directly.Some people prophesied that one day even grandmothers would have computers. People laughed at that.During the early days of the personal computing revolution people couldn\u2019t even figure out why you would want a computer. It was something for nerds to tinker with.The Mac helped revolutionize things because it used the mouse, it had a graphical interface and it was easy to use.Fast forward a few years and computers kept getting easier to use.But it wasn\u2019t until the Internet grew that people started even finding a use for computers. Once social media was developed, starting with MySpace but really taking off with Facebook, then nearly everyone got a computer.It seems obvious to us now, but it really wasn\u2019t obvious 30 years ago. It was a world where the Internet wasn\u2019t used by most people, most people didn\u2019t have a computer in their home, and most people didn\u2019t feel the need to have one.Now everyone has a computer they carry with them everywhere in their smartphone that is thousands of times more powerful than those early home computers.",

            "answer_text": "This answer depends on if you consider the automobile a great advancement. If you read history the original drivers had a lot of problems to overcome. Some places required a man with a torch or lantern to walk in front of the vehicle. If the driver came upon a horse carriage and the horse wouldn\u2019t pass the car the driver had to take it apart and put the pieces off the road. Another law required gunshots or a bell or other noise to be sounded before going thru an intersection. There were a lot more such laws. Actually, the whole industrial revolution was opposed by some. The English word saboteur comes from the French word sabot for the heavy shoes that protesters threw into the automated looms that had come into use and replaced a lot of workers. ",
