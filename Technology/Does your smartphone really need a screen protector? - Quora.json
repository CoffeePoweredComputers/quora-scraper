            "answer_text": "Definitely!! It does not matter which kind of coating your smartphone has on its screen. Even if your smartphone has a coating of Corning Gorilla 3, there are chances that the glass may attain scratches, because this material is not completely scratch resistant. Obviously it will resist scratches to a huge extent but it is always recommended to use a screen gaurd (why to take any chance at all) The hardest material which is currently available for smartphones is a sapphire glass and you must have heard few rumours about Apple using this material on their next version of iPhone. However the tensile strength of this material is very low, which means that it well break or shatter very easily. Sapphire may be scratch resistant but it's tensile strength is half of Corning Gorilla Glass 3. This was that exact reason why Apple did not introduce this material on their iPhone 6 or 6 glass Hence you can expect a stronger material at some time in future which may have scratch resistant properties of sapphire and shatter resistant properties of Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Then you may not need a screen gaurd at all because the only thing which can put scratch on a sapphire glass is another object made of sapphire or diamond. ",

            "answer_text": "I personally like to use a screen protector. On the contrary many people dont.Here are some of the benefits:  Enhance privacy- Privacy screen protectors helps in keeping your private data hidden from prying eyes.The information is visible only to the person directly infront of the screen. Reduce glare- Anti glare screen protectors cut down glare on the screen by using matte finish coating.This ultimately allows a cell phone user's eyes to strain less and also improves screen visibility by cutting reflections.Prevent sticking of fingers- Ultra clear screen protectors are usually thinner than other types and offers a shiny, smooth surface so that fingers can easily maneuver across screen without sticking. Prevent UV damage- Anti reflective screen protectors essentially bend light, providing a reduction in reflection. Basically it filters uvb rays and reflected glare while  eliminating glare from sunlight that enters user's eyes.Thus helps in reading clearly and comfortably with minimal eyestrain. Resistant to fingerprintsRepel dirtAnti bacterial- Anti bacterial screen protectors are made from specific coating that prevents the growth of bacteria, mold and mildew which are responsible for causing stains and odour. This type of protector is perfect for those working in hospitals, schools or other public places.Prevents scratch- Many people think that the modern gorilla glass can protect the screen from all types of materials. But its not the case. People who are frequent to beaches can get sand in their pocket. This sand can wreck user's phone.Obviously there are people who pamper their cellphones and are very kind,respectful, loving and caring. They dont need a screen protector. And then there is another kind, brutal ,ruthless , savage and vicious with their phones. Like me ;) Hope you get the message. ",
