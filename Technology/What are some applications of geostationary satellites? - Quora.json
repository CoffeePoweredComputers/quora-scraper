            "answer_text": "A geostationary satellite is not special in any way. In fact, there are certain disadvantages compared to satellites in closer orbits. The satellite is much further away, so that even at light speed the radio waves take about a quarter of a second to get there and back to earth again. That delay makes voice communication slightly awkward and poses significant challenges for two-way data communication. Also, the radio signal gets weaker the further it travels, so a geostationary satellite requires much larger antennas and more powerful (read: heavy and expensive) communications gear. So being in geostationary orbit is bad for a communication satellite. The satellite only ever sees one hemisphere of the earth and is too far up for decent sensor readings. That means the geostationary orbit is bad for surveillance or scientific observation. There is no reasonable way to deorbit a geostationary satellite which nears the end of its lifetime. It is destined (doomed?) to stay up there forever, cluttering up the sky. If possible, it is moved to an even higher graveyard orbit before that, but many satellites have just failed or run out of fuel and now pose a hazard to anything that passes through. If I remember correctly, there has been at least one mid space collision with such old junk, disabling a relatively new, expensive satellite. It is actually quite cluttered up there. With those risks, having to park satellites in geostationary orbit is relatively dangerous and prone to sudden failure. So, geostationary orbit seems to be a really bad place to put your satellite. But there are mitigating circumstances. Looking up from the earth, the satellite will always be at the same position in the sky. That's actually pretty important. The radio signals are so weak that for any decent amount of data to be sent requires dish antennas at both ends, ie ground and space. Those dishes are very directional. If you give your satellite TV dish a good shove, it loses alignment with the satellite and the TV program gets even more boring than usual. Imagine having to keep it pointed at a constantly moving target! There are, of course, devices that can track a satellite on its way through the sky, but these are hideously expensive. Your TV dish would go up in price from $100 to about $10000 - and that's a cheap tracker. Better by far to just mount it on a bracket, point it at the right piece of sky and tighten the bolts. Same reasoning goes for other uses of the satellite as well. Geostationary orbit translates to \u201cno tracking required\u201d which translates to much cheaper equipment groundside. Also, since the satellites don't cross each other's paths, radio frequencies can be reused a couple of degrees left and right of your satellite, as long as the separation is greater than the \u201clistening cone\u201d of your receiving dish. Radio frequencies are a very precious resource these days and very likely to remain so. So, to finally answer your question: A geostationary satellite is used whenever the cost of lugging a couple of tons of gear to 35786 km and give them hard enough a push to stay there is cheaper than equipping all ground receivers with tracking technology. That means, almost exclusively, communications and broadcasting. So in geo you can expect to find whole swarms of TV broadcasting satellites, overseas communications relays, data relays for outlying areas of the globe, such as the high seas or the middle of some desert. You don't expect to find many scientific birds, surveillance satellites or orbital telescopes. Oh, and you can expect to find a lot of junk. ",

            "answer_text": "It means we can have satellites which appear to remain stationary in relation to the Earth, so they look down on the same bit of Earth all the time. Eg for communications - satellite TV, satellite Internet, etc. The satellite dish can just point at the same place in the sky all the time. If the satellites weren\u2019t in geostationary orbit, then the satellite dishes would have to have very accurate tracking motors, and you\u2019d lose signal whenever the currently tracked satellite passed over the horizon and the dish had to reorient to a new satellite (unless you had at least two satellite dishes to switch between when this happened).
