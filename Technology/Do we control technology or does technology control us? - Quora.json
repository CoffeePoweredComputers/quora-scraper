            "answer_text": "I will suggest a better alternate question first :- \u201cWhat happens when technology knows more about us than we do ? \u201c We all know Technology has become incredibly intelligent and already knows a lot about our internal states. A computer now can detect our slightest facial micro expressions and be able to tell the difference between a real smile and a fake one. This is only the beginning. I think. And whether we like it or not , we already are sharing parts of our inner lives that's out of our control. This seems like a problem, because a lot of us like to keep what's going on inside from what people actually see. I think we want a agency over what we share and what we don't. I really get goosebumps when i think , what will happen when A.I will become self-aware. I think slavery will hit mankind once again and this time we created our slavery gods. ",

So as said above, I will say technology has mastered in the sense that once we know what we up to, technology with the current insertion of AI and other systems, it knows what we really want to achieve. Let me use WordPress as example. A developer might decide to use WordPress to complete a neat project within a day or two. Now time not wasted because once he drags anything to add to the project; WordPress knows what he might want to do next, else he decided to change the more of operation of that very Item added. In short technology is mastering us in knowing what we do daily ",

Everything the technology does is our commands and our implementation of knowledge and logics. Though we made the technology and it's arms. If we made its mind to use the arm in some awkward way it would surely affect us. You have thousands of examples in support to this. Thanks . Keep reading ! ",
