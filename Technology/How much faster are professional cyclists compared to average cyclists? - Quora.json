            "answer_text": "On the flats, much faster. On hills, much, much much faster. I've been riding for 25+ years, and I even raced for a bit (as a measly CAT 5 which is the beginner category). When I was on the East Coast I did not have a power meter but I estimate my FTP (functional power threshold) which is the amount of power I can hold for 1 hour was in the range of 3 - 3.3 Watts per Kilo. When we moved to the West Coast (Bay Area), I realized 2 things 1: It is incredibly hilly. In Massachusetts, our hilly ride was 62 miles with 2700 ft of climbing. In the east bay, most of my rides had 1000 feet of climbing per 10 miles (for example a 50 mile ride I did had 5000 feet of climbing). The ride from my house to the top of Mt Diablo and back in just under 50 miles with almost 5000 feet of climbing. 2: A lot of pros live here, and everyone posts their stats/rides to Strava, including their power figures. So it is very easy to contrast and compare. For my best time up Tunnel Rd in Berkeley (a hill I did often, 3 miles at 5% gradient), I did it in 18:42 (18 minutes and 42 seconds). I did not have a power meter at the time (I've gotten once since then) but I estimate I did it at about 3 watts per kilo (strava esimated 245 Watts and since I weighed about 173 lbs that sounds in the ballpark). The best time up that climb was done by a pro cyclist (Nathaniel English) in just over 10 minutes at 459 watts (they had a power meter so their time is accurate). Strava Ride Segment in Oakland, CA When you look at pro-races, ignore the flats (it is easy to go fast on the flats especially if you are in the peloton). My very first race CAT 5 race I averaged 25+ mph for the first 10 minutes with minimal effort. That is because I was sitting in the middle of the peloton, totally shielded from the wind. Once we hit the hills I was spat out the back like day old gum (and DNF'ed). American Cycling has a helpful chart that shows you various power statistics for each category (take a look at the FTP category). Watts to Speed, Power to Weight, Race Category Central At my fittest I was probably in the 2.8 - 3.3 watts per kilo, which puts me as a competent CAT5, possible CAT4. I suspect with more targeted training I can get to 3.5 - 4 watts per kilo. I doubt that given any amount of training I can go beyond that. I also weight between 165 - 185 lbs (my normal is right about 176 lbs). Pro cyclists tend to be smaller and weight much less (I have a photo I took with Joseba Beloki and Alberto Contador (in 2004, when Beloki was a TDF GC contender), standing next to them I look like a giant even though I am only 5ft 11 inches tall). Their power to weight ratios are also ridiculous. But to really get a feel of how fast pro cyclists are you have to see them flying up climbs that you are familiar with . Mt Diablo in the Bay Area is the tallest mountain around here. I have done it countless times, and never done it from the bottom to the top in less than 1 hr 20 minutes. From the North side it is about 12 miles and 3600 ft of climbing. To do Mt Diablo in 1 hr requires a W/kg of 4.0, which is a very respectable figure. When the Tour of California came here one stage ended at the summit of Mt Diablo. And that is after the cyclists rode 130 miles+ from San Jose. Me and a bunch of friends rode to Mt Diablo to just below the summit so we could watch the pro cyclists come by. They came flying up that mountain like it was flat (I think they did it from bottom to top in about 40 minutes). And this is after already having ridden 120 miles on a super hot day at ridiculous speeds. For a lot of races, FTP is king. To be a continental pro and ride the Tour De France, you need to be north of 5.5 watts per kilo. To be a Tour De France GC (overall victory) contender, the magic number is 6.7 Watts per kilo, which is a mind-boggling figure that only a few people in the World can muster. ",

            "answer_text": "Solo\u2026 not that much on the flat as you\u2019d expect at first glance. There\u2019s very much a law of diminishing returns at high speed because the air resistance goes up with the square of speed. Our average cyclist is able to develop 200W for a hour while the pro can do about 350W, and that huge gulf in power output translates to a speed difference of about 25%. That\u2019s a really big difference, but perhaps not as much as you\u2019d expect. On the hills, though, the difference is dramatic, because not only are they more powerful, but they also weigh less, so they can develop over 5 W/kg for a prolonged period while the average cyclist will struggle to develop 3W/kg. Since they move faster they can tackle the same climb by pacing more aggressively and up the power even more, and especially up short climbs this can translate to double the speed, and that\u2019s with our average cyclist going \u201call out\u201d for the duration of the climb. The pro peloton does move impressively fast, as others have described, but that\u2019s mostly due to the air resistance being dramatically cut in a big bunch and not a comparison of individual performance. Just near my house, the Tour of Croatia passed some years ago. On a flat 12km stretch their average speeds were around 45\u201348 km/hr, but the average power of the riders was mostly in the 180\u2013190W range, which is not even threshold pace for our average cyclist. It is the hill where he would get dropped, not to mention the mountain finish of that stage. It turns out another of my local training climbs, a 2.58km long 6% climb was around mid way of a stage of the Tour of Croatia in 2017. So, for instance, Vincenzo Nibali (to pick a household name, although rest of the peloton has similar times) took 7:19 minutes. My best time is, now, 8:53, which is a lot slower, despite going hard (for my standards anyway) at an average power of 292 W. Even with the benefit of drafting, I doubt I could hang with them to the top, and this is just one small hill. I may have taken some liberties with our \u201caverage\u201d cyclist. Let\u2019s say our average cyclist is fit and is not averse to suffering, which may not be a realistic depiction of the actual average cyclist, come to think of it.  I\u2019ve been recently to a local, eh, non exactly sanctioned TT event, since racing has been spotty this year with the Coronavirus pandemic. The field saw a gamut of various riders from local roadies and triathletes, including a very strong Cat 1, and also a pro triathlete here on his TT bike. The course was 33km long, slightly hilly (about 300m of climbing total, the midpoint being a roundabout at 220m elevation) and slightly windy, with a bit of a headwind going uphill and tailwind on the way back. I, representing an average cyclist, rode it on a road bike, without aerobars, at an average speed of 34,1 km/hr and power of 231W. The cat 1 guy rode it at 38,2 km/hr average on a road bike with aerobars for second place (he got on the podium in the nationals a bit later), and the pro triathlete rode it at 43,3 km/hr at an average power of 326W on his TT bike.  Me at the mid-point turn. ",
