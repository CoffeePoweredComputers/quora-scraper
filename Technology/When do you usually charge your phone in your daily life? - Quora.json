            "answer_text": "I always have a USB cable in my office back pack and charge it off the desktop or the connected laptop. So whenever I am working on my laptop in office, I plug in the phone (USB 3 ports work best as they have a higher current) and have it charged to the full. Since I am busy with the work, it makes sense to charge the phone as well has have it infront of me to know about any alerts. Also when the charge is full, I can plug off instantly. Second option: Better to invest in a good power bank, which can be charged overnight and then charge the phone during travel. It depends on a person's lifestyle. I hardly do this because I am connected on the go. I was careful to charge it once till the battery fell to 30 % but considering the quality of smartphones these days, after a year it is necessary to charge it frequently. If you do want to charge off your phone when you sleep, do remember to place it in on a strong surface. My friend's phone exploded once during a voltage spike :-) Happy charging ! ",

            "answer_text": "Personally I leave it on the charger if I\u2019m at my desk. Every I put it on charge at bedtime and take it off when I get out of bed in the morning. I leave the charging process over to Apple and not worried about 80% or whatever. I like it charged as much as possible in order not to run out during the day. if I\u2019m in my car for a long time I will plug it in as well to charge. ",
