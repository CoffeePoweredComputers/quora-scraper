            "answer_text": "My two favorite are the Jot Script 2 Evernote Edition and the Wacom Bamboo Fineline 2, that is of course if you are not getting an iPad Pro, then I would get the Apple Pencil. Things I like about the Wacom Bamboo Fineline 2: It has pressure sensitivity. It has a shortcut button.It comes in many colors.Has a pen cap.Things I like about the Jot Script 2: It has a tip that lasts forever, no replacement tips.It works with Penultimate and comes with a free 6 month Evernote subscription.Is rechargeable.Looks cool with the gunmetal design.Things I like about both of them: They have a super thin tip.It works with apps like GoodNotes 4.They are weighted like a pen.Have palm rejectionThey are both good styli. Overall, I like the Jot Script better. It will last longer, is rechargeable, and looks like a really cool pen. Choose whichever one you want, and whichever one stays with in your budget. ",

            "answer_text": "The Wacom Bamboo. It's not very expensive, and feels great in the hand as you draw. Very solid.   And here's a bunny I drew with mine... (Using the Adobe Ideas app)  Since I've had a couple of PMs about this here's some more info: I started this by sketching with a pencil on paper. Then I shot a pic of the sketch with my iOS device. Then I loaded the pic into a background layer in the Adobe Ideas app. Then I set up a tapered brush and commenced to ink the artwork in foreground layers, keeping areas in separate layers (i.e. the eye, the jacket) until they were finished or I ran out of layers, at which point I would selectively collapse layers and continue drawing on new layers as needed. The hatched shading is done by first drawing regular brush strokes and then using an eraser to break them up.  Adobe Ideas works perfectly for my illustration style which is rooted in 1950s comic books -- black tapered brush lines and stippled shading effects. Plus the artwork it produces is vector, which can be opened later in Adobe Illustrator for final editing, coloring, layout, etc. ",
