            "answer_text": "Personally, I know that a clean portable fusion power source is possible to build. The general consensus however is that it may not be possible to do fusion in any workable way at any size scale or cost. About 12 years ago I worked on an interesting experimental device which involved a spherical electro magnetic containment system, not a donut shaped tokamak, which is still the only design that has been thoroughly pursued to date. A tokamak design will never work. No idea how long it might take or how much it will cost to develop, but that is something I\u2019ll be working on. Whatever the cost I will fund it myself. I do not want that technology weaponized, which you know is the first thing that any government would try to do with it. So chances are you will not hear anything about it if I finally make it work. I\u2019ll put a big flux capacitor sign on it, hook it up to a battery bank along with alternate energy sources, and just not include any way to measure the net energy flows for the system. No one would believe that it is anything other than a large capacitor working in tandem with the battery system anyway. There is a difference between possible and practical. Honestly, at this time I do not know if it would be practical or not, but either way it will be a fun project to work on. ",
