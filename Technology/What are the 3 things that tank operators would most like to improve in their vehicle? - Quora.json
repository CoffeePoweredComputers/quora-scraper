            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve only done Exercises with our 1st Armoured Division however there are MORE than THREE main improvements that are being designed and fitted in the new M1A3 Abrams Main Battle Tank (MBT). So you always want to improve lethality, survivability, mobility, sustainability and provide increased situational awareness and command and control enhancements necessary to provide information superiority to the dominant maneuver force. Increased Armour is ALWAYS a part of the tank that can be improved with technology such as the British designed and Classified Chobham armour that has been added onto MBTs around the NATO countries. Although the construction details of the Chobham armour remain a secret, it has been described as being composed of ceramic tiles encased within a metal framework and bonded to a backing plate and several elastic layers. Due to the extreme hardness of the ceramics used, they offer superior resistance against shaped charges such as the high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds. There is also the M829, which is an American Armour-Piercing, Fin-Stabilised, Discarding Sabot (APFSDS) tank round designed specifically for the 120mm M256 main gun on the Abrams M1A1 and M1A2 main battle tanks. This sub-caliber anti-tank round is essentially a dart made of a depleted uranium (DU) alloy which gives it good penetration against nearly all known types of tank armour. The penetrator is carried by a sabot during its acceleration in the gun barrel. Also there has been armour \u201cinvented\u201d in the 2000s like cage armour to help defeat tandem shaped charges from like RPG-29. There was also the Tank Urban Survival Kit (TUSK) which is a series of improvements to the M1 Abrams intended to improve fighting ability in urban environments.Historically, urban and other close battlefields have been the worst place for tanks to fight. A tank's front armor is much stronger than that on the sides, top, or rear. In an urban environment, attacks can come from any direction, and attackers can get close enough to reliably hit weak points in the tank's armor or gain sufficient elevation to hit the top armour.So then the second thing you would like to improvements on your vehicle is what type armaments you have and whether you go with a crew loader or an autoloader. So the general consensus on what armaments a Main Battle Tank will carry on her and they are pretty much the same whether in be from Western/NATO nations to Russian/Chinese tanks who seem to have gone with an autoloader . If your tank with an autoloader takes a hit it can take out or disrupt components leaving you as a moving machine gun pill box. ALSO takes a lot longer time to change the type of ammunition in an autoloader!So the main cannon is either a 120 or 125mm smoothbore tube along with a .50 cal (12.7mm x 108mm) and a 7.62mm machine gun seems to be the accepted armament of a MBT until the T-14 came out with anti-air capabilities. Although the United States and/or NATO normally have air supremacy prior to any ground invasion from their own tanks then The Pentagon should be aware that the new Russian T-14 Armata can use anti-aircraft missiles and that a 30 mm anti-aircraft gun may be installed instead of the 12.7 machine gun! Perfect if you wanted to fight back against an AH-64 Apache with her Hellfires and/or a slow flying A-10 Warthog firing her 30mm Armour Piercing Depleted Uranium rounds from her rotary cannon.So next is Mobility, so for example the heavy M1 Abrams has gone from the start using a gas turbine engine which can use jet fuel, gasoline, diesel and Marine Diesel, rather than a T-90 or T-72 which are simply diesel only. Also the new T-14 and M1A2 Abrams have over easily over 1500 Horsepower. General Dynamics has been working on a drop-in diesel engine to replace the gas turbine engine. It is smaller than the turbine, 14% cheaper to operate per mile, and has a four-fan cooling system which is to greatly reduce the tank's heat signature. So things as a tank operator you\u2019d always like to improve without making you more vulnerable is your top speed and operational range.Lastly is TECHNOLOGY as the Battlefield today is all electronic: Sensors and communication. Fire control and observation:The commander's station is equipped with six periscopes, providing a 360\u00b0 view. The Raytheon commander's independent thermal viewer (CITV) provides the commander with independent stabilised day and night vision with a 360\u00b0 view, automatic sector scanning, automatic target cueing of the gunner's sight and back-up fire control. The M1A2 Abrams tank has a two-axis Raytheon gunner's primary sight - line of sight (GPS-LOS) which increases the first round hit probability by providing faster target acquisition and improved gun pointing. \"The first M1 Abrams battle tanks were delivered to the US Army in 1980. In all 3,273 M1 tanks were produced for the US Army.\" The thermal imaging system (TIS) has magnification \u00d710 narrow field of view and \u00d73 wide field of view. The thermal image is displayed in the eyepiece of the gunner's sight together with the range measurement from a laser range finder. The Northrop Grumman (formerly Litton) Laser Systems eyesafe laser range finder (ELRF) has a range accuracy to within 10m and target discrimination of 20m. The gunner also has a Kollmorgen Model 939 auxiliary sight with magnification \u00d78 and field of view 8\u00b0. The digital fire control computer is supplied by General Dynamics - Canada (formerly Computing Devices Canada). The fire control computer automatically calculates the fire control solution based on - lead angle measurement, bend of the gun measured by the muzzle reference system, velocity measurement from a wind sensor on the roof of the turret and data from a pendulum static cant sensor located at the centre of the turret roof. The operator manually inputs data on ammunition type, temperature and barometric pressure. The driver has either three observation periscopes or two periscopes on either side and a central image intensifying periscope for night vision. The periscopes provide 120\u00b0 field of view. The DRS Technologies driver's vision enhancer (DVE), AN/VSS-5, is based on a 328\u00d7245 element uncooled infra-red detector array, operating in the 7.5 to 13 micron waveband. A Raytheon driver's thermal viewer, AN/VAS-3, is installed on the M1A2 Abrams tanks for Kuwait. System Enhancement Program upgrades are intended to: improve target detection, recognition and identification with the addition of two 2nd generation FLIR's.incorporate an under armor auxiliary power unit to power the tank and sensor suites.incorporate a thermal management system to provide crew and electronics cooling.increase memory and processor speeds and provide full colour map capability.provide compatibility with the Army Command and Control Architecture to ensure the ability to share command and control and situational awareness with all components of the combined arms teams.So there are several items a Tank Commander and his crew would like to improve and as we\u2019ve moved into the Digital Age of Fire Control Systems and Target Acquisition all calculated by a computer inside there is still being able to see your enemy first is the the difference between life and death on the battlefield! However with small Drones (UAVs) these days you will probably be firing at enemy armour that is not even in your sights but kilometres away. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't really know about current tanks, but in past wars and ww2, these 3 things were done. -Additional armor -Grousers -Extra camouflage Additional armor. Throughout history, people wanted more protection in battle. Nothing has changed with the tankmen. From logs, concrete, tracks and junk, tank crewmen used anything they could find to improve the survivability of their tank.  Concrete armor on a T-34  Log armor and concrete armor (at the sides and next to gun) on a Finnish StuG IV.  Track armor on a M4A3 Sherman. Note the grousers. This leads me to my next point\u2026 Grousers. Added by crew members to the tracks of a tank to increase the size of the track which will spread the weight of the tank and decrease the pressure on the ground, literally, makes the tracks larger but can also be used for better grip. Useful when crossing muddy and snowy terrain where the tank could easily sink and bog down otherwise.   Various grousers on Shermans. Additional camouflage. To increase the stealthiness of tanks, the crew add various camouflage to it. From paint and nets to actual leaves and branches.  Panther with branches as additional camouflage.  Leopard 2 with moss camouflage.  Leopard 1 with camouflage netting.  Or even that\u2026 ",
