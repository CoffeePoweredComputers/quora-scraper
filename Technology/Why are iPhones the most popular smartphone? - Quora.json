            "answer_text": "Note: This is my opinion, I was an Android Developer for about five years before I went to college and had no time for it. I now own an iPhone 7 Plus. Apple does a few things very well that other phones, basically anything Android besides Samsung, doesn\u2019t do very well. 1. Apple is simple. It has used the same app grid since day one, same familiar Apple phone design, same punchlines at every keynote (\u201cbest [insert feature here] ever on an iPhone). They\u2019re consistent and familiar, and humans, as creatures of habit, developed a comfort in this consistency, believing that, minus the regular growing pains of new updates and features, they would get an overall good product without a doubt. 4. It created what I call the \u201cblue bubble\u201d complex. You could have an iPhone 4s in 2017, but because you have a blue bubble in iMessage, people will consider you (and themselves) superior to the \u201cgreen bubble\u201d crowd (non-Apple devices, except for when your iPhone sends messages as regular SMS). It\u2019s a status and social symbol, and humans are social by nature and don\u2019t like to be criticized, austrisized or constantly on defense for not being with the \u201cin\u201d crowd, so they go get an iPhone and join the group. 3. Apple became a visual media powerhouse for the social media world. As an Android person up until this year, regardless of who MADE the camera in the iPhone, it\u2019s pictures and videos were undeniably superior on Instagram and Snapchat in the early days, even to this day, and that made it a requirement for anyone who wanted to have a decent social media presence worth following. I can tell who uses an Android (and I\u2019m talking Galaxy S8s and LG V30s here, not MetroPCS budget phones) on Snapchat, but I can\u2019t tell who\u2019s using a 5s or a 7 Plus, I just know it\u2019s iPhone. 3a. This has a lot to do with software and quality control that Google doesn\u2019t have over the Android ecosystem beyond the basic guidelines that they set for all variants of the operating system. As an open sourced OS with literally hundreds, maybe even thousands, of manufacturers, it\u2019s hard to build a software that\u2019s fully functional for a wide spectrum of devices without dictating manufacturers and stifling manufacturer creative control. This was a double edged sword, as companies jumped on Android OS and spread it like wildfire, but social media companies can\u2019t build a software that\u2019s perfectly compatible with that many devices, making the experience a hit and miss even on the best Androids. Apple doesn\u2019t have that issue. They are definitively closed sourced and control every aspect of the user experience, and no other manufacturers can buld iPhones or distribute iOS. 4. They let other companies do the guinea pig work. Gimmicks come and go, and lots of Android phones implement these gimmicks, but few make it past the initial wow factor. Some features, however, do stay, and Apple uses it then calls it innovative. What Apple users know as \u201cHandoff\u201d has been used since the inception of Google Drive almost with real time sync between all devices. I was face scanning on my Nexus S in 2012 on software I built from source code myself, but Apple implements it 5 years later and dubs it \u201cFaceID\u201d. Steve Jobs scoffed at huge phones, now Apple releases phones with multiple screen sizes annually. Apple considered NFC useless, but later implemented it and called it \u201cApple Pay\u201d and threw away other uses for it until they implemented wireless charging. And because of that blue bubble complex, people think Apple is the forerunner in innovation when really they just spectate the market to see what does and doesn\u2019t stick. \u201cGood artists create, great artists steal,\u201d is a quote I believe Jobs once used. Apple lives up to that, then puts it between 2 sheets of metal and calls it the greatest and most advanced smartphone on the planet\u2026 literally. 4. iPhones have a cohesive software experience and ecosystem with other Apple products. Most of what I\u2019ve typed here are criticisms but I would be remiss if I did not applaud how fluid their ecosystem is. I bought an iPad, brand new. It somehow detected an iPhone was near it, asked me to scan a blue orb on the screen with my iPhone camera and literally set itself up. Being able to jump from iPhone to iPad to MacOS with services like iMessage just creates a sense of fluidity that Android simply cannot compete with, even with Chromebooks being able to run Android apps now. This is especially useful in things like photography and videography. I can AirDrop a photo or video, edit it on my Mac in Photoshop or Premiere, then Airdrop it back and not skip a beat. 5. Finally, it\u2019s just a good phone. Apple has a tendency to really make things go out of whack with software updates, but in terms of longevity, iPhones will hold their own as long as you maintain it. The learning curve isn\u2019t steep, the build quality is nice and the multimedia experience is very pleasant overall. Do I think Apple is the most innovative and progressive company in Silicone Valley? Nope. That doesn\u2019t matter though, because to everyone else, Apple is, and with me and all of my trash talk, criticisms and gripes, I\u2019m still answering this question about an iPhone\u2026 on an iPhone. That\u2019s the power of Apple, and that\u2019s why Apple is popular, in my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "Apple is (was) thinking years ahead. Their solutions are not ad hoc, those are well planned and integrated (future proof). What they put into the phone \u201cit just works\" for everyone (simplicity). They select only the \u201cthings\u201d which serve the users well (reliable service). They are well known for their utmost care of the hardware and software quality and design details (quality). These are the four main reasons in my opinion that fuel the popularity. As a result people do not have to relearn version by version the phone they are using. Users (IT literate and also IT illiterate) do not need to invent things when using the phone and its software.As a result Apple could build up the supporting services and infrastructure. The phones integrate into existing popular systems, SMS and iMessage, phone call from the Mac, audio calls and FaceTime and a lot more. Apps are available from the well managed App Store. All work without any extra setup or app.As a result the OS and App upgrades are fluid, without big issues, upgrades are popular, users love to upgrade. Apple does not need to care much about different software versions.The phones last a \u201clifetime\". It is usually a better, faster, more appealing phone (the development of better hardware, that in reality is not that frequent) that finally causes the upgrade. The users use the phones for years, usually at least for two or more years. The phones keep their personal and market value for a much longer time compared to any competition.The software internals (I am a programmer) are extremely well planned. Reuse of internal software components runs for years, even decades. The software needs much less resources than in comparable products. Less memory, less produced heat, less compatibility problems,\u2026 less bugs. Even the transition from obj C to Swift (which is a big one) is handled exceptionally well.Usually Apple is not the inventor. They collect ideas, inventions, market information, select only the popular new \u201ctrends\u201d redo them to be better, more reliable, more useful to the user.As more and more hardware components (e.g. sensors, AI) are introduced, as the software becomes more complex it is harder to keep up the original simplicity and reliability. It is not the competition that is the biggest challenge Apple is facing. Those are still well behind. ",
