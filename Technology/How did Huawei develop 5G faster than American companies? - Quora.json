            "answer_text": "A2A. Huawei didn't develop 5G. Companies from across the globe contribute to a global mechanism for continual development of a global wireless communication standard. The body that creates those standards is the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and various working groups such as 3GPP facilitate a mechanism for companies to submit contributions that will make up the accepted specifications. Here is the thing, those contributions could range from the simplistic to complex technical design, having a huge number of submissions doesn't mean much, the substance of those submissions is what matters. We will understand the value of those submissions as they are accepted as part of the final standard, and, more importantly, when companies negotiate with each other over patent licensing fees. Major contributors to the current release of final standards are Qualcomm, Huawei, Ericsson, Samsung, and Nokia. Nokia, Qualcomm, and Ericcson have indicated their licensing fees, Huawei has not at this stage but surely shouldn't be far away from doing so. Then we will understand the real value. As for the rollout of 5G, the US and many nations are currently ahead of China but I don't think that really means anything much in reality. tks for a2a ",

The US development has been divided among at least 4 corporations, no coordination, and probably no better than the programming for the Boeing 737 Max 8. Huawei has had 5G distributed for over a year. Verizon released their first 5 G last week. ",
