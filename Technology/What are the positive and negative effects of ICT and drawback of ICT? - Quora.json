            "answer_text": "This question is impossible to answer as it lacks context. Information and Communication Technology is a loose grouping of tools used by people to achieve various outcomes. Each tool has its advantages and disadvantages depending on how, when and why it is used. Let me explain by considering a simpler tool altogether: the handyman\u2019s hammer. A hammer has no inherent advantages and disadvantages without context; it\u2019s just a hammer. However it has several advantages over many other tools (or using no tool at all) if used correctly to insert a nail firmly into a solid wooden plank at room temperature. It has several disadvantages over other tools if the desired outcome is to screw in a light bulb at the top of a lamp post in the rain. So it is with ICT. You must first evaluate the environment in which the problem exists and define the outcome you wish to achieve, then compare the available tools to weigh up their relative advantages and disadvantages in that context. Only at that point does the answer present itself. The question doesn\u2019t provide any such context, and therefore any attempt to answer it becomes meaningless. Edit: If the question was intended to ask for the advantages and disadvantages of using ICT in general, presumably compared with not using any such technology, I\u2019d offer the following observation: Human beings, being weak, soft, squishy, juicy creatures that can\u2019t run fast and have no inherent defenses, have relied on communication and shared understanding to survive and gain an advantage over their environment since the beginning of existence. They have always employed new tools wherever possible to enhance communication and understanding and so improve their chances of survival and success. We see evidence of this in the earliest cave paintings, stone carvings and hieroglyphics, the invention of the alphabet and the written word, the invention of the printing press, beacons, semaphore, the telegraph, morse code, radio, telephone, film and television, the fax machine, cellular networks, global positioning systems, fiber optics and so on. Technology has evolved as the constant race to survive and get ahead has driven humanity forward. All of this technology, from the earliest, most rudimentary communication tools to those we use today, were the ICT of their time. There are, and always will be social, ethical and psychological challenges to keeping pace with technological progress in general, but for advantages and disadvantages it all comes back to picking the right tool for the job.

            "answer_text": "Interestingly I had a heated debate with a friend the other day on the same topic, although ours was centered on \u201cYoung people\u201d. However, time will fail me if I embark on a journey of creating a vivid image of the importance and drawbacks of ICT. So I will put forth a few of those same arguments in a global perspective. First, let\u2019s begin with the importance. Would I even be responding to this question without ICT? The internet whose potentials, sites like Quora and the rest have harnessed has become a global phenomenon in itself. If some kind of a demographic tool were to be installed on this site to show a geographical representation of all users, I would not be surprised if there are users here from every country in the world. Oh well, even if not every country, every Continent would pass the mark. Now that is what globalization is all about, and ICT for me is the very first agent of globalization, making the world indeed a global village. ICT is good at providing employment in the most unusual ways. In the Industrial era, being a man meant you had to break your back in the name of work. But can you begin to enumerate the different job opportunities that ICT has birthed? The one that so interest me is how ICT just saves time. I use a prepared power meter and the other day out of oversight I forgot to check my units, guess what? It ran out on me just as I settled into the couch to watch TV. Now if there was nothing like ICT in the world, I would shout my guts out and get nasty with everyone. But thanks to the availability of ICT, I got my cell phone, opened an app, punch in some numbers from my debit card and there came an SMS. I strolled to the meter\u2026\u2026 You guess the rest. The amazing thing was that I was whistling the whole time. Politics have become more interesting and participatory in this day and age thanks to ICT, It has presented all people (irrespective of the bloc they belong) the opportunity to air their views in the most compelling way, and at the same time be heard. I never stop making reference to talk-am.com, in a region where politics was reserved only for the lion hearted. But today, opportunities like it are being presented for a robust political debate in Nigeria and other parts of the world. On the disadvantages of ICT, ICT has a PHD in rendering some skills useless, hey are there still Postmen?ICT is gradually infiltrating Machines (Robots) to spy on our human interactions. I resolved last week to make it a point of duty to hang out with friends at least once a week, because I was gradually getting used to talking through the spies.Oh men, ICT is making us super lazy. I have an obsessed cousin who recently got herself a robot that does her cleaning so she can have more time to sit around doing nothing. She is a very good Christian, I used to join my faith with hers concerning her weight, but men how fast I took back my faith after she posted a picture of her new robot.",
