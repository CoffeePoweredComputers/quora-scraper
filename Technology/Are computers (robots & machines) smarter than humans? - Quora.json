            "answer_text": "Please give a specific definition of \u201csmart\u201d. In terms of pure computation, computers surpassed human almost right after the birth. In terms of object recognition, recent deep learning breakthrough have enabled AI to surpass human in quite a few field. In terms of creativity, humans are much better. Although there are some publications of AI making art, such as painting, it is not really creativity. The paint is just a specific combination of the trained features. However, human can organize and create something really new. For some tasks, AI is just much faster than human, such as sorting a sequence. That could be called smarter if you would like. ",

            "answer_text": "If you consider smart as having a quick thinking, problem solving conscience, then of course not. Computers can only do what humans program them to do. But\u2026 deep learning has become a thing\u2026 and it is \u201cgiving\u201d computers algorithms that allow it to essentially figure out a problem without being told the answer. This could be the beginning of the \u201cYes\u201d answer to your question. Maybe not in our lifetime though. ",

            "answer_text": "Humans have abstraction (which I think is the domain of reference exclusively made possible through consciousness). Robots et al. do not yet have consciousness. This in part helps to explain why humans are able to synthesise robotic systems, but robotic systems have not yet synthesised humans. But then \u2014 what\u2019s the difference between synthetic and non-synthetic? Machine and man? An arbitrary line: the same line that appears to separate chicken and egg. ",
