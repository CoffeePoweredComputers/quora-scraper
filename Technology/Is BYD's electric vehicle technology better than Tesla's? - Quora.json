            "answer_text": "Both are admirable technologies. Here are 4 noticeable things about BYD. 1. BYD topped plug-in EV sales in 2015 with 61,722 units. The number is more than what Tesla or Nissan achieved. The company plans to double the sales this year; 2. BYD recorded a crazy 550% increase in net profit in 2015, thanks to the hot EV market in China; 3. BYD is among the early EV makers. Its F3DM PHEV was launched in December 2008, 2 years earlier than Nissan LEAF and Chevy Volt; 4. BYD is a top battery maker itself. The production capacity of 10 GWh is expected by end of this year. For Tesla, there are a few things worth noting as well. 1. Tesla swept in 373,000 preorders for Model 3, which was never seen in the auto industry; 2. Model S is a very popular luxury car. In 2015, it accounts for more than 25% of large luxury car sales in the US, leading this category; 3. Tesla is also among the early EV makers. Its Roadster started to roll out in 2008; 4. Tesla Gigafactory will become world\u2019s largest battery factory \u2013 35 GWh for batteries and 50 GWh for battery packs; 5. Tesla\u2019s growth has earned the company the target for traditional top carmakers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW. In terms of battery pack technology, BYD and Tesla use different approaches. BYD uses prismatic cell. The cell capacity is as high as 120 Ah. The cathode material is lithium iron phosphate. Tesla uses cylindrical 18650 cell. The cell capacity can reach 3.6 Ah currently. The cathode material is lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide. BYD\u2019s prismatic cell format is more commonly used in electric cars than Tesla\u2019s 18650 cell. Carmakers like BMW and VW use prismatic cell. As you can see, the battery pack contains less number of prismatic cells than 18650 cells with the same energy. Lithium iron phosphate is safer than the oxide, but the oxide has higher energy density. Warren Buffett turned out to be among the ones who like BYD. His firm owns 10% stake in BYD. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know. Is BYD a child of Stanford University? Did it start on the Stanford campus in their labs? Did it move off campus with the entire Stanford team intact? Does it currently employ the best minds in the business? Do people flock from around the world to work for BYD? Can any of BYD's cars go 0-60 in less than 5 seconds? Can the same car drive 250 miles on a single charge driving an average speed of 70 mph? Have any of their cars won glowing accolades from the international automotive press? Did any of BYD's cars exceed the safety standards of the US NTSB? Did they score in the top 1% of autos tested by the NTSB? Does BYD's battery have an unlimited miles warranty? The answer is to your question is no. Tesla's battery technology is better by any measure than BYD's except price. By any metric of any part of any car BYD makes Tesla is better. ",
