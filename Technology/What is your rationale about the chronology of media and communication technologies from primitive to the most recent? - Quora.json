            "answer_text": "It started from the natural need to comunicate at high distances and be part of the comunity from the place where you live. Is a natural progression from letters and newspapers , to TV news , entertainment shows that mirrored the comedy colums in newspapers , club activity ,book narratives an theater. became it's own thing with reality shows , game shows , series , movies and telenovelas. And now social media and streaming services : Netflix , HBO , Hulu , Disney+, YouTube and You Tube premium + Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , Snap Chat , Twitch , Discord, Quora, Reddit. Comunocation moved from face to face , letters and books to phones and SMS to communication in real time online and fast trough internet in both visual , audio, written and dialog forms. Also communication became mass comunication, if before you where able to hear a limited number of oppinions and perceptions , limited by geographic location and group appartenance , now you have access to creativity , oppinions, thoughts of a high percent of globe population from many parts of the world and many different social classes and situations. Unfortunatelly it fails to close people up or open their mind as they can choose what they follow , and what they believe in as before. The dialog in two became much more limited than before and mnay people lost the skills of comunnicating real information. Lets not forget about the parasite aspect, or entities that would lie and cheat in order to survive they are the natural viruses of global communication , media is still just a form of communication, they are Fox News , other verified liar tv chanells, youtube chanells: like Flat Earthers. Instagramers and Twitter's that create cults around them. ",
