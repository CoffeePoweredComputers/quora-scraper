            "answer_text": "They can. Here are the reasons Samsung didn't go with that tech in their recent Galaxy S9 and Note 9 phones. Let me explain. First of all, let me explain how the iPhone X and XS have those ultra thin bottom bezels. The OLED display of smartphones needs a connector pin to give power and data to the screen and it is usually located on the top or bottom of the screen. This connector is usually placed behind the bezel. Now here is what Apple did with their iPhone X.  They bent the display in such a way that the connector will be placed somewhere under the display rather than at the bottom of the phone panel. Now, Apple had a strategy to take care of the other components such as camera, the Notch. Samsung on the other hand doesn't want to include a notch, so imagine the S9 with no bottom bezel and a thick top bezel. That wouldn't be symmetric and would look like a joke. I have seen some Mi phones employ this method and it really looks bad. Coming to the 2nd point, this is expensive. Now in the upcoming S10, leaks indicate the Galaxy has smaller bezels than the iPhone X and XS. We don't know yet if Samsung used this tech but whatever they did it got the end result right. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the whole bezel less designed range of products was brought in by SAMSUNG into the show with s8 and only after that Apple came in the market with its very own bezel less display but had a notch Which is disliked by many, yet there are many who either love em or have no problems with a notch screen. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Samsung Stuck to its design because of the competition in the smart phone market. Now if u see there are tons of mobile phones Which have same design as Apple's notch screen. Therefore if even they bring the notch with bottom bezel less display They become a company competing apple in its very own game. \u2026\u2026\u2026.. Second thing is dat they are actually bringing a bottom bezel less display but this new phone will also have top bezel less display. Which means its gonna be a complete bezel less phone with a lil punch hole at corner within the screen itself a camera. ",
