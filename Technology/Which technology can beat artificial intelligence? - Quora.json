            "answer_text": "By beat, do you mean in a fight or sales and popularity or what? For the former, depends. AI doing something stupid like churning out robots with guns won\u2019t stand a chance against things like nukes. AI doing things like disabling our power and money and releasing experimental viruses from labs, well, most of us are doomed. As for the other interpretation, entertainment systems will probably beat out AI except where those systems are AI-powered. ",

            "answer_text": "Making intelligent machines is both the goal of AI as well as the underlying science behind understanding what it takes to make a machine intelligent. AI represents our desired outcome and many of the developments along the way of that understanding such as self-driving vehicles, image recognition technology, or natural language processing and generation are steps along the journey to AGI. Forward-thinking organizations and individuals understand that AI is not a technology. They don\u2019t ask whether something they implemented is or isn\u2019t AI. Instead, they ask what transformative effect that technology has. They ask what benefit they can realize from machines that can think and act as humans do. They ask how AI will represent opportunities to dramatically increase efficiency, reduce expenses, increase customer satisfaction, improve existing products and services, and create new business opportunities. Because at the end of the day, an organization itself is not about its technology, but its overall mission and objective. And just like those organizations, AI is not defined by technology, but by the overall objective. ",
