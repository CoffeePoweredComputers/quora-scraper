            "answer_text": "For a long time, the concept of the \"arts\" were confined to visual arts (e.g., painting) and performing arts (music, theatre, dance) in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. Usage has widened since the beginning of the 1980s with the study of cultural industry (cinema, television programs, book and periodical publishing and music publishing) and the economy of cultural institutions (museums, libraries, historic buildings). Upon analyzing the relations between art and economy, it provides a comprehensive view about the meaning of artworks for society's economic and cultural development. That in my view is as close as you can get in defining economics as an art. ",

            "answer_text": "If you define art as \u201cthe expression or application of human creative skill and imagination\u201d then you can find it anywhere. If somebody excels in their career field in a way they do an extraordinary job and are very skillful, different, precise, interesting and they bring a whole new approach to the industry - it can be considered a performance piece. Not everything named \u201cart\u201d is art and not everything that might be considered \u201cnot art\u201d is not art. Try saying that 10 times fast :) this approach to view on life can make things much more interesting and you can learn many, many things from it. ",
