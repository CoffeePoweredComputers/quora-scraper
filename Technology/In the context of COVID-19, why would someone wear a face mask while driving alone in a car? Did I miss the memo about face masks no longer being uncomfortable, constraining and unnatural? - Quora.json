            "answer_text": "Suppose you're coughing and not wearing a facemask. You cough on the steering wheel. You touch the steering wheel, because you have to to not crash. Now it's on your hands. You don't have hand sanitizer because it's sold out. You go to the store to buy some food. You touch the door handle. Now it's on the door handle. Someone else touches the doorhandle, then their face (because it's really hard not to). They catch it, and cough near grandma. She catches it, gets sick and dies in a hospital, and can't even hug her kids and grandkids goodbye because then they'll catch it too. Maybe that's why. \u201cUnnaturalness\u201d is nothing to do with whether you should wear a mask. The main reason not to is that there's a shortage\u2014and doctors need them more than the rest of us do, unless we're coughing. ",
