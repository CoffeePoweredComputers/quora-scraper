            "answer_text": "The affects of technology on our eye sight is a positive one with very little downside. Technology has greatly improved the outcomes for patients who have sustained injury and suffer from eye disease. In a world where most of the information we receive is conveyed through the medium of screens there is the problem of overexposure to blue light and lower blink rates with resultant disturbance to sleep patterns and eye strain, but this is a small price to pay for the benefits we receive from these technologies. In the social sphere the downside is more pronounced as screen use dilutes and degrades the social interaction between families and the communities we live in, and is to an extent weakening the cohesive fabric of our societies, any reduction in quality or time in face to face communication between human beings is not a good thing as it is a vital component in how we develop and grow as human beings.
