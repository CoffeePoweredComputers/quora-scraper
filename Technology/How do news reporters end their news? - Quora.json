            "answer_text": "It depends on if they are anchors or reporters. An anchor tends to have a sign-off he or she uses at the end of the newscast. For example, Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart, at the end of his Saturday night newscast on NBC, says \u201cI\u2019m Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart, thank you for the privilege of your time, and good night.\u201d Other anchors doing the evening news might say their name and the call letters: \u201cI\u2019m Lester Holt, and for all of us at NBC News, good night.\u201d Obviously, the closing statement from the anchor would vary depending on what time of the day or night the newscast is on; and at local stations, the call letters are often included in the goodbye. Reporters in the field usually do what is called a \u201ctoss\u201d or a \u201cthrow\u201d\u2014 when they are finished with their story, they let the anchor know they are done by saying something like \u201cReporting live from [name of city,] I\u2019m [insert name]. Back to you [name of anchor.]\u201d So, for example: \u201cReporting live from Manchester, New Hampshire, I\u2019m John Jones, WXXX-TV. Back to you Allison.\u201d Some stations don\u2019t say \u201cback to you\u201d\u2014 they just end with the name of the station: in Boston, on the channel 5 news, the reporter might say, \u201cReporting live from Brockton, I\u2019m Mary Saladna, WCVB News.\u201d With that phrase, the anchor knows the reporter\u2019s story is concluded.

            "answer_text": "When I was a broadcast news reporter, how I ended my 1:30 stories depending on whether it was a LIVE shot or general packaged story. I\u2019d start with the most important information off the top of the story, and end with a conclusion telling the audience what was happening next\u2026such as \u201cSo and So could face up to XX amount of time in jail if convicted.\u201d This was the inverted pyramid concept of journlistic story telling. If it was a LIVE shot the story creation would be the same, but to close out I\u2019d say\u2026\u201dReporting live from the County Courthouse, I\u2019m DB, Eyewitness News 8.\u201d If it was the end of a \u201cpackaged\u201d story, I\u2019d say \u201cDB, Eyewitness News 8.\u201d TV Stations used us reporters as marketing tools\u2026faces of the TV station so they always wanted us to identify ourselves at the end of every story\u2026 The \u201cEyewitness News\u201d tag was the slogan our news department used at that time. Today the station uses \u201c8 News Now\u201d. ",
