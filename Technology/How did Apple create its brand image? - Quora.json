            "answer_text": "Apple was created and co-founded by \u201cSTEVE JOBS\u201d . He is also known as the father of digital revolution. He spent hours and hours in making a product great. Apple got its brand name maily because of this one man. His ideas, his vision was phenomenal. In his every presentation he presented the products so well (his presentation on events) that it tempted us to buy it as soon as it was launched . As he did not rely on any other company to make a product as apple made both hardware and software which made the product very awesome . The main reason apple is now \u201cAPPLE\u201d is because steve jobs became the face of the company from start company's inception and he made every product revolutionary. For example Macbooks , iphone , ipods , ipads . These products were absolute peace excellent engineering and of great art . Steve jobs made the product so perfect and made every product a status symbol . If somebody buys an apple product whatever product it may be , even if it is a iphone 4s then one will congratulate that person just because he bought apple. And he never ever ignored any nitty-gritty details may that be either in building a product or may that be in presentation of the product in front of the media or may it be the customer care everything was very good . And made the user very happy about the product. He did his job fantastically that\u2019s why people buy apple product and believe in the brand name . ",

            "answer_text": "I would venture that Apple\u2019s branding wasn\u2019t about competing with other products; it was about escaping competition altogether. You remember the \u201cI\u2019m a Mac, and I\u2019m a P.C.\u201d commercials. Apple was subtly positioning the Mac as an entirely different product class. No one would claim that Macs are categorically different from other computers, except for their operating system, but consumer behavior tells a different story. Look at the premium people pay to own a Mac. This wouldn\u2019t be possible if Macs were interchangeable with Dells or H.P.\u2019s. No increase in processing power or reduction in price on the part of those other companies could bridge this gap either. I suspect that this is why Jobs was so insistent on Apple retaining end-to-end control of its products. Two books, The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing and Zero to One, have shaped my thinking on this subject. ",
