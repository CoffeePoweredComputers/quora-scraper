These standards have been adopted as NATIONAL STANDARDS BY MEMBER CONTRIES OF ISO These standards are established to give a formal shape to the TOTAL QUALITY MANANGEMNT PRONCIPLES evolved during 1945 on wards by scholars like DR DEMING, DR JURAN , DR ISHIKAVA, DR CROBY. DR THAGUCHI It has the following benefits as listed in these standards 1 It makes an organisation to get the systems, processes defined in such a way that the organisation is a CUSTOMER FOCUSED organisation 2 The top management ( the governing board, members and the Chief executive ) drives the organisation goals nd strategy by a defined - QULALITY POLICY AND OBJECTIVES STTAEMENTS and undertakes regular review of the organization's outcome and outputs to ensure customer satisfaction and cost effectiveness 3 The standard sets out broad guidelines to lay down systems across the management functions of the organisation with personnel defined authority and responsilbilties 4 The standard also explains the need for defining clearly the operating processes and work instructions so that operating personnel perform error free operations . The organisation is made to become a Process driven and cost effective. ( handling risks methodology is to be documented and practiced ) 5. The standard lays down grammar for establishing system and process documents and records to be established for capturing various performance level data and information. ( These are to be shown as evidence for CERTIFICATION) 6 The standard also calls for the analysis of data and information to solve - customer issues, cost effectiveness, process improvements etc. 7 The Standard equally ensures that supplier chain integration is well documented and put into practice Thus the Certification to ISO 9001 helps the company to establish and regularly upgrade their system and process as per the conditions of certification This certification 1 Improves the customer confidence about the company products 2 The Large Contacting organisation have set this as a pre requisite for considering tenders 3.
