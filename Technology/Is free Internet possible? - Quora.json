            "answer_text": "Nothing is ever \u201cfree.\u201d Freedom isn\u2019t free. Is it possible to \u201creach\u201d and obtain your goals and aspirations? No, but it gives you something to strive for. Are Politicians ever \u201ccompletely honest\u201d or completely \u201ctruthful\u201d? Of course not. Any site you visit on the Web or internet is out to turn a profit (make money). It is why they are in business. (see commerce and free enterprise.) Free enterprise isn\u2019t free. That\u2019s why every screen you see has commercials on it. It\u2019s why sites give you access only when you join and or register. (They sell your name and viewing history,,,,see \u201ccookies.\u201d) Free access to the Internet with a real fast connection \u201cin your home\u201d? Nope even that isn\u2019t free. Someone always pays. In America you have free speech. That\u2019s why there is so much of it. The worst Vice known to Man is \u201cfree.\u201d it\u2019s called \u201cAdvice.\u201d You can get \u201cfree\u201d DVDs and Music CD\u2019s through the mail. You just go to a site, select your favorite Movie or Album and they send them to you \u201cfree.\u201d Only $12.99 shipping and handling plus applicable State and Local Tax. Free is a word used a lot in advertisements. The call is \u201cfree.\u201d (That means you get to talk with a salesman on the phone \u201cfor free.\u201d) The only thing \u201cfree\u201d is the word free which is why they use it so freely. Now that you are free of your naive expectations of something for nothing,,,,,you are free to go get a job and start paying like everyone else. Oh yeah,,,,the answer was free except for your time, the cost of your computer and the electricity used to power it. ",
