            "answer_text": "Ram is possibly the easiest thing to install on a PC. From the picture below you can see 4 RAM slots with 2 RAM cards installed already. Actually installing the RAM is a simple matter of inserting the card the correct way and then pushing down on it until you hear a click. That\u2019s it. If you have to remove a RAM card first, then you can do so by pushing on the clips that hold it in place, those chunky white things, and pull on the card to remove them, then simply push it in your new card. RAM requires no software or configuring in general, so it\u2019s a plug-and-play situation, so to speak. The only thing you have to be aware of is the type of RAM your computer takes. Your computer will already have RAM installed, simply look at what type it is before you buy your RAM and buy the same type. Most likely you\u2019ll be using DDR3 RAM. Hope that helps!  ",

            "answer_text": "Go to http://crucial.com and use the tools there to see what RAM combinations are valid for your system. To increase total system RAM, it could be as easy as just filling in the two empty slots. However, you may have to remove the existing RAM and upgrade all the RAM together with new devices. It\u2019s all system specific. ",
