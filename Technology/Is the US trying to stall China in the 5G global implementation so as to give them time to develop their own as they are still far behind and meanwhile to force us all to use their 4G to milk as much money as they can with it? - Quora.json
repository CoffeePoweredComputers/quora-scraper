            "answer_text": "We all know that American intelligence agencies monitor every single form of communication they can. Snowden and Assange proved this to be true. I believe the only problem that the US has with Huawei is that they CAN\u2019T intercept Huawei traffic and that has to be a No No for the US. If they can\u2019t intercept everything then it has to be banned, blocked, and accused of anything and everything that may impede their ability to hack every communication made anywhere in the world. - China has already deployed 5G in every major Chinese city and they are looking to deploy 5G across the nation. They lead in 6G patents as they have been working on that as well. - One of the problems I see with Western nations is that they seem to hang onto old equipment to make as much profit from sunk cost as they can. This means that they are often using old equipment, old processes, and old ideas whereas China is a newly developed nation with new equipment, new ideas, new unserviced markets, etc. ",

Practically speaking, they really can\u2019t compete in this area \u2014 they\u2019re too far behind the eight ball. Rather, I think they\u2019re just trying to hamstring the Chinese. It\u2019s a common tactic: if you can\u2019t compete, then sabotage your competitor. Recall the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan story. This is typical American mentality. ",
