            "answer_text": "First of all, you need to answer the question - what result I want to achieve in the near future? If to solve that capacity planning problem, how close would I get to my goal? That is the matter. I don't think its the main thing you need to pay attention to. You will never achieve great results with just capacity planning. I also solved small indirect problems in the past, but initially it is necessary to establish efficiency firstly - this is the basis and foundation of prospective development and Six Sigma helped me solve these issues. In order not to be unfounded, I will tell you briefly about that. Lean Six Sigma is a process improvement analytical method designed to eliminate problems and manufacturing waste, remove inefficiency and improve working conditions to provide a better response to customers' needs. It is often hard to get the organization to recognize the importance of this method for business success. It is much easier to achieve efficiency when both management and the team understand the importance of identifying and fixing the problem. But management does not dictate a problem and solution. Rather the analysis by the team determines the true root cause. Lean Six Sigma is best used for analyzing processes. Even when the problem under investigation is an obvious product problem, Lean Six Sigma will be much more effective when it is applied to the process that designs or builds the product, rather than looking at just the product itself. That is because the analysis is meant to investigate and improve actions, and actions are the steps of processes. So, you can constantly improve your business, if you are the owner of an enterprise, or even a manager. As for me, this thing was really useful. After passing the course about Lean Six Sigmaimplementation on practi\u0441e, I'm really just shocked by the simplicity of using this method. I'm a business owner (not big, 30+ workers) so using this method was strongly needed for me. A lot of business figures were significantly improved. I didn't want to promote the course that I passed (that's why I don't share a link here publicly), but after I collected some responses from my friends, and it turned out to be just as positive as mine. I made sure that it can really help, and I can recommend it with really pure heart. So, if you need a get a really practical information, message me here (it's simple - click on my Name/Surname, then at the right side, just below my bio, is three dots, click on it, and click on Message button), I will be glad to share the course that is being so helpful. All in all, Lean Six Sigma method is a must be thing in your business/department/whatever. ",
