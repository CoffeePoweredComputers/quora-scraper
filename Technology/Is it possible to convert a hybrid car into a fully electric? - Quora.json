            "answer_text": "Yes. It is possible to turn ICE cars into fully electric cars too. Is it feasible and reliable? In all but a few applications NO. The most common switch over is for a GEN 2 prius. As far as I know there is no good firmware mod to keep your dashboard from lighting up like a christmas tree. Also you need to put a low tech inline valve switchoff on your fuel line. You essentially need to trick the car into running 100% on battery. My experience as an amateur tricking car professionally designed car ECU\u2019s into compliance has gone poorly, things are very reliable when operated as the engineer intended. There are kits and they seem to work ok. But one person definitely burned down their car and garage trying to do this. There are companies that do this as well and reviews are mixed and different companies use different approaches. Contact Us If you are going to do this get the best AAA membership or get access to a truck with a car hauler. Because at some point or many points your car is going to stop running or not start running because of an electrical glitch. Prius chat is probably the best place to ask questions and interact with people on this subject. Prius PHEV Plug-In Modifications ",

            "answer_text": "I have a button in my hybrid vehicle (Lexus Rx450h) which does just that: One quick press and the internal combustion engine is isolated and I am on \u201cpure battery only\u201d. OK, if I start with a full charge and I am careful with the \u201cgo pedal\u201d I MIGHT manage about 15 miles, but 10 is more likely (or a bit less if I decide to impress a tortoise when the traffic lights turn green). The point is that the battery in most hybrids is not designed for extended use, so to give the vehicle any practical range would require many times the existing battery capability, plus some means of charging it. The additional cost and weight of those add-ons would be prohibitive. If you want a fully electric car, then simply buy one that was designed that way from the start: a Tesla perhaps or, if you want a smaller car, a BMW i3, or any one of the numerous offerings from other manufacturers.
