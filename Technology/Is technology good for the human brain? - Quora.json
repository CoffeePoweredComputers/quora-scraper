It remains your own responsibility to determine what you want to do with your own brain. If you want to cultivate your brain, technology will give you access to tons of high quality knowledge and data. If you want to play the potatoe couch all day long watching cats videos, your call. We, humans, have the ability to decide how to tame or unleash our basic instincts, just make your choice. Either way technology will be there to support your way of life. ",
