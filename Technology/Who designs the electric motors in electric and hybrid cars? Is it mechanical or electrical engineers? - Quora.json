            "answer_text": "I am a mechanical engineering graduate student working on hybrid electric vehicle energy management strategies. From my experience electrical machine design is a field in itself and elements from electromagnetic theory, field theory, tribology, strength of materials, metallurgy, electrical circuits etc. are used in its design. However, it is unrealistic for a person to master all those fields so electric machine designers draw from expertise of other people dedicated to individual subjects. At graduate studies level there are courses specifically designed to teach what you need to design an electric machine and where to look for resources that can make the electric machine better (metals, wiring, magnetic properties etc.) In industry, there are dedicated teams with experts from many related fields working on designing and improving electric machines for specific applications. When it comes to electric cars or hybrid vehicles, certain types of electric machines work better than others and it is up to the vehicle engineer (a.k.a systems engineer) to figure out what kind of motor works the best and relay those requirements to electric machine designers. Together, they design an electric motor that can provide enough torque and power to provide satisfactory driving experience for the end-user, the driver. In typical hybrid cars of today, PMSM (permanent magnet synchronous motor) is very popular. Switched reluctance motors have also been considered however there is much chatter about their usability in terms of control systems needed, reliability etc. For each kind of motor design there will be dedicated teams with experts in each kind of design. At the end of the day the answer to your question is that neither mechanical nor electrical engineer designs an electric machine. It is a group of people from all related fields led by a experienced engineer who know how to leverage everyone\u2019s expertise to meet requirements set by the systems engineers. ",

            "answer_text": "Why would it be one or the other? There are probably teams involving both disciplines, and there will be a degree of cross-training too. you won't get far into a course on electric motors without having to know the laws of motion, or a description of torque. Mechanical engineers are pretty familiar with Kilowatts (old James Watt was the most mechanical of engineers) These distinctions are not real, you know, but a way of making university education practical. there is a huge overlap at the fundamental level. Engineers never stop learning. Once you start work in e.g. A motor factory you would learn magnetic design by finite element analysis, and heat flow by the same technique. you would have to understand materials to make lamnations, and field theory to size them. You would have to pick up business practices, supply chain issues, and export legislation. Within two years you would be a valued motor designer and no-one would care if your degree was in mechanical or electrical. Or fishmongering. There are no glass walls. Engineering is transferable. ",
