            "answer_text": "There is no easy answer to this question due to the many different classifications of computers. Inventions have came and gone in many places for many years with this computer to be use of now as follows: England: The word \"computer\" was first used in 1613 in the book The Yong Mans Gleanings by Richard Braithwaite and originally described a human who performed calculations or computations. The definition of a computer remained the same until the end of the 19th century, when the industrial revolution gave rise to machines whose primary purpose was calculating. England: In 1822, Charles Babbage conceptualized and began developing the Difference Engine, which is considered the first automatic computing machine. The Difference Engine was capable of computing several sets of numbers and making hard copies of the results. Babbage received some help with the development of the Difference Engine from Ada Lovelace, considered to be the first computer programmer for her work. Unfortunately, because of funding, Babbage was never able to complete a full-scale functional version of this machine. In 1837, Charles Babbage proposed the first general mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine contained an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), basic flow control, punch cards (inspired by the Jacquard Loom), and integrated memory. It is the first general-purpose computer concept. Unfortunately, because of funding issues, this computer was also never built while Charles Babbage was alive. In 1910, Henry Babbage, Charles Babbage's youngest son, was able to complete a portion of this machine and perform basic calculations. Germany: The Z1 was created by German Konrad Zuse in his parents' living room between 1936 and 1938. It is considered to be the first electromagnetically binary programmable computer and the first functional modern computer. England: The Turing machine was first proposed by Alan Turing in 1936 and became the foundation for theories about computing and computers. The machine was a device that printed symbols on paper tape in a manner that emulated a person following a series of logical instructions. Without these fundamentals, we wouldn't have the computers we use today. USA: Short for Atanasoff-Berry Computer, the ABC began development by Professor John Vincent Atanasoff and graduate student Cliff Berry in 1937. Its development continued until 1942 at the Iowa State College (now Iowa State University). The ABC was an electrical computer that used more than 300 vacuum tubes for digital computation, including binary math and Boolean logic, and had no CPU (was not programmable). On October 19, 1973, US Federal Judge Earl R. Larson signed his decision that the ENIAC patent by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly was invalid. In the decision, Larson named Atanasoff the sole inventor. The ENIAC was invented by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania and began construction in 1943 and was not completed until 1946. It occupied about 1,800 square feet and used about 18,000 vacuum tubes, weighing almost 50 tons. Although a judge later ruled the ABC computer was the first digital computer, many still consider the ENIAC to be the first digital computer because it was fully functional. England: The first computer to electronically store and execute a program was the SSEM (Small-Scale Experimental Machine), also known as the \"Baby\" or \"Manchester Baby,\" in 1948. It was designed by Frederic Williams, and built by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Tom Kilburn, with the assistance of Geoff Tootill, at the University of Manchester, England. Kilburn wrote the first electronically-stored program, which finds the highest proper factor of an integer, using repeated subtraction rather than division. Kilburn's program was executed on June 21, 1948. The EDSAC, built and designed by Maurice Wilkes at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in England. The EDSAC performed its first calculation on May 6, 1949. It was also the first computer to run a graphical computer game, \"OXO,\" an implementation of tic-tac-toe displayed on a 6-inch cathode ray tube. USA: First delivered to the United States government in 1950, the UNIVAC 1101 or ERA 1101 is considered the first computer capable of storing and running a program from memory. Germany: In 1942, Konrad Zuse began working on the Z4 that later became the first commercial computer. The computer was sold to Eduard Stiefel, a mathematician of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, on July 12, 1950. USA: On April 7, 1953, IBM publicly introduced the 701, its first commercial scientific computer. USA: MIT introduces the Whirlwind machine on March 8, 1955, a revolutionary computer that was the first digital computer with magnetic core RAM and real-time graphics. -Bharath Vibushan ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you want to define computer. I am limiting this discussion to digital computers, and ignoring analog ones, which are a completely different beast. England, 1837. Charles Babbage describes the plans for his Analytical Engine, a mechanical digital computer using punched cards as input which was only partially constructed. It included sequential control, branching and looping, and would have been Turing-complete. In 1843, Ada Lovelace developed an algorithm that would have enabled the Engine to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, and is thus considered by some to be the world\u2019s first computer programmer. England, 1936. 99 years later, the principle of the modern computer is first described by computer scientist Alan Turing in his seminal paper, On Computable Numbers. However because of his work in World War II breaking German codes, he won\u2019t be involved in the actual design of an electronic computer until the Pilot-ACE project (1950). Germany, 1941. Konrad Zuse completes the Z3, the world's first working electromechanical programmable digital computer. It included about 2000 relays, did 22-bit floating point arithmetic and was considered marginally Turing complete (it had looping but not conditional branching). The German Aircraft Research Institute used it to perform statistical analyses of wing flutter. The original Z3 was destroyed on 21 December 1943 during an Allied bombardment of Berlin. US, 1942. John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry of Iowa State College (later University) develop the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer (ABC), the first electronic digital computer. It used binary arithmetic, had about 300 vacuum tubes, and used capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory. The ABC was not programmable however, and was designed only to solve systems of linear equations. However 30 years later, it will be shown to have influenced the design of ENIAC, and thus invalidate the latter\u2019s patents. England, 1943. Tommy Flowers at Bletchey Park designs Colossus, considered to be the world\u2019s first programmable electronic digital computer, although it was programmed by switches and plugs and not by a stored program. Like the ABC, it is also special-purpose and only used to break the German Lorenz cipher. It used 2400 vacuum tubes (valves in the UK). It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of Boolean logical operations on its data, but it was not Turing-complete. Ten were built.  Colossus US, 1945. John von Neumann authors First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, in which he describes a computer architecture in which programs and data are located in the same address space. Now called von Neumann architecture, it is the model for all computers used today, except those used in many embedded systems which use Harvard architecture (program and data in separate memory spaces). The British computers EDSAC at Cambridge (1949) and the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (1948) are the first working computers that followed his design. US, 1946. John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert of the University of Pennsylvania design ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), the world\u2019s first general-purpose programmable electronic digital computer. It initially contained 17,468 vacuum tubes and used decimal rather than binary arithmetic. Punched cards were used for input and output.  ENIAC programming ENIAC was intended to be used to computer artillery firing tables for the Ballistics Research Laboratory, but the first programs run were actually used to study the feasibility of a hydrogen bomb. It was Turing complete. However like the Colossus, it was initially programmed using switches and plugs (see photo above). A read-only memory was added in 1948, which was first used in April. Mauchly and Eckert will later go on to design UNIVAC I, the first commercial computer first produced in the US in March, 1951. England, 1948. The Manchester SSEM (Small-Scale Experimental Machine) is developed as a testbed for using Williams electrostatic tubes as computer memory. It had a memory of only 32 words (32-bits each) and contained 550 vacuum tubes. It is considered by some to be the first world\u2019s stored program electronic digital computer. It ran its first program out of electrostatic tube memory in June of 1948, but this was actually two months after ENIAC\u2019s first demonstration of its read-only memory capability. The SSEM's successful demonstration quickly led to the construction of a more practical computer, the Manchester Mark 1. The first version was operational by April 1949, and it in turn led directly to the development of the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer, beating out the UNIVAC I by one month (February, 1951).
