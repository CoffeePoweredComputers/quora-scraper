            "answer_text": "Hello, If you want the Android device to be in a stable condition. DO NOT DELETE ANY FILES OR DIRECTORIES OTHER THAN SDCARD AND INTERNAL MEMORY!!! In 2014, my father bought me a Celkon 7-inch tablet running Android JellyBean. It was my first Android device ever. I started installing some games as I was a kid at that time. Slowly I started ROOTING, once I got the root permissions, I started to research on how you can change stuff like the boot animation etc. One night, probably at 1 in the midnight, I accidentally deleted the stock launcher.apk, that was in the system partition. At that time, I was trying different launchers, so had some 7 to 10 launchers installed on my tablet. Next afternoon, I did a factory data reset, and there you go. Now there is not even 1 single launcher application in that tablet. The tablet unlocks but shows a black screen after removing. After playing a few months with it, I could somehow sideload a launcher, via adb command. Yay! it worked! But my stupid me did not know the value of an APK file named: SystemUI.apk and I deleted it. Which lead the tablet to enter into a bootloop. DO NOT DELETE: Your phone/tablet\u2019s default launcherSystemUI.apkThank You :) ",

            "answer_text": "The andriod folder which is generally first one you find in file manager . It is a path given to all apps for data . Also if you have any file manager like MIXexplorer then you can see data partition and system partition , the system partition is like a zip/iso file of your device operating system and data partition is where the zip/iso file is uncompressed and this forms your actual andriod operating system , the apps you install from play store or anywhere else is installed/extracted in data partition for use . Thus the data and system partition files most important and never be deleted . However the first statement of answer only mentions about the file you can see in any file manager , hence andriod folder is the one which never should be deleted , but it will not do any major data loss of apps.
