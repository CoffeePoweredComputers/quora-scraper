            "answer_text": "That would be an asteroid like lutitia\u2026  \u2026 A 100km object 1000km away would have an angular size of 5.7deg This is the same size as a tennis ball viewed at arms length (63cm)\u2026 that is about 11 times the size of the Moon. You\u2019d notice. You could use that picture (above) on your screen and stand back until you got the right angular resolution. Zoom until it is about tennis ball size and lean back in the chair\u2026 gives you an idea what you\u2019d see. Note: guessing you mean 1000km overhead, and not 1000km from the center of the Earth\u2026 because the latter means everyone died (diameter of the Earth?) This object would likely have been spotted months out, and such a close approach is indistinguishable from an impact prediction\u2026 so everyone has been panicking for months by the time it passes so close. In astronomical terms that is very very very close. By the same week though, probably know it will likely miss so asteroid parties folks. The whole planets spends the rest of the year drunk. ",

As the asteroid approached and receded, it would appear smaller, but more people would be able to see it. At around 10,000 km from closest approach it will be as big as the Moon. At about the same distance as the Moon it would appear to be about the size of Tycho crater, I estimate, so even in the daytime it would be visible quite a ways out. At night, it\u2019s quite likely to be a bright naked-eye object millions of km away, and would have been spotted through telescopes by astronomers if it was part of the asteroid belt or at a similar distance for at least a couple of centuries. If it came from outside the Solar System, it is quite likely that it would be spotted weeks, if not years, away because of its size. (\u2018Oumuamua is only a kilometre long on its longest axis and was very difficult to spot.) ",

This is huge compared to the size of the moon which is about half a degree. So, if a 100km asteroid ever passes by so close to the earth, it will look like a fast moving giant supermoon. ",
