            "answer_text": "This question seems to just cover the basics. I assume you are referring to a general procedures radiologic technologist and will insert my input from this assumption. The big plus of ultrasound techs is that they are more involved in the diagnosis and relay a case to the radiologist for his consideration and final read. Beyond that, they also aren't exposed to scatter radiation that in unsafe doses can lead to cataracts among other medical conditions. Starting pay is significantly better. General procedures (GP) techs get to be out and about a lot in different atmospheres outside the department such as trauma and surgery, where ultrasound techs do not. Radiology techs can also work in CT, MRI, Angio, and Cath lab. Each department has its pros and cons that each individual needs to consider. I am a GP tech and I love the OR and trauma. I think MRI is interesting, but requires too much sitting due to long scan times. A brain takes about 13 minutes, a knee is 40 minutes, and one portion of the spine can take an hour. CT is something I would consider as I would be able to see the traumas that come in and have much faster scan times. Angio is also a department I would enjoy for the procedures, but they are sent home early when no cases are available and may be called back in 40 minutes later for emergent cases. There\u2019s too much call for me with some weeks leaving my paycheck light and I would not be able to enjoy as much free time where I wouldn't need to be within 30 minutes of the hospital for call back. Both career types risk wear and tear on the body. Ultrasound techs have issues with carpal tunnel, shoulder, and neck. Some neck problems turn into migraines and I\u2019ve recently spoken to a US tech that is debating injections to relieve the symptoms. Although repetitious movements in any career will cause problems. GP techs usually have back problems from the pushing, pulling, and maneuvering we do. Personally, I\u2019ve had two steroid injections into my elbow from overuse and repetition of AM chest portables in the ICU. Hope these things have helped you to consider which may be the right path for you! ",

            "answer_text": "Having worked with both, Rad Tech seems a better way to go, in my opinion. Rad Tech needs move the patient around and get the images, Sonographer tends to literally need to be up to their elbows in a patient. I mean this, at times, literally. Sonography tends be a more intimate interaction with the patient, and you need to recall, you aren\u2019t typically imaging healthy people\u2026 I have heard from sonographers they make more, from radtechs they make more. I think radtechs may have a slight edge in moving up, and if you get an MBA or other business degree, managing an imaging department is easily in your wheelhouse to move into. A career alternative if you are inclined to travel is applications specialist for medical imaging companies. Going around training imaging techs on your companies equipment, you also tend to support the sales team and can go to conferences to interface with your fellow imaging techs and talk about how system x,y,z is so much better and easier to use. I worked with a large group of sonographers in my last company, many were glad not be in direct contact with subjects on an hourly basis. ",
