            "answer_text": "Dear sir, 1. Broadband is the term used to refer to any technology that provided substantially faster connection speeds compared to dial-up. Direct Subscriber line, commonly known as DSL, is one of these technologies and it is one of the most popular technologies used in homes. Broadband has opened up the internet to more than simple data. It allowed people to use the internet for listening to music, watching videos, and even sharing photos and other files. Peer to peer networks also started to appear after higher data speeds made it more feasible.DSL is not the only technology that is capable of providing high speed access. There is ISDN, satellite internet, cellular broadband, and power-line internet to name a few. Each of these technologies has their own advantages and disadvantages that make them better for one application but not for another. DSL is widely preferred by a lot of homes and phone companies because they use the same infrastructure as standard telephone lines. It is easier for telephone companies because they don\u2019t have to lay new lines. All it takes on the subscriber\u2019s end is a line splitter/ filter that separates the frequencies used for voice and the frequency used for data, and DSL modem. It also requires a lot less expense in terms of hardware compared to wireless technologies like cellular and satellite2. DSL is a communications medium used to transfer digital signals over standard telephone lines. Along with cable Internet, DSL is one of the most popular ways ISPs provide broadband Internet access. DSL technology provides high speed Internet on conventional phone lines. This high-speed Internet connection is provided through either cable or telephone companies. Broadband Internet connections such as DSL and cable are considered high-bandwidth connections. Although many DSL connections can be considered broadband, not all broadband connections are DSL. DSL, unlike cable, provides a continuous, dedicated connection to your business, meaning the connection is not being shared among any potential neighbors. Further, DSL is an 'always on' internet connection.3. Broadband is the umbrella terminology used for high speed internet access while DSL is only one of these technologies. There are other broadband technologies in use aside from DSL say WiMAX \u2026.etc etc . DSL is advantageous compared to other broadband technologies as it can integrate to existing telephone systems but it has limitation that it will work perfectly if the customer is within 4kms from the access point say telephone exchange4. Most computers and portable devices have built-in wireless adapters. Therefore, all you need is a wireless router and an Internet Service Provider. However, you won't be able to connect to the Internet unless the wireless router has an Internet connection. Therefore, you need a cable or DSL modem provided by your ISP built-in Wi-Fi antennaThank you very much ",

            "answer_text": "Broadband is high speed internet. Several technologies are available for an internet service provider to build a broadband network. The main technologies are cellular, cable, fiber, and DSL. DSL uses your telephone line (POTS service). Once you have internet service, you will need three things. A modem will convert the signals received in your house to Ethernet. A router will let several devices share the connection. A WiFi Access Point will create the radio signals for WiFi. Usually, all three of these are combined into one box which is usually called a router or gateway. Your service provider usually offers a router with your service, generally adding a monthly fee for rental and service. ",
