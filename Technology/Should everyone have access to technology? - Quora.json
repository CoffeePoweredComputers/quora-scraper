            "answer_text": "As an incoming college senior, I have witnessed and experienced professors who were reluctant to use any form of technology in their lectures. They claim that technology is a distraction, and limit students from utilizing laptops or other devices within the classroom. This brings me to my answer to this question\u2014 yes, everyone should use technology! Technology comes in many, many forms and we shouldn\u2019t deny it when they\u2019re invented to solely make our lives easier. Technology shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a \u201cdistraction\u201d when it comes to classroom or professional settings. Rather, they should be viewed as tools that can further keep the workspace organized and more convenient for everyone. No matter what, there will be people who completely opposes the use of technology and talk down about it. These people misunderstand the purpose of technology and what it\u2019s really made for. ",
