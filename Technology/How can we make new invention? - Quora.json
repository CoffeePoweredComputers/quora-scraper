            "answer_text": "Inventors and inventions Have you ever dreamed of becoming a great inventor\u2014of having a fantastically clever idea that changes society for the better and makes you rich in the process? The history of technology is, in many ways, a story of great inventors and their brilliant inventions. Think of Thomas Edison and the light bulb, Henry Ford and the mass-produced car, or, more recently, Tim Berners-Lee and theWorld Wide Web. Inventing isn't just about coming up with a great idea; that's the easy part! There's also the matter of turning an idea into a product that sells enough to recoup the cost of putting it on the market. And there's the ever-present problem of stopping other people from copying and profiting from your ideas. Inventing is a difficult and often exhausting life; many inventors have died penniless and disappointed after struggling for decades with ideas they couldn't make work. Today, many lone inventors find they can no longer compete and most inventions are now developed by giant, powerful corporations. So, are inventors in danger of going extinct? Or will society always have a place for brave new ideas and stunning new inventions? Let's take a closer look and find out! Photo: The wheel is probably the greatest invention of all time, used in everything from cars and planesto wind turbines and computer hard drives. Even so, no-one knows who invented it or when. Advertisement What is invention?  Artwork: Thomas Edison's original patent for the electric lamp, granted in January 1880. This wasn't the first electric light, but it was the first really practical and commercially successful one. Courtesy of US Patent and Trademark Office. That sounds like a trivial question, but it's worth pausing a moment to consider what \"invention\" really means. In one of my dictionaries, it says an inventor is someone who comes up with an idea for the first time. In another, an inventor is described as a person of \"unique intuition or genius\" who devises an original product, process, or machine. Dictionary definitions like these are badly out of date\u2014and probably always have been. Since at least the time of Thomas Edison (the mid-to-late 19th century), invention has been as much about manufacturing and marketing inventions successfully as about having great ideas in the first place. Some of the most famous inventors in history turn out, on closer inspection, not to have originated ideas but to have developed existing ones and made them stunningly successful. Edison himself didn't invent electric light, but he did develop the first commercially successful, long-lasting electric light bulb. (By creating a huge market for this product, he created a similarly huge demand forelectricity, which he was busily generating in the world's first power plants.) In much the same way, Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi can't really be described as the inventor of radio. Other people, including German Heinrich Hertz and Englishman Oliver Lodge, had already successfully demonstrated the science behind it and sent the first radio messages. What Marconi did was to turn radio into a much more practical technology and sell it to the world through bold and daring demonstrations. These days, we'd call him an entrepreneur\u2014a self-starting businessperson who has the drive and determination to turn a great idea into a stunning commercial success.  Photo: Guglielmo Marconi didn't so much \"invent\" radio as make it practical and popular. Photo courtesy of US Library of Congress. It's important not to underestimate the commercial side of inventing. It takes a lot of money to develop an invention, manufacture it, market it successfully, and protect it with patents. In our gadget-packed homes and workplaces, modern inventions seldom do completely original jobs. More often, they have to compete with and replace some existing gadget or invention to which we've already become attached and accustomed. When James Dyson launched his bagless cyclone vacuum cleaner, the problem he faced was convincing people that it was better than than the old-fashioned vacuums they had already. Why should they spend a fortune buying a new machine when the one they had already was perfectly satisfactory? Successful inventions have to dislodge existing ones, both from our minds (which often find it hard to imagine new ways of doing things) and from their hold on the marketplace (which they may have dominated for years or decades). That's another reason why inventing is so difficult and expensive\u2014and another reason why it's increasingly the province of giant corporations with plenty of time and money to spend. How and why do people invent things? According to the well-known saying, \"necessity is the mother of invention\"; in other words, people invent things because society has difficult problems that need solving. There's some truth in this, though less than you might suppose. It would be more accurate to say that inventions succeed when they do useful jobs that people recognize need doing. But the reasons inventions appear in the first place often have little or nothing to do with \"necessity,\" especially in the modern age when virtually every need we have is satisfied by any number of existing gadgets and machines. Where, then, do inventions come from and why do people invent them? Scientific breakthroughs  Artwork: The discovery of how DNA worked revolutionized crime-fighting and forensic science\u2014and will have huge impacts on medical science and technology in the future. Picture of a DNA double helix based on an artwork courtesy of US National Library of Medicine. Some inventions appear because of scientific breakthroughs. DNA fingerprinting (the process by which detectives take human samples at crime scenes and use them to identify criminals) is one good example. It only became possible after the mid-20th century when scientists understood what DNA was and how it worked: the scientific discovery made possible the new forensic technology. The same is true of many other inventions. Marconi's technologicaldevelopment of radio followed on directly from the scientific work done by Lodge, Hertz, James Clerk Maxwell, Michael Faraday, and numerous other scientists who fathomed out the mysteries of electricity and magnetism during the 19th century. Generally, scientists are more interested in advancing human knowledge than in commercializing their discoveries; it takes a determined entrepreneur like Marconi or Edison to recognize the wider, social value of an idea\u2014and turn theoretical science into practical technology. Trial and error But it would be very wrong to suggest that inventions (practical technologies) always follow on from scientific discoveries (often abstract, impractical theories). Many of the world's greatest inventors lacked any scientific training and perfected their ideas through trial and error. The scientific reasons why their inventions succeeded or failed were only discovered long afterward.Engines (which are machines that burn fuel to release heat energy that can make something move) are a good example of this. The first engines, powered by steam, were developed entirely by trial and error in the 18th century by such people as Thomas Newcomen and James Watt. The scientific theory of how these engines worked, and how they could be improved, was only figured out about a century later by Frenchman Nicolas Sadi Carnot. Thomas Edison, one of the most prolific inventors of all time, famously told the world that \"Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration\"; he had little or no scientific training and owed much of his success to persistence and determination (when he came to develop his electric light, he tested no fewer than 6000 different materials to find the perfect filament).  Photo: Steam engines weren't developed scientifically: they evolved slowly and gradually by trial and error. As Nicolas Sadi Carnot later pointed out, they could be extremely inefficient machines\u2014which meant they used a huge amount of fuel (coal) to power themselves. But that didn't matter in an age where coal was relatively cheap and abundant and people cared less about pollution. Inventions that evolve Some inventions are never really invented at all\u2014they have no single inventor. You can comb your way through thousands of years of history, from the abacus to the iPhone, and find not a single person who could indisputably be credited as the sole inventor of the computer. That's because computers are inventions that have evolved over time. People have needed to calculate things for as long as they've traded with one another, but the way we've done this has constantly changed. Mechanical calculators based on levers and gears gave way to electronic calculators in the early decades of the 20th century. As newer, smaller electronic components were developed, computers became smaller too. Now, many of us own cellphones that double-up as pocket computers, but there's no single person we can thank for it. Cars evolved in much the same way. You could thank Henry Ford for making them popular and affordable, Karl Benz for putting gasoline engines on carts to make motorized carriages, or Nikolaus Otto for inventing modern engines in the first place\u2014but the idea of vehicles running on wheels is thousands of years old and its original inventor (or inventors) has long since disappeared in time. Accidental inventions  Artwork: VELCRO\u00ae: George de Mestral chanced on the idea of a clothing fastener entirely by accident. Here's a drawing from his invention US Patent 3,009,235: Separable fastening device (filed 1958, granted 1961) courtesy of US Patent and Trademark Office. Some inventions happen through pure luck. When Swiss inventor George De Mestral was walking through the countryside, he noticed how burrs from plants stuck to his clothes and were hard to pull away. That gave him the idea for the brilliant two-part clothing fastener that he called VELCRO\u00ae. Another inventor who got lucky was Percy Spencer. He was experimenting with a device called amagnetron, which turns electricity into microwave radiation for radar detectors (used for direction-finding in ships and planes), when he noticed that achocolate bar in his pocket had started to melt. He realized the microwave radiation was generating heat that was cooking (and melting) the food\u2014and that gave him the idea for the microwave oven. Teflon\u00ae, the super-slippery nonstick coating, was also discovered by accident when Roy Plunkettaccidentally made some strange white goo in a chemical laboratory. Its amazing nonstick properties were only discovered and put to use later. All these inventions, and numerous others, were chance discoveries produced by accidents or mistakes.  Photo: The Teflon coating that makes this frying pan nonstick was another accidental invention. Advantageous inventions From IBM and Sony to Goodyear and AT&T, many of the world's biggest, best-known corporations have been built on the back of a single great invention. IBM, for example, grew out of an earlier company selling intricate mechanical census-counting machines developed by Herman Hollerith; Sony made its name selling cheap, high-quality radios made with tiny transistors; Goodyear owes its name (and its chief product) to Charles Goodyear, a hapless inventor who finally developed durable, modern, \"Vulcanized\" rubber after a lifetime of trial and error; AT&T can trace its roots back to the telephone patented byAlexander Graham Bell in 1876. But a modern company can't survive and thrive on one great idea alone. That's why so many companies have huge research and development laboratories where inspired scientists and engineers are constantly trying to come up with better ideas than the ones on which their original success was founded. As marketing genius Theodore Levitt pointed out in the 1960s, visionary companies need the courage to try to put themselves out of business by coming up with new products that make their existing ones obsolete; companies that rest on their laurels will be put out of business by their inventive competitors. This kind of corporate invention\u2014companies trying to out-invent themselves and one another\u2014is very much the way the world works now. The world of corporate invention  Photo: Inventors have to start somewhere: The Apple ][ computer made Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak rich and famous, but they started their lives making and selling their original Apple I in a garage belonging to Jobs' parents. There are probably more people trying to invent things now than at any time in history, but relatively few of them are lone geniuses struggling away in home workshops and garages. There will always be room for lucky individuals who have great ideas and get rich by turning them into world-beating products. But the odds are stacked increasingly against them. It's unlikely you'll get anywhere tinkering away in your garage trying to invent a personal computer that will change the world, the way Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs did back in the mid-1970s when they put together the first Apple Computer. To do that, you'd have to set yourself up in competition with\u2014guess who\u2014Apple Computer (which became the world's richest company in 2011), staffed with legions of brilliantly creative scientists, engineers, and designers, and with billions of dollars to spend on research and development. Really prolific inventors might file a few dozen patent applications during their lifetime, if they're lucky; but the world's most inventive company, IBM, files several thousand patents every single year. Companies like IBM have to keep on inventing to keep themselves in business: inventions are the fuel that keep them going.  Photos: Nylon\u2014the power behind your toothbrush: Could anyone develop such a fantastic material tinkering away in a garage? Not likely. In our sophisticated 21st-century world, it takes well-funded corporate research labs to come up with amazing new chemical materials like this. Read how it was developed by Wallace Carothers for DuPont in our article on nylon. Think of inventions in the 19th century and you'll come across lone inventors like Charles Goodyear, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, George Eastman (of Kodak)\u2014and many more like them. But think of inventing in the 20th and 21st century and you'll come across inventive corporations instead\u2014such companies as DuPont (the chemical company that gave us nylon, Teflon\u00ae, Kevlar\u00ae, Nomex\u00ae, and many more amazing synthetic materials), Bell Labs (where transistors, solar cells, lasers, CD players, digital cellphones, commercial fax machines, and CCD light sensors were developed), and 3M (pioneers of Scotchgard textile protector and Post-It\u00ae Notes, to name only two of their best-known products). It was Thomas Edison who transformed the world of inventing, from lone inventors to inventive corporations, when he established the world's first ever invention \"factory\" at Menlo Park, New Jersey, in 1876. These days, corporations dominate our world, and they dominate the world of inventing in exactly the same way. If it's your dream to become a great inventor, go for it and good luck to you\u2014but be prepared to take on some very stiff, very well-funded, corporate competition. If you succeed, congratulations: maybe you'll prove to be the founder of the next Apple, AT&T, or IBM! What are patents and why do we need them?  Artwork: A drawing from George Eastman's original Kodak film camera patent, US Patent 388,850: Camera (filed and granted 1888) courtesy of US Patent and Trademark Office. Imitation may be the \"sincerest form of flattery.\" But if you spend years developing a great invention and plow all your life savings into getting it manufactured, you're unlikely to be \"flattered\" when someone tries to copy it and make money on the back of it. That's why the world has patents. A patent is a legal document that records, in great detail, how an invention works, what makes it original, when it was first invented, and who owns the rights to it. Society moves forward through the development of great ideas but, for that to happen, the people who come up with those ideas have to be able to make at least some money out of them (even if they don't get rich). Patents make it possible for inventors to earn money from their inventions for a limited amount of time before the rights expire. At that point, society as a whole benefits because the idea behind the invention effectively becomes public property (we say it enters the \"public domain\"). Filing a patent can be lengthy, complex, difficult, and expensive; typically, it takes about two years from the date when you apply for a patent to the time when it is formally granted to you (largely because there are so many patents being applied for\u2014several hundred thousand a year in the United States alone). Another problem is that patents apply only in certain territories so, if you want to protect an invention throughout the world, you have to take out patents simultaneously in multiple countries through agencies such as the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and theEuropean Patent Office (EPO). One more difficulty is that not everything can be patented. Ideas and scientific discoveries are not covered, for example. Despite all these difficulties, taking out a patent is still an essential step to protecting an invention ",

            "answer_text": "When a person conceives a new idea and capable to visualises final shape of the invention product, has willpower, resources, knowledge /skills, capabilities to implement the new idea to make it happen into reality. They are an all-rounder and make the new product under their guidance and supervision, run the turnkey project, they are actual inventor of the concept. In practical life, there are mostly multiple minds behind one great invention. The person who conceive a new idea is the creator of the invention, the mind who can visualise the potential of the idea of a creator, who can convert the idea into the tangible thing is an actual inventor. Implementation is a real challenge in the new invention. Innovations not inventions: Mostly the existing products are upgraded to a higher version based on the studies of demand, supply in the market and user\u2019s opinion and reviews of a product they use are key to bring modification. Sometimes when the product fail to attract the attention of people, the manufacturer brings their same old product in the market with a new shape, size and some superficial / cosmetic changes in the product specifications with new strategy. The brand, model sustain in the market place based on the acceptance and liking of the product by the people that is customer base and the rates are varied as per the analysis of sales data. The quality of new ideas for invention: We can witness several creative minds, who comes up with different ideas. Few ideas are real, creative and good but most ideas are frivolous as they are produced by superficial thinking, practically, non-implementable and lack creativity and invention. Some ideas are innovation not invention. Implementation of invention idea: Very few creative people are real talented to implement their ideas, those who have implementation skills are competent and capable to translate an idea into realism. Others who have limited knowledge and experience are unable to implement own ideas. Some other creative minds face other multiple problems due to lack of resources, skills and financial strength. Some can imagine great ideas but have no practical knowledge necessary for implementation. There are special minds who can select the potential new ideas from the hundreds of ideas floating around in the environment, they pick nice ideas from the creative people and then implement it into reality. They put take the risk, push their efforts, finance and administration to implement the idea in reality. Sometimes the actual creative mind of the idea is included in the project during the implementation stage. Those creators who can visualise, imagine, capable of implementing everything but lack finance is selected as director, managers of invention project, others are hired, employed at a suitable position in the project, for examples script writers, assistant directors of the movie etc. When an idea is successfully implemented, the invention is placed in the market, when the invention became popular in the masses, the credit of invention go to the person who accepts that idea and implements it on ground. He is an actual inventor. The selection and acceptance of new ideas for implementation are mainly based on the demand of the market. The other impotent issues are: scope of the growth in the business, risk involved in the project, profit factor of a new product, etc, all such aspects which are associated with the project of new invention are examined by the professional people before the invention takes place in the world. Every mind is capable of thinking new idea however there are few minds who can visualise the design and shape of new products, if the person is competent enough than he can learn the necessary skills required to implement it, to produce the new invention in the world.

            "answer_text": "HOW TO INVENT GADGETS OR PROCESSES SIMPLY: From Lectures I gave to Consolidated Systems Corp, Monrovia Los Angeles 1959 - July 2004. I've invented OVER 5,470 fully tested gadgets, processes, discoveries or concepts in many fields - not so many inventions as Thomas Edison who only concentrated on a few major items (lamp, movie, phone) or the 1950s Japanese floppy disk inventor Dr.Yoshiro Nakamatsu & I\u2019m the third World\u2019s most prolific, but escalating weekly; besides at 85 I\u2019m not dead yet. a. Necessity is the mother of invention: Unlike the ingenious MacGyver (TV fame) this approach is something I don't often use, possibly because after years of inventing in many fields, my necessities come almost intuitively, automatically. During Vietnam war, secure jungle communication was impossible; so I invented NUCOMS = Nuclear Muon Communications - which were eventually proved success for 1 Ghertz messages. b. Find a need & fill it: Often from some unrelated source - Keiser's favourite motto (of Keiser Steel). c. Quantum jump or even inspiration from above: This is truly awesome, even after years of frequent occurrence, but it may be triggered by ideas connections from many observations over a huge body of knowledge & subsequent subconscious incubation. Maxwell, Einstein, Schrodinger (see his 1-page Doctorate Quantum Wave-equation!), Florey & umpteen others have enjoyed getting high on this miracle - as I have. By reviewing copious notes going back more than 40 years, I still can't find how I evolved over 60 algorithms for solving so many nasty maths problems, as in my bargain Maths Algorithm computer Library MAL. d. Here's a phenomenon, find a use for it: This is my favourite scene & is excitingly varied because you never know where it leads. But as one wag Linus Pauling said: \u201cGood ideas need lots of ideas\u201d. Thus an electronic problem could be better solved by an optical solution seen by physicists like self, but not by electronic engineers, also self. e. For solving really difficult technical problems, best try Alex Osborne's method: First intensely study the problem & take 3 to 5 stabs at solving it. Then cease all related study. Letting ideas stew or incubate in your brain without even thinking about them often results in \"eureka\" during a quiet spell weeks or months later - on the loo, in a bath, while dozing or gently cuddling. f. Here are some important procedures: Blast then refine ideas, don't nibble at trivia. Don't be a hermit - ask ask ask, you don\u2019t live long enough to try everything. Have a \u201cconstructive discontent\u201d & doubt. Always invent at least 3 superb approaches to every problem - the simplest, cheapest, most reliable & best efficient solution invariably takes longest to perfect - thus never give up unless ultimately PROVEN hopeless. Use \"industrial standard products\" (try not to manufacture any components or subassemblies yourself = too expensive). Finally, inventors are seldom if ever critical of their own work even eschewing making working models - in case proven a failure. So set up a design brainstorming group, often the only way to solve problems. It's not a competition. Record every suggestion however weird, without any analysis or criticism (until much later) & be critical of no one\u2019s ideas at informal relaxed meetings, else they dry up. Beginners wondering what best subject to assist their inventing skills in most fields should consider general physics (rather than the more restrictive engineering) + maths + value analysis. Let me freely help if anyone gets stuck! Schools and colleges are most reluctant to venture into creative fields, however vital perhaps because, to quote Einstein, \"we can't solve a problem with the same thinking that caused it\". Thus education should concentrate on teaching: fixing + making + growing (edible jungle) + inventing + small business + frugality + survival... Beaut schemes to practice creativity include thinking of 50 uses for a house brick - most folk only see about 5-10 uses. Or observe something strange, such as a bulldozer digging up some rail station & try to figure why, however crazy seem your\u2019s or your group's answers! Computer card game FreeCell that my 81year colleague is obsessed (d age 87) with since playing over 3000 games in 3years (near 10,000 at death), has enabled her to become real sharp, focused, greatly memory enhanced & forward thinking - I\u2019ve only done everyone of 2000 undertaken. Try them! Aussie inventors are up against the marketing disease of parasitic colonial apathy - waiting for a pseudo big brother to tell society when & what to buy through sheer expensive hyping. Not unlike early days when Aussie pop groups went overseas for years to be acceptable here. Not much short time luck without first hyping the public into how to wisely buy our credible products - or secretly making devices ourselves & then selling them. Inventing & business is generally a conflict of interest & emotional head-bashing. If inventors have to waste vast time or be conned by Agents-Lawyers out of $1000s to get some gadget to market, they usually entirely lose their creativity, particularly as said agent should know the market perfectly & so offer his services free apart from future Royalties. Most inventors like Sarich (orbital engine) come up with few good new ideas per lifetime. There's no reason you can't create several great concepts per month as I do - especially if you're not forever preoccupied and stresses re lacking $$$s. Near-self-sufficient frugal living helps enormously. All through daily life you can be honing up creativity by continually designing & applying radically better ways for doing homey budget-saving things. This I've titled Sustainable Home Engineering - it's massively job-creating. Sadly, albeit curiously, Australian & many other world \"experts\" have a long history of evolving solutions which are the most: Pollutant, Environmentally Unfriendly, Short-lived, Complex, Unpopular, Costly to Build & Maintain, Inefficient & with the Least Mean-time-between-failures. Superior benign sustainable solutions per capita are vastly cheaper, though often require a lot more thought. Why bother patenting in this country - nobody's interested in your product? I can't even give 100s of inventions away that I find vitally useful!! Less than 0.2% patents break even - or someone nicks them here or overseas! Who can sue IBM? Why waste hard-earned funds on an expensive lottery? Enjoy improving inventive skills instead. Only a micro or cottage industry can make loads of cash by quickly & secretly getting in & out of your own production run with a continuous series of un-patented vital products. Alternatively, as we do, publish or sell plans/kits - then nobody else can patent. Or simply use and demonstrate a device for your own purpose to help live vastly cheaper sustainably! g. FIXING - MAKING: Whereas my Chem Prof photographic-memory bro (d) needed to be shown how to fix a particular toaster for instance, but couldn\u2019t fix a different toaster without being shown, 2013 Wife Dinah & I as Inventors simply Invent how to fix or make such, rather than ever be shown. h. Highly recommend you visit 4-page Dementia file in Happy Health folder to help improve mind, observation, memory, logic, reasoning etc. I\u2019m 85 & never been so creatively inventing. i. DAD\u2019S ONLY GOOD ADVICE, 1949s: Exercise your Powers of Observation - EYPOO - as all good Inventors should. Have fun as an extremely positive-attitude lateral thinker that most things are possible - including miracles because that's what has to be! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- However if U wish to know how to handle School or Uni Maths etc teaching, soon learnt from our professor & guessed the remainder to: Learn the lesson 2 to 3 weeks ahead of time. Don\u2019t simply do book problems assigned, but do every problem in the book. Work hard till 1 or 2 each morning; study weekends; + on all holidays; forget about socialising until graduated. I was so dumb & school told me that I was so low IQ that never go to Uni (but I desperately wanted to get into AeroSpace work, Robots & Electronics - which I did for years). School twice told me join the army, be a cop or train driver, or be a powder monkey. Only recently have I found that all their suggestions were guesses not based on fact!!! Yet now here are a few of my letters of an Independent self-subsidised well-published peer-reviewed Researcher: 85yo Born World Environment Day!, DSc & PhD American, BSc in Math & Physics 1955 Sydney Uni, Fellow-British Interplanetary Soc, Hon Fellows-Inventors Assoc of Australia, Member-IEEE, M-MSSANZ, M-ANZSES, Ecologist, Medical Researcher, Scientist, Electro-Mech Engineer, Value Engineer, Mathematician, Physicist... I Invented & Discovered 5,470 registered items (1/3rd most prolific in the world) + over 750 publications, books etc. Thomas Edison had 6,000 (but only on a few subjects & I\u2019m not dead yet) ",
