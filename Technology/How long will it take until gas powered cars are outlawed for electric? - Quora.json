            "answer_text": "In the US it will be unlikely to happen. What will happen is that ir will be difficult to find fuel in 30\u201340 years or so, and so daily driving a gasoline car will take real planning, and only the diehards will try. The storage tanks have a limited life, they have to be dug up and replaced every 20\u201330 years depending on local regulations. Eventually the volume of gasoline sold will not warrant the cost of the replacement. The tanks will come out and not return. Gasoline will be like racing fuel today, you buy it in a can at the track. In Europe the answer is clearer. Various countries have set dates where they will not issue registrations for new internal combustion cars. The most common date mentioned is 2030. Norway is leading the pack, while not yet banning IC cars, they tax them at much higher rates. The country is now approaching 50% EV in their passenger fleet. ",

            "answer_text": "My non-expert predictions from the UK. This is related only to personal transport, not to goods vehicles: 2020 - older and more polluting ICE vehicles start to be prohibitively taxed when entering urban centres. This is already happening right now in central London2025 - very difficult to buy a brand new pure ICE car (ie. you have to buy hybrid or electric)2030 - very difficult to buy a brand new non-electric car. 2032 is already the Scottish government target for electric only for new cars2040 - UK ban on new non-electric cars (some ambiguity on whether this will include hybrids or not. I suspect not). Suspect this will get accelerated to 2035.Existing ICE cars will never be banned. They will just be made prohibitively expensive to drive on public roads via the tax system. ",
