            "answer_text": "Good Day Sohail. What primitive tribe have you been living in for the past 100 & some odd years? Are there NO televisions or the Internet? I\u2019ve \u201ccopied & pasted\u201d a small excerpt from \u201cA Brief History of Holography\u201d that I hope will satisfy your curiosity. After reading the following excerpt, I suspect you may be surprised in regards to how long this technology has been around: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the invention of the LASER that true three dimensional holograms as you see today became a practical reality. A laser creates pure waves of light that march in phase like a marching band. These waves are said to be coherent. A coherent light makes it possible to record the light wave interference patterns of holography. Albert Einstein first theorized about the process which makes lasers possible called \u201cStimulated Emission\u201d in 1917. The idea of the laser was first published in 1958 by Arthur Shawlow and Charles Townes who were working at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ. Theodore Maiman built the first working ruby laser in 1960 while working at Hughes Research Laboratories in Mailbu, California. This was closely followed by Ali Javan who invented the first gas laser, the Helium-Neon laser in December 1960 at Bell Labs. In 1963, Robert Hall, invented the semiconductor injection laser, known today as laser diodes, while working for General Electric laboratories in Schenectady, New York. However, in 1977, the US Patent Office awarded the basic patent for the laser to Gordon Gould, a doctoral student at Columbia University under Charles Townes, based on his idea from 1957. He didn\u2019t apply for a patent until 1959 on bad legal advice, but after 20 years of court cases he ultimately prevailed. He was the first person to coin the word LASER, which stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.  Holography came into being long before the laser was invented. Back in 1886 in France, Gabriel Lippmann developed a theory of using light wave interference to capture color in photography. He coated mercury on the back side of glass photographic plates to act as a mirror and bounce the light waves back through the emulsion and create wave interference. In 1891 he presented this theory along with some primitive examples of his interference color photographs to the Academy of Sciences. He was able to present perfect color photographs made by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers to the Academy in 1893. It was in 1894 that he published his complete theory. Lippmann won a Nobel Prize for Physics in 1908 based on this work. While head of the Physics Department at the Sorbonne, Lippmann was the thesis adviser to a Polish woman named Maria Sklodowska allowing her to use his lab for her work. He was so impressed that he introduced her to one of his best students, Pierre Curie, whom she later married. Marie Curie went on to become the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 along with her husband and Professor Antoine Henri Becquerel only two years after the Nobel Foundation was established, for their joint research on the radiation phenomena, and later in 1911 she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of radium and polonium. Like Einstein who did poorly at times in school and Edison, who was considered addle headed by his teacher and taken out of school, Lippmann had not been an outstanding student. He had neglected work that did not interest him. In fact, he failed the examination that would have qualified him as a teacher.\u201d I hope you now come to realize that not only does \u201cholography technology exist\u201d Sohail, but it\u2019s been around for quite some time. Thanks for your time & interest. ",

Yes, a hologram does not have to be a floating image at 1 meter from the ground it can also be like this: Euro / Billete / Holograma / Europa | SD Stock Video 894-759-965 | Framepool & RightSmith Stock Footage But if you want to make a hologram follow any of the videos that come on youtube and you'll see ...
