            "answer_text": "Well, there are dozens of use cases for AI in any business, regardless of its type or domain. Considering my personal experience, here are some ideas on how it can be used in sales specifically:  1. Sales process automation, e.g. updating data in your CRM, scheduling meetings, sorting through your inbox, and following up on prospects. 2. Lead scoring - tell the potential customers from the leads that are not going to convert any time soon based on the data about the past sales as well as activity log for each specific prospect (and do so at scale, assessing thousands of prospect profiles per minute while it would take days if not weeks for a human sales rep to do the same). 3. Guided selling - help you pick the optimal strategy for each audience segment and craft more sophisticated experiences through relevant products and services suggestions, or by suggesting actions based on the prospect\u2019s previous activity, behavior, and the context in general. 4. Sales intelligence - analyze your sales call transcripts, both successful and failed, and optimize your sales strategy, predict buying behavior and help you better manage demand and reduce churn, create more effective cross/up-selling offers, identify your prospect needs and help you anticipate them. 5. Sales forecasting - accurately predict buying behavior, help you better manage demand, make better strategic decisions, establish realistic, data-backed KPIs, and adjust your sales strategy taking into account your current business needs and challenges.

No dumb VCs whose goal is only to maximise shareholder profits, No Corporate buildings with fake smile advertisements , No promo codes or Team politics, or fooling people with ultrafast blood diagnostics. Interprise is a direct pure form of commerce between the producer and the consumer. A techno-barter system. The individual human needs are accurately identified and transmitted to producers who can produce things with less effort , all supervised by artificial intelligence. Newer experiences are shared where rewards can go beyond basic forms of exchange like money and take various forms like art tokens etc using block chain. No more middle men . Only real skills will matter and there is less scope for creating fake value castles in the air ( like the land / hard disk rates that keep fluctuating ) ",
