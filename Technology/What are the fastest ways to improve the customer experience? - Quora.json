            "answer_text": "Hey there \ud83d\udc4b Customer service representatives perform tons of routine tasks every day. Do you agree that having to answer the same basic questions over and over again is frustrating? I would say it can drive anyone crazy, and your agents aren\u2019t an exception. While your team of agents could be tackling complex issues, chatbots can spend most of their working time providing info about working hours, pricing, and password recovery, etc. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a significant inefficiency to waste human time and money on requests like: \u201cHow do I make an order?\u201d, \u201cWhere can I find the closest store?\u201d. Chatbots are one of the ways for Customer Service to automate and boost the workflow and create better CX. How to improve Customer Service with Chatbots: 1. Chatbots can learn many languages, expressions, words, and phrases to meet your client's needs across the globe. 2. Customer Service gets tons of repetitive requests. Chatbots can automate up to 80% of FAQs to give customer service agents more time for more complex tasks. 3. Chatbots can be built for many different messengers, websites, voice assistants, and they support mobile and desktop devices. 4. Chatbots work 24/7/365. They don\u2019t get sick or go on vacation, they are always ready to meet your clients at any time of the day or night. 5. Chatbots let businesses save up to 30% by automating routine tasks. 6. Chatbot reply instantly making sure that you won\u2019t lose the prospect 7. Customers today want a self-service. Most of the clients that contact Customer Service have already tried finding the info on its own, so you can use chatbots as an interactive knowledge base that allows customers to answer their questions on their own. 8. There is nothing worse than making customers repeat their issue multiple times to your different customer service reps. You can use chatbots to communicate with your clients, collect information, gather it in reports, and route the call to the right agent. 9. Chatbots help to keep the conversation going. If the client got distracted from the conversation with the bot, they can come back later and continue the same conversation without having to start over and explain the same thing again. 10. Using speech recognition, chatbots can understand customers\u2019 emotions and take actions based on that. For example, if an angry customer contacts the support, the chatbot can recognize the emotion and connect the client to the support agent faster. The chatbot can give customer service reps \u201chints\u201d of customers\u2019 moods and emotions to help agents understand the context and give customers a more personal approach.

            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t have a business without customers. It\u2019s as simple as that. Having a good customer relationship is the company\u2019s priority. But in order to transform one-time buyers into loyal customers for your business, you must understand what it takes to gain their loyalty. The customer is the one contributing the most to the company\u2019s success. As a business, you can\u2019t simply deliver good products with a smile on your face and expect them to do business with you forever. Customers today need to feel wanted and appreciated by the businesses they buy from. That\u2019s why improving your company\u2019s relationships with customers should always be your top priority. One of the best ways to provide an unforgettable customer experience is to engage the customer in the process. Highly engaged customers buy more, promote more, and demonstrate more loyalty. Providing a high-quality customer experience is an important component in your customer engagement strategy.  Keeping the customers engaged can be done in so many ways: Developing emotional connections. Showing the human side of the company by using team member images on social media or developing brand ambassadors. Building a community or forum where users can directly interact and exchange their feedback as well as get informed of the latest updates of the company. Innovating with the customers. Co-creation online or by holding a contest or hosting an event where the customers can participate and feel like part of the company. As the author, professional speaker and management expert Kenneth Blanchard explains in his book \u201cRaving Fans\u201d, there is one thing to keep in mind \u2013 \u201cJust having satisfied customers isn\u2019t good enough anymore. If you really want a booming business, you have to create raving fans.\u201d -Kenneth H. Blanchard  I believe raving fans are better than any type of internet marketing. They are contagious in the best way. If you inspire your company\u2019s culture to expect nothing less than creating raving customers, it will put the needed weight on customer service and how you interact with your customers. Using a costumer-centric approach, priorities are: the customer is an integral part of the system for value creationthe customer can influence where, when, and how value is generatedthe customer can compete with companies for value extractionthere are multiple points of exchange where the consumer and the company can co-create valueWhen brands provide their audiences and customers with memorable experiences, their customers want to shout about it from the mountain top. They want to post their photos on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Someone choose to check into Foursquare and tweet to their friends. They want to tell the story. Everyone wants to share the experience so that others can come along for the virtual ride and get a taste of what it felt like. If you are a marketer or a business leader wanting to create memorable brand experiences, I encourage you to start with the heart. Keep it simple. Put yourself in the head and heart of your ideal customer. What do you want them to feel like? What do you want them to remember? That is the first step to achieving great customer experience! ",
