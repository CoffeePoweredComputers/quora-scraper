            "answer_text": "I have none. A hypothesis is something that can be tested and is falsifiable. When it comes to the mind, that's hard to do. But even without factoring that in, I simply don\u2019t know. Based on the science we have so far, it looks to me to be a function of the brain, and nothing more. The brain is matter and energy, and matter and energy follows rules. It's for this reason that I think we don't have any scientific reason to believe in true free will, at least in the way it is typically thought of. But as I just mentioned, science of the mind is tricky and we\u2019re limited on what we can really test. So maybe my opinion is based on biased information in a way. I know that I would LIKE to believe there is more to it than that. And sometimes I do feel like there is subjective evidence that it could be, but unless I can find a way to turn that subjective experience into objective evidence, I don\u2019t feel like I can believe it.

            "answer_text": "Elementary arithmetic. It emulates all computations, including those supporting \u201cL\u00f6bian-G\u00f6del self-referential machines\u201d which eventually understand that the physical reality is given by a relative measure on all computations. In that case, the logic of the observable is given by a variant of Plotinus theory of Matter (and can be justified through thought experience). Up to know it fits with quantum logic. It also provides a natural non sharable and non justifiable extension which might explains the qualia. It has been the subject of my Phd thesis. To sum up: there is no \u201cworld\u201d, just a universal dreamer lost in a labyrinth of dreams, which exists in arithmetic once we assume a very weak form of Digital Mechanism in the cognitive science. Note that it does not make the physical reality, nor consciousness entirely computable. On the contrary, those notion borrows a large part of the \u201carithmetical truth\u201d, known to escape largely its computable part. ",
