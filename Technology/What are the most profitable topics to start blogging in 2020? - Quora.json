            "answer_text": "This will depend on how much it has cost so far to be trained to a sufficient technical level and then to pay for the equipment and various accessories required for going online as well as safeguarding yourself online. So if we write down a long list of items before we even get a website for a blog we will see that the profit we get out of all this must be more than what we put in. I'm not counting what our parents put in to get us through our educational years before we even start work. I'm counting what we personally paid for with our own money not theirs or from anybody else. It's not always possible to pay others back before we start earning and getting through our first few years doing just that. Are we supposed to include our mortgage or our rent or our payments for antivirus software as well as our computer and printer and printer inks and stationery and so on? Did they appear out of thin air? If we say that the first \u00a31,000 or first $1,000 can't be regarded as genuine profit, then can we realistically expect any blog to get more income? In some cases we can because others have done so. However, their ways may be available to us if we imitate their successes. If we fail, then maybe we keep our computer and so on, or sell these to get some money to try elsewhere.:I've seen blogs that use an abundance of links that go to other websites to gain some partnership payments, but once away from the blog, what then? Will we create enough on-going content to keep our first-time visitors? If not, we lose out big time. So some blog owners sell on their own blogs and keep visitors there as long as possible. Usually that means discount prices rather than big single-buy profitable products being sold. So it may be of interest using pinterest the images website as that provides many images with tricks and tips for blogs and getting our profits increased due to more visitors each year. We'd hardly be likely to think short-term concerning anything profitable.:So if I were interested in adding promotional adverts and links then I'd be OK with these as the starting point, yet I'd also be thinking of creating an online store or an eBay store to provide profits but I'd see these as merely maintaining the costs of being online until creating above and beyond the usual costs.:There is another point of view. The profit of simply doing what's good or what's right. If we consider how some businesses operate it gets complicated. Some want massive profits by overcharging. Some want modest profits by being competitive and some merely want to stay in business offering the best budget deals possible just to help their customers that little bit more. If we look at the spiritual blessings that God has in store for us then maybe we'll no longer think like Scrooge used to do and think like he did when he became a better man.:If we create a well-loved brand name and little profits then maybe that's exactly what God really wanted for us. Prosperity preaching seen on Gospel TV shows doesn't seem to point us in that direction. It's like we can get maximum profits without any responsibilities being involved. We can sell stuff with minimum warranty cover rather than an extended one meant to bless our customers. So maybe it's wise to consider what we wish to do in regard to any real profits. Would we promote a company that overcharges for goods when others are clearly better elsewhere online or in our local High Street stores? If money is all we care about then there's no limit on our choices. If spiritual matters concern us, then we're more discerning about what we're earning.:http://www.pinterest.comhttp://www.ebay.comhttp://www.blogger.com: ",
