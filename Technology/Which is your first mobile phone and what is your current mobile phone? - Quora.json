            "answer_text": "Allow me to take you on a journey through my history with cell phones. It is amazing the difference between start and finish. My first cell phone. The Motorola MicroTAC 650. This baby was top of the line! I was the cool guy with a giant freaking phone strapped to my side. It was so big that it also doubled as a defensive weapon and could stop a small caliber bullet.  I had that bad boy until the next most awesome phone came out. The legendary StarTAC. It was so tiny, everyone was amazed that a phone could be that small. And look at that display! 3 line LCD! HELLO CALLER ID! I had both the digital and analog versions of the phone.  Next up was the Nokia 918. Otherwise known as one of the indestructible Nokia phones. This thing could take a beating, and was the first cell phone I owned that had a decent battery.  After pocket dialing the 10,000th person, I switched back to flip phones. The Motorola V60 had just been released and boy was it a nice phone. Well, except that it was overly rigid and snapped like a twig. I guess I was just used to having a phone you could run over with a tank. Nokia spoiled me.  The Motorola t720 was the follow up to the v60 and was a big improvement. It finally had a color screen that could display pictures. It was awesome to be able to set my own background on my phone.  Next was the Motorola v810. Again just an update of the last phone I had. But this one had a freaking CAMERA on it.  From there, I went with smart phones I had an HP iPAQ 6500. Man that thing was a piece of crap. I can\u2019t fault them too badly, though. It was one of the first attempts at a smart phone, but the watered down version of Windows that ran on it was worthless.  Next I got an HTC Mogul. This was a significant step up in technology. It was better than the iPAQ in every way.  Next came the Helio Ocean. 10 bonus points to anyone who still even remembers Helio. I only do because I worked for them. Still, it was a sweet phone and ahead of its time in many ways.  From then on, until this writing, I have had nothing but the HTC ONE series. They\u2019re all basically the same phone, just faster and a better camera. The HTC ONE MAX - Freaking 6.5 inch screen. It was a monster  HTC ONE M8- My current phone.  I\u2019ll be picking up my HTC 10 in a few weeks. It will never cease to amaze me that there is but 20 years between the first and last phone. My first cell phone could only make about a 30 minute call without draining the battery and could only make phone calls. No caller ID, no frills. Just a phone. Now, I have a device that I barely use as a phone, it\u2019s an all in one personal entertainment center. We really do live in the future. ",

Good enough for 15 year old me.Nokia 3310 - everybody had it, so I had to have it too. And it had Snake II!Nokia 6510 - my mother gave it to me because she said it was small (it was tiny). Had FM radio capabilities.Nokia 6610i - my first colour screen phone. Also my first camera phone (VGA quality).Nokia N-Gage QD - bought it for its gaming capability, and I remember spending hours playing Colin McRae Rally 2 on this. Subsequently lost it after I left it at an ATM machineNokia 3650/Nokia 3660 - bought both second hand as a replacement to the N-Gage QD. Not that interesting.Motorola L6 - a less capable version of the Motorola Slvr L7, and very thin. Was my father\u2019s. He didn\u2019t like it so he gave it to me.Nokia 6680 - 3G network was first introduced in Malaysia around 2005, and by 2006 I just had to be the first with 3G to do video calling (the 3650 can do video calling, but it only has a rear camera). It was a fad and I got bored of the phone rather quickly.Sony Ericsson W800i - my first Sony Ericsson & the reason I turned my back on Nokia. Bought it to replace my iPod which was stolen.Sony Ericsson K800i - replacement of the W800i. Used by James Bond in Casino Royale. Very good camera.Sony Ericsson P1i - my first grown up phone. It has WiFi, e-mail, organizer etc. By this time I\u2019ve stopped replacing my phone like every year & used this phone around 2 years before I misplaced it when I was interning at an ad agency.Nokia 5800 - one last fling with Nokia. Installed an iPhone-esque theme because the iPhone wasn\u2019t officially in Malaysia at that time & grey imports were hideously expensive.iPhone 3GS - finally, the iPhone is in! Bought it on contract & used it for two years.iPhone 4S - also bought it on contract. Took it the first time I went to America. Used it as a phone for three years (and I still used it as a GPS receiver the second time I went to America, in 2016).iPhone 6 - didn\u2019t buy it on contract. Bought the phone just before they jacked the price up in 2015 due to the introduction of GST in Malaysia. Battery however worn out rapidly & I had to replace it after just a year of use.Samsung Galaxy S8 - my first Android. Samsung was the client of the ad agency I was working for as a freelancer so I had advance knowledge before the launch. Found it pretty interesting so I jumped ahead and bought the phone. Haven\u2019t had a problem at all for the past few months that I\u2019ve been using it - in fact I\u2019m using it for far more things than my previous iPhone, thanks to the expandable memory.",
