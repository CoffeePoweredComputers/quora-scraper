            "answer_text": "According to the latest news from Apple's supply chain, the iPhone 11 series may become Apple's last generation of 4G phones, because Apple will launch the 5G version of the iPhone next year. It means that if the iPhone 11 is purchased this year, the iPhone 11 will be depreciated sharply after the widespread use of the 5G network next year.  According to some news, the 5G version of the iPhone will use the Qualcomm X55 signal baseband next year, so Apple will give Qualcomm higher licensing fees, and the internals of the 5G iPhone need to be redesigned, so it is expected that the price of 5G iPhone will rise about $150 next year. From the current stage, the iPhone 11 series starts at \u00a5699, so after the price rises by $150, it means that the starting price of the 5G iPhone next year will be $849.  Although the price of the 5G iPhone is very high, users can't enjoy the stable 5G service. Because Apple uses the Qualcomm X55 signal baseband solution, the battery life of the 5G iPhone may be worse. After all, the battery capacity of the iPhone is small. If the 5G chip is added, the battery capacity of the 5G iPhone will be further reduced, and the battery life is difficult to guarantee. If you want to get one iPhone but have not much budget to buy a new iPhone, and you are waiting for a 5G iPhone. You can choose to buy a used or refurbished iPhone. Actually, now the second-hand market is very popular, you can find many second-hand mobile phone wholesale platform like Merkandi, eSources, Wakephone. Or some second-hand mobile phone retail platform like CellphoneAge, Backmarket. Used and refurbished iPhone is cheaper and the performance is good as new iPhone, this is why more and more people would like to buy a used and refurbished iPhone. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s leave out gossip and rumors, and look at history instead. The original iPhone did not support 3G, a standard that was starting to show up in that year\u2019s phones. 3G support came with the iPhone 3G, the following year. LTE/4G started getting test deployments in 2009, and major rollouts in 2011. Apple\u2019s first LTE iPhone was the iPhone 5 in late 2012. The first implementations of a cell network technology typically require a separate set of chips and antennas inside the phone; this adds bulk, eats power, and runs hot. This was true of 3G, it was true of 4G/LTE, and it\u2019s true of 5G now. Historically, Apple has always waited to support a new network generation until the tech settled down, and could be used without a high price in heat, bulk and battery life. This usually took about a year after the first bleeding-edge products shipped. I expect the same thing this time around; shipping in the 2020 iPhones if the engineers can tame the tech by then, otherwise in 2021. (Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it doesn\u2019t come until 2021. 5G deployment is very spotty and inconsistent as of late 2019, and there have been very few phones with 5G support; this is still very early in the 5G lifecycle.)
