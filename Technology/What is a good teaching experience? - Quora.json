            "answer_text": "The truth is that learning is a powerful and innate human ability. Of all the books I have read I would recommend \"How to Teach without Instructing: 29 Smart Rules for Educators\" by Rolf Arnold. this book supports the notion of moving away from instruction. And as a teacher this is what I have done over time. Moving towards the role of a \"facilitator\" who increases the competence, confidence, and capabilities of students in student centered environments. Teachers fail because of this all or nothing approach. Of course you need to get your students to experience the learning themselves, but you also have to teach them the content. Direct instruction and laboratory activity go together but are not always done together. This idea that it has to be all laboratory and no lecture is causing students to get frustrated because they do not have the proper background to succeed in the laboratory. I think that creating learning experiences (at least for me) is always accompanied by some level of direct instruction. I think that a complete reliance on direct instruction is potentially detrimental, and I agree with your sentiments to that end. A great teacher does not need to \"maneuver the students\" or \"stack the deck\".Rather, s/he just needs to love and have completely knowledge of the subject, see the world through those eyes, and love showing what s/he sees to the students. In a word, a great teacher ... inspires. The role of the teacher is very important. But it has consistently been shown that the quality of the teacher is the most important single factor. And, faced with a complex mix of learning styles, the single most effective teaching technique is lecture. It is great to see some controversy about Education, because it\u2019s a messy business. But we all already knew that! Back in 2013 I\u2019ve read a Wonderfully and insightful article by Prof. Johnson! It was an epiphany, and yes indeed, it just came to me like that!!. At that time, I was seeking a Master's in Education and also doing my student teaching grade 9,10, 11th Working in South Central LA in a Dual immersion Spanish /English program. After reading The experiences of Prof. Johnson, I understood, what I need it to be doing with my teaching development and techniques. I really appreciate how an article like that helped me to focus on what is essential to being an effective teacher. I still have problems with my lesson plans in that I still concentrate on lecturing to students rather than letting them be active learners. Even when doing group activities, I sometimes try to micro-manage and don't let students experience learning on their own. This article was a brilliant reminder that I need to let go and trust students to use their own inquisitive nature to learn. I emphasized in here on how important it\u2019s to encourage student engagement. Students won't learn if they aren't interested in the material and that also requires that teachers get to know their students. This was a great awakening time because it has placed me in the right path of self reflection, to analyze things through so I can improve, develop and grow on my current and future teaching practices. Have you ever read any books, or any articles that had impacted you in such an enlightened manner that you felt as if you just had awaken from a long, foggy and confusing dream? Indeed, students learn best when they are in control of their learning. In my own classroom instruction, I have found that students get the most from my teaching when they are involved in the sort of \"dialogic\" engagement that Paulo Friere popularized. Prof. Johnson's reference to Dewey and experiential learning resonates as well. I appreciate the refresher offered on his book on the way in which students learn best (by doing and reflecting) and the way they learn least (by listening and watching). My current interest is in the teaching of history in particular. With a background in performance studies, I am developing a method in which students become storytellers and embody the historical figures for whom they are studying. (They adopt the style of the old time \"Chautauqua\" presentations in a big-top tent.) In addition to the performance itself, student scholar/performers engage their audience of classmates in Q&A--in character. Many thanks,to all the teacher readers in here; since talking about teaching methodology is so diverse among the educational and pedagogical world, it will serve as a fine reinforcement for my own engagement with teaching. I Would enjoy hearing from others who may have thoughts on alternative ways of teaching Spanish and English in a bilingual education program or dual immersion program. Keep up the good conversation!
