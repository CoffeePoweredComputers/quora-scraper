Signs of a far more advanced civilization than ours, but none of its members?\u201d Okay, so when you lead off with \u201cSERIOUS\u201d\u2026 that doesn\u2019t help tamp down the giggle factor. Just sayin\u2019\u2026 But if we give this one a fair shake? First off, the ruins would have to be fairly well protected, likely entirely subterranean given that most of that planet has been radar-mapped by the NASA MRO. Let\u2019s go with that as we explore those ruins\u2026 We\u2019re going to have questions, but the short term response would be something along the lines of: HOLY CRAP! ALIENS! ON MARS! WE\u2019RE NOT ALONE! Okay, we\u2019re alone now, but there USED TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE! AND THEY MIGHT\u2019VE BEEN SMARTER THAN US! -Humanity As we take a moment to ponder it all, we\u2019re looking for a few key points from explorers in those ruins: First and foremost, was this civilization native to Mars or did they come from a Foreign star system?A close second: how long ago did they exist? Did that time overlap with the rise of humanity on earth?Is there any indication what the conditions were on Mars at the time?Given the conditions on earth have been reasonably hospitable for some time, is there any indication why this advanced civilization didn\u2019t also colonize earth? OR DID THEY?! (this one will get a bit of traction\u2026)What evidence do we find to indicate that it was a \u201cfar more advanced civilization\u201d?Is there any record of their science and engineering that can be learned or otherwise understood by our science?What terminated that civilization\u2019s presence on Mars?Ultimately, these answers will shape the long-term human response. Any way you cut it, humans will likely reach for the stars. ",

            "answer_text": "We would study the ruins and try to determine a number of things, the most important of which is why they died off. We would likely discover some alien technology or designs and would reverse engineer them here on Earth. Such technology could destabilize our balance of power one way or another. We also might bring back microbes that are deadly to us or perhaps helpful. From a religious point of view, this would create issues as to whether the alien god or gods was superior to human gods and so forth. All in all, some change would come from this discovery, depending upon the actual value and amount of the technology and writings we could read from this dead civilization. ",
