            "answer_text": "Roku is a line of digital media players manufactured by American company Roku, Inc. The devices offer access to streaming media content from various online services. The line was introduced in May 2008 with its first model, developed in collaboration with Netflix. Hulu is an American subscription video on demand service fully controlled and majority-owned by Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International, a business segment of The Walt Disney Company, with NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast, as an equity stakeholder. It\u2019s two different things, so you can\u2019t compare it. I recommend you to get XOOMTV if you want to stream all your favorite shows from different streaming providers in HD. ",
