            "answer_text": "This reminds me of the following excerpt of my book, The Future of Healthcare: Humans and Machines Partnering for Better Outcomes: It\u2019s not just oncologists that could be at risk of automation. After all, writers have a 33% chance of losing their jobs to automation within the next two decades[1], and Google\u2019s DeepMind has already developed AI that can use its \u201cimagination\u201d. According to the company\u2019s researchers, the Imagination-Augmented Agents (I2As) uses an \u201cimagination encoder\u201d to make predictions about their environment. When applied to puzzle games, the I2As outperformed regular AIs to a significant degree, but we\u2019re a long way away from omnipotent and omniscient AIs coming to subjugate the human race.[2] But I doubt it will be as bad as that. AI is highly skilled at certain specialized tasks, but we won\u2019t see the software taking over jobs that are fundamentally human. Don\u2019t just take my word for it \u2013 take it from Neil deGrasse Tyson. In a stunning YouTube video in partnership with Mashable, the celebrated astrophysicist weighed in on the debate of whether to send robots or people into space. Tyson believes that it\u2019s an irrelevant question. Here\u2019s what he said:[3] Split the question into two parts. Are you only interested in scientific discovery? Send robots. It's cheaper. You don't have to bring them home. If you only care about science then there's no rational reason to send humans, really. For the cost of sending a human, you can send 100 robots. And robots are getting better, smaller, cheaper, faster, smarter, all of the above. But here's the catch. I've never seen a ticker tape parade for a robot. I've never seen a high school named after a robot. I never saw a kid read a book about a robot and say, gee, I wanna be that robot one day. There's value in human inspiration. It's less tangible than the scientific results of an experiment. It's more emotional. It's more philosophical. It's more cultural. It's more human. And humans can deduce things way faster and more intuitively than robots can, at least for now. We can see something we've never seen before and then interpret it. Computers currently only think the way we've programmed them to think. Take a robot and take a human and have them confront something they've never seen before. Whose analysis are you gonna want first? It's gonna be the human analysis, at least for now. Maybe the day will come when robots will be smarter than humans. But it's very hard to program a robot with curiosity for something it\u2019s never seen before. How to process information it knows nothing about. And if you program a robot that has consciousness and curiosity, is it even ethical to send that robot on a space mission with no intent of ever bringing it back? Are you killing a sentient being? So maybe there's a whole frontier we have yet to breach. At first, that may sound like it has little to do with the world of artificial intelligence in healthcare, but many of the same arguments apply. Picture a future in which healthcare technology has progressed to the point at which human doctors are irrelevant. Would you rather receive a devastating diagnosis from a human or from a robot? And how many people would prefer to be operated on by a human surgeon instead of a robot \u2013 even if the robotic operation was statistically less likely to lead to complications? We\u2019re entering a period of history in which a new type of ethics is coming to the forefront. If AI progresses to the point at which it\u2019s indistinguishable from a human, should it have the same rights? For the technology to continue to progress, we may need a ratified bill of rights for AI software that\u2019s designed to protect friendly AI while shutting down unfriendly AI for the greater good of the world as a whole.[4]  [1] See: Will a robot take your job?

            "answer_text": "Which jobs are least likely to be replaced by automation? I think jobs with these characteristics will be safe for a long time: Jobs with lots of different possible scenarios. Examples are cops, entrepreneurs, Sr. Managers, CEOs, soldiers, doctors, nurses, engineers, scientific researchers, etc. They face an ever-changing landscape of problems and opportunities. It\u2019s hard to program for something that is currently unknown and unforeseen. Jobs requiring a high degree of creativity. We can\u2019t really teach people or computers how to be creative because we don\u2019t yet know how it works. It\u2019s hard to pick examples of such jobs. Many so-called creative jobs like various writers are really just tweaking old formulas. But some, like developing and designing the first iPhone require very high end creativity. Technical craftsman jobs (electrician, plumber, heat & air techs, etc.) are hard for robots because there are too many possible scenarios. Imagine programming a robot to find and repair a problem in a piece of new equipment you have never seen before and you don\u2019t have manuals or blueprints. Added to the complexity is the physical part of craft work. To fix, repair, install means you have to do stuff with your hands and with a wide variety of tools, machinery, and materials. In other words, these jobs require great versatility. Machines don\u2019t do versatility well. Jobs that can\u2019t be done in one place. This may sound strange, but it is easier to automate something that is normally done in one place like at a desk or in a driver\u2019s seat. It is hard to automate or robotize a job that requires a person to travel, to be in lots of different unknown, unforeseen places, to catch planes or climb towers or ladders, or make sales calls. You also need to know that your job can go away for reasons other than a robot. Simple, non-robot automation and new work structures can make jobs go away. The most common way jobs go away is when something happens that allows one person to do the job previously done by many. This can be as simple as a new piece of software. I will also say that historically, new technology is over-hyped. Predictors tend to overestimate how quickly it will take hold and overestimate its impact or capabilities. Take this into consideration as you plan. ",
