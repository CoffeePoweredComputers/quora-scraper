Having a clear vision regarding the target group, enhance the success ratio of an app.Mobile platforms and devices to be supported \u2013 Mobile platforms and devices should be selected keeping in mind hardware performance, battery life, ruggedness and required peripherals. Certain factors that needs to be considered while selecting mobile platforms and devices includes coverage, device support, performance and other features.Revenue model \u2013 The app market is booming like never before. To ensure this resource and generate revenue , app developer need to select appropriate approach in accordance with the app. There are different models of generating revenue from mobile applications which include paid applications, separate app and in-app freemiums, advertisements, subscription and pay per download.These techniques can be employed to generate revenue. However, the developer\u2019s approach has to be in accordance with the application. It is highly essential for the developer to attract the user and spend money on the various aspects of the application. At this point you should also think about your finances, how much money you wish to set aside for the development, marketing and eventual release of your app. Here\u2019s a quick guide to the approximate costs for developing an app. Step 3: Design your app  Designing your app is yet another significant factor responsible for success of an app in the market. Remember, a good UX design and good UI-UX means good discoverability. An app developer should concentrate on the UI design, multi-touch gestures for touch-enabled devices and consider platform design standards as well. Today, emphasis is on the UI design of an app as it plays a crucial role in the success of an app. A number of drag and drop app builders are available in the market. Designing an app is becoming increasingly popular as it create an instant impact on the mind of the user while ensuring usability of an app. If you need to look at common mobile design patterns, you can look into: \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0434 - Android App Patterns - \u0421\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0411\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f .apk UI UX Inspirational Gallery for iOS and Android Step 4: Identify approach to develop the app \u2013 native, web or hybrid Selecting the right approach for developing an app is highly important.

These web apps are less powerful than native apps.Hybrid: Hybrid approach is the latest approach to develop any app. This approach combines prebuilt native containers with on-the-fly web coding in order to achieve the best of both worlds. In this approach, the developer augments the web code with native language to create unique features and access native APIs which are not yet available through JavaScript.Step 5: Make an app prototype Next stage, after identifying the approach is developing a prototype. It is actually the process of taking your idea and turning it into an application with some basic functionality. A prototype makes it quite easier to sell your idea to potential buyers who can now actually view the tangible benefits instead of just visualizing or reading product description. It is quite helpful in attracting investors and working with manufacturers and finding licensees. You can also share the prototype app with testers for functional testing and get an idea of what needs to change to make it a successful mobile application.

Alpha testing with a small number of users enables to clear out maximum bugs. At the same time, device coverage plan is significant for quality assurance of mobile app.Identify goals \u2013 Beta testing is the best opportunity to get real feedback from target customers. It provides a great opportunity to further understand target market and their requirements. Identifying goals for beta testing helps in focusing the efforts. These goals reduce your product launch risk.Step 8: Release/Deploy the app Deploying an app requires plan, schedule and control of the movement of releases to test and live environments.
