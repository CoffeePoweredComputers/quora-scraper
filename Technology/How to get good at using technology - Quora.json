            "answer_text": "Use it more. My mom used to frustrate me to no end, as she was always calling me in to help her with something on the computer, and the problem was inevitably something I had helped her with dozens of times prior. She would get defensive, reminding me that she had been the top student in her computer class at college, and how she had been using computers since before I was born. The problem is, none of that matters. This is seriously one of those \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d kind of things, because technology is constantly evolving. Just because you knew how to type up a document and copy and paste in 1995, you\u2019re not necessarily going to understand how to format in the latest edition of MS Word, or whatever you use. Not only that, but if you only use these things on a rare occasion, you will not gain a good level of proficiency, unless 1) you are particularly gifted at picking these things up and retaining what you learn, or 2) you take an actual course. Although, taking a course forces you to use it regularly, at least for a time. When my sisters and I would complain that my mom couldn\u2019t do things easily, like send us an email or reply to a text, she would retort that she \u201cdidn\u2019t have all the time in the world to play around on those things\u201d like we did, and \u201cNow, just tell me how to do it.\u201d That\u2019s the problem, though. We, just like most young people nowadays, learned how to use technology because we wanted to. We were motivated to spend a huge amount of time tinkering around. You need to think about your goals. Why do you want to get good at technology? Find a way to make it fun. Play computer games, design flyers, play with clip art, whatever it takes! I learned so much, just because I wanted to submit art to contests online and customize cute little webpages, which meant I had to learn how to use a scanner, what DPI meant, how to use simple HTML codes, etc. Of course it helped that my schools taught me how to type and some computer terminology, but MOST of my learning came from necessity in order to achieve my goal, which was to have fun.
