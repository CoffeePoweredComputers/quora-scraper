            "answer_text": " Image source - my camera phone gallery (shot on Asus Zenphone) Nature cannot be fully described and expressed in words . Only a little of it can be expressed in poetic language and imagination . To better understand nature one should spend time in nature. Every person view and observe things differently. It can be wild for someone and at same time it can be a comfortable home for someone. It can be beautiful at one time and it can be cruel , brutal and scary on the other . Nature don't have any boundaries and limitations( our language, culture and traditions have). Nature is quit old and at the same time as young as first orgasmic pleasure. Nature is beyond. Nature holds the answers to all the questions and at the same time it's a deep deep mystery. Feel free to explore nature and please save it. Upvote if you got some hint as I cannot describe it too. Thanks  Edit - 1 Attaching some photographs I clicked as a nature lover .  \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.  \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026  THANKS. Upvote if you like. I will upload more. ",
