            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 they \u201cappear\u201d bad, because there are so many of them out there in the hands of consumers. Chances are, you know many people in your life with HP products, if not HP computers. Out of all of them, I bet at least one is having problems. Is that because HP sucks? Well\u2026 it has more to do with the numbers. Squaretrade did a study of laptops that customers had signed up for their aftermarket insurance for\u2026 the extended plans. They found that over three years, 16% of the best laptops failed\u2026 and 27% of the worst laptops failed. Yes, HP was at the bottom. Toshiba was at the top\u2026 but the sample of Toshiba laptops in the \u201cstudy\u201d was close to one tenth that of the HP owners. They released the study in 2009. That\u2019s the graphic you usually see with Asus at the top, Toshiba next to it, Apple in the middle, and HP at the bottom\u2026. or Asus to the left and HP to the right.  Anyway. With the smaller pool of failures, the rate wasn\u2019t as accurate as the larger pool of HP. This doesn\u2019t mean that more cheapskates didn\u2019t buy the low end HP stuff that the make to really not last longer than three years\u2026 \u2026 because HP is in the business to make money. They make money by selling laptop frequently, not selling laptops that last forever no matter what price point you purchase in at. I\u2019ve seen what happens time and time again with DV7 laptops and the brass screw anchors that are set into the plastic casing to hold the hinge screws in place\u2026 you know\u2026 IMPORTANT screws? The kind of screws that when the come out, the hinge no longer opens, and instead the entire assembly turns and grinds away at everything in its path like a T-Rex jaw (Ok, Velociraptor for size I guess)\u2026 with those now broken free brass ridged stubbs adding to the fray. It is not pretty. Typically catastrophic to the bottom casing, sometimes catastrophic to the motherboard. Designed to fail in choice of materials under normal expected strain. It happened to dozens of DV7\u2019s that I\u2019ve seen over the past three years. I\u2019m not pointing the finger and saying \u201cEvil HP\u201d. They are being as smart as they can. I\u2019ve talked about how currently they sell desktop computers that are no more than laptop motherboards in boxes. No expansion slots. They use laptop power supply bricks. But\u2026 they are the size of a slimline computer\u2026 and they sell slimline computers with expansions slots that will take standard low profile cards sold in the SAME CASES\u2026 just different models. No, the budget models that you see for $249 on sale at the big stores? Check the back. If it has that small, round hole for a laptop power connection instead of the big one you\u2019d normally see in a desktop\u2026 there\u2019s a laptop board in there. Why? They realized that there\u2019s a market of people out there who buy desktops because they\u2019ve always bought desktops. They never add to the computer, and they use it for light tasks. So. They built that machine. That, exact machine. And.. made it look like all the other machines. They tried the cute little blue cube\u2026 that didn\u2019t sell. Same concept, but looked too different. So\u2026 they relegated that smaller form factor to the professional community who can appreciate paying $900 for a Core i7 computer the size of a USB hub. When you look at their professional grade stuff, the failure rate drops. If you got a bad HP, I\u2019m sorry. There do seem to be a lot of them\u2026 but that is also because there are a TON of them out there. If your HP isn\u2019t holding up as well as you\u2019d like\u2026 it\u2019s probably because they want you to get a new one. Even if you aren\u2019t ready. ",

This computer is working the same way it was the day I took it out of the box. Even the screen is perfect. There isn\u2019t a single dead pixel on it!!! And this is not a top product. It\u2019s a computer from their budget line. It is a cheap computer. But only in price. Regarding its quality, it couldn\u2019t be better! My first laptop was an Acer. And it was a huge disappointment. The thing died on me after only 2 years of use. My brother had 2 Dell notebooks. One after the other. And both died on him after a few months of use. With HP, I never had such problems. HP has millions of computers out there. I don\u2019t have the official numbers here. But if you take the percentage of their machines that work perfectly, you\u2019ll see it is much bigger than those that fail. People must stop assuming that everything not sporting an Apple logo is rubbish. And BTW, Apple newest line of computers are not that impressive. The time Apple was innovative and unbeatable in quality is long gone. ",

Seriously, it makes me cringe to hear the sound, because one of these times its just going to kill the motherboard). However, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re bad otherwise. Especially their high end models. As a matter of fact, their old DV6 model computers are some of the most durable laptops I\u2019ve seen.  (This is the model I have) This computer is used every day in a school environment. Falling, hitting lockers, dropped on tables, smacking each stair in it\u2019s bag as I walk up and down sometimes. And the only damage is a small crack in the silver lining (which I glued together), and the left click button was damaged although it is still functional (because I played too many clicker games on it). This computer is an absolute beast, especially for still running 9 years later with no hardware issues. It\u2019s even relatively fast despite it\u2019s Core 2 Duo at 2.1 GHz. The lower end consumer laptops tend to be fragile, though. ",

            "answer_text": "A better question would be why are HP CONSUMER computers so bad. I actually really like HPs business line of laptops (EliteBooks / ProBooks). But yes, their consumer lines leave much to be desired. Most of the issues with their laptops have to do with CPUs and GPUs without adequate cooling methods. HPs are notorious for overheating, partly due to poor overall design and lack of planning for adequate ventilation, and partly due to cheap and poor quality thermal compound and solder. HP doesn't care about their consumer grade stuff because they know the big bucks are made from their business contracts. So that's where they invest all their money and efforts. ",

I chose an HP laptop due to it\u2019s quality and repairability. Later, I performed depot warranty repair for their laptops. I will say, that the quality of the line of laptops I was working on were subpar, the contractor who built them was not the best, while the other HP laptop line was solid, it was built by another company. I bought a laptop that I knew was from the other line. One thing that struck me about their laptops was that they provide the repair manuals and parts online. So, after warranty, you can repair your computer still. That being said, I have found other manufacturers doing the same. HP, in my experience, doesn't seem to be worse than any other manufacturer for it\u2019s price point. ",

No start up repairs worked. Had to wipe it and start over and of course lost my data. It is currently in their custody being \u201crepaired\u201d as it is still making those little clicking noises that indicate hard drive problems. I would prefer a refund but apparently the best I will get is a replacement. This has never ever occurred before with a brand new laptop. Naturally I won't be repeating that mistake. UPDATE, May 26, 2020. Hard drive has failed AGAIN. Stay away from HP laptops. ",

Every electronics will die at some point and HP\u2019s no exception, but you\u2019d really think they\u2019d last much longer. Their line of desktop is not meant for gaming but rather work and other tasks but in the end, it depends on what line of desktops you buy and sometimes just bad luck or good luck with the computer. If you really need a laptop, I honestly think ASUS or Lenovo is the best choice or a desktop, then just build yourself one. My computer is $650 and is a beast. ",
