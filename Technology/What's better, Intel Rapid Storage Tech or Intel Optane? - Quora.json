            "answer_text": "Intel Optane was good, when the SSDs were first introduced. Instead of buying an expensive SSD drive, buying Intel Optane and using it with a hard disk, was a best hybrid solution. But now, it is not so. SSDs already cheap, NVMe PCIx drives are also faster and Intel Optane is not cheap. These all makes Intel Optane an obsolete technology. ",
