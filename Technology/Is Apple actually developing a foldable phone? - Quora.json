            "answer_text": "I personally think no, at least not yet. Apple has been working on the foldable design for years and has several patents on them. There has been prototypes built and are still being tested. When and if Apple does though it will be not just a copy but a unique implementation all its own and will be engineered quite extensively. I did hear the other day that they do plan in one but it wont be until the 2020 cycle before it comes to market. That is just a rumour so I wouldn\u2019t put much salt into it. This market is a tricky and expensive market, a niche. It will be interesting to see maybe a year from now how they sell and hold up to daily usage. Sometimes taking things a little slow to wait and see is better than jumping on the bandwagon with a me too item and the whole thing fizzle out. ",

            "answer_text": "If you look at Apple\u2019s patent portfolio, it\u2019s clear that they been researching this type of a device for quite a few years now. Personally, I think think the concept of a foldable phone is very cool, but the current implementations are little more than a novelty. Samsung is the type of company to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. Sometimes they get lucky with a good product or a good implementation. In many cases, they don\u2019t. I see Samsung\u2019s foldable phone attempt as DOA. It\u2019s very expensive and it\u2019s awkward in terms of implementation. I don\u2019t know if Apple will ever release one or not. However, based on their history, they\u2019re not going to rush a half baked implementation to market as Samsung and Huawei have. This is basically what you get when you don\u2019t have a company like Apple to copy from. ",
