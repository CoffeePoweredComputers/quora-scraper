It doesn\u2019t matter anyway since there are no nationwide 5G networks available. There are some small test nodes in various cities, but full urban roll out will take years. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, If company want so they can upgrade any iPhone to 5G Supported Phone. But if you really want to ask which iphone can not be upgraded so I will say iPhone 4 and 4s. becuase it runs on low capacity battery and 5G uses lot of battery if you tested on Samsung's latest 5G Supported phone. Mobiles phone gets so hot so think about iphone 4s. ",
