            "answer_text": "Next Generation, Generation 4 nuclear fission reactors. These reactors are a significant improvement over current PWR reactors. Gen 4 reactors are designs that are highly resistant to meltdowns. They can have other safety advantages an could be cleaner, smaller, cheaper and easier to operate. They may run on nuclear or mining waste as well as unused weapons material. These could be a vital option for low carbon energy. There are many nuclear reactors being planned for future construction. China wants to build over 50 nuclear reactors to meet its fast growing energy demand. China is building a number of different reactors including some Generation 4 reactors. China has just started operation of a gas cooled pebble bed reactor. It uses spheres containing nuclear fuel that can resist very high temperatures. Temperatures that would melt common Uranium fuel rods made of metal. This will not replace renewable energy but will part of many technologies we need to lower carbon levels. Hopefully, many of the reactors that will be built in future will be better and safer designs. The US is not planning to build nuclear reactors but has many old reactors that will need replacement in future. They may be replaced by renewable energy projects and gas. The US has Generation 4 technology but is not building prototype reactors needed to prove these reactors work effectively. China is building some Gen 4 reactor designs including Molten Salt Reactors and Sodium cooled Wave Reactors. Terrapower is a US company that was developing a Wave Reactor in China. Bill Gates is a spokesman for Terrapower. This reactor is designed so that it can be operated in countries that do not have a nuclear industry. They would use depleted Uranium waste as fuel. Hopefully future reactors will have much better designs. A number of countries are working together to develop these new reactors but China is doing most of the work at present. ",

            "answer_text": " The question is so general it evokes a general response. Any measure of performance over time shows that technological achievement is monotonically increasing. The question is what form does advance take? Here are three functions that always increase as a function of time that are reasonable candidates to model and predict technical progress. Linear, exponential, hyperbolic. On the left side of the graph they all seem linear, and with the exception of the linear function, far to the left they are pretty much flat. They are constant over a human life. The idea of progress for ancient humans was sheer fantasy. Of course when advance is not constant over a human life, they at first appear to increase in a linear fashion. In the middle of the graph the slope of all the functions approach that of the linear function. It is only late in the game that there is a divergence in behaviour. Now we are in the middle on this graph. So, its important to know which curve we\u2019re on if we want an accurate prediction of the future. So this is the general solution to your general question haha At present we are in the middle. You are asking about the right side of the graph. Generally speaking our future depends on which graph best predicts our future? Is our growth linear? Exponential? Hyperbolic? This will impact what we are able to do and when we are able to do it. The linear function which was way ahead of the other two early on falls behind as it plods along. The exponential function constantly accelerates but requires infinite time to attain infinite capacity. The hyperbolic function attains infinity in a finite time. Economist have struggled trying to determine which model best fits human affairs. Thomas Malthus famously predicted a carrying capacity for the whole Earth following Captain Cook\u2019s first circumnavigation of Earth. Malthus reasoned that human productive advance grew linearly whilst human numbers grew exponentially, therefore at some point we would be overpopulated and poor. Malthus reckoned in the 1770s overpopulation would occur around 1950s and we would have some three billions of people on Earth at that time. On the exponential increase of human numbers Malthus was quite right. There were three billion people on Earth. On the poverty aspect, he was quite wrong. By 1950 humans were far wealthier than they were in 1770. In fact by 1950 humanity had achieved many things that would not be credited by anyone in 1770 if you were to tell them of it. Personal motorcars, air travel, atomic energy, electric lighting, telephones, radio, motion pictures, television, just to name a few. These would be looked upon as magic by any scientific mind of 1770. Yet these innovations were merely symptoms of a larger transformation in ability wrought by science. Fundamental improvements in core agricultural and industrial capabilities, informed by scientific method made poverty a virtual impossibility in any well managed economy. Even one with growing populations. Milton Friedman details in his work, that mass production of any good ends any possibility of scarcity. Economic growth of 7% per year which is possible with 1950s technology always outstrip growth in human numbers so permanent growth in personal wealth for all is a real possibility. Human numbers increase at most 1.5% this means that wealth for all increases at 5.5% per year. So, a well managed economy see that every 12.9 years of 7% growth even with 1.5% growth in numbers per person income doubles! From birth to retirement in 65 years a generation could expect a 32 fold increase in income! This for generation upon generation in the future. The future\u2019s so bright, I\u2019ve got to wear shades! This capacity of modern productive science to transform cultures has transformed China and is in the process of transforming India as well. Africa and South America had a good start early, but has derailed for now.  Some think all scarcities today are artificially induced and maintained by those who benefit from that scarcity. In fact when the true history of our times is written some contend it will be seen that the epoch from 1900 through to the present day was a search by those in control over humanity for new methods of control in a post-scarcity age. Global war, psychotropic drugs, mass media, , new age culture, internet can all be seen as social experiments seeking to control humans by various means. As Joe Campbell says, life overcomes death, and it is the nature of life to resist anything that attempts to destroy it. Now, the functions are incomplete. Their ultimate behaviour depends upon initial conditions. In short, growth is constrained. In the real world there are limits to growth. So what does that mean to the long term future of humanity?  Well we can see the first graph was merely far to the left of these graphs. That is our limits to growth are in the future and we are near zero in comparison to our ultimate capacity.   Now, our physical dominance of the terrestrial environment is at present large. This indicates our future growth must occur off world. When we look at the resources of energy and materiel in our solar system, we can see that our Earth is a very small place in a vast cosmic arena. The Sun for example generates 21.27 trillion times more power than humanity uses. There are hundreds of billions of suns in our galaxy. Hundreds of billions of galaxies in the observable cosmos. We have demonstrated a capacity to observe, and measure the cosmos. We have demonstrated a capacity to move operate and make use of resources off world.  So, the next question is when? In the case of the exponential function, our limits are in the far future. In the case of the hyperbolic function, our limits could be quite near in time.   Kurzweil has one take on future progress. Like Malthus, he got a lot right. Like Malthus he got a few things wrong. The first thing he got wrong was his exclusive use of exponential functions. The hyperbolic model should be included also. In fact the data points do show a tendency to move above the exponential function plotted for them. That much is clear from the accelerating curve. The second thing he got wrong was the assumption that cosmic life would be non biological. This prejudice against biology throws away too quickly the information life has struggled to give us since the beginning of time. That\u2019s one reason not to be too hasty to dispose of biology. Another is that compared to the resources of the cosmos, keeping biological systems alive is far more costly than non biologicals, but the difference on the cosmic scale is miniscule. Finally, our own history shows the error of this conclusion. The anaerobes that inhabited the early Earth still inhabit our gut today. This suggests very strongly that the biological life forms that spawn the technologies that span the cosmos will inhabit that machinery. By the year 2030 will will be approaching the point where the hyperbolic function outstrips the exponential models as computers outstrip most human productive function. At that point our technological growth uncouples from human limits in mental capacity and hyperbolic acceleration dominates. this uncoupling of human affairs from human control will see the following transformations; The first step is complete awareness of the human condition as it is. AI will make the dark web safe for all and AI will help fuse together all bits and pieces of information available and penetrate all secrets. We will all become aware of our condition without any limit. The next step will be the reaction to that. We will shake off all artificially imposed limits and constraints. We will bring justice to those who have violated our trust. At this point the visionary future imagined by the Russian Cosmism movement will transpire. Rather than rid ourselves of biology, we will come to inhabit the oceans, the skies and colonies beyond the skies across the solar system. Human life will be extended. Human intelligence too. Machinery will at some point come to dominate, but not at the expense of biological life. We will reach out through time. This will permit travel to the stars and back, and travel through time will permit those returning in the distant future to return to their time of departure. Affording apparent travel beyond light speed. Time travel ability will also permit us to use science to resurrect the dead. ",

            "answer_text": "In the field of aviation, one proposed advancement is actually a throwback to the earliest age of powered flight: wing-warping Wing warping was an early system for lateral (roll) control of a fixed-wing aircraft. The technique, used and patented by the Wright brothers, consisted of a system of pulleys and cables to twist the trailing edges of the wings in opposite directions. In many respects, this approach is similar to that used to trim the performance of a paper airplane by curling the paper at the back of its wings (Wikipedia)The Wright Brothers used wings of cloth, so warping did not over-fatigue the wings\u2019 trailing edges. The next, experimental use of this principle was the Mission Adaptive Wing, tested on NASA\u2019s F-111 aircraft in the \u201970s and \u201880s.  (Youtube) The wing could be optimized for all phases of flight: take off,landing,cruise economy,combat maneuverability, anddamage mitigation.We haven\u2019t seen any practical applications of this technology in military aircraft\u2026 yet.

In my lifetime, computers have gone from filling rooms to getting lost in my pocket. Transistors were invented four years before I was born and now they are in virtually everything of importance. The internet has changed the world so much I doubt that young people can imagine what it was like before. I think the next big advances may be in software, even though hardware improvements like nano-technology will continue. The inevitable arrival of artificial intelligence will undoubtably have a huge effect on our lives. If the promise of room temperature superconductors bears fruit, we may see the world change very fast. I am optimistic about the future, despite the many problems we see, the world is improving overall. There will always be setbacks, but I think the future will be bright. ",

If something is needed, then efforts will be spent in order to satisfy that need. But play is an impredictable phenomenon - you do not know what some human mind at play may invent (the first mechanical computer was invented around 100 BC, same as the first steam engine, Antikythera mechanism an Aeolipile). The two developments that are needed are an engine that will take us easier to space and in space (although the technologies we have now may be enough, for intrasystem and interstellar we shall need something more efficient) and BCI - brain computer interface, so we may make more efficient use of AI (which is not real AI or AGI, Artificial General Intelligence, on par with human intelligence). That is why we need BCI - because AI cannot in a sufficient measure simulate our human intelligence, being too narrow. ",
