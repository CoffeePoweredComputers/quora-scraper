            "answer_text": "Anywhere other than BitCoin. BitCoin has no intrinsic value. You\u2019d be buying it on the \u201cGreater fool\u201d theory, which assumes that you\u2019ll find someone dumber than you who will pay more for it. Buy ETFs that cover Bank and Utility stocks. It\u2019s a safe investment that will yield 5% a year, and have good capital growth. Every 7 years you should reasonably expect the investment to double and you won\u2019t lie awake wondering if you\u2019ve lost your money. Investing in Bitcoin is a gamble, not an investment. You might be lucky and double your money in a year, or you might lose it all. At least in a casino you get free drinks while you lose money. ",

            "answer_text": "13000 USD is not enough to set up a crypto farm, and if you don't have trading background, you may lose a lot of money.Cloud mining is ideal, you should pick the right contract to invest in.I always consider RRMine's products as investment, not mining products. Instead of selling mining units, they sell computing power for mining on their platform. If you don't want to go through all the things mentioned above, you can check them out, directly acquire computing power from RRMine, this would save you all the trouble of running a crypto farm; they will take care of them all for you, it\u2019s more of an investment instead of a technological challenge, they have a large userbase of 100k.
