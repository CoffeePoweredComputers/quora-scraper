            "answer_text": "I found that.. Take a look! 3Pl stands for \u201cthird party logistics on TPL is a kind of supply chain system organization that act as a third party by outsourcing products, wear houses and fulfill there services. Basically it provide you logistic services to 3Pl expert they have expertise in international services certain area just like a doctor can help you when you' re sick and a lawyer can help you if you need legal problems. 3PL can help you if you have to ship some thing or you need to understand the logistic for your business. 3PL has a lot of experience with shipping, freight inventory, management and many other things they can provide a lot of value for your business in areas where you may not be proficient. Where as LLP LLP stand for lead logistics provider also know as (4pL) 4th party logistic. These services provider figure out your supply chain . LLP behave as a supply chain management. They are expert in their work and have a broad management role with supply chain. However, 4PL provide stable services and become a reliable partner with their customers. 4PL is a kind of big umbrella. They work on bigger levels and handle transportation, shipments, inventories, Merchandise and also handle large amount of data's. ",

            "answer_text": "This what I was able to find: 3PL = Third Party Logistics, they offer logistic-related services to their customer (you hire them to move your product, they need directions on what to do, but they handle details such as paperwork) 4PL = These guys offer to manage a bunch of 3PLs for you (they usually don't move your products directly) LLP ~ 3.5PL = These guys are actually 3PL, but they offer to manage your supply chain as well. Their services are tilted to use their own assets to do it if practical to do so, but could include others (in territories they don't serve for example) Edit:  I found some interesting post about the subject here:3PL vs 4PL: What are these PLs, Anyway? Layers of Logistics Explained  There you'll find 4PLs defined by some as  \"A supply chain integrator that assembles and manages the resources, capabilities, and technology of its own organization with those of complementary service providers to deliver a comprehensive supply chain solution.\"  \"4PLs have also been referred to as \u201cLead Logistics Providers\u201d. Now a new crop of companies have emerged who are actual transportation companies too. While a 4PL is sometimes described as non-asset-owning service provider, their role is to provide broader scope managing of the entire supply chain.\" (take a look a the LinkedIn discussion cited in the post, it has +150 comments, so there's definitely  some blurry edges on the concept) ",

            "answer_text": "Those are pretty blurry lines. In our opinion, this distinction is often more of a rhetorical exercise than anything else. Strictly speaking, a 3PL service provider would be hired to just move your goods from one place to another. A LLP on the other hand, will be responsible for handling a cluster of 3PLs for you without getting to the level of actually executing the job. Which one do you need? Depends upon your needs. In many cases a single 3PL service provider will be able to handle your needs. But if you have a diverse range of products then it is sometimes a good idea to have both.http://www.gati.com/ ",

            "answer_text": "Almost none! I know that is a provocative answer. But there is a good reason why I say there almost no difference between the two. Think about it - how many 3PLs do all the tasks in a logistics chain themselves. Somewhere along the line - they would employ another agent, carrier, customs clearance person, delivery truck operator etc. The moment they do it, they become a LLP. ",
