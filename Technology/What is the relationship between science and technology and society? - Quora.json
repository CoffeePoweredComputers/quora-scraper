            "answer_text": "Question: What is the interrelativeness of science, technology and society? Interesting. I\u2019m not sure I can do this question justice in a short discussion, but I\u2019ll try. And if it\u2019s not good enough, I can always expand on it in a full article. One reason why answering the question is so difficult is because all three have bidirectional relationships with each other: each one influences the other. So that\u2019s six different relationships. Science and Technology Science informs technological advancements. We rely on theories on physics, material science, electricity, chemistry, etc to develop new technologies. Indeed, we\u2019re still working to create a lot of potentially useful materials that are predicted to exist, based on our current scientific theories, and the more scientific theory develops, the more it can inform our technological advancements. Our ability to create such powerful computers is informed by our science. Quantum computers are being developed, based on our science on the topic, which will further our computing power by orders of magnitude. But technology also changes how we do science. Think about the invention of the telescope. It vastly changed our ability to conduct astronomical research. Space telescopes, probes like Voyager, the Cassini probe and the Huygens lander, etc have done even more. Even more recently, technological advancements have allowed us to create a virtual telescope the size of the Earth, which has allowed us to actually photograph a black hole (or really the material around it). I happened to pick astronomy as an example, but the influence technology has had on science is\u2014well\u2014astronomical. Computing power, storage capacity, and so on has allowed for data science and the use of big data in medical sciences, sociology, economics, and more. So the very computers that are being developed, using scientific theory and evidence, also help us do scientific research. Technology and Society In some ways, the influence that technology has had on society is obvious. It\u2019s also very profound. Just consider your ability to ask the Quora community this question, and our ability to answer. It would not exist without technology. Social media, the internet as a whole, blockchain technology, etc all have had significant influences on society. Of course earlier technological revolutions such as the industrial revolution and the agricultural revolution cannot be ignored either. The ability to create materials that we use in our everyday life, the ability to feed a massive amount of people, and so on, are all thanks to the development of technological innovations. Of course, while technology has been a great boon for prosperity, it has also had some negative impacts. It has produced quite a bit of pollution, though hopefully technology and science will cure that issue. Probably the worst use of technology\u2014and the science which informs its development\u2014has been weapons of mass destruction. In the opposite direction, society drives technology and sometimes prohibits its development. I recently finished a piece on the ethics of fiction writing, in which I touched on the importance that fiction has had on inspiring new technology and warning of threats that we could face in the future[1]. Society also drives technological evolution through need. Very often a technology emerges because someone recognizes a need for that technology. Science and Society Just as technology often develops because there is a need for it, science helps solve the needs of society. While a major goal of science is to simply better our understanding, many leverage science to help solve real world problems in society. Additionally, like with technology, society can influence our theories, and their evolution. Science also improves our understanding of society. Anthropology, sociology, economics, political science, and so on, all help us better understand how society functions. Because science alters our understanding of the world, it has had a significant impact on our belief systems, our norms, and our values, as well as our daily behaviors. Germ theory, for instance, has changed our sanitation habits and our hygiene, as well as our food safety protocols. Footnotes[1] Ethical Fiction Writing",

            "answer_text": "We have about five thousand years of written history available, beginning with some memorized poetry and song cycles that have survived to be studied today. Over all that time, we have records of how humans have developed techniques for organizing the actions of groups of humans and their domestic animals (society). When groups of humans had a surplus of time they didn\u2019t need to spend feeding themselves, some of them found ways to manipulate the natural environment in beneficial ways (technology). When groups of humans developed enough technology that food surpluses could persist and build up enough to allow specialization into cities of skilled workers, some of those skill workers applied their efforts to the study of how the natural world worked (science). These studies persisted through time through written tablets/scrolls/books/quipu/??? and built upon earlier work to develop into reproducible scientific theories. The analytical methods science made possible allowed technology to be extended faster and further than individual insights and observations. Technological breakthroughs allowed different sorts of societies to become possible. So, societies moved from: families, to clans, to kingdoms, to republics. Technologies moved from: clubs, to plows, to fertilizers, to antibiotics. Sciences moved from: written accounts, to encyclopedia, to analytical techniques, to computer models. ",
