            "answer_text": "I always hated trying to answer this question. I\u2019ll say Star Trek because we know more about that Universe and tech specs etc. Death Star can destroy a planet but so could TOS Enterprise and it\u2019s a lot smaller. Jedi mind tricks would not work on most Star Fleet officers as they are not weak minded, they are selfless and work to better society. Han states in New Hope that it would take 1000 star destroyers to destroy a planet. Plus Star Trek has Q and Robert I think his name was in TNG episode where we wiped out an entire race with a single thought. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to say. If the Midichlorians infested the Milky Way galaxy, then everyone would become helpless against The Force, in which the Star Wars universe would be adept. As seen in the TOS episode \u201cOperation: Annihilate!\u201d, Midichlorians are similar to the parasites in that episode, being collectively sentient; except that they are microscopic and generally undetectable. So it would come down more to a mission to understand the MidiChlorians, rather than war. So Spock might communicate with them,and realize that there were good ones and bad ones, and that they had to destroy the bad ones without harming the good ones. ",
