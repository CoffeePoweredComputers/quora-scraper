            "answer_text": "If you mean the Blu-Ray family of technologies which includes Blu-Ray Ultra HD, rumors of its death have been greatly exaggerated. Internet streaming may have improved greatly in recent years, but it still can\u2019t come close to the nearly flawless quality and reliability of a physical disc \u2014 not to mention enough storage for gobs of extra language tracks, alternate cuts, and special features. We\u2019ve had three main iterations of Blu-Ray: Blu-Ray, Blu-Ray 3D, and Blu-Ray Ultra HD. This followed two iterations of DVD: the original 4:3 version, and a later \u201cEnhanced for Widescreen\u201d 16x9 version that kept the same physical format, but made widescreen movies dramatically sharper on widescreen TVs (using anamorphic encoding). As a general rule, disc quality follows TV quality. As TVs hit the market with better features (widescreen, 1080p HD, 3D, Ultra HD and HDR), new disc formats come out to support them. So what could the next home movie disc format have? It depends on what the next generarion of home TVs and projectors support. 3D with Ultra HD and HDR That\u2019s the most obvious new feature. Today you can buy a movie on either 3D 1080p or 2D Ultra HD, but not 3D Ultra HD. I think there are three main reasons for this: 3D isn\u2019t that popular, because most home 3D TVs haven\u2019t been very good. Some higher end TVs supported a great theater-like \u201cpassive\u201d 3D, which uses lightweight polarized lenses and allows both eyes to see the image at the same time with no strobe effect. They\u2019re awesome. But few TV sets and no home theater projectors use that technology; instead, most use \u201cactive\u201d 3D, where bulkier glasses with batteries use a rapid strobe effect to alternate the image between each eye. People complained of headaches and a darker image with that.The best way to improve on the quality of home 3D is to double the brightness and (for passive 3D, which sends every other pixel to a different eye), to also double the TV\u2019s resolution. But that\u2019s what Ultra HD TVs have! So a UHD TV can use its extra brightness and resolution to make 1080p 3D look as good as 1080p 2D, or make Ultra HD with HDR look incredible \u2014 but not both. To make Ultra HD 3D look as good as Ultra HD 2D, commercial TVs will have to double in brightness and resolution again.When Blu-Ray Ultra HD came out, the 3D version of its video codec (HEVC) hadn\u2019t yet been released.Well, the 3D version of HEVC is now available, and TVs that are even brighter and have higher resolutions than today's Ultra HD are now being shown off. Soon, the market might be ready for Ultra HD 3D. Ultra-Wide Aspect Ratio (True 4K) Theatrical movies aren\u2019t really shown at the 16:9 (1.78:1) aspect ratio used for home TVs, but a wider 1.85:1 or 2.39:1. Encoding then for home TVs results in black bars above and below the image, which eat up some of the disc\u2019s available resolution and lowers their quality a bit below \u201ctrue\u201d 4K. If discs widen their image a little, they could support the full theatrical 4K resolution. Then ultrawide \u201c21:9\u201d home TV sets and high-end home projectors could show the same quality you get at a $20/ticket cineplex. 8K There are new TVs coming out with double the vertical and horizontal resolutions of Ultra HD, and whoever buys them will want content to watch at that quality. There really isn\u2019t much content at 8K; the best Hollywood blockbusters today are mastered in 4K. Recent IMAX movies could benefit if your home TV is large enough. But technology doesn\u2019t stand still, and someday shooting in 8K will cost the same as making a movie in 4K today \u2014 and we\u2019ll have content for those giant TV sets. I have no idea if that\u2019ll come sooner or later. New codecs Video and audio codecs are coming out that are even better (and cheaper to license) than the ones used in Blu-Ray Ultra HD. A future format could switch to better codecs, letting it fit more content (at better quality) on the same sized disc. Higher-capacity discs All of these features except for the new codecs would increase the amount of data needed, though only 8K really needs a bigger disc. But either way, more storage capacity couldn\u2019t hurt. Who wouldn\u2019t want to fit longer movies and whole seasons of TV shows on a single disc? Blu-Ray fits 50GB per disc and Blu-Ray Ultra HD fits 100GB per disc. Presumably a future format would increase that a bit more. ",

            "answer_text": "There probably is no future for this technology. The Blu-ray standard is outdated. NAND chips are getting cheaper, so a lot of digital storage is now done on flash drives, memory cards, and hard drives (as the prices of hard drives keep plummeting). As far as the encoding done on Blu-rays, it still is encoded in the MPEG-2 standard. This is a 22 year old codec. More modern codecs have since then emerged, including Div3, DivX, XviD, h.264, and the latest h.265. Audio codec of MPeG 2 is also very ancient.It uses MP3 as audio compression, which is a 25 year old codec! MP3 was succeeded by OGG and M4A/AAC; and more recently superseded by Opus. And in the low bitrate, WMA beat it, as well as OGG, and M4A/AAC. From a resolution perspective, the Blu-ray standard is also outdated. Officially only supporting 1080p video, it will soon disappear, as most optical storage will now start using h.264 or h.265 encodings at 10 bit, with HDR and wide color gamut; at 4k (2160p) resolutions. From a hardware perspective, many people now buy smart TVs that can stream their movies. They don\u2019t want to spend another $50 for a device they\u2019d hardly be using. But it\u2019s not the price that bothers most people. It\u2019s the bulkiness.In a time when we are going \u2018borderless\u2019 on our phones and televisions, there is no space for cables or drives hanging off the wall, or on a desk near the TV. Give Blu-ray another 5 years before it\u2019s completely phased out. ",
