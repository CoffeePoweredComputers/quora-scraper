            "answer_text": "The answer is Yes and No. If the input voltage of your phone is 5v and you chose to connect directly to a solar panel of 12v output voltage, it will damage your phone.Also worthy of note is the instability of sun rays and the consequent voltage fluctuation. Its better to avoid charging directly from solar panels. However, its safe to charge your phone if the solar panel has a regulator that produces the required 5v. It is also safe to charge through an inverter ,but in this case with an adaptor or phone charger. When solar panels are installed with inverters and batteries, the energy produced is safe, stable and reliable. Engr Justice Ekeke +2347037813713 ",

            "answer_text": "Directly NO. But it can cause long term effect later on. Last week I had to visit my village home. Unfortunately there is no electricity coverage. People use solar cells. So I also charged my Redmi 8 through solar panel. My device was fast charging. But after coming home, I charged my phone and suddenly noticed that it is being charged so slowly \ud83d\ude32. Even I tried the airplane mode. But really even after 4 hours charging my phone is not charged fully\ud83d\ude4e\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. So my suggestion is if not VERY URGENT, then please don't charge your electric device through solar cell. Thank you. ",
