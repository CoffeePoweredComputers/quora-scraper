            "answer_text": "I associate the word debriefing with a review made after a key event to learn and publicize what caused that key event. So I can associate debriefing with investigations after: * an important complaint; * the loss of a strategic customer; * a serious production failure; * a serious accident at the company; * a serious accident at a competitor or industry. Being so, I associate debriefing with corrective actions and risk treatment. ",
