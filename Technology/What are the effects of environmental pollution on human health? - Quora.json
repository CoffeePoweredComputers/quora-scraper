            "answer_text": "Hii Ritesh , see the environmental pollution and degradation may rise in step with such a rise in output, the result leading to an appalling environmental pollution and damage. Tens of millions more people may become sick or die each year from environmental causes. Water shortages may become intolerable and tropical forests and other natural habitats may decline to a fraction of their current size. The earth's 'sources' are limited and so is the absorptive capacity of its 'sinks'. Whether these limitations will hinder the growth of human activity will depend on the scope for substitution, technical progress and structural change. ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH Environmental health can be defined as \"the aspect of public health that is with all external conditions such as all forms o life, substances, forces, problems and challenges and any other condition in the surroundings of man that that may extent an influence on man's health and well-being\". Disease in this sense represents maladjustment of the human being to his environment. This rapid industrial growth has made water pollution, air pollution, and hazardous wastes pressing environmental problems in many areas of the developing world. Industrial emission's combine with vehicle exhausts to cause air pollution, while concentrations of heavy metals and ammonia loads are often high enough to cause major fish kills down- River from industrial areas. The lack of hazardous waste facilities compounds the problem with industrial wastes. The physical environment has a major influence on human health not only through temperature, precipitation and composition of air and water but also through its interaction with the type and distribution of the flora and fauna (the biological environment). The biological environment is a major influence on the food supply and on the reservoirs and transmission mechanisms of, many diseases. The following gives the simplified illustration of these relationships. The scale and nature of human activities including agricultural, industrial, and energy production, the use and management of water and wastes, urbanization, the distribution of income and assets within and between countries, the quality of health and other public services and the extent of protection of the living, working, and natural environment. Environmental hazards to health fall into two broad categories. On the one side is the lack of accessibility to basic environmental resources like sanitation, water, fresh air, shelter and the like. On the other side is the exposure to hazardous environment. These hazards include biological agents viz., micro-organisms such as bacteria and viruses and parasites which contribute to the global burden of infectious disease, chemical pollutants, ultra violet radiation and the like which cause birth defects and damage the body immunity system and which render people susceptible' to a variety of health risks. Environmental Problem Effect on Health Water pollution and water scarcity More than 2 million deaths and billions of illnesses a year attributable to pollution, poor household hygiene and added health risks caused by water scarcity. Air pollution Many acute and chronic health impacts excessive matter levels arc responsible for 300,00 - 70,0,000 premature deaths annually and for half of childhood chronic diseases; women and children in poor rural areas affected by smoky indoor air. Atmospheric disasters Possible shifts in vector-borne diseases; risks climatic natural: diseases attributable to ozone changes depletion (perhaps 300,000 additional cases of skin cancer a year worldwide; 1.7 (million cases of cataracts). Among the environmentally-based diseases water, food and oil borne diseases affect a majority of the world population. Diarrohea, Cholera and Hepahtis A and E have the clearest link to the environment and spread by both bacteria and virus. According to a WHO study, Diarrohea deaths were around 2.5 million in 1996. Around 4 billion cases of diarrohea cause widespread debilitations each year. The nuclear development and use, the world over is a major threat to human health today. The radiation hazard arising from Extra Low Frequency (ELF) magnetic fields of between one and one hundred hertz (HZ) as well as the very High frequency fields of 147 MHZ, which can alter the outflow of calcium ions from the brain tissue of children, in particular with steadily weakening resistance causes tumour formation in the human body. Health is a fundamental resource to individual and community and is a pre-requisite for their social, spiritual and physicalwell-being, the protection and preservation of which is dependent on the ecological status i of the environment and sustainable development.

            "answer_text": "Environmental pollution has adverse effects on human health. The contamination of physical and biological components of the atmosphere system beyond a limit to such extent that normal environmental processes are affected sums up the definition of Environmental pollution. Categorically speaking pollution can be segregated as air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution and all these contribute towards the global environmental pollution that has become one of the worrying problems worldwide. Air pollution can cause harmful effects on humans if one is exposed to air having toxicants which results in toxicological impact. It can adversely affect one\u2019s respiratory system resulting in diseases like skin diseases, lung cancer, asthma, ventricular hypertrophy. Recent findings also show that pollutants in the air can also cause various mental diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases, autism, etc. Noise pollution is considered as a major concern of the civilized world, that causes innumerable complications in human health- be it physical or psychological. Consistent exposure to unwanted and undesirable sound levels lead to noise pollution. Hearing impairment, high stress levels, hypertension, sleep loss, heart disease, annoyance, tinnitus are some chronic effects of noise pollution on human health. Water pollution has resulted in worst epidemics in the world. Human activity is the sole reason that our water resources are facing the threat of serious water pollution which in turn affects human life. . is a man\u2019s basic necessity and by polluting it, human beings are endangering themselves. Dangerous water-borne diseases like Typhoid, Cholera, Dysentery, Jaundice, Amoebiasis, Malaria are a result of water pollution. Pollutants in general, can affect health by hardening of arteries, risk of heart disease and strokes and also contribute in disturbing one\u2019s mental health. This risky environmental problem has to be tackled and finished before it finishes the mankind. Reducing pollution doesn\u2019t mean abandoning the existing human activities but re-establishing and reordering them in such a way that they do not cause any harm to the environment or human beings.
