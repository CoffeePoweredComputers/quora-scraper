            "answer_text": "Interesting question. If you have a 4K TV it is operating at 4K display resolution all the time. I guess your real question is \u201chow can I tell if my TV is displaying native 4K content or upscaled HD?\u201d There is no easy answer to this other than checking the programming details. 4K (UHD) native content is usually advertised as such and only available from streaming service providers such as Netflix and maybe some forward-looking cable TV companies who are experimenting with 4K. Games consoles have been 4K for some years now. Note: If you are connecting external 4K devices (games consoles and advanced cable STB\u2019s) and they work OK with your existing HDMI cables then thats fine. Your picture wont improve by buying a higher spec HDMI cable. You will only need a high spec cable if you see bright sparkles on-screen, usually because the cable is long. I am not aware of any domestic displays which give a reading of the input resolution nor any which allow a 4K input to be downscaled to HD for comparison purposes. If the source is interlaced HDTV (1080i format) you should be able to see the lack of vertical resolution in moving objects quite clearly. Look for camera pans across the audience or grass in a sports arena. US-style 720p HD content should also bbe easy to spot. But if the source is True HD with progressive scan (Bluray for example) upscaling produces no discernable picture artefacts and can be quite difficult to spot unless you sit close to the screen and have native 4K content to compare it with. There are other UHD (4K) picture improvements such as HDR and WCG that improve contrast ratio and colour rendition, but some lower priced 4K TV\u2019s cannot use the extra enhancement information of HDR and have a limited colour gamut that sits inside the new WCG standard. Many LCD TV\u2019s even have a problem using HDR as their native contrast ratio is so poor. 4K TV\u2019s are sold on the \u201cgreat pictures\u201d they produce. But this is bullshit. Yes if they have HDR and WCG capability and are OLED or QLED technology the pictures will look better than True HD. But for average sized TV displays viewed at average distances the difference is minimal. What is improved is the picture quality for average viewing distances on larger displays or average display sizes viewed up close. This is because the additional spatial resolution of 4K blocks the eye from resolving individual picture elements that would be visible under these conditions on an HDTV. But manufacturers wouldn\u2019t sell many 4K sets on this basis. ",

            "answer_text": "If the source providing video is set to output 4K in the settings and if the native resolution of what you are watching is 4K, you will be watching 4K. In most Blu-Ray and even older DVD players you need to go into the settings and set the output resolution to match the native resolution and aspect ratio of your television. Many Blu-Ray players and even 4K TVs can upscale 1080p sources to 4K. It\u2019s not the same as native 4K, but if you have an upscale great option on the blu-Ray player or TV, make sure it\u2019s on so you\u2019re at least getting the most out of 1080p sources. ",

If it suddenly receives a 4K signal, usually from a 4K bluray or a streaming service it will give me an indication on the top right of the screen that says something like 3840 x 2160 (HDR) or Dolby Vision, etc depending on the source.

If you are asking about Netflix, or Amazon, their content would be marked as 4k, but the quality you ACTUALLY GET is based on your internet provider\u2026 In other words, I was watching Jack Ryan off Amazon\u2026 promo-ed heavily as being 4k and at various times it looked like crap because of lowered bit rate of my connection. The image is still 4k, but the quality of the bit rate can fluctuate resulting in all different levels of visual quality. ",
