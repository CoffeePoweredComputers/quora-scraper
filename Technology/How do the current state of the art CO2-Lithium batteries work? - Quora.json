            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there is such a thing. If it existed it would be a useful way to capture to CO2, but it would need its own supply as there isn\u2019t alot of CO2 in the atmostphere for reaction purposes. There is a lithium air (or oxygen) battery, that I think works by oxidising Lithium with acid as opposed to using lithium ions sorted in a matrix. It has an energy density similar to diesel. but doesn\u2019t last for very long in cycle life. Aluminium air batteries are also a high energy density (abour 2/3s of diesel) but can\u2019t be recharged. Both could be a solution for aviation. ",
