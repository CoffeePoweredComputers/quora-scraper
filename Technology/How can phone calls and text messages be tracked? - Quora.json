            "answer_text": "Tracking of cellphones as depicted in some movies are mostly fictional & not that easy to conduct. It requires a bugged cellphone with an active GPS connection & an active GPS info feeding malware, that constantly keeps on sending the current co-ordinates of the phone to the person who intends to receive this info & with the help of mapping information you can see a moving indicator on a map. And such tools are present with the surveillance team & various National Defense & Security departments. But here are couple of location tracking methods using which a phone can be tracked to a very precise location depending upon different important factors. Cell Tower Triangulation :- This is the most effective & most widely used by organizations or cyber cell divisions & by the NSP\u2019s (Network service providers) to locate a cellphone to a very precise location. Its quite similar to GPS tracking in various ways. It makes use of multiple cell towers in the vicinity of the cell phone to track its location by the measuring & analyzing the time delay that a signal takes to return back to the towers in the vicinity & then this delay is calculated to get the measure distance of the phone from different towers & that gives a precise location of the phone.GPS : - Using the world\u2019s well renowned boon GPS (Global Positioning System).\u201cGPS\u201d is actually a brand name, but it has become an eponym. GPS has many alternatives ,which are much more accurate & offer all the functionalities that GPS offers. One of the best alternatives is GLONASS, Doris, BeiDou/Compass etc. All these alternatives have different defined orbital rotations in order to provide much more accurate data for location based services. Using this a device or a phone call can be traced to a very precise location of about 3\u20135 meters, but you need other information including the phone number, IMEI info, Cell tower info (being used by the device at that very moment) & a tool that offers you the functionality of tracking phones based on their IP addresses, IMEI & other data. And mostly this tools are found with the cyber division cell or with the network service provider or any respective organization.IP Address :- is an another way of tracing a phones exact location, depending upon the time of the call or the text. But it also depends whether while making the phone call or sending text, the phone or the device had an active GPRS connection or not. If the phone had an active GPRS connection while placing the call or sending the text than it can be traced to the location it was passively active, it won\u2019t be the exact or the current location where the phone is present. As it completely depends upon the time stamp of the IP address allotted by the ISP or the Network service provider at that particular time to a particular phone number . So the ISP\u2019s or the Network service providers do keep a log of the IP Addresses allotted to a specific phone number or a specific device. So by taking into account the time of the allocation of the IP address to a specific number the location can be traced. As ISP\u2019s or NSP\u2019s do have the location of the phone when the IP address is allocated, it may not be that precise depending upon other factors, but it may come handy in some situations. IP Address assisted with the active GPS functionality on the phone can give a very precise location. And believe it or not IP addresses have a lot to tell.",

            "answer_text": "There are a few ways for this to happen. For my answer, I\u2019m going to assume you want to do this for business purposes - track phone calls and text messages to see which marketing campaigns are working. To do this, I would suggest checking out a call tracking software platform like PhoneWagon (disclosure: I\u2019m the founder of PhoneWagon). If you want to check out a list of more call tracking software programs and read unbiased reviews, you can head over to Capterra and view a bunch of them on their call tracking software directory. Call tracking software allows you to setup different phone numbers and forward them to your main phone number. When the customer calls, the phone call will go straight to your phone. They won\u2019t know it\u2019s not your main phone number and you won\u2019t know that they called a different number. Then you can login to the dashboard and view these calls and see where your calls are originating. Businesses are using this to help them spend marketing money in the right places. ",
