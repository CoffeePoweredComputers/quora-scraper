            "answer_text": "While the majority of students have working parents and are not returning home directly after school, I disagree with those who have stated that the school system should have to accommodate parents\u2019 working hours and should be responsible for students following regular school hours. It probably would be more practical for the school system to assume responsibility; I think it\u2019s a bad idea on principle. Schools already take on too much responsibility that should belong to parents. Making schools responsible for students\u2019 post-school hours places us that much closer to a system in which we construct dormitories for public elementary school students. Students neither need nor benefit from a longer school day. If lack of affordable quality childcare is a problem, perhaps the public sector does need to step up and fill the gap, but such should not be a mandate of the school system. ",

            "answer_text": "For working parents the question becomes where should the kids be until the parents get off work. Private after school programs or school after school programs. The kids already have that long day. Most kids are not coming home to June Cleaver or Carol Brady. They are going on private buses or empty homes. I think schools could provide a good option. ",
