            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an electronic device that decodes and amplifies encoded radio waves to serve some use, like transmission of audiovisual info. between points. Prior to digital encoding, radio was well used to send and receive analog-encoded audio and video. Analog receivers combine tuners with RF and lower-frequency amplifiers to produce usable output. Digital receivers use data processing to decode incoming signals (which are just encoded data). Wireless technology enables receivers to be very portable devices. There are various approaches to wireless technology, and most of them currently in production use battery or solar-cell power to exploit the remote-use capability. The term wireless could be replaced by the term radio, but the word wireless lends the aura of inherent freedom of movement as a main feature for consumer attraction. Also, radio technology has been around for over a century. The term wireless skews toward less conventional or legacy, hence suggests the latest incarnation of tech. ",

            "answer_text": "In real life 2 people communicate with a speech. One is speaking (transmitter) , another one is listening (receiver). If they are far each one from another one, they may use a cable with a repeater (like in a cord telephone). If they are near to each other, they can have a Wireless communication through air or use an electronics that can transmit their speech over RF, which is also Wireless. For that they need an equipment to receive the signal from RF(receiver) and then convert it back to speech. This is just an example among others . ",
