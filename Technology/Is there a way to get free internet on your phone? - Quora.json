            "answer_text": "Everything that has a value has a price. This is one of the basic laws of economics. So in short, there is no reliable way to get free internet. So unfortunately you cant get totally free internet anywhere. Even free wifi access at coffee shops or pubs is only provided when you buy another service, so the cost is factored in. The best way to get \u201cfree data\u201d is to \u201cfree up\u201d some of your data on your monthly mobile data plan. This is possible if you use a free app called Datamore (I wrote it) from the android play store. It allows you to stream video at a lower rate, and frees up half your data in the process. It is specifically for people who spend a lot of time watching movies and TV on mobile, as video players use up large amounts of our data, regardless of the cost to us. Datamore : Data Saver for Streaming Video - Apps on Google Play Using this app you can limit the data usage AND still enjoy very good video quality. ",
