            "answer_text": "Cars that can steer and brake themselves risk making people in the driver\u2019s seat have a false sense of security. How are these cars going to keep people alert and stop them from becoming careless drivers? Some say that these cars could even cause people to go to sleep at the wheel. How is it possible that these cars are safe? It seems as if the problem car makers and drivers are most concerned about is keeping the driver alert. I don\u2019t believe watching a movie in order to keep drivers from falling asleep is a good idea. In fact, it\u2019s illegal in many states. That is exactly the experiment Stanford students decided to try. Students at Stanford University wanted to find out if using a technique that is now illegal might help keep drivers from falling asleep at the wheel. Students put themselves in a simulated self-driving car to study how they reacted when their robo-chauffer needed help. The experiment was one in a growing number of experiments that assess how cars can hand control back to a person safely when their self-driving software and sensors are overwhelmed or overmatched. Some models are already able to stay in their lane or keep a safe distance from other traffic. Automakers are pushing for more automation; the car-to-driver handoff is a big open question about safety. The elimination of distracted driving is a major selling point for the technology. But in the Stanford experiment, reading or watching a movie helped keep participants awake. Distracted driving would certainly be the act of watching a movie while driving. It makes a personal injury attorney think about what types of distracted driving will be considered \u201cacceptable\u201d with these so-called self-driving automobiles. Among the 48 Stanford students put in the driver\u2019s seat, 13 who were instructed to monitor the car and road began to nod off. Only three did so when told to watch a video or read from a tablet. Alertness mattered when students needed to grab the wheel because a simulated car or pedestrian got in the way. There\u2019s no consensus on the right car-to-driver handoff. The Stanford research suggests that engaging people with media could help, while some automakers are marketing vehicles with limited self-driving features that will slow the car if they detect that a person has stopped paying attention to the road. Although research is ongoing, it appears that people need at least 5 seconds to take over \u2014 if they\u2019re not totally checked out. How do people keep alert? It would make sense to me to not have self-driving cars. Will they be safe considering the timing for handoff in case of an emergency? Self-driving car experts at Google, which is pursuing the technology more aggressively than any automaker, concluded that involving humans would make its cars less safe. Get this, Google\u2019s solution is a prototype with no steering wheel or pedals. Google\u2019s idea is that human control would be limited to go and stop buttons. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t think that there will never be an accident,\u201d says Ron Medford, Google\u2019s director of safety for self-driving cars. Autonomous cars will be \u201cmuch, much better than a human,\u201d he says, but they won\u2019t be perfect. Traditional automakers are making efforts to phase in the technology. Mercedes and Toyota sell cars that can hit the brakes and stay in their lane. By adding new features each year, they might produce a truly self-driving car in about a decade. I myself have a car that causes the steering wheel to vibrate when you get slightly out of your lane. One hazard of this gradualist approach became clear this fall, when Tesla Motors had to explain that its \u201cauto pilot\u201d feature did not mean drivers could stop paying attention. Several videos posted online showed people recording the novelty \u2014 then seizing the wheel when the car made a startling move. Starting late next year, the Cadillac CTS will get a Super Cruise system, which will allow semi-autonomous highway driving. If the driver\u2019s eyes are off the road, and the driver doesn\u2019t respond to repeated prodding, the car slows. \u201cWe are in no way selling this as a technology where the driver can check out,\u201d General Motors spokesman Dan Flores said. \u201cYou can relax, glance away, but you still have to be aware because, you know, the technology\u2019s not foolproof.\u201d Will people try and take a nap behind the wheel if they think the car is in control? Audis A7 test car is hoping you won\u2019t be able to. Here is what consumer reports article Avoiding Crashes with Self Driving-Cars says about the Audi. With the A7 in control, the driver could do other things, although sleeping was not one of them. The vehicle was equipped with two cameras with facial recognition that monitored the driver\u2019s eyes. Giesler showed off that feature in an unnerving moment. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to you, this is still pretty scary for me,\u201d he said as he pretended to sleep. After about 10 seconds the vehicle noticed. An audible alert sounded and, when he still didn\u2019t open his eyes, the vehicle shut down in the middle of the highway and activated the hazard lights. That is a safeguard on the prototype A7 in case the driver is ill or incapacitated. But production cars will be designed so that they can make autonomous lane changes, which will allow the vehicle to safely pull off the road. One conundrum automakers will have to solve: How to get owners to trust the technology so they\u2019ll use it \u2014 but not trust it so much that they\u2019ll be lulled into a false sense of security and therefore be slower to react when the car needs them. Bottom line, people should still be paying attention to the road to avoid careless driving. The human mind can\u2019t \u201ccheck out\u201d while driving these types of new technology automobiles. One might want to consider, most people for many, many years won\u2019t be able to have access to these types of cars. How safe will they ever become when there will always be human factors involved in the majority of the other vehicles on the roadways?

            "answer_text": "With the constant innovation and update in technology, autonomous cars are likely to be the next big thing across the world. The significantly rising number of accidents across the world is expected to fuel the adoption of autonomous cars as they are supposed to be highly effective in reducing the number of road accidents and make streets safer by automating safety features. The advancements in technology are likely to enable autonomous cars to save tens of thousands of lives every year, lost to traffic accidents and fatalities due to the human errors in judgment, which will eventually reflect on their sale in the future. Along with this, the seamless connectivity offered by autonomous cars, which enable vehicles to ride closer together with the help of sensors, allowing more cars on the road with less traffic and reducing congestion, is also projected to add substantially to the growth of this market in years to come. However, the lack of clarity over laws and regulations may hinder the market to some extent.
