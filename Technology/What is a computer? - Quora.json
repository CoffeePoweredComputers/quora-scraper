            "answer_text": "This question has a very simple answer. This question also has an interesting, albeit longer answer, in my opinion. As this question was tagged under computer science, I'll write down both. First, the simple answer:   When you hear someone talking about a computer, this is probably what they meant. Well, it probably didn't have arms, or was creepily euphoric, but it was a device with a screen, keyboard and mouse/touchpad, which ran, most likely, either Windows, Mac OS X or Linux. That's the way we normally use the word computer in our daily lives. But a computer, is simply anything that computes. Uh... what does compute mean then? Compute is the verb that denotes performing a computation. Uh... what is a computation then? Now we are starting to get somewhere! A computation is the evaluation of an expression. Let's deconstruct that further! What does evaluating mean? By the strictest sense of the word, when you evaluate something, you are assigning that something a value. So what is an expression? An expression is something that denotes an idea that can be evaluated. Where are you trying to get with this? That the meaning of computer is something that evaluates ideas that can be evaluated. The geekiest will probably have cringed their teeth at the sound of that potential recursion - and that's exactly what I'm trying to get that. What we call computers is a very small subset of them as a whole, but in reality they are much more.  When we see the colour red and we associate it with red, we have evaluated an expression. Our eyes have sent optical signals to our brain, through a network of neurons, which have subsequently determined that what we saw is red. The physical colour, the photons that hit the retina, were the expression, and it was evaluated as our personal, internal conception of the colour red. Therefore our brains are able to evaluate things that can be evaluated, and hence they are computers. On the other end of the scale, a mouse operates on the same principle, just with lesser evaluation capabilities (some may disagree), and hence we are better at learning and being creative. For all we know, the universe could be considered a computer. Physics has given us formulas that very accurately predict the behaviour of the universe. And just because we will never know the complete state of it doesn't mean it isn't. Computers don't have to be deterministic at all, it's just that most of the ones we interact with operate in that way. ",

            "answer_text": "What is a computer? Basically, a computer is an electronic machine that can carry out calculations and is able to store information. In order to do these things, a computer uses different programs for specific tasks. For example, it has a word processing program for typing letters and a program called a Web Browser for searching and browsing the internet. Computers also come in different shapes and sizes e.g. laptops, desktops and tablets but they are all able to perform the same or similar tasks. Beginnings The first programmable computer, designed by Charles Babbage in the 1830s, was mechanical rather than electronic. Unfortunately it was never built, and it wasn't until World War II that British code breakers built Colossus, the world's first programmable and fully electronic computer. However, Colossus still didn't include a number of elements present in modern computers. Finally, after the war, a complete computer was built in Manchester by the great mathematician Alan Turing, who had worked with the code breakers. From science project to everyday tool Computers were initially of interest only to scientists and engineers. But from the human\u2013computer interaction theories of mouse inventor Douglas Engelbart in the 1960s to the release of the Apple Macintosh computer in 1984, they became easier to use and more capable of tasks that ordinary people could carry out. Now, with the spread of personal computers (PCs), mobile phones, notebooks and tablets, computers have become part of our everyday lives. It's almost impossible to imagine modern society without them. Highlights in the development of the computer Computers started out as huge racks of glass valves and wires that occupied multiple rooms and weighed tons. Now they can fit on tiny microchips that are barely larger than an ant and are millions of times more powerful than the first ones.Computers have a huge variety of uses. Originally employed to break enemy codes and calculate artillery trajectories, they're now used for everything from word processing and spreadsheets to mobile phones and playing games.The number of computers in the world has risen incredibly. Urban myth has it that, in the 1950s, the head of IBM estimated a global market for five \u2013 yes, five \u2013 computers. But within the next few years, it's expected that there will be 2 billion computers \u2013 and that figure doesn't even include computers built into other devices.In the late 1960s, the American government created ARPANET, a network that allowed the few university and military computers in the US to talk to each other. This eventually turned into the internet, a global web that connects well over a billion computers \u2013 and people \u2013 to each other.",
