            "answer_text": "The iPhone 12 Mini is certainly a compelling phone. The original iPhone SE \u2014 basically an iPhone 5 with a 4\u2033 screen but technology two generations newer, introduced a half-year after the iPhone 6S at a bargain price \u2014 was 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6 mm and weighed 113 grams. The 2020 iPhone SE \u2014 basically an iPhone 8 with a 4.7\u2033 screen but technology two generations newer, introduced a half-year after the iPhone 11 at a bargain price \u2014 is 138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3 mm and weighs 149 grams. It was the \u201cspiritual successor\u201d to the original iPhone SE, and tens of millions of people who wanted a cheaper iPhone, smaller than most other iPhones (if still markedly bigger than the original iPhone SE) bought it. But this year\u2019s iPhone SE really offered very little over the iPhone 8 except for a years-newer, faster CPU. So there were people who wanted an iPhone that was small, but not merely a speed-bumped version of an old model. That market niche hadn\u2019t really been addressed by Apple before \u2014 there was always a correlation between \u201csmaller screen\u201d and \u201clower price.\u201d The iPhone 12 mini is clearly aimed at that niche. In terms of size and weight, it\u2019s bigger than the original iPhone SE but smaller than the 2020 iPhone SE, coming in at 131.5 x 64.2 x 7.4 mm and weighing 135 grams. But there\u2019s no old technology to be found. Its 5.4-inch display is larger than that of the 2020 SE, and it has twice the pixel density of older iPhones, for a 2340x1080 display. It\u2019s also OLED instead of IPS LCD. It\u2019s got the latest CPU, dual cameras, 5G including mmWave, Face ID, 6-meter water resistance, 30fps HDR video recording, 1080p FaceTime calling\u2026 yeah, lots of goodies in a small package. So for those who wanted an iPhone that\u2019s small but also completely cutting-edge, the iPhone 12 mini is certainly what they were calling for. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it is. It\u2019s even closer to the iPhone 5/5S/SE design and dimensions than I expected. When they introduced the iPhone X, which was roughly the size of the iPhone 6/6s etc but all screen, the first thing I thought was \u201cI hope they do it to the SE\u201d. It\u2019s remarkably close to it now. Now the thing is, it\u2019s also much more expensive than the original iPhone SE was. In fact it\u2019s almost twice as expensive. So that may hold people off but I believe it\u2019s the closest we\u2019ll get for the time being, as I don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll touch the iPhone SE anytime soon. ",
