            "answer_text": "Einstein did not discover the photoelectric effect, so it\u2019s hard to say whether he should be given credit for technologies that directly or indirectly rely on it, like photoelectric or photovoltaic cells. However, his explanation of the effect in terms of a particle of light, for which he won the Nobel Prize, was one of the founding principles of quantum mechanics. Thus, he deserves partial credit for the solid state electronics of today, which rely on quantum mechanics. His general and special theories of relativity are used in the construction of geopositioning systems. His special theory of relativity is fundamental to the design of large particle colliders, which certainly constitute a modern technology. Einstein, along with Leo Szilard, invented an absorption refrigerator with no moving parts. It was never put to practical use in his lifetime, but recently has received some attention for producing refrigeration in remote areas. Einstein refrigerator - Wikipedia I will not cite nuclear energy here. It\u2019s true that Einstein\u2019s theories helped explain the apparent mass defect when matter was converted to other kinds of energy in a nuclear reaction (by using Einstein\u2019s famous E=mc^2 relationship.) However, credit for discovering nuclear energy belongs to people such as the Curies and Enri Becquerel. ",
