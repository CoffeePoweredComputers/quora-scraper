            "answer_text": "All I ever hear about from regular people is that they only understand and perceive that 5G is faster. Thus, that is all they talk about. There are 8 metrics that 5G improves over 4G and they are not all related to a faster speed. Even many of the experts have the same continuing myopic focus on the mobile device that\u2019s 10 inches in front of them, i.e. the smartphone. Meanwhile, the true impetus for 5G is to handle the tsunami of IoT devices with 10x lower latency, coverage density, longer range, etc that will be 10x times more in devices than the total world population.  Notice that \u201cArea Traffic Capacity\u201d is 100 times. ",

            "answer_text": "no need to overdo yourself just to have 5G, it probably won\u2019t be available for another few years anyway. 4G is fine for pretty much anything nowadays. 5G would benefit big tech companies more than they would an average consumer. Companies like Baidu, or even Tesla, can use 5G to their advantage. Especially with Baidu creating self automated taxis, they can use 5G to help make their vehicles safer, along with their ambitions of creating \u2018Smart Roads\u2019, to help detect vehicles and people who are also on the road.
