            "answer_text": "For many people dealing with illness and injury, the only sources of information on their condition are dry medical textbooks, doctors who often aren\u2019t up to date on their field of study, or the internet where many search results are less than helpful due to the domination of companies trying to sell their products regardless of whether anyone wants them. This list is a grab bag of cutting edge medical technology assembled by an engineer for no purpose other than to help patients connect to treatments and tools that may help them. If you are healthy today, the first section on patient education may still give you some useful tools. Articles are arranged by probable usefulness, with more space devoted to solutions that could help more people. Many links to \u2018MedGadget\u2019 may have timed out as they delete their articles after a year, but I\u2019ve tried to link to source material in such cases to keep the information available. Interesting information/patient education:  Most drugs last far past their expiration date Turns out the FDA rules on when to throw away drugs are based on fiction and pixies, so much so the US government doesn\u2019t even follow their rules. This waste costs around $765 billion each year.  3D4Medical \u2013 awesome free to $50 anatomy app Amazing anatomy software good enough to train doctors but simple enough for consumers to use. Incredibly complex 3D anatomical models that can be sliced, searched and moved to understand how our bodies should work and how they can fail. When you talk to an auto mechanic, the smart consumer brings the manual along to show what\u2019s wrong. Is your body less important than your car?

Interesting technology. Emergency medicine:  Doctor finds GIK prevents 80% of damage from heart attacks This is a life and death difference for anyone suffering from a heart attack: a dose of glucose, insulin and potassium injected upon discovery of the heart attack drastically reduces the damage and improves likelihood of survival. The original study in the 1950\u2019s was botched, and so this sat on the shelf. Today we know it works, but mixing three cheap drugs together doesn\u2019t make enough profit for the pharmacy industry, so they\u2019re not interested in making GIK. The good news is it can be delivered from common hospital medications IF anyone bothered to train the doctors on how and why to use it. If you work with a hospital, read this and get the staff trained to use it to save lives.  The Butterfly IQ ultrasound costs $2000 and fits in a pocket. If you practice any flavor of emergency medicine you should have one in your pocket because quick diagnostics can save time and lives. If you want to learn how to read ultrasounds, its all online from UV Ervine: \u200eEmergency Ultrasound on Apple Podcasts  Res-Q-CPR Turns out this thing improves odds of survival by 49%. Yes really. The company that cooked this up was bought out by Zoll back in the twenty teens, but they never bothered to advertise it so a lot of people don\u2019t know it exists. Its a $42 suction cup on a thousand dollar handle, combined with a $100 check valve that fits into an ambu-bag. We\u2019ve implemented this at the factory I work at. Does your facility use and train on this?  2.8 Lb Lifebot defibrillator is worlds smallest (in 2014) There have been attempts at a cell phone defibrillator, but none I know of have entered production.  SyncThink Oculus rift program detects concussions \u2013 no calibration needed, FDA cleared  PowdAir Open source dry powder inhaler for developing nations This all plastic four piece design cuts open all standard size pills to deliver drugs simply and easily in the field. There are no metal parts to rust, and nothing to fall off or get lost. When the choice is an inhaler or death in the bush, this is a very cheap, simple and reliable tool to have.  Vayu drone carries 4.5lbs of samples 40 miles from remote areas for diagnostics/emergencies  Otter Newborn Warmer - prototype In rural hospitals, newborns and premature babies sometimes die due to simple lack of warmth. Infant warmers are all built for developed hospitals and are pricey, complicated and difficult to maintain. The otter will be cheap, simple and easy to use, and is undergoing testing in Haiti, Vietnam and Sierre Leone.

It\u2019s essentially a big capacitor bank and a hand held coil employed for ten to twenty minute sessions to treat Depression and other mental conditions. Its painless, has virtually no side effects and is FDA cleared for a few conditions, but it\u2019s in its infancy as a treatment. Promising studies have shown its potential to improve OCD, Autism and several other conditions.  Deep brain stimulation without surgery! \u2013 TIS \u2013 Temporary interfering stimulation Parkinson\u2019s, epilepsy and other brain illness treated with deep brain stimulation normally require holes in the skull and electrodes in the brain area to be effected. These researchers figured out how to do the same thing with electrodes on the scalp using two high frequency signals that interfere and stimulate the area that needs it. They used mice, but with scaled up electronics the same could work for the rest of us.

If you work with IV\u2019s and haven\u2019t seen this before, check this out \u2013 these things save a fortune in time and injury, and they\u2019re cheap enough you can buy your own for under $100.  Donor lungs last 56 hours (instead of 6) outside the body with organ life support rig If you or a loved one is in need of lungs, this article could help \u2013 80% of transplant lungs are apparently thrown away because they can\u2019t get to the recipient in their 6 hours of viability. This new life support system kept the lungs alive for 56 hours and lead to a successful transplant. More of these systems at major hospitals would mean more lungs and more lives saved. Video.  Burn out offending brain tissue with crossed ultrasound beams in a 1.5T and 3.0T MRI scanner FDA approved. \u201cDon\u2019t cross the streams!\u201d may work for the ghost busters, but in this case, crossed ultrasound beams are used to burn out offending brain tissue responsible for Essential tremor. Could this also be used to target other things that shouldn\u2019t be growing inside the skull?

            "answer_text": "Emerging technologies are constantly changing the landscape of the healthcare industry. Here are some examples of how medical technology has changed in recent years.  1. Wearable Monitoring Patches: This is the next level to traditional monitoring systems. Their ability to provide continuous monitoring, which is far better than periodic readings, leads to improved patient care. Sensors used include those that can monitor a person's stress and anxiety level, which is compared to the patient's pulse and blood pressure to provide them personalized feedback. 2. Edible chip: Hospitals these days are using ingestible computer chip, which can be embedded into the pills to determine the performance of medication. This information can be tracked even on mobile devices. Therefore helping the healthcare provider to keep track of how the medication is working and make necessary changes whenever needed. 3. Chatbots: AI software that is designed to conduct a conversation via audio or text is used by physicians to reduce their workloads. These chatbots are capable of triaging patients and make care recommendation to physicians. 4. m-Health: It is the abbreviation used for mobile health. It is a term used for the practice of medicines and healthcare assistance supported by mobile devices. These devices collect healthcare information delivers them to the practitioners to detect the abnormalities inside the body; these data are then used by the healthcare provider to recommend appropriate medication. With each year passing, healthcare industries are deploying these advanced technologies at an alarming rate. And thus contribute to the improvement of the quality of healthcare in the near future. ",
