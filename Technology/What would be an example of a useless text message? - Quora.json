I took my eggs out of the car and was walking toward the building when I thought to look at it. The text was from the guy who runs the market, and it said, \"Are you close?\" I stopped walking and from the sidewalk in front of the building, sent a reply: \"You might say that.\" I saw the message had been sent, so I put my phone back in my pocket, and went inside. The guy was in the middle of reading my text when I walked in: he looked up and said, \"You sent this from the parking lot!\" I said, \"Technically, it was the sidewalk.\" ",

This person literally couldn\u2019t even be bothered to give the courtesy of the second letter by typing \u201cok\u201d, never mind anything else. They might just as well have left you on read. So yeah, that\u2019s about as useless as text messages get. ",
