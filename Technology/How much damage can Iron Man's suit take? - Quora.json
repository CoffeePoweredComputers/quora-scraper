            "answer_text": "I am making a few assumptions about your question: one you\u2019re asking how much force or energy is needed to cause a complete failure of the armor (the armor loses some functionality all the time, but Stark always works around this) or death of user/pilot, two modern iterations of the armor. The iron man suit really is not that impressive when it comes to durability. Because modern weaponry is so destructive it is a waste of resources to sufficiently armor something, durability is inefficient. What you want is an aggressive enough offense to prevent the enemy from even attacking, the ability to avoid an attack, or the ability nullify the attack i.e don't get hit. Stark knows this. He can hit targets before he is even in range of their weapons, or rapidly insert himself into the field and destroy them before they have a chance to counter attack; even if they are able to launch an attack he has point defenses to avoid or nullify the attack. Usually (meaning mooks not the big bad) at best one would only achieve a minor damage, and he can swap broken/worn parts for new ones mid battle. Any anti armor weaponry could probably kill him if you can get a clean hit that if is the caveat. ",
