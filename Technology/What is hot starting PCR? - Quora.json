            "answer_text": "Hot-Start PCR is a variant of PCR commonly employed to prevent the amplification of the non-target sequence. In the reaction mixtures, all the components are present which includes the polymerase, primers, dNTPs etc. Taq polymerase is an enzyme which works effectively at 72 \u00b0C. But sometimes, even at low temperature, the enzyme has some residual activity which can amplify the non-target sequence due to non-specific primer annealing. To prevent this, after denaturation step, we add Taq polymerase. The alternative to this is to use antibodies. The antibodies would bind the Taq polymerase and prevent its activity until the denaturation step. Modification to the Taq polymerase using acid anhydride can be carried which would modify the lysine residues.  Image[1] Once the reaction mixture is loaded to the PCR machine, the step one is denaturation of the DNA at 92 \u00b0C; which would act as activation step for the enzyme. At this temperature, the antibody linked to the Taq polymerase would be released. Also, if a modification to the Taq polymerase is carried out then it would be reverted. Thus, the polymerase would become active. Once the Taq polymerase is active, it would be stable and amplify the DNA with high fidelity. There are several master mix available such as AmpliTaqGold, which provides the Taq polymerase associated with the antibody. AmpliTaq Gold and AmpliTaq Gold 360 DNA Polymerases are hot-start enzymes which utilize a chemical modification to inhibit enzyme activity at room temperature. Upon activation the modifier is permanently released, resulting in an enzyme that becomes active at a temperature above the primer annealing temperature. Thus the only products extended and amplified are those with highly specific priming[2]. In a nutshell, hot start PCR would reduce the non-specific amplification, increases the fidelity of the reaction, prevents primer dimer formation, and increases the yield.
