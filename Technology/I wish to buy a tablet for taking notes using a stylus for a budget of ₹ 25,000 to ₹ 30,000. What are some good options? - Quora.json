Otherwise you can also buy iPad 2018 at a discounted price .. There\u2019s not much of a difference in both other than screen real state. My two roommates, one have iPad 2018, other have iPad 2019.. So I\u2019ve seen both, they\u2019ll be the best option for notes taking and educational purposes.. ",
