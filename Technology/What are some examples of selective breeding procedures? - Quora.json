I will breed that monster and then breed those offspring together for many generations to get more monsters with red toenails.\" (3) Breeding with a specific understanding of genetics. \"I like monsters that are splotchy, but not solid white monsters. I know that splotchy monsters have one copy of the splotchy gene and white monsters have two, so I will only breed splotchy to solid monsters to get half splotchy and no white monsters.\" ",
