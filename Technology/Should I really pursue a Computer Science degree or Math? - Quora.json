            "answer_text": "Let me offer you some advice. Speaking as a math major, I think I can help you out here. From looking at your comment, I just first want to address the fact you would love to solve a millennial problem. Like you, thousands of mathematicians or budding mathematicians who have way more experience than you or I would also love to find a proof for a millennial problem since that is pretty much the pinnacle of success you can get in the field of mathematics (you get USD $1M and if you do it by the ripe age of 40 you get a fields medal!). I would also like to say that despite thousands of mathematicians in existence, very few have solved any. Do you know why? Those millennial problems are HARD. Even brilliant mathematicians like Terrance Tao don\u2019t know how to solve them. Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem (even though this wasn\u2019t one of the 7 millennial problems) was just recently solved by Andrew Wiles and before this, the problem remained unsolved for 358 YEARS. My point is, yes, any mathematician or math major would LOVE to solve one of those problems. Those are hard problems to solve for anybody working in the field of mathematics. For Andrew Wile\u2019s proof, new math had to be R&D\u2019d in order for him to find success. My point is, don\u2019t put that kind of pressure on yourself or you\u2019ll go mad. Secondly, now addressing what your major should be. Nobody can tell you what you should major in. You should major in something that you love doing yet can help pay the bills (or some compromise or balance of those\u2026 this could possibly mean a double major!) so you don\u2019t wake up to an eviction notice. I am majoring in math because I never mind studying math and I can\u2019t see myself studying anything else (even though I\u2019ve been playing guitar since I was 5). I simply love math and wake up feeling excited to go to my math courses and learn new math and gain a better understanding of the world around me. My question for you is what makes you feel this way? I will say though, getting no higher than a C+ in those courses is not good (sorry to be blunt). Discrete Math is hard, yes, I struggled in that too, but precalc along with calc 1 and 2 are the easy classes in a math major. If you got a C+ in those you will likely greatly struggle (like, \u201cdrown\u201d kind of struggle) when you take beyond calc 3 or linear algebra (the calc 3 and proof based kind that most math majors take). Also, being a math major takes serious work. It certainly isn\u2019t easy and if you\u2019re not willing to work hard in your classes (which some might infer from your C+\u2019s) then pursuing a degree in either Math or CS is certainly not a smart choice since both are hard degrees. Even for hard workers those classes are difficult. Especially if you say you suck at proofs (I assume you\u2019re talking about the proofs you saw in discrete math, not those stupid euclidean geometry proofs), a course in Probability Theory, Real Analysis, or Abstract Algebra would be your death sentence. I don\u2019t mean to sound harsh, I\u2019m just saying those are very difficult and proof intensive courses and from what you\u2019ve described in the comments, those would be terrible for your GPA (which yes, does matter. Most employers like to see at least a 3.0). GPA isn\u2019t everything, but, between the thousands upon thousands of dollars it costs to in the end, receive a piece of paper that says \u201cCongrats! You earned a degree in X!\u201d You should make the most of your investment (your college education) since most employers and grad schools care about your GPA enough to where if you have below a 3.0, you got some explaining to do. Especially if your parents are paying for your college (no shame in this), you should at least show them that they aren\u2019t wasting their money by having you get terrible grades and in the end struggle to get a job or find a grad school that will accept you. Thirdly, it\u2019s certainly true that a lot of CS stuff is online. Between CodeCademy, Coursera, Udacity, MIT opencourseware, etc., you could probably find a whole undergraduate CS curriculum. But, these courses wouldn\u2019t be the same as a degree (even though you could have taken all those courses online). Employers or grad schools want to see you have a degree in something. You said that you\u2019ve considered just sticking with CS since you know it well, then maybe you could pursue CS! A degree in CS opens up many doors for you and is just a great degree to have in general in an ever evolving technological world. You definitely don\u2019t have to take as much math (you\u2019re probably pretty much done based on the courses you\u2019ve already taken) and it\u2019s not a proof intensive major. You can come out of college with a good paying job with fair hours and it is a stable career. You said you\u2019re a deep thinker though, so why not philosophy? Believe it or not, a degree in philosophy isn\u2019t a one way ticket to poverty haha. George Soros started a world renown hedge fund and he has a degree and a PhD in philosophy. He used what he learned in studying philosophy and applied it to markets and that\u2019s how he found his investment successes. You could also go into Law, Criminal Justice, Politics, or even Healthcare. It\u2019s just an idea though. So to answer your question you asked on Quora, to provide a definitive answer, I would say CS. That being said though, ask yourself what kind of life and career do you want to have? When asking yourself this you must be realistic with your goals. This does not include solving a millennial problem or making a million dollars a year or something of the sort. What are your hobbies, what do you love to do? How many hours a week would you like to work? Would you want to work in a big mecca city like NYC, Chicago, Washington DC, San Francisco, or Austin? These are important questions to ask yourself when choosing/finding a major (which is why it is totally okay to change majors in college. I came in as a finance major hoping to double major between finance and math but they wouldn\u2019t let me so I just dropped finance). What do you love to learn? What courses are you excited about attending? Which ones do you not enjoy? What kind of life do you want to live? You\u2019ll have to do some hard thinking and maybe come to realize a thing or two about your career options and what not based on your majors (which is okay, literally everybody in college has to face these decisions), but you\u2019ll figure it all out, I\u2019m sure! Stick with CS and see where it takes you. If you like it, great! Wonderful! If after a few courses/semesters you\u2019re like, \u201cehh, maybe I could try something else\u201d then do it! College is the one time in life where you have a plethora of opportunities at your hands to try and see what you like and find out what you don\u2019t like. Even upon graduation you don\u2019t have to have your whole life figured out, not many do. You can pick up a job or go to grad school and narrow down your choices. This is what I\u2019m figuring out right now. I know I want to continue being a math major with a CS minor, but what I want as a job? I have no flipping idea haha. I\u2019m thinking maybe Cryptography (NSA, etc.), Actuarial Science, Quantitative Analysis, Data Science, or just being a professor. Through internships and online research, networking, and college courses, you\u2019ll find these answers out. The world is full of opportunities. Find them and take advantage of them and run with them and see where they take you. Do this while you\u2019re young because the moment you get a family or get into your mid thirties or forties, this is incredibly difficult to do. The sooner you realize that, the better I think you\u2019ll be. It\u2019s helped me and because it has helped me, I think it could maybe help you! I hope this helps and is a good answer to your question! Good Luck with all your endeavors! You\u2019ll choose the right thing for you, I\u2019m sure of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Since you don't mention an explicit passion exactly, it depends on your \u201cmeasure of goodness,\u201d i.e. what you're trying to optimize for. If you're going for employability at the Bachelor's level, CompSci wins hands-down. It's very easy to get a job from a mid-tier school with mid-tier grades, especially in Silicon Valley. If you're looking to write code, again CS wins hands-down. You CAN get a coding job as a math major, but the core concepts of cs (particularly data structures, algorithms, and paradigms) give you a huge boost. If you're looking to solve practical problems in math, both are pretty good majors (CS has a surprisingly high number of unsolved or undersolved problems, particularly relating to discrete math and stats). If you're looking to do analysis (as in stats, visualization, etc) then both are good at a high level (practicality varies based on specific circumstance). If you want to teach at a university as a career, work on crypto for e.g. the NSA, or get a Master's or doctorate in something else, a math BS is a good place to start. Indeed, if you want a relevant job in Math and don't want a degree in the STE parts of STEM, you're looking at either a teaching credential for K-12 or an advanced degree for college. So if you're signing up for a math BS, you're by default signing up for extra work as well. Of course, if you're that passionate about math, extra work is a non-issue. Right? :-) ",
