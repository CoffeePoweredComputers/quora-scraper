Almost every international institutions now has made it clear that any new name of countries on the list with nukes \u2026that country is going to suffer by \u201csanctions\u201d but believe me \u201cPREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE\u201d ie: even civil nuclear deals should be under constant evaulation & surveilance or else If a country has got its hands on it I hope it\u2019s a country ruled by a sane minded govt. If the country having nukes is of sane govt. then no need to worry \u2026\u2026 the biggest threat to HUMANITY is if a NUKE falls in the wrong hands like a terrorist outfit\u2026because if a \u201cCOUNTRY\u201d is using nukes it can be punished by retaliation from others\u2026ie MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION strategy which will make the aggressor think twice before attacking but if a non state actor smuggles a NUKE into a sovereign country the amount of confusion on \u201cwho did what?\u201d & \u201cwho to punish?\u201d would be epic & when its found that it was done by a terrorist outfit we just can\u2019t bomb their country to oblivion as they(terrorists) are just a few among thousands of innocent civilians \u2026\u2026 THAT\u2019S WHAT THE WORLD FEARS THE MOST \u2026..BTW if there are nukes in the world at least 2 opposing countries should have it or else the only country with nukes will become a bully nation ; From 1945 to 1949 only USA had nukes in 1949 came Soviets then we know the others. So in my opinion there should be either no nukes or at least 2 opposing parties with nukes trust me it will be always better than NUCLEAR MONOPOLY. I don\u2019t support nuclear disarmament of any countries which already possesses nukes, as it will be ineffective or it will make those nations vulnerable to threats; But I am totally against new nations(both sane or insane govt.),terrorist outfits trying to get nukes\u2026 even those who test nukes in this millennium (D.P.R.K\u2026 we call it North Korea) should be punished in civil ways if possible & only punished militarily when all else fails.

            "answer_text": "The immediate effect would be minimal as most stable nations are led by rational leaders. You\u2019ll need to exempt many African nations as they are nations in name only. Somalia for example. Which Somalian government are you proposing have nuclear weapons? There are concerns and some of the nations I am most concerned about have or are are trying to build nuclear weapons. Iran and North Korea being two of the nations in the world we LEAST want to have nukes. India and Pakistan worry me greatly. Their animosity is so great and their nukes are low enough powered and few enough they are tempted to use them. Watching Pakistanis and Indians argue and frequency in which they toss threats of nuking each other is disconcerting. Sure you might hear an Englishman or a Frenchie or an American talk about nuking so and so from time to time, but there\u2019s nothing behind that but hot air. I fear there might be more than idle threats the way these 2 go about it. The biggest issues are security and environmental impacts. Most nations could not secure nuclear weapons. A band of well trained mercs could penetrate their best defenses without issue then sell the stolen nukes on the black market. Best defenses meaning not much defense at all. There are several nations in the world that do not even have a military. Dozens where the military is a farce consisting of a few thousand poorly trained men running around with antique weapons. A more likely scenario is for the government itself to sell the nukes or for high ranking government officials to steal them and sell them. Corruption is a huge issue in most third world nations and the primary reason they are third world nations to begin with. Net result is every terrorist group able to raise $20 mill would have at least 1 nuke as well as a few major crime organizations. Most nations do not have the technical knowledge or could afford the safe storage, testing and eventual safe disposal of said nukes. Just taking care of 5 nukes is expensive and dangerous. The costs could easily exceed many nations total GDP. So dozens of nations would 20 years from now face leaking nukes and an environmental nightmare they couldn\u2019t pay for. The economic impact of development costs and maint on the nukes would bankrupt many nations or costs could easily drive them into civil war. The lack of any sort of effective government in several African nations is also disturbing. A small group of one of Congo\u2019s many splinter rebel groups handed nukes might actually try to use them. Such a group might easily capture them from a government that\u2019s mostly in governing name only. Some of the smallest and most densely packed nations, where were are you going to put them that is a couple miles from populations? While accidental discharge is incredibly unlikely, a leaky warhead which is likely, could poison thousands before anybody knew it was leaking. It could destroy an entire nations drinking water or wipe out part of it\u2019s bread basket if improperly stored and tested. There is a rather limited supply of necessary fissionable material. This would shut down most of the worlds non-breeder reactors for either lack of fuel or it would make nuclear energy prohibitively expensive. It would also wipe out thousands of scientific research projects which need nuclear materials or power from small nuclear reactors. What it would not do is equalize power. You could literally not fit enough warheads in some nations to equal the size of the military superpower\u2019s nuclear arsenals. Producing enough nukes to make a world wide MAD agreement is simply beyond our resources. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer would be analogous to \u201cWhat if every human had a kilo of gold to himself?\u201d. Simple, it will lose it's value of being a perfect deterrent . Though it would be very dangerous, so every world leader would vouch for nuclear proliferation, disarmament and stricter monitoring of nuclear weapons. Every terrorist organisation would be after it, so increased threat to safety of civilians. The intelligence wings of every country would try for espionage missions to avert nuclear threats from its adversaries. ",

Assad would have used them in Syria rather than chemical weapons. With a number of countries being messed up there would have been a good chance terrorists would get access to them, after all if Pakistan fell into Islamic fundamentalist hands the US and India wouldn\u2019t let Pakistan keep their nukes - they\u2019d either get nuked by India or the US would send in special forces to seize them.
