            "answer_text": "Anyone that tries to provide a clear winner for this question is simply wrong. The leading contenders are Apple, Google, Samsung and Huawei. The reason there are no clear winners is become camera technology is multi-faceted with no one vendor winning in all areas. What makes the best camera technology is a combination of the lens(es), the ISP on the SoC and the overall software technology stack including AI. For example, Google is doing a nice job with AI. They are producing results which clearly extend beyond their competitors with similar hardware. They have great low light capabilities for example, and they can do a reasonable job with simulating bokeh with just one lens. Remarkable. However, devices like the Pixel have just one lens and are inherently inferior to a good multi-lens system. At the same time, nobody is doing video as well as Apple right now or even gets color accuracy as good. Samsung is very competitive in this space and has better hardware than Google, but is not a clear winner either. Huawei has even better camera hardware but is lacking in software. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. You asked: Which phone has the most advanced camera technology ever? None of them. Phone cameras are hamstrung by having itty bitty, teeny tiny sensors and a lens which does not zoom, meaning that zooming is done digitally. Go ahead, zoom in as close as you can and take a photo with your phone. Now look closely at your photo that you took. It may even look pixelated without you having to zoom in any more. An SLR or compact camera, whether film or digital, equipped with a zoom lens will run circles around your phone camera in terms of picture quality. I know this, my 10 year old DSLR runs circles around my two year old smart phone in terms of picture quality. Know something else? My 20+ year old film SLRs will run circles around my DSLR in terms of quality as well, under the right conditions. I\u2019ve even got a couple of cameras in excess of 60 years old that can easily keep up with my DSLR. Where my phone camera wins is convenience. I almost always have my phone camera with me; I can\u2019t say the same thing for my DSLR or my film cameras. ",
