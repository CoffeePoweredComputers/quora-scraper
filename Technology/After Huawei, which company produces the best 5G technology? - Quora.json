            "answer_text": "Assuming you mean networking equipment rather than phones, there are several alternatives, though before the ramp up on pressure on Chinese companies in general and Huawei in particular, Huawei was the leader. They were offering some of the best performing products with a very compelling price, which is why there is significant push back from Telcos against attempts to block Huawei. You don\u2019t get a similar issue with ZTE, who are far smaller and less popular, because there was a lot less interest in using them anyway. Major competitors for Huawei are ZTE, though being Chinese they share a lot of the same concerns, Nokia and Ericsson, who are long standing providers of this infrastructure who while very good and well respected had been edged out by Huawei in recent years, and Samsung, a huge company in all kinds of business but specifically are growing quickly in network infrastructure. These are all full-stack suppliers, so you could build an entire 5G network using only equipment from a single vendor. Other companies do supply some 5G equipment - such as Cisco, who are big on the routing and switching front, but as far as I am aware do not produce the radio or much of the core equipment. Qualcomm often comes up in these discussions, and they are a key part of the 5G ecosystem, but I don\u2019t think I have seen them sell any network infrastructure. I think they are more involved in the development because the network infrastructure has to be developed alongside the modems that will connect to the network, where Qualcomm is the dominant provider.

            "answer_text": "Huawei is just one of the 3 large international corporations, who can supply the whole bandwidth of mobile network equipment. the other two are Ericsson from Sweden and Nokia from Finland (Nokia has acquired the remains of Bell Labs, as part of their Alcatel acquisition few years ago. And that deal was paid for by the proceeds of Microsoft acquisition of Nokias handset branch - Balmer\u2019s last failure before he was ousted from MS, just to note on the side). There are others who can do bits and pieces, like Cisco in the Core Network, or Samsung and NEC as supplier of some radio technology. An operator needs a partner with full capabilities and a commitment for cooperation during 10 years, though. And that they only find in the big companies, All three world-leading suppliers are approximately at a par when it comes to capabilities, capacities and state of development. After all China Unicom and China Mobile, the two Chinese giant mobile networks, give large contracts to Ericsson and Nokia. Why would they do that if Huawei was so advanced as they tell all the time?
