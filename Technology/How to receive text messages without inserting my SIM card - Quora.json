            "answer_text": "Use the same text phone number on the internet and receive your messages on the internet instead of a phone. I do almost all my texting on the internet, because I prefer a keyboard to my thumbs. Get yourself a google voice account and your text number can be incorporated. My GV online account links to my smartphone and a third number, even though the three numbers are not the same. If I send an email from my google voice, it will not appear on my smartphone. But if someone writes back to my GV online phone number, that voicemail will appear on my smart phone also. I\u2019ve been asked by my bank for a textable phone number. They won\u2019t accept my google voice number even if it would work, because its not on a list of numbers they look up that are supposedly all the possible textable numbers. But it would work anyway if they only tried it. The reason: the banks want the number I give them to be a cellphone number: that is their understanding of what a textable number is. Friends of mine routinely, incidentally, send me email via their phone numbers on their cellphones too by simply texting me. I get emails from them that have nothing but their email number as an address. I write back using my normal email address and they get what I wrote as a text. I assume you know your phone won\u2019t communicate without a sim card in it?! But I can be reached anyway even if my cellphone isn\u2019t on. Also, most phones when dialed will not produce a caller ID number on a called phone unless it rings twice. I get a caller ID with just one ring on google voice. My credit card company writes a short statement to my phone\u2019s email account every time I use any credit card I have. That short statement winds up in my gmail every time that happens and appears as a text and also as an email. I have records of every call I\u2019ve received, including texts, all the way back to August, 2009. Google Voice, incidentally, will convert a voicemail into text on my google voice program online.

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean as text messages if you mean actual SMS or MMS you need a service provider to receive and send those type of messages. If you're using iPhone or any free text and calling app they are strictly using WiFi signals to encode and decide messages which is not bound to any service provider, and is truly unlimited in the ammount of text sent, received, and data sent. Really it comes down to how fast both partys wifi is. Kind of unrelated but this is why SMS/ MMS are total garbage when it comes to any video or picture taking. You can send a nice 4k video and when it's received on the other end it's so compressed to fit the maximum 4mb file format it looks like it was shot underwater through 50 panes of glass. Its really bad. iMessage Doesn't suffer from this since it's sneding all photos and videos through the wifi signal so it's essentially uncompressed. ",
