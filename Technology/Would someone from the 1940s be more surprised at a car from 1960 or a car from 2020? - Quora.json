            "answer_text": "A 2020\u2032s car as different from a 1940\u2019s car as a 1940\u2019s phone landline is to a iPhone X. When I work on my 1972 Porsche 911 (which was a very advanced car for the 1960\u2019s), it\u2019s like working on a horse drawn cart compared to a 2020 BMW. A 1940\u2019s mechanics would have no problem working on a 1960\u2019s car - the main difference was they had different body styling, but mechanically similar. The 1940\u2019s mechanic would have no chance at all at troubleshooting modern electronics, where you need to use CAN bus sniffers, analyze DLT traces, using scopes to measure engine ECU\u2019s. Most 2020\u2019s mechanics cannot even do this. Imagine giving your 1940\u2019s mechanic an iPhone and telling him to make a call, stream some music, look at Facebook or check his email. Its not just that the technology has moved, the entire concepts of modern tech didn\u2019t exist in the 1940\u2019s. Also, all the materials are different, with extensive use of alloys and composites instead of mild steel, crumple zones, SRS & airbags, electric everything, less hydraulics, data connectivity with 2 way information transfers, ADAS driver assistance packages, CVT, double clutch and 10 speed transmissions, direct fuel injection, Magnetorheological dampers, laser and Xenon headlights, braking and throttle by wire, CAN, computer modules, digital dashboards, variable valve timing etc etc. The best you could hope for from a 1940\u2019s mechanic would be an oil change, some light bulb replacements, tire and brakes change and maybe some fluid replacements, but not all.

            "answer_text": "So, the question asks if people living in the 1940s would be more surprised by the styling and technology of an automobile from 20 years in the future, or by one from 80 years in the future? I think the answer is obvious. My current car was built in 2013, just 7 years ago. Recently I drove a couple of rental cars that were 2020 models, and in each one I felt like I was piloting an alien spaceship. Automobiles built today are so much more sophisticated and feature so much more technology than those built earlier in the same decade. I know cars, I pay attention to trends, and even I was future shocked by current models. And these were conventional ICE (gas powered) cars. I have yet to drive an electric one, or even a hybrid, but based on what I have found, driving something like a Tesla would surely blow my mind completely. People living in the 1940s expected that big advancements would occur in future decades. By the 1960s, not much had changed on the automotive front, except that cars were a bit lower, somewhat more comfortable, marginally safer, much faster, and had more powerful engines and a few more cabin amenities. Also, automatic transmissions and transistor radios. But despite those advancements, cars were still very recognizable outside, inside, and under the hood. Now in 2020, the future has arrived, and it is way more elaborate and advanced than the mid century futurists had ever imagined. In fact, it could be argued that the fabled \u201cfuture\u201d arrived around the year 2010 or even ten years earlier, and that we are ten to twenty years beyond that now. We are in the \u201cpost-future\u201d today. If someone from the 1940s was magically transported to today, they wouldn't think that we in 2020 were living in the technological future of planet Earth. They would be very disoriented because they would think that we were living in a whole different civilization in another galaxy. ",
