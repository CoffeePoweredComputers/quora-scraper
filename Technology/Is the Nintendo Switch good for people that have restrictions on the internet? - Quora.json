If you are relying on your parents for\u2026 well everything (money, food, clothes, school etc) then\u2026. Mabye? The nintendo switch requires you to pay for the internet for a certain amount of time and I believe its $20 a year I think? If your parents are okay with paying an extra 20 once a year for a console they bought then I dont see that as a problem. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the types of restrictions. You don\u2019t need internet at all to play games from cartridges. You do need it for updates, to buy digital games, or to play multiplayer or communicate with online friends of course. If you are restricted as in limited bandwidth, you should always monitor that closely. Switch games, especially games on the larger side, tend to be far smaller than games for the bigger consoles. Switch cartridges don\u2019t hold as much, and it doesn\u2019t have the power to use all the assets that an Xbox One might, so it would most likely use less bandwidth over time, but only you could say if it is still too much.
