            "answer_text": "Yes. The problem isn\u2019t so much generation as frequency control. You need large rotating masses on the grid to maintain frequency. That\u2019s given mainly by coal, nuclear, gas and hydro generation. Solar and wind don\u2019t provide a \u201cpulse\u201d for the grid to maintain that frequency control. It\u2019s possible to simulate it using power electronics, but not very practical. However, it is very easy to put large rotating masses into the grid. In fact decommissioned coal and nuclear plants are often used for this purpose. They remain connected and spinning but with no power of their own. Their job is to keep pushing out that pulse when the grid is trying to change its fundamental frequency due to too much or too little generation second-by-second. The fact that the wind stops and the sun doesn\u2019t shine are not real arguments. The wind blows somewhere, the sun shines somewhere, we can store baseload (most likely with pumped hydro) very easily. The tech isn\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s just the cost of changing a horribly polluting, inefficient system for a clean tech system. The energy we need to power human activity in the world falls as sunlight every few minutes. We just don\u2019t want to pay the setup cost to utilise it. (And people making a killing in fossil fuels today will do anything to convince you it\u2019s not possible to do so). If we spent on clean energy what we spend on killing each other, we could be fully renewable in under 10 years, at least for electricity. Transport might take 15 years (using hydrogen instead of oil). ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Generation: wind, solar, tidal, hydro and (optionally) nuclear; a bit of biomass, geothermal and other technologies e.g. anaerobic digestion, waste to energy. Back-up: pumped hydro, CAES (especially ours), a bit of biomass. Short duration fluctuations: batteries including vehicle-to-grid, demand side response. Price control: interconnectors. Grid stability (inertia etc.): hydro, pumped hydro, CAES (ours delivers double), optionally nuclear, a bit of biomass, geothermal and other technologies e.g. anaerobic digestion, waste to energy. Some gas demand to convert to electricity as above, e.g. heat pumps for buildings, electricity for cooking, power stations closing in favour of renewables. Other gas demand to be by electrolysed hydrogen. Some new industrial processes (e.g. cement and steel making) have been and are being developed to eliminate CO2 from the pathways. Transportation: a mix of batteries for small size/distance, and hydrogen fuel cells for large size / long distance. With the exception of electrolysis and some industrial processes (which are expensive but costs are coming down, just as they did with wind, solar and batteries), all this can work without subsidy at a total system cost roughly equivalent to today\u2019s.

            "answer_text": "I think so. If not fully, then we could still make a large transition until technology can catch up. I mean, we have solar, wind, and hydro. Plus, there are solar thermal power plants that use molten salt. This allows for the plant to generate electricity through the night. Plus, Tesla has their Megapack for energy storage. Hydro is great too. Biogas can be used a source for fuel or energy. On an individual level, if possible, switching to passive homes are more energy efficient putting less strain on the grid. There are so many options! A lot of people want to say it\u2019s not possible, but I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good mindset to have. I mean, remember how many times it took to get the lightbulb right? Saying it\u2019s not possible is incorrect, it\u2019s do people want to change? I mean regardless of climate, I just love the thought of being more efficient and being more eco friendly! ",
