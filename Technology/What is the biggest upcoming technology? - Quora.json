            "answer_text": "Add Bio \u00b7 Go Anonymous \u00b7 Go Fullscreen Project Loon is a research and development project being developed in Google X, so as to provide the Internet access to rural and remote areas. The project uses high-altitude balloons, which are placed in stratosphere (at an altitude of 32 km) to create a wireless network with up to 4G-LTE speeds. The Project Loon balloons are carried around the earth by winds and they can be steered by rising or descending to an altitude with winds moving in desired direction. People connect to the network using special antenna attached to their building. The signal bounces from balloon to balloon, which then provides a connection back to earth.  Image: A Loon balloon being launched in 2013. The unofficial development on the project began in 2011 in Google X. Later in 2013 the project was officially launched in 2013. Loon Movement: Project Loon balloons travel approximately 20 km above the Earth\u2019s surface in the stratosphere. Winds in the stratosphere are stratified, and each layer of wind varies in speed and direction. Project Loon uses software algorithms to determine where its balloons need to go, then moves each one into a layer of wind blowing in the right direction. By moving with the wind, the balloons can be arranged to form one large communications network.  Image: Google\u2019s illustration of the stratosphere, where winds at different altitudes run in opposite directions. Balloons can thus be very coarsely steered by raising and lowering them. Loon balloons are super pressure, which enable them to stay a lot for 100+ days. Loons are also unique and are entirely solar powered. Connection : Users of service connect to the balloon network using a special Internet antenna attached to their building. The signal travels through the balloon network from balloon to balloon, then to a ground-based station connected to an Internet service provider (ISP), then onto the global Internet. The system aims to bring Internet access to remote and rural areas poorly served by existing provisions, and to improve communication during natural disasters to affected regions.  Image: The Loon comprises three parts: Envelope, solar panels and equipment. Envelope: Loon Envelopes are made of polyethylene. They are specially constructed for use in super pressure which are resistance to UV radiation.Solar panels: Solar Panels power each unit&#39;s electronics. In full sun, these panels produce 100 watts to keep the unit running while also charging a battery for use at night. By moving with the wind and charging in the sun, the loon is able to power itself using only renewable energy sources.Equipment: A small box containing the balloon\u2019s electronic equipment hangs underneath the inflated envelope, which contains circuit boards that control the system, radio antennas to communicate with each other balloons and with Internet antennas on the ground, batteries to store solar power so the balloons can operate during the night, and weather instruments to monitor the weather and conditions round them.On 16 June 2013, Google began a pilot experiment in New Zealand where 30 balloons are launched in coordination with the Civil Aviation Authority. About 50 local users tested the connection using the special antennas.  Image: The terrestrial antennas deployed at buildings where Google's Project Loon delivers broadband Internet service from free-floating balloons in the stratosphere.  Challenges: The huge challenge of project is to control the free floating of balloon by modeling wind patterns.The balloons stay for 100 days after launching into stratosphere. After every 100 days the balloons are replaced, it is due to the regular changes in temperature and atmosphere.Flight Control: If any balloon get failed then to land the balloon safely also by controlling the air traffic is a risky process.",

The aircraft may be remotely controlled or can fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans in their embedded systems working in conjunction with GPS. They are being used everywhere, and they have grown exponentially interms of usage. According to Bloomberg & Price Water Coopers the Drones market will be valued at $127 Billion by 2020. Amazon plans to deliver it\u2019s goods by drones, in under 30 mins. Youtubers are filming their videos using High Definition Cameras which are placed on Drones, and the same goes for Films. Some Facts about drones: The first Armed DronesThe very first drones which were used for military purpose was to reach one of the feared terrorists of the time. The National Security Council of United States reached Mohammed Atef, a feared terrorist from Afghanistan by the armed drones and was killed by it. He was the military \u2013in \u2013chief in Afghanistan in November 2001 when he was brutally assassinated. First Country to build DronesIsrael was first to make these defensive aircraft\u2019s. Now it is the most popular country to sell drones to all over the world especially to the two dozen countries. The Israel Aerospace Industries have become one of the largest exporters of goods recently. Number of deaths Occurred due to DronesFrom 2004 till 2015 there has been a killing of 2500 to 3300 people alone in Pakistan. Of these people 478 were normal civilians and 176 children. These armed drones not only save the country from some fearful terrorists but along with him a number of civilians die needlessly. According to the Bureau Investigation Journalism, compared to the previous numbers of deaths, there has been a death of 3000 people approximately in the9\\11 case. Drones serve Other PurposesAn NGO takes the pledge to save people\u2019s lives in remote cities of Africa were lifesaving medicines take longer time to reach before the person expires. Thus drones are also used for greater purposes other than bombing. They reach these remote places before humans, and thus act as a life-saving machine. Drones as part of Police DepartmentRecently drones have started helping the police departments by helping them fight crimes. They are used for surveillance of certain corrupted areas and helping carrying out sting operations. Even the FBI has started using them. So the next time you don\u2019t have a clue to solve a problem secretly, drones is the right choice! Drones with Flying Pizza!Is it always necessary that any technological invention has to have a serious outcome only? Domino\u2019s proved it wrong. Recently Domino\u2019s have launched a video on You Tube of a drone delivering a pizza. The advantages of such a mechanism would be that It would be faster than manual delivery and hence the food more delicious. Survey of Crops in FieldsDrones can help farmers by giving them an aerial survey of the entire field. Previously the farmers had to walk past the entire field to survey over the land but now it can be a lot easier. From a single place the farmer can check the crops, their growing percentages or whether anywhere the crop is damaged. A part of Cricket World CupDrones have already been used in football and now it\u2019s time for cricket too. It can give a great aerial coverage of the huge fields. WeddingsDrones can make a marriage ever memorable as every angle of the wedding is covered. So if you want to set up a dream wedding for yourself go for a Drone to get the over view of the wedding along with the side ones.
