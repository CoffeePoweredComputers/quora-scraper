            "answer_text": "They have \u201crecognized\u201d about half the revenue from pre-payments to date in their accounting, claiming they have partially delivered the functionality. The biggest deliveries so far were Smart Summon and Stops at Stop Signs functions. You can view youtubes of both. Few owners use Smart Summon today, after a few accidents it caused and youtubes of it acting erratically. Less stress to just walk to your car, and about as fast. The later feature has proved amusing, stopping at round restaurant signs, including a Burger King sign, which BK leveraged into a web ad, stating that Tesla\u2019s AI was so smart that it wanted one of their burgers. It seems embarrassing that their software mistakes a round white and red sign, a bit off the road, for an octagonal solid red sign with large letters \u201cSTOP\u201d (almost everywhere in the world). Soon after (about 1 month ago), Elon Musk tweeted that they began rewriting FSD software \u201cfrom the stack\u201d, which is the lowest level of any software system, and should have it finished by end of 2020. Even stranger, he tweeted an invite a few months earlier for anyone with software experience (no college degree needed) to drop by his house (~5 houses in LA then) to help complete their FSD code. Sounded like a tiger-team lockup session to slam out code, perhaps paid with free pizza. Not sure that happened since CV-19 became much larger than Elon ever expected in the interim. He had tweeted (similar to Pres. Trump) things like \u201cjust the flu\u201d, \u201cwill be gone by April\u201d, \u201cdoesn\u2019t affect children\u201d, and \u201chydroxychloroquine shows promise\u201d. He still tweets about \u201cerroneous statistics in testing\u201d and such, which has frustrated his fans in the medical community who disagree with his medical understandings. ",

According to Elon Musk all Tesla Autos will have Level 5 Full Autonomous mode, \u201cvery soon\u201d! The Hinderence to utilizing the 100% Full Autonomous mode\u2019 is the limitations by State and Local Government Laws. In the USA, most States restrict Self Driving to \u201cDriver Assist mode\u201d only, and Full Autonomous mode is Not allowed. Therefore the Program operates at a restricted and limited capacity. Typically, Laws require the Driver to be sitting behind the steering wheel, in the Drivers seat, awake, and able to operate the Brake and accelerator. The current mode which is allowed in nearly every Country and State, is the driver assisted mode! 100% Full Autonomous driving in All Areas and on all roads, is still probably 5\u201310 years \u2018Down the Road\u2019 (Pun Intended). Tesla's Elon Musk: Our fully autonomous cars are now 'very close' | ZDNet Also, Elon Musk claims that Autonomous driving will make cars safer. He also is working a plan to offer Insurance companies incentives regarding Cars with Autonomous driving abilities. Driver assisted Self Driving Technology should, in theory, cut down on accidents because of its built in vehicle Avoidance systems. And Now, for some Humor, by the Kidder himself, Elon Musk (from the above article): In April last year, Musk said Tesla would probably have fully autonomous driving by the end of the year and that he would be \"shocked\" if it didn't by the end of 2020 at the latest, at which point \"having a human intervene will decrease safety\". \u201cDecrease Safety\u201d, Elon?? Ok, If you day so! Lol What a Kidder!! ",

            "answer_text": "Not much \u201chappened\u201d to Tesla\u2019s FSD. It\u2019s been incrementally rolling out. There are a couple of big changes in progress. One is the \u201c3D\u201d neural network. Tesla FSD relies on cameras, which makes it somewhat difficult to judge distance. They\u2019ve rewritten the neural network so that it can be trained with images that are labeled with distance information, so it can learn depth perception. Supposedly this is done, and Elon Musk has it on his car. Tesla was talking about those in the early access program (Kevin jumps and down and yells \u201cme! me! me!) getting it in 6 weeks. The other big deal is mapping parking lots and all their intricate rules. Current Tesla parking lot software like Autopark and Smart Summon, are somewhat rough at present, although I have successfully used both. I\u2019ve found it particularly informative to look for videos on YouTube featuring Andrej Karpathy, head of Tesla\u2019s AI team, at technical conferences. Karpathy also presented at Tesla\u2019s \u201cAutonomy\u201d day last year.[1] Tesla will hold its annual shareholder meeting on September 22, and you may pick up some news there.

Every month or two, I get an update that makes it a little bit better. A little closer to full self driving. Since I got my car, it now can drive around parking lots without a driver, and stops at stop lights and stop signs. It also got a lot better at changing lanes on a free way. And the more cars they get on the road, the more data they have to train with, and the faster they can get it done. But they still need to make sure it doesn't get confused with stuff like this.  Or this.  Or this.  ",

If you make a car self driving in the US will it \u2018know\u2019 the difference in the driving rules in Canada and Mexico? No. The problem gets worse in Europe where roads are considerably narrower and apparently Tesla\u2019s brake with oncoming traffic even though there is plenty of space. It is also important to remember that a significant proportion of the world drives on the left! I think it will come but we are still a long way off. I think that Tesla is quiet about it for two reasons, firstly because it is taking a long time and the second the press likes to dramatise accidents that do happen as \u2018failures\u2019 of self driving Tesla\u2019s when Tesla has repeatedly said that the current system is driver assistance not full self driving.

Full self-driving will arrive little-by-little with no completion date (it will never be complete). When it is reliably safer than 70% or so \u2014or at least 50%) human drivers, most governments will have no problem allowing it on the streets. And it will just keep getting better and better. Tesla is mis-perceived as being behind other researchers mainly because they release each new feature once it is expected to be safer than human drivers. This confuses analysts compared to lab demonstrations and projections. Tesla is not exactly behind 10 other autonomous driving researchers, because it all depends upon what the study is focused on\u2014or gets stuck on. In many ways, Tesla is ahead of all 10 researchers that are ahead in other ways. No company has everything needed, and it will take a lot of cooperation to do it fast. One thing that most article writers do not seem to get is that the human system can no longer be considered the best contender for safest driver. For every failure they point out in past autonomous driving systems, humans have had and continue to have way more risks\u2026 ",
