            "answer_text": "Cannabis is generally seen as the least dangerous of all illegal drugs, and infrequent use is probably not harmful. However, current scientific research suggests that marijuana may be hazardous to normal brain development in adolescence,[1, 3] and even in adults heavy use is associated with poor memory [2] and lower IQ. [4] \"When the first exposure occurs in younger versus older adolescents, the impact of cannabis seems to be worse in regard to many outcomes such as mental health, education attainment, delinquency and ability to conform to adult role\" [1] Why do people get addicted to cannabis? It turns out that it reduces the amount of naturally produced dopamine in the striatum. [5] A commonsense answer to this question, based on the very well-known mental effects, is that if you spend a long period of time in a cognitively challenged state then your intelligence will reflect that state. The more time you spend stoned, the longer the road back to normality. [1] Perception of marijuana as a 'safe drug' is scientifically inaccurate Original study: Trajectory of Adolescent Cannabis Use on Addiction Vulnerability - Hurd YL, Michaelides M, Miller ML, Jutras-Aswad D., 2014 [2] Heavy marijuana users have abnormal brain structure and poor memory [3] Marijuana use in adolescence may cause permanent brain abnormalities, study finds [4] Study shows marijuana's long-term effects on the brain [5] Long-term cannabis use may blunt the brain's motivation system ",

            "answer_text": "Is the mental damage of the propaganda that led to the illegality of a harmless human activity permanent? That\u2019s the question you should be asking. After the government demonizes it to the extreme that it did, it\u2019s really hard to trust any info out there. After all, it was serious warning that it would cause homicidal behavior. I\u2019ve also heard from more high scientists that it works by binding onto your cannabinoid receptors, thus repairing nerve damage. It helps the neurotransmitters cross the synapses. Or something. Not a scientist here. I\u2019m not saying that it doesn\u2019t cause mental damage, just that if it does, then a lot of people are actually smarter than einstein. The propaganda wanted to say this: cannabis makes you lazy, stupid, and violent, and a danger to society at large. However violently punishing people for this activity is far more homicidal. However, doing drugs does not make you a danger to society, and therefore, when they take the moral high ground on the subject in argument, they not only sound like liars, they sound like they think they have so much power they can simply demand what is truly righteous and make it so, like Jean Luc Picard. However, they can\u2019t make it so. What is moral can only be decided by what people feel inside is best for the survival of all humanity. ",
