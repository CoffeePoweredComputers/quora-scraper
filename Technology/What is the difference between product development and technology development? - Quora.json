            "answer_text": "Some organizations blur the line between these activities but it is useful to distinguish them. The purpose of product development is to develop a product that will be offered for sale in the marketplace; a company\u2019s technology roadmap shows when work on future products will begin and when they will be offered for sale. The purpose of technology development is to create or refine a new technical approach to solving a problem; a company\u2019s technology roadmap shows when work on new technologies will begin and when they might be sufficiently mature to use in its products. Product developers are more concerned with producing an economically viable product. They worry about launch dates, sell prices, sales volumes, manufacturing costs and profit margins. Technology developers usually operate in a higher risk domain and focus on reducing risk and improving the performance, utility, and cost of a technology. For example, H-P might have a product development team designing a new printer and a technology development team creating new high-performance toners for use on many different printer products. In short, all the differences between technology and product development arise from different purposes and different success criteria. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the answer depends on the context, but let me try a general answer. Product development is the advancement of a product. This may or may not involve technology. The technology may be code, circuit boards, or machines. It may involve more than those creating the physical product and may involve the product managers, marketing folks, etc. Product used to be differentiated from a service, however those lines are completely blurred now. Technology development is an advancement of something using technology. This something could be a product or a service. In practice, they often mean the same thing, the engineering/programming team responsible for creating the product. ",
