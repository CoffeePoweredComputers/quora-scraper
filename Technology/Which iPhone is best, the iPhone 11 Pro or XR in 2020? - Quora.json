            "answer_text": "After the launch of the latest iPhone 12 series, Apple has officially discontinued the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max in India to make way for the updated devices. However, some iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max devices are still available with offline retailers. Even though the 11 Pro series is discontinued, the regular 11 and XR are officially available even today with reduced prices and offers. If you\u2019re looking for a device that has higher camera quality and don\u2019t mind going in for a smaller 5.8-inch display size at a slightly higher price, you can think about the iPhone 11 Pro. The iPhone XR has a bigger display size at 6.1-inches but misses out on higher camera quality but makes it up with better battery life. You can get amazing discounts on the iPhone XR right now on various online and offline platforms. ",
