            "answer_text": "Is it okay to cover a heating vent? It is probably OK to cover a single heating vent. If the vent has a register with a control to modulate the air flow, it should be closed before you cover it. Most the air that is designed to come out of that register will be forced to come out of other registers and there will be less total air that circulates through the system as a whole, particularly the furnace. The heat from every other register will increase in temperature slightly. The total heat delivered by the furnace will be slightly less, so the temperature of the heated air will rise. All of these things, taken together, will cause the furnace to deliver less heat and be slightly less efficient. If you do this to too many vents, the heat will rise to an unacceptable temperature through the furnace and to other vents, and safeties will turn the furnace off to prevent possible fires. This is not really a good thing to do. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m no expert , but many homes have duct work systems that have vents that can be open, closed or adjusted to any desired intermediate position. This enables you to direct more warm or cool air, as desired to some rooms, and away from others. Doing so can result in saving a good bit of money heating or cooling rooms that are not being used. Covering up just one or two vents shouldn\u2019t cause you any problem with the heating or cooling system itself, assuming of course that it has a number of other vents that will remain open and unobstructed. BUT if you close off the vent to a room with plumbing, you might have to deal with frozen water pipes in or near that room if it gets really cold. ",
