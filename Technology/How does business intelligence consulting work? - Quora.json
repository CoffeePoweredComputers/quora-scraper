            "answer_text": "When the business intelligence consulting function is located within a major corporation, the intelligence officers would conduct both project specific and organizational (big picture) intelligence monitoring, collection, and analysis. The type of business intelligence I'm familiar with, tends to be niche-specific within a given sector. I'll use an example to help with the specific ways that business intelligence may be collected and compiled. For example, in the life science biotech/pharma arena, there are consultants who specializes in a given therapeutic area such as \"oncology\". Maybe a company is developing a particular type of compound in the oncology arena, and they are targeting a specific cancer market. The company may then (1) engage niche consultants who specializes in a particular cancer market (solid tumors v. liquid tumors for example), in addition to (2) deploying their own intelligence functions (as well as (3) internal and field-based medical affairs functions staffed with scientists, pharmacists, and physicians) to attend medical science symposia and meetings. These external and internal consultants are tasked with going to specific sessions, circulating particular posters, and in general keeping their eyes and ears open for relevant data around \"key intelligence topics\" or KIT's. They may pay attention to the types of questions asked and how these questions are answered. They may pay attention to omissions of information that may be in people's minds (i.e. what are the \"elephants in the room\"). They may pay attention to the level of attendance for a session as a gauge of interest. They may also pay attention to each other -- internal consultants (employees) may better recognize competitors within the market or franchise. They may pay attention to surprising attendees -- for example, people they recognize from companies that they did not expect to be competitors yet, but those people are there (perhaps these competitors are ready sooner than we expected them to be competing in this space?). All these bits of data is then compiled. What happens next will depend on the robustness of the company's business intelligence capacity. Some companies will sit around with all this data compiled into reports that nobody reads. The companies with a well-oiled business intelligence machine will have analysts who are able to create specific and actionable pieces of intelligence (meaning, decisions that can be made by people who have the power to move money and human resources).  These pieces of actionable intelligence will be channeled to the decision makers who need to know and act upon this intelligence, then metrics around those decisions will be put in place to follow the implementation and return on investment of that piece of intelligence.

            "answer_text": "Business Intelligence consultants initiate their work with identifying your business requirements. The foremost step is identifying the different target audiences \u2013 the management, the IT department, the marketing and sales team (at times data has to be segregated for these two as well), the end users and other business-specific verticals. The next step is to understand how do you consume the information; is it through dashboards, through analytics or in a different format. When partnering with BI consultants it is important to understand that they will work on the most viable solution that is understood and accepted by members of all the verticals. At the same time these experts also need to create a roadmap for gathering, filtering, dividing and sending the information for the different segments. Implementation of BI tools or reinventing an existing BI model takes place after complete requirement gathering has been successfully carried out. Customizing Business Intelligence methodology according to the business model of the client for an easily adaptable solution, is taken care of by the development team. However, the BI consultants initiate the process and create the blueprint on which the project is executed. ",
