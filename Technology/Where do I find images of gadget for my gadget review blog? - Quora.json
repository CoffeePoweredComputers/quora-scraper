            "answer_text": "Before you use an image on your website, you need to understand copyright. Most works on the Internet are protected by copyright, which is reserved by the creator of the image, and they choose how and where it can be distributed. Remember how you often see \u2018All Rights Reserved\u2019 on music and movie discs and next to product labels? This means that the rights of use of that particular item rest completely with its creators, and any use by you without their permission allows them to take legal action against you. Now there\u2019s too much information being uploaded and recirculated on the Internet every day for people to track where everything is going, so generally people end up using copyrighted content without getting into trouble. But since you\u2019re going to be using it for a blog run by you, it\u2019s best to do things the right way. This is where Creative Commons (CC) comes in. There are many types of licenses which can oversee the rights to a particular work, and Creative Commons has licenses that allow work to be distributed freely. Generally, all media under CC license can be shared. Of course, there are some restrictions. For example, almost all CC licenses require you to give proper attribution to the creator, which is easy enough. Some impose further restrictions, such as not allowing modification to the work, or not allowing it to be used for commercial purposes. You can find specific information on Creative Commons licenses here: About The Licenses. If you\u2019re writing about a device manufactured by a well-known manufacturer, make sure to visit their website. Some OEMs have a section dedicated to the press on their websites, where they have downloadable images of their products. These are what you usually see shared by websites when a product launches. However, make sure to read fine print on any restrictions that may be placed on the use of images. If there are none, use with attribution is usually fine. Flickr is a great source for CC images, and you can even filter search for images with these licenses. There are many profiles on Flickr that deal exclusively with gadgets, and you can reach out to some of them and personally request if you can use their work with attribution. An easier option is to search for images that are in the public domain, either because their creators are really cool people, or because their licenses have expired. Some sites from where you can download high-resolution license-free images are Pexels, Pixabay and Unsplash. Some of these sites give you an option to donate some money, which you might want to do. Hope this answer helps you out, and all the best for your blog! ",
