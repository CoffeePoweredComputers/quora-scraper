            "answer_text": "The amazing thing about autonomous (self-driving) cars is something called \u201cmachine learning.\u201d The first step to programming an autonomous vehicle is \u201cdata annotation.\u201d Data annotation is a human process which involves annotating hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of images and videos which consist of everything having to do with driving. Roads, lane markers, sidewalks, trees, dogs, stop lights, pedestrians etc etc. Data annotators use special tools to outline these parts of the world and label them. Afterwards, all of this data is fed into a computer which in turn, allows the car to drive. But what is even more amazing? it doesn\u2019t stop there! Every time someone is driving a Tesla (or any other autonomous capable vehicle), (which has many cameras and sensors) the car continues to learn, to capture everything that is happening on the road - and in turn, sending all of this data back into the mainframe of the company which allows all other cars to learn at the same time. What I\u2019m saying is, it is a slow start - but if the amount of self-driving cars continues to increase, then the data sets will continue to increase, which in turn will make the autonomous driving more and more advanced. In my opinion, the top major cities in the world will incorporate self-driving cars before everyone else - in the next 5 years. The biggest negative factor of this progress? Human drivers\u2026 like my mother always used to say, \u201cI\u2019m not worried about you driving, I\u2019m worried about the other idiots on the road.\u201d Same applies here - eventually, when self-driving cars will have a very low rate of accidents, everyone will begin to question why we still have human driviers on the road.

            "answer_text": "When do you think fully autonomous self-driving cars will be mainstream? Mainstream? You mean, most new cars having this ability?Well, it is a feature that is still under development and it will take a few years until it is ready.It will be expensive at the start, but eventually most people will want to have it. As a result, I\u2019d guess it will be a feature in most new cars in about 15\u201320 years. You are asking about these cars being available as a public service?Well, cab services will want them even sooner, since they won\u2019t need to pay the cab driver, so I would guess that they will be the ones who will adopt them first because they will pay off.My best guess is more like 10\u201315 years.
