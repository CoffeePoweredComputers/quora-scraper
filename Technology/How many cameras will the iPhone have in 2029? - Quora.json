There is no point in speculating that far in advanced as phones as we know it now could be different in another 10 years, we are already shifted designs on the screen taking up the whole front of the device, we are currently trying to make phones with a foldable screen, what could be next after that? No clue, but what ever it might be by 2029 we should find out! ",
