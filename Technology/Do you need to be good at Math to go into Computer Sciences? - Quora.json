            "answer_text": "To go into computer science, you need to be proficient in logic and problem solving more so than math. Of course, these two are closely linked, but you won't necessarily need in depth knowledge of Calculus, for example, to write working algorithms. In the US, the winners of USACO (United States of America Computing Olympiad) are more often than not also USAMO (USA Mathematics Olympiad) winners. But, the winners of the other olympiads (besides maybe biology) also usually have advanced mathematics experience. The reason for this trend? It's probably that due to years of math training, these students possess the work ethic they need to study the other fields. If you love CS, you will have the drive to study. So if you like it, go into CS, and, I promise you, you'll do well. Truthfully, computer science is not that related to mathematics. It has its own rules, problem-solving strategies, etc. that you'll have to learn no matter how good you are at math. ",

            "answer_text": "Computer Science branched off of Mathematics. As a result, most Computer Science programs require a lot of Math courses. At my school, CS majors have to take quite a few math classes, but at some of my friends at other schools had to take a lot less. I wouldn't discourage someone from majoring in a field just because they might not succeed in the related courses. For example, in Biology (my degree), lots of people struggle with Chemistry and Physics (required classes in related fields). They take them and pass, and get on to what they really like - Biology classes. If you really like CS, I'm sure you can get through a few Math classes!  ",

            "answer_text": "No, you don't have to be a math wizard.  If you are good in high school math that is often good enough.  Logical thinking is what you need.  That usually leads to people being good in high school math, but not always.   Do you like solving Sudoku or other brain-teaser puzzles?  (The man in the green house does not have a dog; the house with the cat is not next to the yellow house etc.)  That's a kind of math, and it's the kind that is very useful for computer science. Some BSc. computer science programs (like UBC in Vancouver) make you take two courses in calculus and two more in physics.  Other programs don't require any more math past high school.  Choose your program carefully if you don't want to take more math. Even if it's not required, I suggest all computer science students should study statistics and probability.  I never found any need for calculus, but that's just because of my career choices. ",

Most resemblance can be to high school proof geometry.This was especially difficult for me as proofs in computer science are even less intuitive than that, you can't see the solution.Of course this differs between people, but in general, you have to be able to handle math, not necessarily master it.
