            "answer_text": "Q: How can I get free wifi at home? It is really easy. Find somebody who wants to dump an old but working wireless router and, if they are willing to let you have it for free, install it in your home. This will give you free WiFi. However, you should note that although you will have free WiFi and it will be completely legal, this does not mean free access to the Internet. WiFi, like Ethernet, is simply a method of connecting a device to a router. You still need an Internet Service Provider to be able to get access to the Internet legally. Don\u2019t be a thief and risk prosecution. Pay for the services you need. UPDATE: Quora Content Review merged the question I answered with: Can I make my own WiFi for free internet use? Free WiFi and Free Internet are not the same thing and the two questions should not be merged, but QCR cannot understand the difference. ",

            "answer_text": "I love how \u201cWiFi\u201d is the laymen\u2019s universal reference to a connection to the internet. Sure, you can have free WiFi, but\u2026it will not get you to the internet. If the question is more along the lines of free internet in every home? Not possible. Someone has to pay for access. And that means you will too. If your city has a MAN (metropolitan area network) with universal wireless access, then you\u2019re paying for it in taxes somehow or another. The internet comes with costs. It doesn\u2019t \u201cjust work\u201d. There are costs for laying the fiber from hub to your city. This may mean that your ISP has to be access fees to the fiber installer, or they have to fork over millions of dollars to dig, tunnel and lay their own fiber (potentially) hundreds of miles. Then there are the costs for uptime. Again, it doesn\u2019t just run. There are costs for 24/7 monitoring. There are costs for 24/7 technicians and engineers that must fix issues when they happen. There are call center techs that have to answer the consumers question and report outages. You have the cost of field techs that make sure that the last mile (to your home/business) is functional. You have infrastructure engineers that control access to services. The costs to an ISP are astronomical. There is no way to get \u201cfree internet\u201d unless by the kindness of some large company (Google?) that can absorb these costs. Google still can\u2019t give it for free - even now. ",
