            "answer_text": "CSK can take back the following positives from IPL 2020: Good fast bowling attack: CSK is a team which has relied upon spinners and based its bowler selection assuming that 7 games will be held in a spinner friendly Chennai ground. This year- however the tournament being shifted out of India, and the UAE pitches favour fast bowlers. Under these circumstances CSK has found some good pace bowling in Deepak Chahar, Shardul Thakur, Josh Hazlewood. Having a good pace attack is important to win T20 and ODI matches in the future. CSK needs to train these fast bowlersYoung talent in middle order- N.Jagadeesan played a sparkling innings in the first match against RCB. A quickfire 33 from 28 balls , and most importantly he showed intent. But he needs to be coached on how to play long and hard. Ruturaj Gaikwad also needs to be shaped up as an opener in the future squads to replace Watson.All rounder Sam Curran: I see Sam Curran as one of the future stars of CSK. He is in red hot form and can play explosive shots, and is a good fielder. He can also be an extra pace option.Change in captaincy: Its time for a change of guard. Dhoni\u2019s time is up- sad, but its the truth. Given the auction might not happen for next year, and in the event Dhoni steps down [he should, if he really wants to give youngsters a chance], I would like to have duPlessis as a stand-in captain. He has International experience and also in form batsmen who can provide stability to middle order.All in all- these are the positives and CSK should do a team revamp ahead of the next season. The team has focused on perfecting their play-off records for the past 13 years instead of looking inwards and grooming the next line of players after Dhoni, Bravo and Raina. This season exposed the chinks in the armour and its time to look fix the broken parts. We have enough records under our belt - 8 finals, 3 trophies and 10 playoffs. No team will achieve this in the next couple of years atleast. CSK should sacrifice their play-off dreams for the next 3\u20134 years and groom the next line of players. I am okay with the team not making it to the playoffs for the next 3 seasons if the youngsters need time to find their form. ",

            "answer_text": "This Guy  Sam Curran He was a great addition to CSK He proved that he is a complete all-rounder. He played well whenever given the opportunity While watching him I felt like watching Albie Morkel \u201cCurran is a complete cricketer for us and you need that seaming allrounder. He strikes the ball nicely, he can bat up the order, he plays spinners well,\" Dhoni said of his team's youngest member. He can give us those 15-45 runs if you need momentum. I feel as the tournament progresses, he'll get even more comfortable with death bowling. That's one of the reasons we kept him away at the death.\u201d This statement was given by MSD in one of the post-match presentations So yeah Sam Curran is the only positive. I am sure CSK will bounce back next season ",
