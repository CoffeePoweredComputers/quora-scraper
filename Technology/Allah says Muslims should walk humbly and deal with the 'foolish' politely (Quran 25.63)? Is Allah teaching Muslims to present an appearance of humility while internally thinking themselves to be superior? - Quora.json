            "answer_text": "(25:63) The true servants of the Merciful One are those who walk on the earth gently and when the foolish ones address them, they simply say: \"Peace to you\". That is, though all human beings are by birth the servants of the Merciful before Whom you have been invited to prostrate yourselves, and which you disdain, his true servants are those who adopt the way of His obedience consciously and develop such desirable characteristics. Then the natural consequences of the prostration are those found in the lives of the believers and the evil results of rejecting the invitation, those found in your lives. Here attention is being drawn to the two patterns of character and life. First of those who had accepted the message of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and were following it, and the second of those who persisted in the ways of ignorance. Here only the prominent characteristics of the true believers have been cited, and for contrast, the characteristics of the disbelievers have been left to every discerning eye and mind which could see them all around in the society and make its own decision. That is; they do not walk haughtily and arrogantly like the tyrants and mischief-makers, but their gait is of a gentle, right thinking and good natured person. Walking humbly does not mean walking like a weak or sick person, nor does it imply the gait of a hypocrite who walks ostentatiously to show humility or fear of God. According to traditions, the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself used to walk with firm, quick steps. One day Caliph Umar saw a young man walking slowly like a weak, sick person, and asked him: Are you ill? When the man replied in the negative, the Caliph raised his whip, rebuked him and told him to walk like a healthy man. This shows that the humble gait is the natural gait of a noble and gentle person and not a gait which shows weakness and undue humility. In this connection, the first characteristic of the true servants of Allah to which attention has been drawn, is their gait. This is because the gait indicates the character of an individual. If a man walks in a humble and dignified way, as opposed to a haughty, vain and proud manner, it shows that he is a noble and gentle person. Thus the different gaits of different types of people show what sort of characters they possess. The verse means to imply that the true servants of the Merciful can be easily recognized by their gait among the people. Their attitude of Allah\u2019s worship and obedience has changed them so thoroughly that it can be seen at first sight from their gate that they are noble, humble and good natured people, who cannot be expected to indulge in any mischief. For further explanation, . \u201cthe ignorant people\u201d: Rude and insolent people and not uneducated and illiterate ones. The true servants of the Merciful do not believe in vengeance, even though they may have to deal with the ignorant people who behave rudely and insolently towards them. If they happen to come across such people, they wish them peace and turn away. The same thing has been expressed in (Q28:55), thus: And when they hear something vain and absurd they turn away from it, saying, our deeds are for us and your deeds are for you, peace be to you, we have nothing to do with the ignorant.

            "answer_text": "Actually It\u2019s the opposite. First notice how Allah before saying anything said The servants of Allah which implies that the following text is for people who have submitted their self (nafs) wholly to Allah. They\u2019re people who have decided to stay on the path of Allah or you can say the people who are on the Sufi Path. (Sufi/Auliya/Saint = Friends of God). Second thing that you should know Moulana Rum said that you should pity the wise person in ignorants. Now this message can only be completely understood and felt by people who have a little higher observational and awareness skills. Allah have gifted them with higher level of understanding than normal people (This is mentioned in Quran). If you truly understand this statement of Moulana Rum then you know how hard it is to control your mouth and staying humble in front or around ignorants. Now to the rest of the text. Allah knows how hard it is for a wise person to confront ignorants. It\u2019s really hard to not think of them as dumb people or ignorants. It\u2019s very very hard to not think of yourself as a superior person. Satan at that time whisper a lotta stuff into your heart about taking those ignorants as inferior people to you. He keeps telling you that you are very different from them and superior to them. This is where Allah helps you with this verse. He called you out specifically and saying to hold tight to the rope of humbleness. Do not think of yourself as a superior person. Do not take pride in your spiritual intelligence. Even if you do are a little wise compare to other but if you are truly wise, you wouldn\u2019t think of yourself as a wise person. You will think of yourself as a very common person, even common than the ignorants around you. Answer calmly to people with less understanding. Try to understand them and talk according to their mind level. Never argue with them. If you feel like you can do nothing then answer them with silence. Moula Ali sayings that supports this verse: The ignorant man does not understand the learned for he has never learned himself, but the learned man understands the ignorant for he was once ignorant himself.The moment you start arguing with an ignorant fool, you have already lost.I have never argued with an ignorant person and won.The best response to a fool is silence.Do not talk about knowledge with the foolish so that they deny you nor with the ignorant so that they find you oppressive, but talk about it with those of its people whom you meet who will accept it and understand it.Note: My english is not that good so ignore using of bad words and wrong grammar and this all is my view and understanding of this verse on the basis of knowledge that I have. I am no scholor or mufti. I hope this will help you. ",

            "answer_text": "The verse you mentioned: it says if someone mocks you then say \u201cpeace\u201d and leave. For, [true] servants of the Most Gracious are [only] they who walk gently on earth, and who, whenever the \u201cjahils\" address them, reply with [words of] peace. (Quran 25:63) Firstly, the more accurate translation of the word in this context is probably \u201cunaware\u201d or \u201cignorant\u201d, not fool. And is it not common sense that if A mocks B, A is the arrogant one? God will requite them for their mockery, and will leave them for a while in their overweening arrogance, blindly stumbling to and fro: (Quran, 2:15) Secondly, There are two terms \u201ctolerance\u201d and \u201cacceptance\u201d and there are difference between in these two. Tolerance: \u201cI know I am better than you, but still I am accepting you.\u201dAcceptance: \u201cI accept that every one will not believe the way I believe\u201d.The amount of commandment in the Quran for the believers to accept the disbelief and \u201clet go\u201d is numerous. VERILY, you cannot not guide aright everyone whom you love: but it is God who guides him that wills [to be guided] and He is fully aware of all who would let themselves be guided. (Quran 28:56) \"The truth [has now come] from your Sustainer: Let, then, him who wills, believe in it, and let him who wills, reject it,\" (Quran 18:29) Thirdly, the command to behave well with them is because, it may change them eventually. NOT because \u201cwe consider ourselves better\u201d. Requite evil with what is better and lo, he who is your enemy now will become as if your intimate friend. (41:34) Forthly, Muslims are prohibited to be double faced (thinking something inwardly, but doing something else outwardly). So answer to your question is \u201cNo\u201d! Our inside and outside should be same! O YOU who have attained to faith! Why do you say one thing and do another? Most loathsome is it in the sight of God that you say what you do not do! (Quran 61:2\u20133) Lastly, we cannot ascribe purity to ourselves. We hold God as the ultimate judge, only he can know what has someone earned. do not, then, consider your\u00adselves pure - [for] He knows best as to who is conscious of Him (53:32) I can never know that who will ultimately have a better place than me in the paradise (only God knows). So I have no way to look down to other. let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them; nor let women ridicule [other] women; perhaps they may be better than them.

Pride is \u201cI\u2019m the best version of myself I can be, I\u2019m not perfect, and I strive to be better as each day passes\u201d. Arrogance is, \u201cI\u2019m better than you.\u201d. There are some matters/situations and acts in which we don\u2019t just think we are better, we know we are better, but it\u2019s not enough to revel in this awareness if you aren\u2019t helping others also to be better by spreading your knowledge. For instance, if we as Muslims teach others the salah sequence, it is up to them to incorporate it into their lives. We can provide them with tutorials and books and help them understand the reasons both physical and spiritual for why we perform this. Whether it be a matter of maturity, peer pressure, or familial pressure to stay in their current religion, it is not our job to judge, but rather perceive and at the very least, be a good friend as a Muslim that they can rely upon. If they turn away from this wisdom, it\u2019s not your job to be their babysitter. You\u2019re not guardian over them, and if they chastise you for being Muslim, we aren\u2019t the ones with the arrogance problem; they are. They are too good to bring their face toward the Earth that gives them life and submit to Allah. So just be yourself, and let the haters hate. ",

This does not give rise to your conclusion. It's not possible. There are always those who are better than oneself, and remembering that as well as the results of arrogance is important. Do not avert your face from people out of haughtiness and do not strut about arrogantly on the Earth. Allah does not love anyone who is vain or boastful.
