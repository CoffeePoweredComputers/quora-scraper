            "answer_text": "In the 11th century, something happened.The sky was dramatically altered. Night became almost as bright as they daytime, and the stars could not be seen. The light stayed for days, emanating from one point in the sky, and when it did fade, the mini second sun that had emitted it was gone.In its place was the blurry nebula we now know as the Crab Nebula.We know this happened because ancient Chinese astronomers recorded it, fascinated, as it happened.This was the light of a supernova. A star dying, burning itself out in one last flare of glory.The thing is that the star that formed the Crab Nebula is so far away that, by the time the light reached us, the supernova was long past. That's part of the reason I love winter- because I (and this has literally no research backing it; this is just a thing that I think) am relatively certain that with the way we see the star Betelgeuse, it's already gone nova. I just wonder when it's nova light will reach us. Could be today, could be never. I hope it's tomorrow. I'd love to see a supernova. The answer to your question: Sort of, yes. We'll see that star forming just the way it really did, just after it happened.A cool thing about the speed of light: You're literally looking into the past. You're looking at things that happened long before you were born when you look at stars. Isn't that neat? Hope this helped. ",

            "answer_text": "The stars we see as individual points of light in our night sky are all in our galaxy, the Milky Way. Every star is associated with some galaxy; thus the type of scenario you describe - light of a very far away star finally reaching us - would register in telescopic images as a part of an entire galaxy becoming visible. At that distance, individual stars will not be distinguishable. In case you are referring to the unexpected appearance of a supernova, that is a different issue. It is a star that suddenly increases in brightness due to a tremendously enhanced light output. ",
