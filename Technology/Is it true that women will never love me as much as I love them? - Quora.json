            "answer_text": "No. I don't know you. I don't know how you love. Do you put women on pedestals? Do you become infatuated with every pretty face? Are you looking for someone to mother you? I can't say. I can only say that while individuals of any gender may vary in their relationship skills, on the whole, women are every bit as capable of loving men as the reverse. You may need to hone your skills in choosing a person who can love you as much as you love her, and there are few among us who don't need to work at loving their special someone in a way that is healthy and mutually beneficial. But you aren't going to be loved less simply because you are a man loving a woman. ",
