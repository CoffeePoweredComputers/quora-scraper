            "answer_text": "It\u2019s just a term that is relevant to the industrial revolution going on from the last couple of decades. But first, take a glimpse of how it was started! Two-decade ago from now was the time when the first industrial (Industry 1.0) and second industrial (Industry 2.0) unfolded. Industry 1.0 covers the manufacturing/production of products through mechanizing the work through water and steam power.Industry 2.0 covers the mass manufacturing/production of products through electricity and assembly lines.Industry 3.0 covers the mass manufacturing/production of products through computation power.Industry 4.0 is an extension of industry 3.0 in which the manufacturing/production of products done through the computational power fueled with machine learning and artificial intelligence without any human involvement to reduce the cost of production.When computers were introduced in Industry 3.0, it was disruptive thanks to the addition of entirely new technology. Now, and into the future as Industry 4.0 unfolds, computers are connected and communicate with one another to ultimately make decisions without human involvement. A combination of cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things and the Internet of Systems make Industry 4.0 possible and the smart factory a reality. As a result of the support of smart machines that keep getting smarter as they get access to more data, our factories will become more efficient and productive and less wasteful. Ultimately, it's the network of these machines that are digitally connected and create and share information that results in the true power of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 applications today While many organizations might still be in denial about how Industry 4.0 could impact their business or struggling to find the talent or knowledge to know how to best adapt it for their unique use cases, several others are implementing changes today and preparing for a future where smart machines improve their business. Here are just a few of the possible applications: Identify opportunities: Since connected machines collect a great volume of data that can inform maintenance, performance and other issues, as well as analyze that data to identify patterns and insights that would be impossible for a human to do in a reasonable timeframe, Industry 4.0 offers the opportunity for manufacturers to optimize their operations quickly and efficiently by knowing what needs attention. By using the data from sensors in its equipment, an African gold mine identified a problem with the oxygen levels during leaching. Once fixed, they were able to increase their yield by 3.7%. Optimize logistics and supply chains: A connected supply chain can adjust and accommodate when new information is presented. If a weather delay ties up a shipment, a connected system can proactively adjust to that reality and modify manufacturing priorities. Autonomous equipment and vehicles: There are shipping yards that are leveraging autonomous cranes and trucks to streamline operations as they accept shipping containers from the ships. Robots: Once only possible for large enterprises with equally large budgets, robotics are now more affordable and available to organizations of every size. From picking products at a warehouse to getting them ready to ship, autonomous robots can quickly and safely support manufacturers. Robots move goods around Amazon warehouses and also reduce costs and allow better use of floor space for the online retailer. Additive manufacturing (3D printing): This technology has improved tremendously in the last decade and has progressed from primarily being used for prototyping to actual production. Advances in the use of metal additive manufacturing have opened up a lot of possibilities for production. Internet of Things and the cloud: A key component of Industry 4.0 is the Internet of Things that is characterized by connected devices. Not only does this help internal operations, but through the use of the cloud environment where data is stored, equipment and operations can be optimized by leveraging the insights of others using the same equipment or to allow smaller enterprises access to the technology they wouldn\u2019t be able to on their own. While Industry 4.0 is still evolving and we might not have the complete picture until we look back 30 years from now, companies who are adopting the technologies realize Industry 4.0's potential. These same companies are also grappling with how to upskill their current workforce to take on new work responsibilities made possible by Internet 4.0 and to recruit new employees with the right skills.

            "answer_text": "Industry 4.0 and India\u2019s Preparedness What is Industry 4.0? \u00b7 Industry 4.0 \u2013 or the Industrial Internet of Things \u2013 is on the verge of radically changing the way in which manufacturers operate. \u00b7 The rise of new digital industrial technology, known as Industry 4.0, is a transformation that makes it possible to gather and analyze data across machines and thus enabling faster, more flexible, and more efficient processes to produce higher-quality goods at reduced costs. \u00b7 It focuses heavily on interconnectivity, automation, machine learning, and real-time data.  Introduction \u00b7 Technological advances have driven dramatic increases in industrial productivity since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. \u00b7 Now, though, we are in the midst of a fourth wave of technological advancement: the rise of new digital industrial technology known as Industry 4.0, a transformation that is powered by nine foundational technology advances would transform how our machines work. \u00b7 In this transformation, sensors, machines, work pieces, and IT systems will be connected along the value chain beyond a single enterprise. These connected systems (also referred to as cyber physical systems) can interact with one another using standard Internet-based protocols and analyze data to predict failure, configure themselves, and adapt to changes. \u00b7 This in turn will increase manufacturing productivity, shift economics, foster industrial growth, and modify the profile of the workforce\u2014ultimately changing the competitiveness of companies and regions. The Nine Pillars of Technological Advancement \u00b7 Many of the nine advances in technology that form the foundation for Industry 4.0 are already used in manufacturing, but with Industry 4.0, they will transform production: isolated, optimized cells will come together as a fully integrated, automated, and optimized production flow, leading to greater efficiencies and changing traditional production relationships among suppliers, producers, and customers\u2014as well as between human and machine.  1. Big Data and Analytics \u00b7 Analytics based on large data sets has emerged only recently in the manufacturing world, where it optimizes production quality, saves energy, and improves equipment service. \u00b7 In an Industry 4.0 context, the collection and comprehensive evaluation of data from many different sources\u2014production equipment and systems as well as enterprise- and customer-management systems\u2014will become standard to support real-time decision making. 2. Autonomous Robots \u00b7 Manufacturers in many industries have long used robots to tackle complex assignments, but robots are evolving for even greater utility. \u00b7 They are becoming more autonomous, flexible, and cooperative. \u00b7 Eventually, they will interact with one another and work safely side by side with humans and learn from them. \u00b7 These robots will cost less and have a greater range of capabilities than those used in manufacturing today. 3. Simulation \u00b7 In the engineering phase, 3-D simulations of products, materials, and production processes are already used, but in the future, simulations will be used more extensively in plant operations as well. \u00b7 The 3D simulation data allows operators to test and optimize the machine settings for the next product in line in the virtual world before the physical changeover, thereby driving down machine setup times and increasing quality. 4. Horizontal and Vertical System Integration \u00b7 Most of today\u2019s IT systems are not fully integrated. Companies, suppliers, and customers are rarely closely linked.Nor are departments such as engineering, production, and service. \u00b7 Functions from the enterprise to the shop floor level are not fully integrated. \u00b7 Even engineering itself \u2014from products to plants to automation\u2014lacks complete integration. \u00b7 But with Industry 4.0, companies, departments, functions, and capabilities will become much more cohesive, as cross-company, universal data-integration networks evolve and enable truly automated value chains. 5. The Industrial Internet of Things \u00b7 Today, only some of a manufacturer\u2019s sensors and machines are networked and make use of embedded computing. \u00b7 They are typically organized in a vertical automation pyramid in which sensors and field devices with limited intelligence and automation controllers feed into an overarching manufacturing-process control system. \u00b7 But with the Industrial Internet of Things, more devices\u2014sometimes including even unfinished products\u2014will be enriched with embedded computing and connected using standard technologies. \u00b7 This allows field devices to communicate and interact both with one another and with more centralized controllers, as necessary. \u00b7 It also decentralizes analytics and decision making, enabling real-time responses. 6. Cybersecurity \u00b7 Many companies still rely on management and production systems that are unconnected or closed. \u00b7 With the increased connectivity and use of standard communications protocols that come with Industry 4.0, the need to protect critical industrial systems and manufacturing lines from cyber-security threats increases dramatically. \u00b7 As a result, secure, reliable communications as well as sophisticated identity and access management of machines and users are essential. \u00b7 During the past year, several industrial-equipment vendors have joined forces with cyber-security companies through partnerships or acquisitions. \u00b7 Effective proven security features for real-time critical systems are essential to adopt Industry 4.0. 7. The Cloud \u00b7 Companies are already using cloud-based software for some enterprise and analytics applications, but with Industry 4.0, more production-related undertakings will require increased data sharing across sites and company boundaries. \u00b7 At the same time, the performance of cloud technologies will improve, achieving reaction times of just several milliseconds. \u00b7 As a result, machine data and functionality will increasingly be deployed to the cloud, enabling more data-driven services for production systems. \u00b7 Even systems that monitor and control processes may become cloud based. \u00b7 Vendors of manufacturing-execution systems are among the companies that have started to offer cloud-based solutions.(E.g Amazon Web Services) 8. Additive Manufacturing \u00b7 Companies have just begun to adopt additive manufacturing, such as 3-D printing, which they use mostly to prototype and produce individual components. With Industry 4.0, these additive-manufacturing methods will be widely used to produce small batches of customized products that offer construction advantages, such as complex, lightweight designs. \u00b7 High-performance, decentralized additive manufacturing systems will reduce transport distances and stock on hand. 9. Augmented Reality \u00b7 Augmented-reality-based systems support a variety of services, such as selecting parts in a warehouse and sending repair instructions over mobile devices. \u00b7 These systems are currently in their infancy, but in the future, companies will make much broader use of augmented reality to provide workers with real-time information to improve decision making and work procedures. Outcomes  \u00b7 Industries and countries will clasp Industry 4.0 at different rates and in different ways. \u00b7 Industries with a high level of product variants, such as the automotive and food-and-beverage industries, will benefit from a greater degree of flexibility that can generate productivity gains, for example, and industries that demand high quality, such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, will benefit from data-analytics-driven improvements that reduce error rates. \u00b7 Countries with high-cost skilled labour will be able to capitalize on the higher degree of automation combined with the increased demand for more highly skilled labour. \u00b7 However, many emerging markets like India with a young, technology-savvy workforce might also jump at the opportunity and might even create entirely new manufacturing concepts. \u00b7 Global trend towards knowledge based economy will grow in coming times. \u00b7 The focus will be on acquiring new skills on critical thinking, design thinking, problem solving, team work and cognitive learning. \u00b7 Re-skilling and up-skilling needs to be done for existing workforce to equip them with changed job roles. \u00b7 In India, skills in domains like Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Robotics, Big Data Analytics and 3D printing will be in much demand. \u00b7 New employment opportunities also known as gig economy will emerge like online developers, coders, online sales, systems thinking and multilingual and multimodal capabilities. \u00b7 Low skill jobs will be eliminated and new higher skill jobs and industry sectors will be added. \u00b7 There are doubts that the new technologies will kill jobs but historically it can be seen that new technology has created more jobs. \u00b7 Along the value chain, production processes will be optimized through integrated IT systems. As a result, today\u2019s insular manufacturing cells will be replaced by fully automated, integrated production lines. \u00b7 Products, production processes, and production automation will be designed and commissioned virtually in one integrated process and through the collaboration of producers and suppliers. Physical prototypes will be reduced to an absolute minimum. \u00b7 Manufacturing processes will be enhanced through learning and self-optimizing pieces of equipment that will, for example, adjust their own parameters as they sense certain properties of the unfinished product. \u00b7 Automated logistics, using autonomous vehicles and robots, will adjust automatically to production needs.  Impact on Production Lines \u00b7 Industrial Revolution brought-in a sea of changes in the manufacturing goods but this Industry4.0 pre-dominantly focuses on the improvement of production lines.(Design to After Sales Service). \u00b7 Along the value chain, production processes will be optimized through integrated IT systems. \u00b7 As a result, today\u2019s insular manufacturing cells will be replaced by fully automated, integrated production lines. \u00b7 Products, production processes, and production automation will be designed and commissioned virtually in one integrated process and through the collaboration of producers and suppliers. Physical prototypes will be reduced to an absolute minimum. \u00b7 Manufacturing processes will increase in flexibility and allow for the economic production of small lot sizes. \u00b7 Robots, smart machines, and smart products that communicate with one another and make certain autonomous decisions will provide this flexibility.  \u00b7 Manufacturing processes will be enhanced through learning and self-optimizing pieces of equipment that will, for example, adjust their own parameters as they sense certain properties of the unfinished product. \u00b7 Automated logistics, using autonomous vehicles and robots, will adjust automatically to production needs.  Trends in India \u00b7 Industry 4.0 can be integrated with Make in India, Skill India, Startup India and Digital India to create more opportunities. \u00b7 Make in India scheme aims to make India a global manufacturing hub and create 100 million new jobs by 2022.  \u00b7 Import duties on mobile phones, automobiles have been increased so that foreign companies will setup manufacturing units in India. \u00b7 Rising trends in enrolments of online courses like big data, machine learning and cloud computing. \u00b7 Digital India budget has been doubled. \u00b7 Plans to setup centres of excellence for research, training and skilling in robotics, artificial intelligence, digital manufacturing, big data analysis and IOT. \u00b7 Startup India launched in 2016 is generating large scale employment and is building a vibrant ecosystem for nurturing entrepreneurship and innovation. Eligible startups are exempt from income tax levy on share premium received100% deduction of profit and gains from income for 3 out of 7 consecutive assessment years. \u00b7 The government has come out with a new draft for telecom policy-National Digital Communications Policy 2018 Aim to create a roadmap for emerging technologies.Attract $100 billion investment and create 4 million jobs by 2022.Increasing India\u2019s contribution to global value chain by creation of innovation led startups in digital communications sector.Training 1 million for building new age skills, expand IOT ecosystem to 5 billion connected devicesAccelerate shift to Industry 4.0. \u00b7 National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme has been launched to promote apprenticeship which is a critical asset. The Road Ahead \u00b7 As per World Bank, India is the fastest growing major economy of the world and it will continue so for the next decade. \u00b7 The skills agenda needs to be revisited as global manufacturing will see structural shift. \u00b7 Cross functional skills will be critical factor of production and driver of competitiveness \u00b7 Continuous employee re-skilling and up- skilling \u00b7 Government has to inculcate STEM education (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the course curricula. Conclusion \u00b7 Youth is the fountain head of national growth and development. \u00b7 Industry 4.0 presents tremendous opportunities for innovative producers, system suppliers, and entire regions. \u00b7 For this we need progressive transformation which can be achieved with the transformational change, the government is trying to bring through various models and schemes. \u00b7 Industry 4.0 also poses a severe threat to laggards. As business models, economics, and skill requirements shift, we could well see major changes in top positions, at both the company and regional levels. \u00b7 Manufacturing processes will increase in flexibility and allow for the economic production of small lot sizes. \u00b7 Robots, smart machines, and smart products that communicate with one another and make certain autonomous decisions will provide this flexibility.
