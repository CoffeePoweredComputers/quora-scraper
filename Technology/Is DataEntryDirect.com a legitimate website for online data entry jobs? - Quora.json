            "answer_text": "Not sure abut name mentioned. but most of scammes operate on data entry jobs projct offers only. yes. they collect fees, registration and give something mission impossible task and later , deny for payments . so you can not basically scream being scammed too. cute reason, your submission was not according quality parameters, accuracy , work load etc. No matter where you are . forget earnings if trying to search for genuine data entry, copy paste thing. You will never find one . companies never waste money on such simple jobs which can be done by anyone.. You are not alone who know to type abcd. No offense. Instead improve your skills. bid on projects . if you are qualified , no one stops you from getting real jobs. If not , no one can give you job. Try to learn some marketing , real business, demand and supply , lead generation etc . where you introduce new revenue to companies, client and earn commission for successful submission. Good Luck. One of genuine reference still in market . Definately not data entry and keyboard trics. only lead generation, sales and marketing . Try it.
