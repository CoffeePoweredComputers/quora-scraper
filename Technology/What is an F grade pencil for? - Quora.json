            "answer_text": "Pencils differ by their grades.They range in H and B. H stands for hardness whereas B stands for blackness.It starts from H-9H as it gets harder. Similary for B-9B as it gets softer.Now there is HB, F stands somewhere between HB and H. F may indicate fine but that isnt official, just a name carried forward  by people. The hard grade pencils are used to mark or draw lines in wood and the softer B ones for shading purposes. HB is used for writing on papers, since F is below H it can be used for writing but it wont be smooth to use it.  It's use can be same as HB or H.  Source: My arts teacher ",

            "answer_text": "As per my knowledge of pencil shades,Pencils for sketching differs in grades. H Grade \u2192 Hard lead pencil(can be used to write on woods) B Grade \u2192 blackish lead Pencil(best for shading purpose) F Grade \u2192 Fine lead pencil So the pencil with F grade can be sharpened to a fine point and can be used to write on hard surfaces. but most importantly finding what works best for you as per your needs on sketching or writing is a matter of your own preferences and experiments by using different brands of pencils.
