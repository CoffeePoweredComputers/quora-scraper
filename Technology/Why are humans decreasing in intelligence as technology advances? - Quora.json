            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Human IQ points might be following a negative slope over the decades. But this doesn\u2019t signify any rigid proof of \u201cIntelligence\u201d itself reducing. IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient and measures Critical Thinking and Learning capability, not Smartness or Intelligence. It is a biological fact that our brain cells are reducing gradually over generations, Whether its evolutionary in making brains smaller and more efficient or whether its the shit-tons of chemical additives in our food, I can\u2019t tell. But, I also personally feel that while Humans haven\u2019t in any way degraded in terms of intelligence, Our Parenting and Nutrition skills have terribly declined over the generations. As Edison remarked Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration, If humans aren\u2019t given incentive to work hard and max their potential, they definitely would lag behind in IQ and pass on these genes to their offspring and so on. The education system is also to blame for this scenario. When students don\u2019t perform well enough, we reduce the passing grades! Problem solved! The school earns a good name, gets rich and everyone\u2019s happy. It\u2019s all about the money these days, No one really cares about improving humanity unless there is capitalism potential. Hope this answers it! Have a great day! ",

            "answer_text": "The scenario presented in the diagram is impossible. IQs are calculated by standard deviation from the mean: 100. So by definition the average IQ is 100 and will always be 100 for eternity. Now, it is true a year 1950 100 IQ would certainly be different then a year 2110 100 IQ, but thats a separate question. I don\u2019t think it is true that humans are becoming less intelligent with technology. It all depends on what is considered intelligence. In older times it was important to keep many things in someones head because it is not feasible to constantly be referring back to books for everything you ever needed to know. In current times, the average person may keep fewer hard skills in their head but I think this allows humans to clear bandwidth in their brains to focus on other problems. In this sense, our problem solving skills are far more advanced then they used to be. This is speculative of course, it would be difficult to compare since every generation had different \u201ctruths\u201d at the time that restricted thinking. It would be unfair to call someone living in year 1200 unintelligent because they thought the world was flat. Just like now I am sure there are many parts of life that will seem ridiculous in the future! ",

That chart is wrong in that it shows the exact opposite of reality: IQ tests have to be periodically adjusted to prevent people from scoring too high because of the Flynn effect. IQs, in average, raise almost 3 points per decade. So, an average person in 2010 would score over 115 in a 1950 test. ",
