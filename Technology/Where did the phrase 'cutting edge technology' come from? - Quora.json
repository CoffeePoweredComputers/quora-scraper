            "answer_text": "Cutting-edge technology refers to technological devices, techniques or achievements that employ the most current and high-level IT developments; in other words, technology at the frontiers of knowledge. Leading and innovative IT industry organizations are often referred to as \"cutting edge.\". Then, where from did this phrase originate? The initial meaning of \u201cleading edge\u201d was in reference to the forward edge of the blade of a screw propeller (such as on a ship) that cuts through the water. Later use applied the term to the wing surfaces of an aircraft and even the forward edge of a moving plate in the surface of the earth. Cutting-edge technology refers to current and fully developed technology features, unlike bleeding-edge technology, which is so new that it poses unreliability risks to users. While commonly used to refer to computer and electronic technology, the term can apply to technology of any type, including automotive, medical, engineering and countless other industries. As a term, \"cutting-edge technology\" is somewhat ambiguous and often used in the context of marketing. ",

            "answer_text": "During the 18 th century, in buisness, you could have an edge over your competition, where as you were out performing your buisness rivals. Thus in 19th century, new developments, like the steam engine at sea, were described as a cutting edge technology, in that they redefined the edges of the buisness/military landscape. I believe HMS Warrior, and her 12 class ships, the first iron warships were described in 1860 as cutting edge, despite being modelled on the French Redoubt Iron clad warship of 1850. ",
