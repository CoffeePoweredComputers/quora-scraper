Some of the people got tired making these extraordinary contraptions and so here are some of the dumbest inventions that will force you to laugh your head off.\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af  The Useless MachineWhat can you expect from a machine that itself states that it is useless? It's a simple device in which when the user pushes the lever magic happens. A small hand comes out of the box and pushes the lever back to its original place. How magical! Right?   The Multilever Uselss MachineThis son of a gun takes the concept of the useless machine take to a WHOLE new level. Now you can push multiple switches and the machine will keep turning it off with the help of its very own hand (humans are progressing-_-). From useless machine to useless machine 2.0.   Dual Useless MachineOne of the most laziest man on the world thought,\u201cWhy do we even need to push a button again and again to open and close a box.\u201d (So pointless). So he created the Duel useless machine. In this machine you just need to press one button and both the levers will start pushing the lever onto the other\u2019s side. Basically triggering each other. Hence the Useless Machine 3.0 was created. I can't stop laughing. :-p  Problem Solved! (Therefore, The Useless Story Ends)  The Useless Box Returns.The Useless Box Redefined; Beware!! The useless machine has awoken from its sleep. The kids of the modern world like scary things. Right? So, they transformed the Useless box into a Usless Coffin. In which when you push the lever, a scary hands comes out and you know WHAT IT DOES? The ordinary thing, it closes the box.Duh!   The Smoking Machine (Anyone wants a cigarette?)Obviously, why do we need to even smoke, right guys? So another lazy man created the Chainsmoker (Not the one that gave you Closer), The Smoking Machine. It\u2019s motor starts taking cigarettes and burning it. I don't know the exact time at which this machine will get a Lung Cancer though. Hehehe.   These were all the dumbest of machines from my side. Hope you liked my post. Bye Folks!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "In the Netherlands, we usually pay with a bank card: a PIN pass. It is noticeable that \u201cpinnen\u201d is now a standard verb in Dutch. I am used to that; so used to it that I found returning to using cash when I was in the USA on visit was a surprise. But here is the new feature I loathe: contactloos betalen. To illustrate the contrast, here is the usual method:  Insert the card, type in your 4-digit number, and wait for the transaction to be complete. Here is what it means to pay \u201ccontactloos\u201d:  You just put your card up to the icon on the side; it reads the chip automatically, and the transaction is complete without your needing to type your 4-digit number in.  This feature is too common, and I think you can see the potential for abuse. In theory, if I find someone else\u2019s card on the side of the road, I can just use it. I could go to a restaurant and just pay without needing to guess the PIN. In other words, it makes fraud much easier \u2026 for the sake of convenience! I would much rather have the \u201cinconvenience\u201d of typing four digits which I\u2019ve memorized than to take the risk that someone might do the above to me. I felt that way the first time a local restaurant (since closed) used that feature with my card without asking me. I have since had my bank (ING) disable that feature. I do not trust that feature. I find it not only pointless, but potentially dangerous as well. ",
