            "answer_text": "In terms of the most exciting tech startup ideas, let\u2019s clarify that \u201cexciting\u201d could mean immediate cash or it could mean sentient recommender systems and robotic bartenders. The opportunity for business impact is usually due to the fact that society has still failed to adapt to the paradigms of what\u2019s possible for computers. There are existing, amazing technologies that are going to waste! Solved Problems Waiting For Adoption When computers were invented, people weren\u2019t sure how to work with them, so everything was essentially just a digital adaption of existing processes. This also influenced the naming \u2212 \u201cemail\u201d, \u201ce-signature\u201d etc. Emails should more accurately be called \u201ce-postcards\u201d btw, since everyone along the way can read it and it certainly doesn\u2019t have to be this way.  On the Internet, we still often don\u2019t really know who people are; and we still make mistakes that are meant to be within the realm of \u201crobotic\u201d thought \u2212 we lose things; we forget things; we make mistakes in calculations; we leave our information vulnerable. In particular I\u2019d like to mention spreadsheets \u2212 they were based on the idea that humans can understand what\u2019s happening between the columns, but for VLOOKUP, they can\u2019t infer what\u2019s going on and they need to easily see the formulas or there are going to be mistakes. There are trillions of dollars being caused by avoidable problems, as discussed in Spreadsheets Are Sabotaging Your Business  Word-processing suffers many of the same problems as spreadsheets btw \u2212 data; algorithms; and presentation should be kept separate. To achieve this, documents should be written in LaTeX (or even Jupyter Notebooks & MathJax), not Microsoft Word or its clones. I don\u2019t consider blockchains as an obvious solution that should\u2019ve already been adopted, but now that they exist, we have a similar scenario to the already-mentioned problems, where there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to solve real problems right now. Ethereum in particular can be used to solve problems around provenance; escrow; and even the legal immunity of computing.  A Practical Guide To Eternal Life Futuristic Technology For Our Other Problems Computers struggle to see; it\u2019s just not something that you can expect a calculator to do; and yet, at the LDV Vision Summit, it became clear that through sheer perseverance, humans are pushing computers to use images as the input for seemingly any problem imaginable. IBM Watson can now accurately classify food and its portion sizes from photos. It would\u2019ve been easier with a scale, but whatever, humans take pictures; they share pictures; and they hence provide plenty of training data for machine learning. Nobody shares the data from their scales except on Grindr.  Tell me what you eat, and I\u2019ll tell you what you are In judging these future technologies, I think we can clearly make the conclusion that society is just going to do its own thing for decades, even if it\u2019s the wrong approach. Computers can still become smarter thanks to all the training data, but unfortunately we can\u2019t count on consumer adoption of a product simply because it\u2019s good or even optimal. There are a few startups that can be put in both buckets \u2212 they\u2019re using futuristic technology to solve problems that could\u2019ve already been solved, had people just adopted the right solution. Tanuki.ai is one of these. Adoption of Tanuki\u2019s software is a critical part in the roadmap to liberating humanity from its existing enslavement, where we\u2019re performing the tasks of robots.
