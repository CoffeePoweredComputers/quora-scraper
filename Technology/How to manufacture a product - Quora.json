            "answer_text": "This is a very broad questions and it really is different from product to product. But just as a general overview: You first need to work out what manufacturing processes are required to make your parts that will make up your final product. PlasticsIf you have plastic parts you are 90% of the time going to need to use Injection Moulding. This means you are going to need to open tools, which depending on the size and complexity of the part could range from hundreds to thousands of dollars all the way up to one million plus. There are also other factors to consider when opening tools such as the tool life you will require; 10,000, 50,000, 150,000, 1 Million. This will also have an effect on the cost as the metal used to make the tool will be higher quality and most of the time harder which makes machining and making the tool more difficult.There is another process with plastics which can be used which is extrusion. This is when you want long parts of a uniform shape and size. These lengths are normally 6 meters in length and then are cut to the desired length for the product.Lastly you can also machine plastics from blocks of material, however this is really only used for short production runs unless there is a technical reason why a tool cannot be made.MetalsThis is a huge area. For metals there are so many processes:MachiningExtrusionCasting: Investment Casting, Sand Casting etc.StampingFormingFasteners (Bolts, Screws, Washers, Clips etc.)There are a vast array of \u2018standard\u2019 fasteners for products and most can be bought \u2018off the shelf\u2019. If you need custom fasteners this will require tooling.ElectronicsFor electronics the first thing you will need is a supplier who can make the blank PCB BoardAfter you or your supplier will need to arrange the purchasing of the components which go onto the board. They will then need to me placed onto the board at an SMT Factory.Then for larger components or components with legs, wires, pins etc. they will need to placed on the board and either wave or hand soldered. This process is called THT.After all the above steps are complete the board will need to be tested which requires a special PCB testing device to be made and then the software to be loaded onto the PCB (If you have Software).The above points are literally the tip of the iceberg and there are loads of others which could possibly be needed. The best thing I would suggest is: Get Prototypes of your parts made if you haven\u2019t done so already. You can use simple short run processes such as 3D Printing, Milling/Machining, Metal Forming etc. to make these parts so there is no large investment in tooling. Then test your product for:Functionality: Does it meet the requirements you were looking to achieve.Durability: Is it strong enough to survive in the environment it will be used it. Also Life Cycle testing can be done here as well to see how long your product lasts.Ease of Assembly: (DFM: Design for Manufacturability), how easy is the product to manufacture, could any changes to the design be made that would make manufacturing easier without affecting the Functionality or Durability in a negative way.Find suppliers that already product parts and products similar to yours. Visit them/Audit them, get quotes and technical information on how they plan to achieve your requirements.Review the suppliers you can chosen and go with the ones you think will be best for the part you are looking to product.Work on opening tools for parts that need tooling in order to be mass produced. Choose your tooling carefully to ensure it meets your quality, tolerance and durability requirements.Do a short production run to test the stability of your processes and improve the manufacturing of your product. Try and continually improve the process to make it more efficient and stable.If everything has gone well with the above point you can go into mass production.As I mentioned this is a really VERY brief overview of how to take a product from a concept to a mass production product. If you can be more specific regarding the product I could try and update my answer accordingly and make it more suitable for your requirements. Best of Luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Many people have great ideas of new product.But they might do not know what the next? Below are some of my opinion for your reference. I have been in plastic injection molding and tooling for more than 6 years(rpimoulding). From my experience,when you come up with some new projects, you need to know: 1, What are they made of? Usually, different materials are made by different processing. For example, when your new project is a metal part, you should not find a plastic manufacturer. 2,Do you know what the processing it should be? If it is made of metal, do you know what the processing it should be? If not sure, do you have samples or prototypes available? All manufacturers custom make parts as per samples or prototypes or 3D drawings. If you have more than one samples/protoypes available, you can send one to the manufacturer to know whether it is in their field.For us, if it is not within our capabilities, we can usually help to transfer the sample/prototype to other factories as per the customer's request. Metals are usually made by die casting(it is also called metal injection molding or MIM), stamping, or extruding. If it is made of plastic, they can usually be made by plastic injection molding, blow molding, rotocasting, extruding, rotational molding,etc. Also, plastic injection molding is the widest used method. For which processing, it depends on the design or constructure of the part. If you are not sure, come to us for help. 3,What should you prepare? Money,of course. _ Then a prototype or sample or 3D design drawings. To make prototypes, you can find a local rapid prototyping company to do it. If just need to be similar to an existing product, you can get a similar sample from existing market, and tell the manufacture where you need modifications. If it is not new, just need to copy, you can easily get a sample. To make 3D design drawing, one of my customers, I heard that he finds a university engineering major student to create the first 3D. And then send to the manufacturer, the manufacturer must know where should be modified, as the student might not know knowledges in manufacturing. ",
