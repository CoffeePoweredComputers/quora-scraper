            "answer_text": "In response to your question I googled \"The English Opening\" and found this very nice article: The Ideas behind the English Opening  It seems your choices are: encourage a transposition to the Queens Gambit, or with 1...e5 go to something like a closed Sicilian but with the black pieces and a tempo down, you'll need to play sharp to pull it off! It looks like you could also try something that looks like the white side of the Dutch defense but, again, with the black pieces. It looks like the BAD idea is to leap into the center with the idea of holding it. That seems to be white's dream response! There are other ideas in the article. Don't ask for the 'best' move. The best move is the one that wins, and we won't know which one that is for 30-40 moves yet! Look at it another way. When white plays 1. c4, white is giving you, black, opportunities and challenges. Ones that are different than if white had played 1. d4, or 1 e4. You'll see this if you play enough chess. You'll be glad, that when you do you know something of what white wants to do, and some ways of dealing with it. If the game was just a matter of memorizing lines, wouldn't it be a dismal passtime?

            "answer_text": "There's no best move, however, there are several fighting moves that are subjective to a player's style. If a player prefers uncompromising chess 1...Nf6 followed by 2...e6 or 2...g6 are definitely options. If a player prefers more positional play, 1...e5 or 1...c5 are viable options. Personally I play 1...Nf6 and 2...e6 almost exclusively after 1.c4. ",
