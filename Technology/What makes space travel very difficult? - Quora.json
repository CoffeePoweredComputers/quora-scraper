Here is how astronaut Don Pettit solved the problem:  Morning Joe in Space: MoMA Acquires Capt. Samantha Cristoforetti\u2019s Coffee Cup  We have not been in space long enough to be comfortable there. The right stuff is vital. To get some idea of what is involved, consider Antarctic exploration. From the point of view of 19th century explorers, it was as challenging as space is now. Antarctic Exploration in a Nutshell It was hard for sailing ships to reach because of the circumpolar current and stormy seas. It was Captain James Cook in 1773 who first deduced its existence from rock embedded in icebergs. In 1820, half a century later, Thaddeus Bellinghausen became the first explorer to sight the continent. For the rest of the century, exploration was restricted to the ocean, with a few landings (e.g. Carsten Borchgrevink who used dog sledges for transport). During that time, the sea was exploited by fishermen and whalers. It was in 1900 that serious exploration of Antarctica started with Ernest Shackleton\u2019s expeditions, and culminating in the famous race to the South Pole by Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen. Permanent bases in the interior waited until the first Geophysical Year in 1957-1958, and the Antarctic Treaty of 1961. Now there are year-round bases at the South Pole, with several major scientific research stations, such as the Ice Cube neutrino observatory. The first observation is that these things take a long time and start slowly. Much of that time is just being able to reach the place. It takes a long time to learn how to prepare for the environment. Amundson benefited from his fellow Norwegian\u2019s example of using dog sledges. This allowed him to prepare for the long journey, and the dogs were a source of food on the return. Scott\u2019s men, on the other hand, pulled their sledges the whole way. When they ran out of food, they died. The Norwegians probably had better equipment, coming from a country that straddles the Arctic Circle.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s expensive. Chemical fueled rockets are obscenely inefficient. Most of the fuel is burned just to push more fuel. So to get a payload into space from the ground in the Earth\u2019s gravity and thick atmosphere, you need really big rockets. There are theoretical technologies that could bring the cost of space travel down, but the developmental and setup costs would be enormous. Others, like a space elevator or star tram, require technology and material sciences we simply don\u2019t have yet. One non chemical fueled launch system that we\u2019ve known how to build since before the Apollo program and would lower the cost of space travel happens to be illegal: nuclear pulse propulsion. The bottom line is that in a capitalist society, especially a late-stage capitalist dystopia like the US, nothing gets funded unless it will start making the rich richer with one or two fiscal years. A non rocket launch system would take over a decade to develop and might never turn a profit. The few billionaires investing in space travel aren\u2019t actually advancing technology, instead they\u2019re just reusing technology developed by the US, UK, and USSR during the Cold War. And their motives seem rather dystopian rather than scientific. Musk seems to want to create a bolt hole on Mars where the super rich could run after capitalism starts collapsing our civilization in a few decades. ",
