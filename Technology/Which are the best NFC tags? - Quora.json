            "answer_text": "No, the \u201cbest\u201c\uff0c only has the \u201cbest fit\u201d. Labels are flexible and change based on project needs and the work environment. NFC technology combines the functional design of non-reader/Reader, non-tag/tag, and peer-to-peer data exchange! NFC Forum, as the author of the specification, defines the following 5 types of NFC tags. Type 1: Based on ISO14443A. With readable, re-write capabilities, which users can configure as read-only. The storage capacity is 96 bytes and is used to store URL or other small amounts of data. However, memory can be expanded to 2k bytes. The communication speed is 106 kbit/s.Typical chip type Topaz 512 (BCM20203) Type 2: Is also based on ISO14443A, with readable, re-write capabilities that users can configure as read-only. Its base memory size is 48 bytes, but can be expanded to 2k bytes. Communication speed is also 106 kbit/s.Typical chip types are Mifare Ultralight / Ultralight C, NTag203/210/213/215/216, etc. Type 3: Data communication speed is 212 Kbit/s. Therefore, this kind of label is more suitable for more complex applications, the cost is higher.Type 4: This type of label is defined as compatible with ISO14443A and B standards. Manufactured is pre-set to readable/rewritable, or read-only. The chip has a larger memory and is communicating between 106 kbit/s and 424 kbit/s.Typical chip types for a wide range of applications are the DESFire family, with capacities ranging from 2K, 4K, and 8K. Type 5: This type of tag is the latest type of NFC tag defined in recent years, and the corresponding RFID protocol is the ISO15693 series RFID chip. NFC Forum introduced this range of chips to meet the growing variety of long-distance, miniaturized NFC tags and their applications. ",

            "answer_text": "If the word \u201cbest\u201d is not intended to determine which NFC tags are best for a particular use case but \u201cbest\u201d with regard to material composition and reliability the answer I can provide is simple: The NFC Forum is the \u201cofficial\u201d organization for NFC and has so far refused to do its job in this regard. The NFC Forum takes many, many, many thousands of dollars they charge for \u201cmemberships\u201d but spend NOTHING in return to help determine which manufacturers of this type of product are manufacturing the best products. The NFC Forum has been made aware of misconduct and unlawful activity by some of its members and has refused to say or do anything about such reports. I know this to be true because I attempted to report a member for unlawful activity. My emails were not even answered. Be advised then, on the basis of fthe facts on-hand as I know them and as they can be observed by anybody taking the time to look into the matter the NFC Forum is like \u201cassociations\u201d simply yet another marketing scam and none of us working with NFC tags have as of yet an independent trustworthy resource to help answer such questions as to which are NFC tags \u201cbest.\u201d \u2014 Clinton Gallagher (((tap)))\u00ae to interact anywhere in cellular space ",
