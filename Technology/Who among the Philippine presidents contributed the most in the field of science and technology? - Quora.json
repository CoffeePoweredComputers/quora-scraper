            "answer_text": "That will be President Marcos. He encouraged the development of missile technology, the construction of locally built helicopter construction of first integrated steel mills construction of copper smelting, development of geothermal and nuclear power plant and encouraged the development of locally designed public utility vehicles. That guy was a visionary though. He was just corrupted by many of his trusted friends who received money to run manufacturing facilities that ended into a failure. He ended his legacy as a corrupt and with a bad behavior leader. ",
