            "answer_text": "Someone asked me \u201cHow do we stop our young people from carrying knives?\u201d to which I reply: Absurd. There is no knife problem. There is a widespread character and integrity problem. People who can\u2019t be trusted to walk around in public with bits of sharp metal really can\u2019t be trusted with anything at all, including self governance.  Having constantly carried a blade since I was 9, (Yes, including at school, with teacher knowledge as there were no rules against it at the time) with I have zero interest in supporting such a ludicrous premise. I gave my children knives to use and carry on their own responsibility at an early age, after they demonstrated safe blade handling derived from BSA \u201cTotin\u2019 Chip\u201d requirements. Totin' Chip | Boy Scouts of America Unfortunately, I had to fortify the safe use and handling standards with additional material that takes into account the craven and brainless zero tolerance context in which we now operate. This included advising them to never discuss or display their knives to their friends or anyone else in public, never take them to school, never to carry them visibly, and to always state that they \u201cdo not consent to searches\u201d in the event anyone claiming authority attempts to search them.  So, if you want your social \u201cknife problem\u201d to go away, raise your kids to be full adult members of a free society, which carries the expectation that they would be trustworthy enough to walk around in public with guns.

            "answer_text": "I carried a knife my entire childhood and most of my adult life. I probably had my first knife when I was 6 or 7. I carried a knife with me wherever I went including school. I grew up on a farm and it was a frequently used tool. I never considered hurting anyone with it. The problem is not the knifes. If you are concerned about young people carrying knives, it really means that your society has not raised responsible citizens. Solve that problem and you won\u2019t have to worry about the knives, guns, brass knuckles, baseball bats and anything else you can think of that could be used as a weapon. I have no idea what country you live in, but I suspect that your society has become very tolerant of bad behavior. I live in the US and I can tell you that all our social problems center around a lack of any self discipline among a large percentage of our young people. If I was in charge of education I would fire every teacher in the nation and hire military men to teach. Absolute discipline would be maintained in the classroom. The teachers would be allowed to use whatever painful discipline methods they they find necessary to maintain order, baring anything that would cause permanent injury. Any child assaulting a teacher would be caned as they do in Singapore. If the child learns little more than self discipline in school they will be able to make their way in society. The trouble makers should never be allowed to interfere with the education of those that want to get an education. Those that want to learn would thrive in that kind of environment. Those that don\u2019t care to would at least learn to behave. ",
