            "answer_text": "Most consumers today do not foresee this ever happening. But history begs to differ. Consider the first computers, taking entire rooms. Most people never thought you can put all that computing power into a box that fits nicely on the side of your desk. Then portable computing in the way of laptops and notebook PCs. Now, these devices outnumber desktops in most enterprise environments. Then came the tablets and they are still fairly new in the landscape. There are PCs, like the Microsoft Surface, that although they are technically PCs, they fit the definition of a tablet. Today, there are still too many tasks that require computers, whether it is Windows or iOS based. The reason? Computers are still far more powerful than tablets and in cases like, software development and mathematical computations, the input device of choice is till the keyboard. For this reason, we are a long ways away from replacing computers with tablets. For consumer use, tablets are fast gaining ground. They are affordable and do just about anything a computer can do when it comes to web browsing and other multimedia functionalities. I can even help you organize your day, your work, or your life. And with technological improvements in voice recognition and hand writing recognition, they are being adopted quicker than before, but not in terms of replacing a computer\u2026 at least not yet. I have recently transitioned from a laptop to a Microsoft Surface Pro. It is technically a computer, as its specs closely matched those of my previous laptop. And it can do anything my previous laptop can do, and more. I could not do the kind of work I do on a tablet (Android or iOS). It simply does not have the necessary hardware and capabilities. And while I can use a bluetooth input devices for quicker interaction, it still does not have the capabilities I need to do my job. For example, I cannot perform the type of video edit I do on a laptop with any existing tablet on the market. So when will they replace computers? Personally, I believe that performance is still a major factor for this to occur in the majority of computer users. But, advances in input like voice recognition or writing recognition, will be the true determining factor. AI will also play a major role to improve this aspect of advancing tablets. But this speculation is entirely based on our perception or understanding of the current tablet technology. If tablets evolve, as is expected, they might very well take over. If computer manufacturers go in the way of devices like the Microsoft Surface, these \u201ccomputer tablets\u201d can very well replace computers. Only time will tell. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so, some elements of computer users are very conservative. At least ten years ago, I was told by my computer store boss that, at the time of Windows Vista, the vast majority of computers in the world still used Windows 98; mind you, this included things like retailers like cash registers and data servers, etc, that only need durability, security and cost as prime considerations, not performance. I also do not think tablets will \u201covertake computers\u201d in the sense that it\u2019s actually more the opposite- larger tablets like Microsoft Surface come with physical keyboard attachments. So if tablets overtake computers, it\u2019s only because tablets become more like conventional computers like laptops. I also don\u2019t see them overtaking normal computers simply because tablets are designed with one thing in mind- the next step in portability than laptops. So laptops themselves might die out, but desktops? Nah, designers never even wanted to replace them with tablets. The typical desktop computer someone like a gamer users, will never have integrated speakers, keyboard, mouse and other peripherals. Companies that attempt that will only find a very niche market, and will disappoint that market because the options are inherently less than the option of buying a set of Bose speakers that will never be outdone by anything found in a tablet. Designers know this and don\u2019t bother, instead they go with it and make better Bluetooth connections or otherwise try to profit, like try to improve connection range or be able to simultaneously link with multiple speakers. Ease of use between all your computer accessories is better than having everything in one package. As an \u201cold timer\u201d guy born in the late 1980s, tablets will never replace the keyboard and mouse. I use tablets everyday and I am frustrated by how I can mistype so easily. If I press F instead of G on my laptop, it\u2019s easily fixable- press that big backspace key with right hand, move your finger one key over to correct issue. You cannot ever replicate this with current tablets because of lack of tactile functions of the touch screen. The lack of mouse is more apparent, tablets out there seem to have different ideas of how to make you \u201cright click\u201d or alt-tab, etc. with finger gestures, but with a mouse, it is always with a right-click, unless you specifically flip the function for left-hand users: while I normally can function mice with my right hand, I can easily use it with my left hand due to practice. In my view, if there\u2019s something that will overtake computers, it will be something that overtakes tablets. ",
