            "answer_text": "Having worked in the UK for a while I can tell you that phones there are definitely more expensive unless there's a special discount. If you plan to pay for the phone in INR it's infinitely better to buy it here. If you have price constraints consider picking up a used phone. You get some fabulous deals if you're careful and you look in the right places. Anything bought abroad will not have a valid warranty in India so you're better off either saving some more or looking at used options.  If you must buy abroad the US is your best option and then too primarily on the iPhone. ",
