            "answer_text": "Original Question:\"How many years is an information technology course? Why should I study information technology?\" As with all things... It depends... In this case, it depends on both the institution where you are studying and their particular use of the term. When you say \"course\" do you mean a single subject, a night school \"short course\", an Associate Degree, a Bachelor of Technology (Eng.), a Bachelor of IT (sometimes called Informatics) or a bachelor of Engineering with an IT major? If you are talking about a night school short course, it could take anywhere betwee three months and a year (Depending on what they wanted to cover). If you are talking about *most* universities then: - A single subject usually takes one semester and a workload of four subjects per semester, for at least two semesters per year, is considered a \"Full time study\" workload. - *Some* universities use the word \"course\" to group subjects that are required to quallify for a particular major. IE. A sudent must complete subjects X, Y, Z, J, K, L and M as well as the common core subjects, to graduate with the Software Engineering major. So the Sofware Engineering \"course\" is made up of the subjects X, Y, Z, J, K, L and M. - An Associate Degree takes two years of full time study. - Both a Bachelor of Technology (eng.) and a Bachelor of IT take three years of full time study (usually... some institutions play fast and loose with the terminology). - A Bachelor of Engineering with an IT major (Micro-electronic Engineering / Software Engineering / Robotics / etc.) takes four years of full time study. - If it's a combined degree (eg. Bachelor of IT and Aviation, Bachelor of Business with IT, etc.) all bets are off. They can add one or two years to the length of the other degrees. Now onto the second part:\"Why\". The short answer is like asking whether you should study medicine:If you have to ask, you probably won't enjoy it.If you don't enjoy it, you probably won't finish it. That said, from an economic point of view *everything* these days has an IT component to it.This means that those who have been properly trained to exploit IT, can be productive almost anywhere, with almost anything.This also means *everybody* seems to feel they \"know IT\" because they worked out how to reboot their phone and load up some apps. If you like the idea of plugging things together and forcing them to work, against all odds and their designers expectaions, then IT may be for you. If you don't mind answering to people that mistakenly believe they know as much as you do, because they read a PC magazine once and recognised some of the shorter words, then IT may be for you. If you like the idea of guiding such people (who will also be determining whether or not you get paid), then IT may be for you. If you can deal with customers pushing infront of you and randomly mashing the keyboard (or turning off the machine) in a panic because they don't know what you're doing, but they are pretty sure they will need to undo it, then IT may be for you. If you can spend two days straight with no sleep, resurecting the companies critical systems following a catastophic hardware failure, only to be told by the CEO in the elevator \"I don't know why we pay you people so much, trained monkeys could do IT work these days!\" and *not* do something permanent to yourself or the afore mentioned CEO, then IT may be for you. If you don't mind spending hours staring at the same piece of text, trying to work out why the computer doesn't like it, only to find there was a missing fullstop or semi-colon and feel relief rather than frustration, then IT may be for you. If you like the idea of making your own tools, because nobody else has tried to build what you're building in the way you want to build it, then IT may be for you. If you like the idea of modeling the way you think through performing a task, in a computer, then IT may be for you. If your thinking is structured and disciplined enough to enable you to model it in a computer, IT may be for you. If you like being treated as an all knowing wizard that can swoop in and save the day with a few clicks of your mouse... You will be sadly disappointed by real IT work. ",

            "answer_text": "Due to information technology having so many different areas and pathways, as Russell Pollard has stated it really depends. There are short courses that can range from a few weeks, to ones that can last 3 to 4 years if you are doing a degree. As some can be a simple testing the waters type course to see if you like the course before doing an in depth study. If you are after an accreditation for the study and past experience, these all play a factor in how long the study takes. Also which country you are in or wanting to study in if it is a degree. Other factors you need to take into account are if you plan to study at a College or University surrounded with other students. Or is it an online course that you would prefer. Then there are distance learning courses that are a combination of studying at home and online. These could have exams attached to time, that you may need to attend an external exam centre, that is close to where you live. ",
