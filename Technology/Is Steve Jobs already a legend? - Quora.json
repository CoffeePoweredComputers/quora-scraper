            "answer_text": "Myth-Making: Say It Often, People Will Believe. According to Jobs, without him, personal computers might not have multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. That's a legend right there.  \"If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.\"http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html ----- Jobs is a legend in the sense that he's a famous, notorious person, definitely.There's a mythical connotation with the word \"legend\" one must keep in mind before applying it to Jobs: The idea that legendary beings/people have amplified, if not supernatural, powers or skills; and that these skills enable the legendary being/person to overcome extreme obstacles or perform awesome acts. For instance, Einstein's legend is usually centered around how was considered a failure at math as a child, but later demonstrated visionary ability in science and math as an adult, eventually revolutionizing the study of physics. Further, this story developed organically over time -- Einstein didn't try to develop the belief that he was a genius, he simply demonstrated that he was. Because of his wealth and influence over the media, Jobs legendary status may very well have been a result of P.R. -- whether through his camp or his direction -- and not solely through oral histories reflecting popular sentiments among disparate groups (like how Johnny Appleseed became a legend). Aggrandizement like this for leaders of successful organizations is not unusual -- as they have \"figurehead\" status and often enable \"cults of personality\". Regardless of whether the legendary status of Jobs was constructed by his team, or developed organically among the people, Jobs is, was, and likely will be a legend for a long time to come.
