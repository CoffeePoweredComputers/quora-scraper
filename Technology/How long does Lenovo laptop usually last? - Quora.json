            "answer_text": "ZDepends on what price point you enter at. If you look after it you should get at least 5 years, but by them you might want it to die. I have an 8 year old Macbook Pro that is still going strong, but it has superb build quality and I treat it properly. I expect to get at least another 5 years out of it even though it has an early i5 and an nVidia GT 330M graphics chip so really can\u2019t perform at a modern level I don\u2019t mind. It is stable and fast enough for the minor workload I give it. It still runs MacOS High Sierra quite well probably because it has the maximum 8gb of RAM installed. The only reason I\u2019m banging on like this is that a well built laptop should last an exceptionally long time. Having said that the cheaper end in any brand is usually pretty crap. In Windows laptops I prefer high end Dells. ",

            "answer_text": "I own a Lenovo ideapad, every single day, no cover, long journeys & frequent travelling and messy lifestyle, I use it rough & tough, sleeping with it & eating on it, using it as a stand, not cleaning it as much\u2026  & it\u2019s been 7 years now! It\u2019s strong & working perfectly fine! Been a coding student, so even experimented a lot with the laptop too, lot of gaming, using non stop, learning on it and risking the life of laptop but it has been all Fine. :) Well, most people might say that ideapad models are made up of weak materials and won\u2019t last long, but I disagree. My laptop is working perfectly fine even in its 7th year and I am sure it will be alright for 2\u20133 years more. & unlike me, if you take care of the laptop, then it will last even longer! No doubt. :-) Lenovo laptops are awesome!  ",
