            "answer_text": "A company that is \"product-driven\" or \"sales-driven\" takes its primary inputs from customer inputs, or, more accurately, the perceived customer inputs as modulated by product management. A company that is \"design-driven\" or \"engineering-driven\" will take its primary input from its engineering staff. There are enormous trade-offs here. A company that ignores its customers may frequently produce products that miss the mark. However, a company that ONLY does what customers request is unlikely to innovate and bring revolutionary products to market. No one requested the iPod, iPhone, or iPad. ",
