To explore. create. invent. And the funny thing is that Brain wasn't even designed to do all the scientific discoveries. It was a tool for survival that we decided to use for something much more than just living. I'd say the most Brilliant invention that we should have in the future is Brains that are actually designed to discover and innovate. A higher level of Intelligence and Consciousness. ",

That would give us fuel to power whatever we needed without depleting resources and yield a way to power a space craft for interstellar travel. Once we have a portable, sustainable power source and can travel to other planets, we\u2019re a lot less vulnerable as a species and don\u2019t need Earth as our main planet. ",
