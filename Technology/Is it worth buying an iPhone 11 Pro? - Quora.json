            "answer_text": "Is the iPhone 11 Pro worth buying? There are a few issues with answering this question. The first issue would be at this point in time there is no such iPhone, but assuming the current rumors are correct and the upcoming iPhone that is expected to be announced by Apple on Sep. 10, 2019 is called the iPhone 11 Pro, then the second issue with assessing worth would be we don\u2019t yet know the price but lets assume for a moment that the price for the new \u201ciPhone 11 Pro\u201d is the same price as the current iPhone XS base 64gb storage configuration which is $999.00 if you buy the iPhone and pay for the phone outright and walk out the door or you can pay $41.99 a month for the next 2 years if you finance it through Apple. Here is my third issue with assessing worth which is \u201cworth\u201d is subjective to each individual, I have owned some version of each iPhone since the iPhone 4 up to the current iPhone XS and I have to say it\u2019s hard to really justify for me from a financial perspective and each time I upgrade I can hardly tell a difference in performance of the new iPhone to the previous model. Sure Apple says the CPU outperforms the previous model by 15\u201330%, the camera is 20% better in low light big deal, you will likely not be able to tell a huge difference. Can I see that in my day to day use? Nope, not unless to do a benchmark test which really means very little on the day to day use to me personally. But if I keep emotion out of the equation and strictly look at it from a financial standpoint, if you have an iPhone 6S or newer you will be able to update to IOS 13 which will be released to the public some time in September (this month) which will come with a few new features like \u201cDark Mode\u201d and a few reworked Apple apps like the reminders app, Apple Maps app, etc. If you are using an iPhone 6S or older iPhone and upgrade to the new \u201ciPhone 11 Pro\u201d then you will be able to see a difference in the day to day performance but chances are if you currently have an iPhone newer than a 6S you will see a bump in screen size and less bezels but performance will not be very noticeable. In conclusion, you tell me. Is the \u201ciPhone 11 Pro\u201d worth it? After all it\u2019s your money not mine, you are the one that will be handing out over $1000 with taxes added, not to mention Apple Care Plus that you better get because the new iPhone like the current iPhone is almost all glass, you drop it on a hard surface like tile or concrete and it\u2019s likely broken. So you better put a case and screen protector on it too. ",

            "answer_text": "I say YES! I\u2019ve just traded in my XS, got the 500 dollar allowance for it\u2026and now I\u2019ve gone from love to ABSOLUTE ADDICTION for the iPhone 11 Pro. This is the ULTIMATE iPhone X since it\u2019s had TWO upgrades since the iPhone X came out. Perfection!! Battery is now 3190mAh and lasts all day, the display is GORGEOUS now and twice as brilliant as the XS\u2019s screen and that CAMERA is just amazing. I took my first low light photo the other day with it and the low light sensitivity is amazing. The photo POPPED in low light. The new A13 Bionic processor is SUPER FAST. I will be happy with this phone for a few years! I was going to wait for the iPhone 12 in the fall of 2020 but decided to pull the trigger on this. I am so glad I did; especially since the new iPhone 12 Pro will have a 6.1 inch screen. The 5.8 inch screen of the iPhone 11 Pro is the perfect size for me, not too big, not too small. I\u2019ve held the 6.1 inch screen of the iPhone 11 and it\u2019s too big; going into phablet territory. In addition, the 12 is supposed to be a new design (I love the current design), 5G capable (I\u2019d rather wait past the first model 5G for a few improvements; besides, there won\u2019t be widespread 5G availability for a couple of years I\u2019m sure) and as far as the reinstalled rumored fingerprint reader that will cover the entire screen, after a year plus of face ID, who needs fingerprint?? I don\u2019t miss it whatsoever. Go for the iPhone 11 Pro. The new frosted glass back is another PLUS. It\u2019s beautiful. ZERO fingerprints. And, here\u2019s an update, after months of living with this phone, a couple of times I\u2019ve gone 48 hours between recharges! The battery life is truly amazing. I\u2019m a fairly heavy user too! The 11 Pro also seems to have better connectivity. I don\u2019t have much trouble keeping connected to my WiFi from my back room now whereas the XS was always losing signal. I recently convinced an iPhone owning friend of mine to go for the iPhone 11 Pro from his iPhone X and not wait another year. He did it and is loving it. This could be another reason to go for the 11 Pro and not wait. Rumors have it that in 2021, the iPhone 13 Pro (or whatever it\u2019ll be called) could lose ALL ports, meaning you\u2019d have to charge wirelessly AND you would HAVE to have a bluetooth headphone, meaning if you already own expensive 3.5mm jack type earphones, they\u2019d be rendered USELESS even having a dongle (which would also be useless). I have a few very high end Westone and Shure earbud type headphones and wouldn\u2019t be able to plug them in to my iPhone 13 Pro phone!? Also, all of your expensive lightning connector cables would be useless. I\u2019m not liking what I\u2019m hearing. Go for the iPhone 11 Pro now! ",
