            "answer_text": "When I was a reporter years ago, I had some understanding of the FMCG industry. Different from most people\u2019s ideas: Sales of most items have significant seasonality. Even the things we eat every day, such as meat, are affected by the seasons and the weather (think of whether you will have a BBQ on a hot summer day?). However, there are kinds of goods that I know are unaffected by the season: Oral hygiene products, such as toothpaste and mouthwash;Female care products;Battery.Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Very interesting question. And I am going to answer your question. There are a lot of products that don\u2019t have a seasonality and have steady sales across the year. Firstly think about a Laptop or Desktop computer. It doesn\u2019t have season. Whenever you need it, you have to buy. Secondly, think about a mobile. Whenever you need it, you have to buy. Thirdly, think about television. For watching movies, dramas, and different tv programs televisions are very important. So, you will have to buy it whenever you need. And finally, you need cloths to wear. It doesn\u2019t need season. You can buy t-shirts, pants, etc when you are bored with old dresses. So, you will like to have new cloths. And many more products I couldn\u2019t mention here. ",
