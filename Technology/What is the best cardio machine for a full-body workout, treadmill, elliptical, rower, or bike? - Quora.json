            "answer_text": "Dear Corey Devereaux: Thank you for the question. I will try to answer. None of these exercises are full body training comparable to weightlifting. I prefer the sports of Powerlifting and Oly lifting. I like the Treadmill to warm up before weightlifting. I may also use the Elliptical as assistant warm-up exercise. I can use a Rower for warm-up too. A bike? I enjoy it outdoors but useful to build conditioning using a stationary bike as an assistant conditioning tool to weightlifting. I prefer weightlifting for full-body training (not a work-out). The best cardio machine does not exist for me. My best cardio conditioning is the barbell complexes. If done right, you simultaneously building connective tissue and improving heart and lungs. If I were to choose form your list, I would take the bike and then when I am finished and bored; I would park the bike and engage in deadlifts, squats, snatches and clean and jerk. Any exercise or training routine and physical activity that you can handle with control and programming mixed with a proper diet and recovery is a plus. Note that excessive cardio conditioning combined with poor nutrition/recovery may lead to some muscle loss and then it may lead to injuries. Mix it up with strength training for the best result. I hope I gave you some clues. Mansour\u2019s disclaimer: Don't do anything stupid and get hurt lifting big weights after reading some of my answers. This would make us both quite unhappy. Consult a Medical Doctor, a Strength Training coach and common-sense specialist before doing anything you may read in some of my answers. ",

            "answer_text": " Rowing wins by a long shot! Rowing, like the other machines you mentioned is leg dominant, but the upper body and core engagement surpasses that of using a treadmill or elliptical by a mile. Because rowing is a very specific technique that begins with a leg drive, then a core movement then a row, I highly stress learning the proper form from someone who knows how to row. When you get the sequence wrong (which most people who have not been properly taught do), you risk hurting your back. You\u2019ll know if after you row hard and your back aches. That should not happen. You also risk not getting all the benefits. The leg leg drive should be a hard power move like a deadlift or leg press. The core should be straight and taught. And the row should be the finishing movement. Then the slide to the \u201ccatch\u201d which is where the movement starts, should be slow. Most people just roll back and forth with no clear understanding of \u201cratio\u201d. But once you learn this, you will be smoked!! Your legs with burn, your back muscles will develop and you\u2019ll burn more calories than any other cardio machine per minute. Again, getting the max benefits without injury comes down to leaning the specific technique and not just guessing how to do it. ",
