            "answer_text": "Pigeon \u201cmilk\u201d or crop milk, is produced in the crop of the bird and fed to chicks (squabs) by the parents until they are 10 days old. It serves a similar function to the squabs as human milk does for infants, and is stimulated by the same hormone (prolactin); but is completely different, more solid and like cottage cheese. Attempts to reproduce this substance artificially fail and result in the deaths or illness of the squabs. It\u2019s composed of 60% protein, 36% fat, 4 % carbohydrates, and minerals and antibodies. It comes from the fat cells (and not sweat glands, which birds don\u2019t have) in the lining of the crop. Wikipedia ",
