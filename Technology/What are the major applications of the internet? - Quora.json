            "answer_text": "The internet has been very beneficial to our society. I will point out the top 5 major applications of the internet. The internet pretty much covered up everything from thrift shops, tvs, maps, video games, and calculators. Communication: Our world has been shrinking since the dawn of the internet in the 1990\u2019s. The presence of the internet has accelerated that shrinkage and has brought our world closer. Nowadays, people can go online and communicate with a person from the other side of the planet as if that person was his/her next door neighbor.Education: The internet makes our electronic devices our own pocket-sized encyclopedia/dictionary. If we do not know an answer to the question, we have the knowledge to almost everything right in our pockets.News: We can stay updated with the news easier and faster. The latest political events happening right now is right at our finger tips\u2014one tap away! Casting an online vote and submitting a ballot is easier than waiting in line in person for hours to have your thoughts heard.Online streaming and entertainment: The entertainment industry has strongly benefited from the internet with more people who are able to access their contents. People are able to hear the newest songs/albums, live concerts of celebrities, and new memes instantly. Besides being able to watch videos created by other people, millions of people from different houses can watch a single person\u2019s live gameplay on Youtube. Others can openly volunteer to beta test games that are in progress before a final version of that video game is released.Online shopping: We can buy almost anything from a store that is away from our houses by a continent. The con is, as we get more technically advanced with retailing and other stuff that requires us to enter our information, the dangers grow much more prominent. Beware of phishing, catfishing, and other malicious acts.Hopefully, this answer helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Do you know who is James Park? Okay, let me give you a hint: He was named in 2015 among Fortune magazine's 40 Under 40, an annual ranking of the most influential young people in business and has a net worth of $660 million estimated by Forbes. He is the co-founder and CEO of a company whose product you've surely heard before or even used. FITBIT That is IoT. \u201cInternet of Things\u201d. The idea of IoT is to have a \u201cthing\u201d such as a band in case of a FitBit, sending out or/and receiving sensor information from a system or a system of interconnected devices via the internet. Apple Watches is a similar example. Look at the ridiculous amount of money they make on watches alone year after year! Recently, I watched a Shark Tank episode of two entrepreneurs that had come up with a system of sensors that would monitor the baby while her parents were away and give them updates on their smartphones. The idea preys on the innate parental need to be informed about their baby at all times. Connected Health is another big big example of IoT. You've also heard about homes that are controlled by a simple app or device. If you need the curtains down, you can speak into the device \u201cCurtains down\u201d and the curtains will be down. Same for lights and fans and AC\u2019s and TV\u2019s. Of course, all these devices need to be connected to the internet (common WiFi) and programmed accordingly which is the definition of IoT, really. A very recent application of IoT is the \u201cSmart Car\u201d. Where you can lock/unlock the door with your smartphone and even turn on/off your ignition. Basically, your smartphone is your car key! Google, Microsoft, and Apple have all announced connected car platforms! Supply chains have been getting smarter for some years already. Solutions for tracking goods while they are on the road, or getting suppliers to exchange inventory information have been on the market for years and with the boom of e-commerce several years ago, it is only a matter of time before IoT solutions are used to push Supply Chains to be even smarter. Another big application of IoT is in industrial and manufacturing spaces, called \u201cIndustrial IoT\u201d. This technology is an amalgamation of different technologies like machine learning, big data, sensor data, M2M communication, and automation. Even small manufacturing companies use this technology, albeit, in a limited way. I know of factory owners that do not have to go to their factories anymore. They can stay back home and get updates about everything that is going on in their smartphone or desktop PC! Like the statuses of manufacturing belts and how much product they are producing or have already produced or are estimated to produce given a particular day. They can also monitor the workers using cameras installed in the factories that give their live feed straight to their PC! Since factories are usually located away from places one might live, you can imagine how this changes lives. One of the last applications I want to speak about is \u201cSmart Farming\u201d. I personally know so many friends and acquaintances of mine who are working on making this happen as I type this sentence. Smart Farming could be a game changer but is an often overlooked business-case for the internet of Things because it does not really fit into the well-known categories such as health, mobility, or industrial. However, due to the remoteness of farming operations and the large number of livestock that could be monitored the Internet of Things could revolutionize the way farmers work. Smart farming will become the important application field in the predominantly agricultural-product exporting countries. These are some of the big, upcoming application areas of IoT that I know of. But IoT is vastly diversifiable in addition to being expandable. You can connect a home, or an entire city. There is really no limit. ",
