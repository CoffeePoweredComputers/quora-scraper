            "answer_text": "Depending on the regulation specific to countries, the credit card issuer has to be financial institutions or an independent private company. To issue branded credit cards like MasterCard/ Visa etc a\u013al of their compliance requirements like memebership application, capital requirements, AML compliance etc has to be complied. As a new startup, need to have sound business case with all the financial projections and cash flow analysis for at least 5 years. As the credit card markets are predominant by big banks , need to have solid target market, marketing strategies, promotion plans, rewards and loyalty etc. Now you need to decide on technology. There is two options.1. Own and manage entire technogy including CMS system, switch, network integration (Master/ Visa etc), data center, hardwares etc. Setting up entirely own infrastructure in quite complex and time taking initiatives. This can be very expensive and capex intensive as well for new startups. 2. Select processing company on cloud services and pay as per your business. 3. Once system implemented, certifications done and credit cards launched, need to manage efficiently operations including billings, collections, customer services, call centers, clearing, settlememts, reconciliations, chargeback and disputes, marketing, promotions etc. Depending on the approvals and certifications, projection implementation, it may typically require 6-12 months to launch credit card in any market.  Like other business, there are fixed and variable cost in running credit card business. Hence credit card business is always volume game. Typically the project cost to lunch 100 k credit card would be around US$ 1  to 3 mio depending on country, infrastructure and resource cost etc. Apart from business expenses funds are required to cover credit exposure and other settlement risk guarantee depending on the rating of company.

            "answer_text": "Broadly speaking, here are 4 critical areas: Marketing - getting your cards in the hands of consumers - typically a combination of brand advertising and direct marketing (mail and Internet these days).Risk Management - Making sure you give each of those consumers the right credit limit and interest rate so that you don't lose your shirt, i.e. managing Credit Risk.Operations - All the servicing, statementing, collecting, etc., of making sure the customer's experience in using your card is good, and that you get paid on time.Finance - Collecting the funding base (either via deposits, or wholesale funding) that allows you to extend the credit your customers are looking for.Obviously, there's a whole lot more, but those are probably 4 of the most important areas.
