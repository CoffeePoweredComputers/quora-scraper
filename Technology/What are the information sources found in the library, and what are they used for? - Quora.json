            "answer_text": "I could probably write a book on the different information sources libraries contain and their uses. However, here is a brief summary of what types of information most libraries contain. Keep in mind that different types of libraries have different types of information. A public library will have different information sources than a college library. In general, most libraries have the same general types of information. Print sources: This can be popular reading books, reference books, books published by experts, dissertations, newspapers, magazines, government information.Electronic sources: These can include e-books, electronic databases, guides and tutorials, and other web-based sources of information. A library catalog is typically kept online in its own electronic platform.Electronic databases contain multiple types of information sources. They can contain e-books, academic journals, dissertations, conference papers, newspapers, financial reports, etc.Reference librarians: These are people who have obtained professional degrees to help people find information that is credible and relevant to the user\u2019s needs.Miscellaneous: Many public libraries allow users to check out \u201cthings\u201d to meet community needs. Some libraries offer ties the public can check out for job interviews. Libraries that offer these types of items are often found in low-income communities. Some libraries offer cooking supplies for people who are interesting in learning specialty cooking skills such as cake pans, mixers, etc. Some have electronics the public can check out such as laptops and iPads.Every library is different in the types of information sources they contain because every library community is different and has different needs.
