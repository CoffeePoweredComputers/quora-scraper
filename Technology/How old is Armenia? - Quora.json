            "answer_text": "A question like this will unfortunately attract numerous divergent and biased answers. To answer it in the most honest and unbiased way, the information sought by the question needs to be clarified. Either the question is asking how old is Armenia as the name of a country or it is asking how old is civilization on the territory of the country of Armenia. A lot of answers here will jump to the second interpretation, as that allows claims to be made of all sorts of civilizations on a certain territory. This is a common practice in many countries unfortunately. I will answer the first interpretation as it refers to an \u201cArmenia\u201d with that exact name and identity. The oldest reference to an Armenia in the historical record is the Behistun Inscription in Iran. Created around 522 BC, it describes the achievements and conquests of Darius the Great. A section is devoted to Darius putting down various revolts in \u201cArmenia.\u201d The inscription is in 3 languages. In the languages of Old Persian and Elamaite, a form of Armenia is used, while in the Babylonian version the name \u201cUrashtu\u201d is used. This indicates that at that time, \u201cArmenia\u201d and \u201cUrartu\u201d (the ancient civilization that predated the Armenians) were used somewhat interchangeably, or at least in Babylonian and other Semitic sources, \u201cArmenia\u201d was an unfamiliar name where as Urartu/Urashtu was known. Using the date of the inscription as our starting point, we can say from the historical record that Armenia is at least 2540 years old. Before this date, we have no record of an \u201cArmenia\u201d and Urartu \u2014 which had a language and identity different than the Armenians \u2014 was the state on the territory of historic Armenia.

            "answer_text": " New findings show civilisation existed in Armenia 8000 BC. 8th millennium B.C. settlement discovered in Armenia. YEREVAN, JANUARY 12, ARMENPRESS. Archaeologists have made a new discovery near the village of Lernagog in Armenia\u2019s Armavir province. An area dating back to the 8th-7th millenniums B.C. has been discovered in Lernagog 1 site. Pavel Avetisyan, director of the Archaeology and Ethnography Institute presented the details of the 2017 works during a press conference. \u201cFor the first time we have recorded a stationary settlement in this region, the lower layers of which date back to the 8th-7th millennia B.C\u201d, he said, adding that this is one of the brilliant results of 2017 research works\u201d, Avetisyan said. Research showed that people living in that settlement had certain architecture skills \u2013 traces of clay buildings have been found. Doctor Makoto Arimura of Japan\u2019s Tokai University has been in Armenia before also. \u201cThe Middle East, Caucasus are the key part of the Neolithic culture. There are many monuments from that period in Syria, Iraq and Turkey, but we have little information on the Caucasus. Monuments before this dated back to the 6th millennium B.C., we didn\u2019t have information about earlier times. These studies showed that there is a settlement dating back to earlier times in Armenia, where people lives and created. It was a surprise for me that architecture was discovered. This was the first time to have discovered architecture in Caucasus from that period\u201d, he said. Pavel Avetisyan said excavation works will continue in 2018. From Armenian encyclopaedia: 9000BC Armenian Nation start forming from Hayasa and Armen-Soupria land called Armenian mountains where Urartu kingdom established. ",
