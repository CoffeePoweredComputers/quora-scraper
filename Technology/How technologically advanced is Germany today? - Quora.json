            "answer_text": "Having lived in just 2 countries: India and Germany, I suppose I could be eligible for this too. I\u2019d say, Germany is technologically advanced, but you won\u2019t see this directly on the streets. There are many small things that you\u2019ll notice once you come here and live. The advancement lies in the big companies and their R&D department, also their product ranging for different sectors. I\u2019ll try to put as many as I can, which is noticeable on daily basis. Traffic System: The roads and the discipline you\u2019d see is far better than even some EU countries. Special machines and traffic controlling systems (also speed cameras) are integrated to have a steady flow of traffic with optimal road network. Source: Creating Intelligent Traffic Management Systems with Industrial Serial-to-Fiber Converters Bureaucracy: This is most annoying part of this country, as they want everything on paper. You have to fill out forms and different document so that, it\u2019s Alles in Ordnung. Source: Bureaucracy Is a Fact of Organizational Life\u2013But That Doesn\u2019t Have to Stop You Health and accidents: You pay huge amount for health insurance every month but in case of unlikely event, in worst case, they fly you to hospital via Helicopter. You get your diagnosis from German medical devices with good accuracy. There are always steps they follow.

As this would eventually get recycled again, minimizing plastic waste. You recycle paper, plastic and metal waste and use bio waste for agricultural process.

The technology and development is going to amazing for us in the future. Source: PressTV-How future cars look like! Resources: Shutting down nuclear power plant and getting more into non conventional energy is a difficult task, Germany is maintaining this trend to minimize and get rid of the conventional source of energy. Germany produces enough renewable energy in six months to power country's households for a yearI would say, the small attention to details has made this country a better place to live, but it doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t many negative aspects, anything over done is a mess, and it\u2019s true for some things in Germany, also over-engineering. Hope you get it, these are things which can be seen, rest all lies under different aspects and sectors you search for. Edit: This is not technologically advance thing, but the way people drive is commendable. The civic sense and discipline others have for the country is at whole another level. The priority and sense of giving way to the need. The photo below is what we do if there's an ambulance driving to an accident zone on Autobahn.
