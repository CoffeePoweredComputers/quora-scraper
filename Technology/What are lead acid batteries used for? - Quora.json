They remain the technology of choice for automotive SLI (Starting, Lighting and Ignition) applications because they are robust, tolerant to abuse, tried and tested and because of their low cost.\u201d Low internal impedance, high output current on demand Robust, reliable, abusable Indefinite shelf life if stored dry Holds charge over long inactive periods Tolerates continuous trickle charge Major uses are in automotive and traction, stationary engines, submarines, backup storage\u2026.
