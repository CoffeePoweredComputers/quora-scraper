            "answer_text": "A good alternative would be to buy a bluetooth K120. This is definetly the most comfortable keyboard i type on and is very well designed. Since i am a Improper typist(meaning that i don't type properly) keyboards such as Seanix and HP KU give me strain because they are on a slanted surface, which is designed for clerks and people typing 20 wpm. I can type high speeds on it and if you learn touch typing, you might be able to be typing as fast as me ;). ",
