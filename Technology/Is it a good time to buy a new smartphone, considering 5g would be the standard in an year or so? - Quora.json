            "answer_text": "If you need a new phone, whatever you do don\u2019t buy any first generation 5G cellular telephone. Period . Most definitely do not buy any 5G telephone until the system, and systems are built out to support any devices, modems, base station, portable hotspots, Cellular telephone, or anything that has any relationship with cellular technology that even remotely says or has a label affixed to it or displays on its digital display the name 5G. Look at any trade magazine or consumer magazine and the overwhelming consensus is, wait. The first generation of Devices will be buggy, under performing, and overpriced. Besides the 5G standard states in the US for the system to work properly, a sharing of the entire networks, plural, similar to bonded pairs in cable for improvement in internet redundancy and speed, Mu-MIMO with Wi-Fi, massive MIMO, new beam forming antennas, plus a few other goodies all need to be stitched together for an optimal end-user experience. That Is Not Going To Happen any time soon. Unless you live in South Korea or somewhere else where they have deployed 5G in a complete and thorough way, WAIT! Save your money! Please do not spend it on a 5G cellar phone unless you need a Samsung S10, then buy a Samsung S10! Or whatever Samsung phone or phones that you have to have. They make great devices, don\u2019t get me wrong. I like Samsung products. I have two of their SSD\u2019s, there great. But 5G, read and take heed, in the USA, every major cellular phone provider is pulling back on their 5G expenditures on system build out from what I have read lately. AT&T and Verizon are trying to make money and save some cash. T-Mobile and Sprint have had their marriage proposal nix\u2019d by the FCC. Unfortunately. And they needed the money to build a combine system, it\u2019s expensive to build out a cellular system from scratch. We\u2019re talking billions here. Anyway, I\u2019ve gotten a little long-winded here and I hopefully have persuaded you not to buy a new phone or at least not to look for a 5G featuring the phone at least not yet because the system just ain\u2019t there yet. But if you got to have a phone, go for a Samsung that\u2019s got it already if you\u2019re into that brand, I like my LG V35. And my iPhone 7 Plus. One that\u2019s work issued and the other one I bought. Whatever. And I\u2019m not jumping in the 5G at least for a couple of years 2021 at the earliest. If they come out in 2020 I\u2019ll be more than happy to print this out and eat it, prove me wrong. Take Care, Be Well, Stay Blessed Terry EDIT: The FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has changed his mind and decided that 5G is inevitable and costly. So the T-Mobile and Sprint merger has his approval. Now it just has to pass the Department of Justice Anti-Competitive, Monopoly board and get their approval. Good luck there fellas. DoJ is no pushover like FCC was. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it's time to upgrade a phone. As 5g will be standard after 2020 and as of now one doesn't need a 5g phone even if some high end companies are marketing their 5g phones as till 5g actually arrives, our phones (if we now buy any 5g enabled phone) will be old and some new phones with updated hardwares will be there in market. So, at that point it will be benfiical to upgrade to actual 5g phone with latest hardware. So, for now buy any any latest 4g phone and juice it out for 1-2years and then upgrade. ",
