            "answer_text": "First considering what a person mean by a computer, computer is device which would performs some computations(even the most complex of tasks such as designing software, rendering new mathematical or scientific models can be viewed as simple computational steps at the very basic level). So Computers aren\u2019t designed to be intelligent and No Computers are not intelligent by itself, they simply performs computational tasks. What makes a computer system intelligent are the AI deployed softwares present in that computer and that that computer isn\u2019t intelligent, it is that software which is intelligent(Intelligence in computers or any other system or human is defined by as the ability to take action on previously un-encountered conditions on the basis of previous experience without being explicitly told to what to do, or in case of softwares without being hard coded to take any action). So a Computer isn\u2019t intelligent though the software present in it can be. ",

            "answer_text": "A computer is only as intelligent as its creator can make it or fake it. A game developer can create a game of chess and fill it with all the possible win moves. A human plays and loses, even the grandmasters lose, we say the computer is intelligent. Siri or Alexa can't understand even the most basic human sentences, we call it stupid and laugh at it. Here is the catch, even a novice developer with an understanding of chess moves can build a sophisticated chess game that can beat a lot of humans but the brightest minds in the industry haven't been able to build a natural language understanding system which can beat a 4 year old. You decide for yourself, are computer's really intelligent. ",

When I connected four hard drives, none of them are showing for two it shows for three, some times it shows. If it is intelligent, it has to say power is not enough. Many times I get wrong messages and the problem is some thing else. ",
