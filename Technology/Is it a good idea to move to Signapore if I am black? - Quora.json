            "answer_text": "I lived in Singapore for 12 years. Ethnic Chinese are the majority and darker skinned Malay and Indians are not. Singaporeans are a nice people and it is a nice place, but very expensive place to live. However, the government is a socialist dictatorship whereby I could be put in prison for making that statement or kicked out of the country. Singaporeans are also prejudiced against darker skinned people in general, but not likely to discriminate because they like to keep a low profile out of public and government eye. ",
