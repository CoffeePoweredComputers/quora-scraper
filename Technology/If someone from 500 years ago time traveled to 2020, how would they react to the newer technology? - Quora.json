            "answer_text": "I'd guess their reaction would be very similar to yours if,as you're standing outside,you are having a heated discussion with your best friend about the sorry state of tea your loved one keeps bringing home for you when,all of a sudden,you're beamed off the lawn and deposited in the main transporter room of the Enterprise. Your first words could very well be,\u201dWhat the bloody Hell\u2026?\u201d Yeah,that person that lived in antiquity would have a very similar reaction. As Arthur C. Clarke said in the third of his Three Laws: \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" That person from five centuries in the past wouldn't have much of a frame of reference from his own time on which to base things he might see. There were no planes,trains or automobiles as the first fixed-wing glider flight was some 250-odd years into his future. The Chinese had the first black-powder weapons in the 13th century,but weren't imported to the middle-East or Europe until some time later,so those were frightening enough that one could surmise that,upon seeing one of THOSE go off,our intrepid time-traveller might very well have had to change his britches. Imagine his awe upon someone's face popping up on a flat-screen tv in a shop window or a car driving by or the sound of my son's stereo turned to 11 with Korn assaulting his eardrums? The poor fellow would have his own version of \u201cWurt deh FURK?!?\u201d that he'd readily use. ",

            "answer_text": "They would very likely pass out or even die from the shock. Imagine you are in the same situation: 500 years ago, or in the 1500\u2019s we had some major events: The Spain doing colonizationThe horse (as a animal-race) was taken to the AmericasReformation of the Christianity in EuropeThe Finnish language was for the first time written to the Abckiria (Abc-book)And we had some technologies and inventions invented, there were i.ex: The spinning wheel was introduced which revolutionized the textile industryThe letter J is introduced to the English alphabetThe first PORTABLE watch is introducedTheory of Sun being a star and planets spinning around it. Earth was no longer the main-attraction(Late 16-century) the first flush toilet was introduced(Late 16-century) Galileo Galilei invents the thermometerSo\u2026 being born and raised in 16-century and it\u2019s culture and technology, a swift in time to 2017 with smartphones, computers, space programs, AI and nuclear fusion etc. would be.. very very very different and shocking to the poor one experiencing such a grand experience. You can also imagine being throw 500 years ahead, to the 2500\u2019s. You\u2019d see.. well, I do not know\u2026 You\u2019d get to experience the difference in the solar system at the 2500\u2019s when compared to the 2000\u2019s. Also, in the very early of 2500\u2019s, dwarf-planet Pluto does its Second orbit around the sun since it\u2019s first official discovery. ",
