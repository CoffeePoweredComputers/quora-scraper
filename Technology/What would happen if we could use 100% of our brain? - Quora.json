            "answer_text": "If you used 100% of your brain, you may as well be put to sleep. No, I don\u2019t say that because I\u2019m a morbid pessimist, but because you would live a very difficult and stressful life. For the most part, your brain stem regulates your heartbeat and blood pressure, as well as other vitalities. However, if you used 100% of your brain, you would have to constantly and consciously do that on your own. You\u2019d have to regulate your breathing, as well as involuntary muscles such as your eyelids. You may even have to sacrifice some things such as blinking, entirely, in order to make room for more important things in your life. This would cause you to go blind. It would make your life significantly more difficult if you couldn\u2019t function at school or work, if you ever do at all, when you could barley concentrate on anything else other than \u201cBreathe, Beat, Shut, Beat, Breathe\u201d. Frankly, I\u2019m not even sure living that long would be possible. Eventually, you\u2019d need to sleep. Not only that, but you\u2019d need to enter the state of REM to get a sufficient amount. That you would also have to do manually. Once you\u2019ve figured out how to enter REM, you need to paralyze yourself to ensure you don\u2019t act out any movements in your sleep. Speaking of movements, when you sleep, your brain releases a natural hallucinogenic drug. This is what causes dreams, and it is theorized that this drug is also released before you pass away. However, that is not proven and the purpose of this would be unknown. Good luck consciously drugging yourself to sleep with hallucinogenics. Not exactly an ideal time to utter internal processes on top of all that. Don\u2019t even get me started on eating or restroom breaks. Someone would have to constantly be there for you to make sure you\u2019re okay. You\u2019d need help and would most likely fall under the handicap category. There is just too much to look after, and you\u2019d barely have any time to live life to your fullest potential. You\u2019d also be likely to develop depression, if not severe, as that life is far from pretty or practical. You may even become suicidal. With that comes morals and debates, which would be just as controversial as the Death with Dignity Act. Some people would argue that it would be better you go out in peace. Wouldn\u2019t it be better if you could just relax than to constantly force yourself to life? You\u2019re a living life support machine. All you\u2019d do is keep a sack of blood alive. A mutation of nature\u2019s kind. On the other hand, others may argue that at the end of the day, life is precious and while you\u2019d have to constantly maintain your health and keep your body up to date, you may still be able to hear, feel, and smell the savors and aspects of life\u2026or you may not. Perhaps, you\u2019d so busy keeping yourself alive that you don\u2019t have time to process every sound, sense, and smell you come across. All that is done by your brain as well. In this case, you\u2019d have to do all that. Therefore, you may not be experiencing anything. If so, very little of it. Speaking of health, you\u2019d have to regulate you\u2019re immune system. You\u2019d be in charge of your internal \u201carmy\u201d persay. Whenever you experience symptoms of an illness, the symptoms are not due to the illness itself. The symptoms exist because your body is at war. Congratulations, you have contracted the common cold. Not only do you have to worry about you taking your body out by not regulating and maintaining it enough, but now you also have to worry about the illness taking you out as well. Sounds like fun, doesn\u2019t it? Now come the philosophical questions, because this almost creates a paradox. If you have to do EVERYTHING for your body, do you even need a brain? If you regulate your vitalities, you don\u2019t need a brain stem. If you maintain your judgment on top of using it, you most likely don\u2019t need a frontal lobe. If you regulate your balance, do you even need a cerebellum? If you don\u2019t have brain, what is keeping you alive? Yourself. But what\u2019s keeping yourself alive? Your brain? But your brain doesn\u2019t exist. What is keeping YOU, the regulator alive? Your soul? What if spirits don\u2019t exist? What if we\u2019re all damned on this floating piece of rock that we call \u201cEarth\u201d? If you don\u2019t have a brain though, doesn\u2019t that contradict the question? Well, you see, you are the brain. You have gained control, and with that, you fade. You are one with nature, and nature is one with you. ",

            "answer_text": " You are in a way always using 100% and never using it. All of your brain is important but you cannot use it all at once. It is a common misconception that 100% of your brain can be used at the same time. Your body could not handle the functionality of this supercomputer at such levels. Think about the fact that currently your brain is using 20% of all the resources you put into it. That being said, you are not even using only a minute amount at any given time. That means, to use 100% of your brain you might have to expend many times the amount of energy you are using now. And, in terms of sheer calorie consumption, that is almost impossible. But let\u2019s say it were possible from an energy perspective. Then you still have all the input coming in all at once. Since certain parts of your brain are responsible for different things, using 100% of your brain at once would lead to utter chaos! Let\u2019s see what would happen if we were to use 100% of our brain: You would produce every hormone in your body. Making you feel aroused, afraid, angry, sad, happy, good, bad, excited, in love, and all other emotions all at once.You would become aware of everything you smell, hear, see, taste and feel all at once. Think about noticing your clothes 24/7, or how your tongue is moving in your mouth\u2026Your memory would get activated, meaning all past experiences would be shown to you, sort of like when you die your life might flash in front of your eyes non-stop.All your muscles would get activated at the same time and in all directions, causing you to have continuous spasms all over your body.These things may not happen exactly as described, but just getting close to that is enough for you to not being able to make any conscious action at all anymore. You would be trapped by your mind with your body going completely haywire. Your mind is responsible for more than just what you experience and sense. Now, all of that being said, there is still a way to increase the amount of brain activity we have. And the basis of that is: Awareness of your surroundings. I am assuming you want to know how to be like Bradley Cooper during \u201cLimitless\u201d, where he supposedly uses more of his brain. So let\u2019s look at what he did and did not do. During the movie he started paying attention to all the details of everything that was going on around him. Not only that, but he started to take action instead of sitting at the bar getting drunk. He cleaned himself up and he started taking care of himself. Learning more languages, going outside to jog, even writing more and spending more time analyzing. He even cleaned his apartment! All of these things are small details you might think are completely useless, but these are the small ways your brain will push you to doing more when you become aware of what is happening around you. Practice this right now. Look around you and just become aware of where things are: What does your desk look like? What does the book on your shelf say? What do you feel right now? What emotions are going through you? Where do you have tension in your body? Why? Becoming aware of more things allows you to use your brain more for what is actually happening instead of thinking so much about events you cannot control. When you look at how you normally spend your thoughts you will realize that a lot of them are focused on past or future events, or fantasy dreams that do not matter. This is how you spend the brainpower that you can use instead of spending it on the things that Bradley Cooper did. You will not really get to use more of your brain at once, but you will get to spend it how you want it, which gives you the feeling of using up to 100% of your brain! ",

            "answer_text": "As should be evident by now, \u201cusing\u201d 100% of our brain isn\u2019t some hypothetical, all of our brain is already being used. If it wasn\u2019t then it would quickly disappear, since brains strive for efficiency and unused parts would get in the way. All that is between your ears, all of that white and gray matter is being used, just not all at once, that would be a grand mal seizure and you would most likely die after a short while.  These pictures aren\u2019t what you think you are. The areas lit up aren\u2019t the only active areas, the dark parts aren\u2019t \u201cinactive\u201d in any way. These images show you the difference between condition A and condition B. In both condition the whole brain is showing some kind of activity, comparing them will cancel out any activity that it the same and only leave the activity that has changed together with whatever changed between condition A and B. As for regulation of that 100% of the brain, that different. That\u2019s basically saying, what if we could consciously control all the functions and activity in our brain. Which sounds amazing, wonderful, super-powerful, and completely and utterly\u2026..fatal. You don\u2019t want to be aware and in control of all that goes on and you can\u2019t handle being in control of everything. Quick example, we breath automatically but we also evolved the ability to consciously control our breathing. It comes in handy in situation where breathing might be dangerous or not possible, also helps us swim. As humans we are also rather OK with not breathing for a limited time, we have some reserves to keep the body going. Now change that to your heartbeat. You are now in control of your heart, go on give it a try. Heart goes haywire, heart stops, organisms dies. What about more complicated things, vision or hearing? You really want to regulate the entire visual process from photon all the way to a scenery. Decomposing and recomposing your vision into it\u2019s base elements, analyzing those elements via two pathways to extract all the information? You\u2019d be exhausted 1 minute after opening up your eyes. Same goes for hearing, or any of the other senses. What about the circadian rhythm? That\u2019ll kill you too if you mess it up, gotta keep that sine wave going. Fight or flight responses? reflexes? Motor control and planning? Facial recognition? Speech comprehension and production? Our brains do and regulate so much in our bodies, the sheer amount would overwhelm you, and the addition of decision making that comes with conscious regulation would inevitably lead to death, sooner rather than later.

            "answer_text": "Large number of academics, citizen scientists and entrepreneurs are interested in cognitive enhancement and finding methods for cognitive enhancement which are safe, robust and reliable. There are many lines of inquiry in the study of cognitive enhancement including studying the effects of diet, sleep, meditation, education, genetic modifications, exercise, mental training, social interactions, brain-computer interfaces, and pharmacological agents [1]. Many discoveries can already guide our decisions, but we know very little compared to what remains to be known. One thing we do know is that the implicit assumption that we utilize very little (10% is often quoted) of our brain is meaningless and trying to understand cognitive improvements only in terms of increased brain activity is not the correct lens to understand cognitive enhancement.  The question needs an overhaul. For example: 1. It is not clear what using 100% means. 100% of computational capacity? 100% of possible energy consumption?  2. The question implies that we do not use 100% of something undefined. To add to the confusion, it is often incorrectly assumed that usage is around 3% or 10%. 3. It plays a part in propagating the vague notion that using \"more\" of the brain is categorically a good thing. We are in the very early stages in our explorations to understand the types of computations that are carried out in the brain and how these computations are carried out. Also, establishing bounds on different measures of brain activity and connecting them meaningfully to cognitive performance has proven to be non-trivial. Despite the current limitations, we do know enough to displace filler hypotheses such as the 10% brain usage hypothesis and the hypothesis that increased brain activity categorically results in increased cognitive performance.  Early explorations revealed that the human brain consumes approx. 20% of the body's energy budget yet accounts for approx. 2% of body mass [2]. This piece of information becomes a bit more interesting when one considers that task related cerebral metabolic changes are usually small when compared to the rather large total energy consumption [3]. The above pieces of evidence suggest that during non-task states the brain may be active. One might assume that only \"housekeeping\" operations are being carried out but this hypothesis can be challenged. Additionally, one might assume that most of the activity is noise, but this hypothesis can also be challenged. What has been discovered, contrary to intuition, is that brain activity in the absence of any explicit information processing instructions (called non-task activity from here onward) is highly structured both spatially and temporally across the whole brain.  Using fMRI, it was discovered that activity in regions that are assumed to comprise the motor system are highly correlated with each other in the absence of any motor processing task [4]. Since then similar  correlations have been found in other systems such as the visual system, language system, default mode system, dorsal and ventral attention systems, salience system and control system [5]. Furthermore, temporally the non-task BOLD fMRI signal displays a 1/f distribution, similar to the 1/f distributions observed in non-task EEG and MEG recordings [6]. Not only are these patterns of non-task state activity observed in multiple systems at the same time, but qualitatively similar patterns are also observed under conditions of sleep [7] and light anesthesia [8]. Similar structure in non-task activity has also been observed in other species [9]. There is now an increasing body of work that suggests that these non-task BOLD signal correlations are functionally relevant. For example, it has been shown that the non-task BOLD fMRI signal can account for variability in task related BOLD fMRI signal (button pressing task) [10].  Much work remains to understand the neurophysiological basis of the non-task fMRI BOLD signal, but one thing we can say is that the brain at \"rest\" is far from idle, and brain activity during non-task states seems to be critical for information processing. The other idea that using \"more\" of the brain is always desirable can also be challenged. Behavior would point towards efficiency in neural processing being more desirable than increased activity since we know that experts often exert far less cognitive effort than novices. Neural data makes similar suggestions. For example, repeatedly presenting visual stimuli leads to repetition suppression of neural responses [11]. We also have evidence that sparse coding strategies in the brain allow for increase in representational power while reducing metabolic costs [12].

            "answer_text": "If we force to use 100% of our brain, It would look like this:  Seriously, the only situation that I know in which a person can \u201cuse\u201d 100% brain utility (using every neuron connection at the same time) is during seizures. If someone know any other scenario, please tell me in the comments. It comes down to how our brain proccesses information. Our brain doesn\u2019t work like most computer CPUs. Most current generation CPUs have cores that can do almost any task at a fix clock speed, basically every CPU cores is the same. Because of this universal versatility, you can utilize it to 100% CPU time utilization, in which every core is doing everything as fast as it can, to do the set of tasks you give to it. Because the RAM channel bandwidth is very high, you have relatively little problem in task scheduling. For the brain, you can replace \u201ccores\u201d with a \u201cnuclei\u201d which is a cluster of neurons that does a specific task. Our brain processes different kind of task/information in different part of the brain (cores), and there\u2019s so many of them. Even every muscle that controls your fingers has its own \u201cmotor core\u201d (a network of neuron dedicated to control that finger). If a core is not receiving enough information, it will not utilize every neuron on that core. But if it receives more information than it can handle, it will run at 100% utility, and ignore what it can\u2019t process at the time (the data is lost). Now, there's a special bundle of cores, called the prefrontal cortex. That's where you make conscious decisions based on the information coming from other brain area, although this part is physically relatively big compared to other cores, this core is easily overloaded because the task is so complex. Your standard IQ test mostly measures this core's performance. Edit: Some say that this brain region is where your consciousness resides, but it hasn\u2019t been proven to be true or not. It is still an interesting controversial topic (thanks to Kai Voges for the edit). For example, if you\u2019re playing basketball and you have the ball while dribling towards your opponents ring. This is what happens in your brain: Your balance cores are busy determining where your center of mass is, your speed, your orientation, angle of attack while running, accelerations, tracking where your legs are (this information is fetched from \u201cproprioception cores\u201d), knowing the ground textures (fetched from the visual cores), and a bunch of other stuff.Your visual cores are busy tracking the movements of the ball, separating the player from the background, judging distances, recognizing your team mates, knowing where the line is, judging the speed/acceleration of other players, and much more.Your motor cores are busy determining which muscle strands to contract at what time to move a limb, how much power that goes in a movement, etc. This core\u2019s relationship with the proprioception cores is vital.Proprioception cores \u201cremember\u201d where your limbs are so you don\u2019t get trampled by your own legs. (Yes, stumbling for no reason is your proprioception failing to do its job)Your thalamus filters out unnecesary information that will otherwise make your brain utterly ineficient and slow because of overloading (I have experienced it, its not very pleasant, theres a wikipedia page about it: \u201csensory overload\u201d)Your audio cores are not so busy, they are waiting for a command or audio communications from other players. By constantly analyzing every vibration in the air that sounds like a human voice, and half-ass processing other sounds. If it finds a human voice, it will conveniently articulate it back into words for you.Your olfactory (chemical sensor) cores aren\u2019t doing much. There\u2019s not enough relevant information from the environment. It's beneficial to actually do this, since your thalamus and your prefrontal cortex bandwidth are easily overloaded.Your somatosensory cores (skin sensors) are mainly analyzing pressure points all over your body, and relaying this information to the prefrontal cortex and the others.The prefrontal cortex (your consciousness) is very busy doing a lot of analyzing, strategy, predictions, risk managing, decision making, etc. by processing the information from all of the cores above. And then it tells the motor cores what to do.All of the cores above are intricately interconnected, and constantly interchanging information, which results in massively pararel processing.So, because not all information is relevant to the situation, there\u2019re always some cores that have nothing to do, for there is simply not enough useful information to process. But there\u2019s more\u2026 The brain stores information in its structure of neural connections. If you fire a random neuron without a relevant stimulus, it will trigger memories/muscle memories that aren\u2019t even related to the situation. Imagine you fire a neuron that triggers your bladder/urethra muscle memory to pee. Or your muscle memory to play a piano while you\u2019re holding a guitar. Your finger will press the guitar strings like a piano key. Or some random sensation memory, like smelling an apple juice, or something. And then, imagine all\u2026 every muscle memory and mental/sensation memory that you have up until now being triggered. Now you are remembering and doing everything you know how to do. At the same time. Can you guess what would be the result? Yes, a realy bad total seizure\u2026 And no, you will not even be conscious if that happens. So, the reason the brain cannot functionally operate at 100% utility is: not every piece of information is relevant to the situation, and there\u2019s simply not enough useful information to process. (Non-useful information will only cloud your judgment, you don\u2019t want that)There\u2019re always some specialized cores that have nothing to do, because there\u2019s not enough specialized kind of information for it to process.bottlenecks in some part of the brain.and it will make you do and feel everything you know at once. In other word, a very bad seizure.Sensory overload sucksP.S: I\u2019m a new writer here. Please have some mercy, and suggest edits if you can, English is not my first language. ",

The concept that we use less than 100% of our brain has 19th Century origins (Ten percent of the brain myth - Wikipedia), but has become a science(?) fiction trope that is without any actual scientific credibility. It deserves to die, but idiotic books, movies like Lucy, and TV shows like Limitless keep resurrecting it because their writers seem unable to come up with better, original plot devices. Despite appearances, everyone always uses 100% of their brains all the time. No part of your brain is loafing. No spare, residual, unused capacity is built-in. It's too expensive (energetically, evolutionarily, personally) to have unused brain capacity just sitting around, doing nothing. The appearance of fMRI images is especially misleading. The images are produced by heavy statistical data manipulation to emphasize minute differences in activity. The differences are minuscule and dark areas are not \u201cinactive.\u201d Recreating You and Your Universe inside your skull takes a lot of constant processing and energy (http://qr.ae/Rg7gFW; Appraising the brain's energy budget). This is known because we can measure brain metabolic activity. Besides... Neurons do not have \"off\" switches. They never goof off; they're \"on,\" alert, armed and ready for action (potentials). They maintain electrical potential gradients across their membranes that are truly \u201cshocking\u201d (yeah, I know it's just mV, but those membranes are thin). They store up synaptic ammo, they keep their powder dry and their barrels clean and their tasers charged...and all the while they're evaluating myriad inputs and assessing whether they need to pull the trigger, or grow a synaptic bouton here, or a dendritic spine there, or ooze peptides elsewhere, or secrete neurotropic factors somewhere, or neurotrophic factors wherever..... Many people asking and answering these types of questions seem to think that soma and axon action potentials are a profound measure of brain activity. Not true. Dendrites, for instance spike much more often than somas (Dynamics of cortical dendritic membrane potential and spikes in freely behaving rats). In any event, action potentials utilize a minuscule amount of the energy maintained across a neuron's cell membrane and they manifest only one aspect of an extremely active cell. Neuron axons aren't firing most of the time (Neuron firing rates in humans), but even when no spiking occurs, neurons are busy, busy, busy, everyone of them, all the time. For instance, dendrite filopodia writhe, snake-like, as they restlessly make and break synaptic connections*. Besides, sometimes just waiting at attention and being ready is the most important job of all. Dave Brodbeck explains it thusly, \u201cWhen I teach intro neuroscience I tell students to think of neurons that aren\u2019t firing as being like drawn bows. They aren\u2019t shooting arrows, but it takes a lot of energy to keep a bow drawn.\u201d Addendum: a related meme occurring in many answers to this question is that the result of using 100% of our brains would be a \u201cseizure.\u201d This curious meme is nonsense. It results from a bizarre concept of neuronal \u201cusage\u201d and an unwarranted focus on tetanic excitatory action potentials as the only metric of neuron activity. Neurons do so much more than just fire off action potentials. A lot of what they\u2019re about occurs in dendrites and synapses and then there\u2019s all that cellular activity because they\u2019re very active, living cells. This meme results from unsophisticated concepts of what occurs during seizures. Let me clue you in, folks. It doesn\u2019t involve 100% of brain cells firing. Most people think of tonic-clonic convulsions when they think about the semiology of seizures at all. However, the effect of all neurons firing at once most likely would be a jerk followed by an akinetic seizure (drop attack) and death as inhibitory neurons shut everything down. Be that as it may, answering a credulous question with made-up nonsense is discouraged.

            "answer_text": "Obviously, we use 100% of our neurons, and obviously this is not the number of involved neurons which makes the effectiveness of our different intelligences. The brain of the elephant has 267 billion (86 billion humans); if the counting concerns only the neocortex, the most recent part of the brain, we are still behind the pilot whale: 37 billion compared with 19 to 23 billion in the adult human brain. We should also mention the case of a person in which a systematic scanner discovered a box cranial essentially filled with water (hydrocephalus), lined with a layer of neurons representing 10% of the number usually present in a brain, and living normally in the society with an IQ in the average. If the planet hosts a human rather than elephantine or whaline civilization, it is a matter of organization. Brain organization, and social organization which is a set of rules hosted by this cerebral organization. It is not a specific structure of the nerve centers. The neocortex is certainly larger in humans, but the general organization of the brain is the same, since the lamprey marine to primates through the mouse. The most singular characteristic of man is that his brain continues its maturation several years after birth, while it is intrauterine in other species. Within our own species we know that the effectiveness of the brain is extremely variable. This isn't in dissecting it that we can know whether it belongs to Einstein or a mentally deficient. Everything depends on the quality of the self-organization of neurons, allowing progressive tiering of elementary concepts in sophisticated concepts, a pyramid leading to increasing elevation of consciousness attached to certain areas. Because it is not possible to compare the experienced consciences. Only their contents. One can know solve a mathematical puzzle and not succeeding to tie his shoelace, while another can you repair a car with closed eyes and give you a fanciful bill because he does not know to count. How to improve the self-organization of these neurons, since it is ultimately the true meaning of the question?

            "answer_text": "Let me ask you this: How would the world change if humans could use 100% of a\u2026 chair?  If we could use 100% of that chair, do you think our civilization would ascend to the next level? Would we unlock the chair\u2019s secret potential or something? Some things that probably crossed your mind: What a hell is he even talking about?What 100% of the chair?What does it even mean: is it like\u2026 sitting on a chair in a way when 100% of its surface is in contact with someone\u2019s ass, or what?What does hidden potential even have to do with it?How could someone even measure the use of a chairs in percentage? It\u2019s not gasoline that you can pour in a car and say: \u201cHere, I\u2019ve used all we had, which makes it 100%!\u201dBelieve it or not, but I\u2019m wondering the same things while looking at your question. I have no idea what you mean. I have no idea how could someone use a percentage of a brain. I have no idea what does percentage of the brain has to do with anything: be it the world, potential, or whatever. I have no idea how to measure it in percentage in the first place. But I understand. I mean, there are functions in our body that can be approximated by a percentage. Muscle contractions, for example: when half of muscle fibers are activated, we could say that the person is using 50% of her muscle\u2019s potential. It\u2019s only logical: the more fibers are activated at the same time, the stronger the muscle pulls; if all fibers are activated, then it\u2019s 100%. Muscle strength is a linear property that correlates with the quantity of activated fibers \u2014 hence percentage makes sense. But neither brain nor intelligence work like that. It\u2019s not a muscle, when the harder you flex it, the stronger you think \u2014 doesn\u2019t work like that. If you think it does, then you\u2019ve been misled by low-quality education, unfortunately. It doesn\u2019t function on \u201cthe more \u2014 the better\u201d basis. It\u2019s more like a computer: an intricate structure made from many different parts with different functions that work together in coordinated manner to deliver the result. You might not be using every part of it at any given time, but that\u2019s the whole point. If you magically remove some fibers from a muscle, the muscle becomes weaker. But if you magically remove parts of a brain, then either the brain will stop working completely, or it will lose some of its functionality. Last but not the least, brain is just an organ. It\u2019s a cluster of conductive tissue that allows us processing information in very physical and straightforward manner. There\u2019s no magic or mystery about it \u2014 it works exactly as expected. There\u2019s no more \u201chidden potential\u201d to it than there is to the heart or to the kidney.  P.S. Of course you could eat someone\u2019s brain and claim that you\u2019ve used 100% of available calories. Or perhaps annihilate every atom of someone\u2019s brain with antimatter \u2014 definitely doesn\u2019t get more 100% than this. ",

The trope evolved from misunderstandings and marketing jargon, but we can use this as a teachable moment to discuss interesting ideas.  In some sense \"using more of your brain\" could describe an epileptic seizure, where too many of your neurons activate at once for any useful patterns to happen.  That's educationally convenient because seizures also demonstrate that visually, since having more of your *muscles* activate at high levels simultaneously leaves you physically helpless in a viscerally disturbing way. On the other hand, most of your neurons are never really \"off\": they are tonic, firing at some typical frequency when left alone.  Why?  That could be healthier for them, or it could be computationally convenient since you can turn the dial down as well as up, or it could be critical for making sure your body does essential things whether or not there is outside stimulation etc.  Interesting topic. On the other other hand, it is fascinating that people are ready to believe that evolution gave us wondrous abilities that we rarely or never use.  \"Never\" would be ridiculous, if the ability never comes up there can be no selective pressure encouraging it.  But \"rarely\" is interesting, you can see how hysterical strength or slowing your metabolism while drowning might be incredible advantages when they do come up.  And actually \"never\" can be misleading--our ancestors never played football or drove cars or typed Quora answers yet somehow we evolved the ability to do these things.  So \"releasing untapped human potential\" is real, and we do it by playing video games.  Even the idea of tropes evolving is interesting.  What makes some myths (urban or...suburban?) catch on and spread?  Can thoughts evolve in a way that parallels the much-studied evolution of the organisms that can have thoughts?  A whole field studying \"memes\" was born, blossomed, and has probably started declining, just in my lifetime. Anyway, it can be fun to take even silly ideas as starting points for exploration. ",

Let me clarify you, it's a fact that you certainly uses entire brain over a period of time, but not at once. It's the survival instinct of our body which shuts down the part of the brain which is not related to received stimuli from the external environment to curb down the metabolism rate of the body. So, if one day you get any drug (like CPH4 in the movie Lucy) and your 100 percent brain functions activates at a same period, your brain will require so much blood circulation that will deprive all other organs of the body. It would certainly require so much of energy to run at this phenomenal capacity, that your body require food all the time,and you will feel munchies . Isn't it? So, it would be impossible for your body to handle that brain. That's why, the evolution process of our body reaches to a certain point,we are living today, where you can use use any function of the brain but can't at same time. Now it's time see if it happens(but that could be reality also,may one day) - You can see every action of your life as a holographic event out of many possibilities that could happen on first place. You will calculate the minor perturbarions and their possible result with accuracy. Causal events prediction can help you to see in future. You can act upon situation before it actually happen.You can see both the good and bad in the event at same time. So, you will become less judgemental.Negative emotions vanishes-because every misunderstanding leads to anger,hate, jealousy\u2026.but if you can sense the point of view of another person and you can see the situation as a third person,then you would not be angry on another person.It means you get a level of mind reading.Caution: The article you are going to read can bend your brain As you all know that what we perceive as reality of outside world invokes the neural connections in the brain , but in limited ways. If you can use 100 percent brain , it means any neuron can intact with any neuron at a distinct part of the brain. It means every neuron is free to make random neural connection. So, you eat food with creativity, hammer the nail on the wall with a pleasure of sexuality, read the book loosing yourself to the fantasy world, walking on the road with countless emotions and endless possibilities that could happen, which will change your outlook for the world forever!! You will never feel depression as everything feels amazing\u2026.phenomenal thinking capacity can breaks the preprogrammed notions that you had acquired since childhood\u2026. Any neuron can latch with any other distinct neuron. So, in that case, you would feel the sense of complete knowing. In simple world your subjective world would never be the same. World is not what you perceive from external stimulus, it is what you subjectively perceive from your limited brain capacity. And there are two possible scenarios then, CASE 1-You could be labelled as \u201c Mad\u201d because you are incomprehensible to the normal person\u2026. CASE 2- You could be labelled as \u201cGod\u201d because you are talking about something incomprehensible\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "Ever thought if you could solve that 3-page lengthy problem of that boring maths class in a matter of a second. Or why a computer can multitask so better but we humans, who created it, couldn\u2019t. If you could devise your own time machine had you got enough brains. Ever thought what would happen if you could use 100 of your brain? Well, if all these tasks were done in the blink of an eye then it would turn very comfortable for the human race. Percentage of the brain used by Einstein  Scientists have been researching for decades to vouch for the percentage of brains, we humans are really able to use. The origin of this myth that humans are only able to use 10% of their brain took from some prevalent theories from the 19th century. And since then it has become a hot topic for some of the science fictions without any scientific credibility. This myth took speed with a common belief that percentage of the brain used by the great scientist Albert Einstein was 13% which is just 3% more utilization than the normal human. He did many amazing scientific discoveries and people thought that if we were able to use 100% of our brains than that would bring wonders to this world. 10% brain usages myth The belief that we are only able to use 10% of our brains is half truth and half a lie. The only truth to this 10% myth is that our brain consists of 10% neurons which help us in processing and transmittinginformation while the remaining 90% is made of glial cells which act as a support system for the neurons and provides insulation to them. Do you know how heavy the human head is? Well, it comprises 3% of the total body weight but still, it utilises 20%of the total energy of the body. If it had to work actively for a single problem then it will require so much blood circulation that the other organs would be deprived of it making it impossible for the body to control the brain leading to a survival crisis. The most part of the brain is busy controlling all the different kind of processes in the body. Let us understand this with the help of a simple analogy. Consider your brain as the CPU of the computer and you are busy seeing a video. CPU is not using all its power of process in playing a video, however, in the background, it has to manage many other functions such as running the antivirus programmes, keeping the USB ports functioning or for that matter even rotating the hard drive. Now similarly at the time of you watching a video your brain performs many other functions for the body such as keeping your lungs breathing, maintaining your heartbeat, helping your eyes to see the video or helping your food to digest your food, so scientific studies have concluded that maybe only 10% of your brain would be focusing on seeing that video while the remaining 90% will be busy in performing other basic processes of your body. So the answer to the question that how much of our brains are we able to use is a 100% and the theories that we use only 10% of our brains is just a myth. ",

            "answer_text": "Lucy is not a romanticized pseudoscientific Hollywood Film, but is actually reality. So, is it really pseudoscience that we use 10 percent of the brain? No actually not. I know we use all parts of the brain, but we use specific parts for specific functions. And this is also not entirely true! More specifically, we use certain circuits that work together for specific functions. Yet! We do not use the functions that are not necessary for a specific task. Why should it be? To become tremendously impressive geniuses with endlessly cognitive abilities. What i actually mean, is... Synesthesia. It is not yet completely clear how this phenomenon arises, but Some scientists believe that synesthesia results from \"crossed-wiring\" in the brain. Years ago I saw a documentary about an Autistic Savant named Daniel Tammet with this condition. He sees colors and visuals when he thinks of numbers. He has memorized Pi to more than 22,500 digits, and he speaks 11 languages \u200b\u200b- one of which he learned in a week for a TV special. He can multiply enormous sums in his head in a matter of seconds.  So suppose we had more access to this cross-wiring phenomenon, what would we all be capable of? Physically feeling numbers and letters, connecting auditary memories to bodily sensations, seeing our intuition in visuals, Audio memorizing when seeing numbers. Or even feeling like kissing while on the phone, without doing the physical deed.. Maybe even more impressive things, or maybe nothing spectecular would happen. And perhaps synesthesia is not due to cross-wiring, but the suspicion is strong. But, if science can figure this phenomenon out and confirm the cross-wiring, we may be able to do more with our brain in the future through this phenomenon. Then maybe we can go from 10 percent to 100 percent, and become like Lucy!  ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s kind of a ridiculous question, because your brain cells are always doing something. Most of it is trivial stuff like regulating bodily functions, generating neurotransmitters, coordinating muscles, and interpreting your senses. Other stuff is higher-level but mundane, like forming memories, discarding irrelevant sensory information, observing your mental and bodily state, and converting thoughts to and from language. It\u2019s more interesting to consider individual cases of \u201cmaxing out\u201d a function. Here are some common ones. You are aware of 100% of your senses. You simultaneously feel every touch on your entire body, get an unfiltered visual field, and are attentive to every sound, smell, and taste. You can feel every point your clothing touches your skin and every breeze on every hair. You can taste your own bad breath and the plaque on your teeth. Humming electrical wires and distant cars constantly interrupt you. Since you\u2019re getting an unfiltered visual field, you can no longer recognize people or track moving objects; because your brain no longer reorients your view, everything flips upside-down. Bright colors are almost painful, and looking around causes a disorienting visual smear. Your inner ear constantly tells you that you\u2019re off-balance. It\u2019s impossible to tell what\u2019s going on. You could be hit by a car while distracted by the feeling of air going into your nose. You can\u2019t walk because of the huge amount of information produced as your body shifts. You\u2019re probably experiencing something similar to severe autism, with even the tiniest touch or smell totally consuming your thoughts. Your brain needs to discard most of what you sense because most of the information is irrelevant or distracting. You can access 100% of your memories. With a thought, you can access every experience relating to it. You can immediately summon every memory of any object and replay your life in chronological order. Except you can\u2019t. You think about that time you tried coffee for the first time, and all you can recall is that it hurt. You remember your best friend\u2019s face perfectly, but his body is an amorphous blob, and there\u2019s no way he had acne when he was five. Reminiscing about college is physically painful because every memory is overlaid with oppressive, unceasing stress. You try to re-read a book and nearly all the pages are blank. On top of this, you find that your memory has gaps. Entire months are simply gone, with nothing at all. Your own wedding is a cloud of disjointed facts. Most of the memories are damaged, hastily redrawn with obvious inconsistencies. Earlier memories are more corruption than fact. Worst of all, every time you check back on a memory, it warps and decays, moving further from the truth. The issue is that you don\u2019t memorize very much. Your brain memorizes some important or interesting details, and when you recall it, your brain backfills the rest with general details that are probably correct. Most events don\u2019t get memorized at all - you keep them in memory for a short period, but they\u2019re never archived for long-term recall. On top of this, recalling a memory destroys it, and your brain does a poor job of rewriting it afterwards. You have 100% control over your attention and behavior. You declare a plan and your body springs into action, working ceaselessly until the job is done. Every distraction is banished, and your entire thought process and working memory are devoted to the task at hand. You sequence your to-do list and completely empty the easy items in a couple of days. You launch into your work project, making massive progress until you abruptly faint because you forgot to eat for the last 18 hours. So you start adding regular checks to eat and sleep, and you mix some workouts in there. It\u2019s trivial to stay healthy, because you have infinite willpower to eat and exercise. You tear through your work, devoting eight hours a day to uninterrupted focus with your full mental resources. Simple tasks are done almost as quickly as you can type, and you rarely forget things and never get lazy. Except you start making mistakes. There are factors you didn\u2019t consider, but by the time you realize, you\u2019ve already sunk another eight hours into it. You repeat bad habits because you didn\u2019t take a gut-check. You plunge into dead-ends, deciding that your work was wasted as soon as you finish. You make strategic and political missteps, failing to factor them into your plans before you execute them. You start taking planning more seriously, and realize that there\u2019s never enough information to be fully confident. You\u2019ve wasted weeks and your confidence is broken. You adopt a lockstep strategy of making a short plan, executing it, evaluating it, and repeating. Now, your performance is consistent and well-informed, but your raw output is slower than before. You struggle to explain that you spent an hour researching and two hours working to determine the probability of a longer-term plan succeeding. Even though your work is of exceptional quality, you fall behind your coworkers on all of your boss\u2019 metrics. When you discuss this with your boss, he fears that you\u2019re after his job. You use 100% of your brain for sentient thought. You gain the ability to reassign any neuron to work towards your self-awareness and thoughts. The ability is supernatural, since you can even reassign memory-forming white matter into action-taking gray matter. You immediately realize that if you accidentally overwrite your autonomous nervous system, you\u2019ll die. You\u2019ll have only seconds to learn how to pump your heart before you asphyxiate, minutes to determine how to breathe, and days to control your endocrine system before hormonal problems destroy your organs. After some experimentation, you realize that this power causes significant trade-offs. Converting memories into mind destroys them, so if you grow smarter, you become more ignorant. You could overwrite some language or sensory processing, but you don\u2019t know what point it will cause brain damage. Worst of all, you\u2019ll soon be able to make yourself happy on demand. The constant struggle between bliss and reality tears you apart. You\u2019re always aware of the fact that you\u2019re less than you could be, but if you became fully sentient, it would mean trapping yourself in a dying body with no senses or memories. Basically, evolution has done a pretty decent job at optimizing the average person\u2019s brain. There is some tuning to do, but on the whole, you\u2019re already using 100% of your brain in a pretty practical configuration. ",

A 100% usage of your brain constantly would mean every single Neuron was constantly firing, not only would you not even be conscious at that point (decision making and perception would be completely gone), your entire body would be convulsing and breathing, and heart beat would stop (as those circuits in the brain stem would not longer be functioning). You could speculate that you\u2019d be remembering everything that you\u2019ve remembered, not a guarantee because we don\u2019t exactly now how memories work, we believe it works on Neurons that fired in that moment get refired thus invoking how you felt and what happened in that moment, that would explain why you can get literal emotional pain from memories, but this likely wouldn\u2019t happen because the Neurons are all firing, not distinguishing how you felt and what happened in that moment, imagine you had this complex puzzle picture, throwing every single puzzle piece at a desk wouldn\u2019t make that picture come out. But even if somehow memories were invoked, you wouldn\u2019t recognize the memories or even process what\u2019s happening in them.

Your visual cortex would be reading that all these inputs are coming in, you\u2019d see something that\u2019s beyond your comprehension, you\u2019d see all sorts of colors, figures, etc. it\u2019d likely be somewhat psychedelic as it\u2019d be reading all these false inputs.

            "answer_text": "As previous answers put it, the fact that we only use some % of our brain's capacity is indeed a myth. I would like to add though that it seems that our brain capacity is much more than what we use it for, and that is true. Our brains are proven to be plastic and can change. So for example if you used a large part of the brain to enforce bad habits and negative emotions, that part can be re-wired so you could use it for positive habits and cultivating other useful skills. It now \"seems\" that you're using more of your brain, because you were probably only counting the positive, the good behaviors, not the negative ones. It is dangerous because our brain can easily learn a negative behavior just as easily as it can learn a positive one, but that doesn't mean our brain isn't used at full capacity. Take a drug lord for example, he may have a brain that is teeming with activity, because he is using it to build his network, stay away from law enforcers, figure out who's to be punished and stay ahead of the game by conquering territory with as little expense as possible. That seems like a lot of things his brain should do, and do them well, otherwise he'll end up dead or in prison. But no one is recognizing the fact that he's using his brain to its full potential. Even a couch potato can use his brain to full potential, while he is lying there, not thinking about anything else, his brain absorbs the information he's seeing on TV unconsciously, so he can develop a high skill of recognizing characters, discerning complicated plots, analysing visual scenes, etc. Of course, he will lack skills in any other domain of life, but his brain is used up by the kind of lifestyle he is living. It is therefore not a question of simply how much of the brain we use, but how much of the brain can we use for positive things. That is a question that I think remains open and because each person's learning ability and motivation is different, will not have a general answer. ",

Consciously in a self aware state of mind? No, that\u2019s literally impossible. But a huge chunk of the brain IS reserved for conscious self-aware daily activities. Your brain, fuck, YOUR LITERAL ENTIRE BODY, is constantly in the \u201con\u201d position literally every second of every minute of every hour of every day of every week of every month of every year in your entire life up to the point until you die, assuming you don\u2019t have any disabilies or paralysis, and ignoring the given dead skin cells and other cells on your body constantly being shed every moment. But let\u2019s focus on the brain, since that is what you asked. Your brain is ALWAYS 100% active 100% of the time. Sure, some regions may be LESS active during certain times of the day, such as when you sleep, but it is still 100% active 100% of your time alive on earth nonetheless. Whether you\u2019re passively breathing, reading a boring textbook, or fully engaged in an engrossing video game, all parts of your brain will always be active till the moment you die, and it doesn\u2019t take a medical genius to know that. In fact, it\u2019s common sense if you ever finished high school with any decent grades. If you are thinking to yourself that \u201cif humans could \u2018consciously\u2019 use 100% of their brains, they would gain literal superpowers and be able to fly and levitate things with their mind! \u201c, then you are DEAD wrong (pun INTENDED! XDD) ! such comic book phenomena literally never did, and literally never will exist, because they break the laws of physics. Those phenomena literally cannot exist. The real queestion is: what are you trying to acheive, when asking this question? Are you hoping that any of us can give you a comical, slightly feasible and believable scientific answer, that it may give you hope of becoming a modern day superhero? You don\u2019t need to be a supergenius to succeed in life (although admittedly it is a MASSIVE perk which makes learning things SUPER EASY). If that was your hope, then sorry my friend, you will never find that pot of gold over the rainbow. I guess, to answer your question, if we COULD \u201cuse\u201d 100% of our brain, nothing would happen. You literally wouldn\u2019t feel any different, your brain wouldn\u2019t magically swell into the size of a soccer ball, and you wouldn\u2019t become an evil genius madman like stewie griffin xDDD. At most, you would be much more intelligent, be way more efficient in the way you do things, and be overall happier in life. I hope that answer sufficed. :3 ",

            "answer_text": "There are many angles of approaching this one depending on your interpretation of the background context for the question. One point I didn\u2019t see mentioned in the long list of very good previous answers is: We primarily learn by example, even when it comes to learning how to use our own brain. Consider feral children for example, or the fact that a person who is born blind will never walk on two legs unless taught to do so. Many animals with all the same parts in their brains (or fewer) are able to perceive things and communicate in ways that we humans are generally ignorant to. There are a lot of documented proofs of things like significantly superior intelligence, telekinesis, psychic abilities, astral projection, premonition, self-healing beyond the ability of modern medicine, ext\u2026 In most cases we don\u2019t need to use these abilities to survive and so they remain undeveloped and \u201cforgotten.\u201d Also, from birth, our parents and peers have not shown us how its done or that it is even possible; if any thing we are taught that it is not. (Note: people who do develop and utilize uncommon or above average mental abilities often suffer from brain related ailments like seizure, migraine, dementia\u2026) It would be absolutely morally unacceptable and impossible to conduct a sterile experiment with all unknown variables removed (though I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been tried), but, theoretically: If a child were raised from test tube conception, and somehow remained isolated for life from contact of any kind with other living beings (from whose bad habit of going through life brain-dead could be learned), then was somehow taught from the beginning (maybe by use of computer generated virtual reality) that all these sorts of things were not only possible but normal: the subject would very likely develop a much greater brain utilization as well as so called \u201cimpossible\u201d abilities. That is, if it didn\u2019t die from loneliness first. ",

            "answer_text": "I am an amateur scientist (BS Physics) without official credentials in neuroscience. Yet I spent my entire grammar school through high school years apprenticing in a well-known wet neuroscience lab, so review the literature I reference if you do not believe what I say here. The views expressed here are entirely my own except where I make reference. Let's say that we take 100% brain use seriously. All synapses of all neurons are activated at the same time. On the face of it, an undifferentiated global pulse in the brain has no value at all, informationally similar to no activity at all. So 100% must mean something else. There must be patterns of activity. A pattern means a volume of activity next to a volume of inactivity. A naive view would choose 50%/50% active/inactive as 100% use of the brain. However, this fails horribly. Consider that an image filled with white noise is essentially as useful as no activity at all. Then, what makes activity informationally rich? I propose that one should expect something like a volume diffraction pattern expressing activity identifying sharp boundaries between adjacent fields of undifferentiated inactivity. The ability for these boundaries to migrate as activity surfaces through a field of inactivity seems like a viable starting hypothesis for making best use of neural organs. So, if this hypothesis were reasonable, and we wanted to be able to move an activity surface over 10 times its surface depth as wiggle-room, that would already cut down useful activity to no more than 1/10th of the cells in the brain. But this presupposes that one has a laminated layer-cake of activity as best use. This makes no sense either since there is little informational richness in moving layers up and down relative to each other. So, a more informationally appropriate use would be bubbles of activity where the surface of activity surrounds a volume of inactivity and which bubble is sufficiently distant from other bubbles. Still using the factor of 10 suggested before, and a volume containing bubbles of radius 10 and kept a distance 10 away from nearest neighbors, the unit activity surface is 4*pi*r*r and the volume is 2*4*pi*r*r*r/3 for a active/total population ratio of 1/60th of the cells in the brain. So, for any more than 1 out of every 60 cells to be active would support this second approximation of informationally useful activity. But this, also, is inappropriate because a box full of same size bubbles is still informationally poor. This is where we come back to the idea of \"3D diffraction patterns\". The original holograms had a peculiar zebra-stripe appearance where shining a reference laser at an angle caused a 3D image of a scene to be visible. These holograms were 2D diffraction patterns capable of storing 3D information. My third hypothesis is that 3D diffraction patterns supported by neural organs are capable of reproducing 3D images with acceptable time-transitions. Such a scheme would require the wiggle-room to be larger in places, such that the likely population of active neurons could be cut possible by an order of magnitude. So, now we are down to 1 in every 600-1000 brain cells active at any given time. My guess is that more \"intelligent\" people are the ones capable of performing more transforms on these activity surfaces to achieve a more varied outcome while less \"intelligent\" people use a more limited set of transforms. But this is rank speculation with no foundation in existing literature. I am conducting experiments to collect anecdotal evidence that the hypothesis is plausible. The experiments involve rote training to install alternative dissimilar reflex pathways for people presented with situations in which their prior reflexes were monotonous. Sherrington, who won the Nobel Prize for his work in neuroscience proposed that there is no single neuron unaffected by every other neuron in the nervous system. All activity is as a contributing member of a community and all neurons contribute. Since all cells are autonomous cells, they perform normal cellular functions as well as providing signals to distant cells when necessary and sufficient conditions are met. The notion of using only 10% is difficult to understand. \"They also serve who only stand and wait\" (Churchill). The vast majority (perhaps 97% or more) of axons are fully insulated without nodes of Ranvier (no access to external ions needed for Hodgkin&Huxley membrane pulse propagation) and therefore not carriers of membrane pulses. To see how the ubiquitous \"unmyelinated\" axons are insulated, review the image in Grays Anatomy 35th British Edition, W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, 1973, pg 782. To justify the 97%, see \"Functional properties of regenerated optic axons terminating in the primary olfactory cortex\", Scalia, Brain Research, 685 (1995) 187-197 (speculation: Lissauer's tract in the spinal cord is vanishingly small yet may contain more axons than the entire rest of the spinal cord). The reason investigators prefer experiments on myelinated axons is that they are larger and easier to investigate; which means only 3% of axons generate the \"pulses\" used for the modern practice of brain mapping. Measuring gross signals in the smaller axons is published in the Gasser and Erlanger 1944 Nobel lectures. Measuring them individually is published in \"What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain\", Lettvin, Proceedings of the IRE, November 1959, pg 1940-1951. From what I have been able to interpret, a lot of the activity of the brain is the attempt to inhibit activity (bulbo-reticular inhibitory system). The inhibitory system is extraordinarily powerful with much global general inhibition preventing excitations and more focal inhibitions constraining excitations in more specific ways. Strychnine, apparently, increases activity in the central nervous system. An animal with strychnine poisoning was relieved of seizures by stimulating the bulbo-reticular inhibitory system (private communication with J. Y. Lettvin). All this is purely my own personal interpretation of informational necessities in nervous systems. It may be wholly unsupportable when reviewed by a professional, but then again, it may not. Errors in factual material are my own and I invite clear non-ad-hominem corrections. I welcome feedback and discussion on this material. ",

            "answer_text": " Human brain is one of the most complex things in the world to understand. It control many voluntary and involuntary activities with the help of millions and millions of neurons. Many people believe that we use only 10% of our brain ability. There are assumptions that if we somehow become able to use 100% of brain potential we can solve the mysteries of universe, we will have telekinetic power, we can travel across the time and what not,. There is also a movie exploring the possiblities (Lucy). But, it\u2019s a myth. It turns out though, that we use virtually every part of the brain, and that [most of] the brain is active almost all the time. Brain is just 3% of body weight and use almost 20% of body energy. Evidence would show over a day you use 100 percent of the brain. Thermal scans and MRI has shown 100% activity in brain. Scans has shown that while doing any voulntary or involuntary action different parts of brain function simultaneously. for example - Take the simple act of pouring coffee in the morning: In walking toward the coffeepot, reaching for it, pouring the brew into the mug, even leaving extra room for cream, the occipital and parietal lobes, motor sensory and sensory motor cortices, basal ganglia, cerebellum and frontal lobes all activate. A lightning storm of neuronal activity occurs almost across the entire brain in the time span of a few seconds. This isn't to say that if the brain were damaged that you wouldn't be able to perform daily duties, There are people who have injured their brains or had parts of it removed who still live fairly normal lives, but that is because the brain has a way of compensating and making sure that what's left takes over the activity. Our brain is a complex thing and we still don\u2019t know much about it. We have seen people doing impossbile stuffs. Like kids learning calculus at age of 12, people memorizing the whole deck of card, people holding their breath for 15 minutes and what not. It\u2019s all about training the brain, it is scientificaly proven that anyone can do these things by training the brain and constantly pushing the limits. Its not about how much percent brain can we use its about how much can we train it. Thank you References: Do People Only Use 10 Percent of Their Brains?

            "answer_text": "While plenty of answers have addressed the 10% of your brain myth (see also What happen if human use 100% of its brain?, Is it true that humans only use 10% of their brain?, etc.) I believe you phrased your question carefully enough that it's worth addressing the deeper issue people are touching on when they ask these questions. There is a sense people have that they aren't reaching their full potential. Whether it is laziness or constantly facing limitations in what we can do versus what we can imagine, we cling to this belief that there is some secret way to unleash the untapped capacity of our mind. Pretty much everyone I know - from workaholic professors to rich entrepreneurs - feels like they don't perform to their peak capacity. That should tell you that the notion of underusing our (brain) potential is primarily a matter of perception and not reality. Indeed, as we begin to better understand the science of learning and memory, we now understand that sleep (Sleep and learning), leisure (More time for leisure increases employee productivity), play (Let the Children Play, It's Good for Them!) and day dreaming (Resting state fMRI) are all important components of cognitive development and cognitive performance. That is, while you think you may be wasting your potential by vegging out, letting you mind wander or even sleeping a few extra hours, you probably are not. In fact, if you weren't doing this stuff, you could very well be functioning more poorly. We still don't know the optimal balance of all these cognitive processes, but it's likely that we aren't too far off. Having said that there are certainly ways to improve your productivity and to work smarter and not harder. There are proven ways of improving learning and memory and getting better at problem solving. Similarly, there are clear ways in which you can waste potential by not treating your body and mind well (What are the most stimulating activities for your brain?) What would happen if we put all of these methods, knowledge and techniques to maximal use? What history has shown us is that there is apparently no upper bound to humans' potential. Human technology, language and accomplishment are not genetically endowed phenotypes. Rather, they are self-reinforcing cultural scaffolding, allowing us to attain ever higher goals.  For example, imagine if you told Aristotle that in 2000 years, every (educated) 12 year old would be doing mathematics far more complicated than he could comprehend. He would probably surmise that humans' brain capacity had somehow increased or evolved, though that certainly hasn't happened at all. Or consider the Flynn effect, the constantly rising IQ observed in the Western World. The time span where we've observed this is way too short for any biological explanation. Instead, it's all cultural, the way one generation of humanity builds on the next. So, in terms of what our full capacity is, it's better to think of human intelligence and brain function not on a scale, from 0-100, but rather bounded only at the origin, from 0 to infinity. That is, more like the height of a building or population of earth.* There is no 100%. Our capacity for art, knowledge and creativity is forever increasing, generation after generation.   * - I realize that in  both cases there actually are practical upper bounds to these things, but the supposed upper bounds keep being passed (Thomas Robert Malthus) and any true upper bound is so far away from where we currently are so as to be immaterial.

He also gave evidences for this: 1. If we used only 10% of our brains we'd have evolved with brains with much smaller in size as the brain is the most costly organ in terms of nutrients and oxygen. So if we had small brains it would have been more beneficial as our bodies would have to provide for a much smaller brain. ( 20% of the body's energy is used by brain). Hence, 10% theory have both survival and evolutionary disadvantage.2.  Now, if 90% of brain area is unused then any brain damage should not have any effect on the body but that doesn't happen.Even slight damage to small areas of the brain can have profound effects.3. Brain scans have shown that no matter what one is doing, all brain areas are always active.4.Decades of research have gone into mapping functions onto areas of the brain, and no function-less areas have been found.5. PET scan and MRI scans have revealed that our brain is active even when we are sleeping.6.Brain cells that are not used have a tendency to degenerate. Hence if 90 percent of the brain were inactive, autopsy of normal adult brains would reveal large-scale degeneration. But why this myth continues is somehow, somewhere, someone started this myth and the popular media keep on repaeating this myth and then everyone believes the statement regardless of the evidence. So for the question that what will happen one used their 100% of the brain: it will be normal, and if a person is not able to use their 100% of the brain, it can be a sign of brain damage and can be fatal.

            "answer_text": "What could a person using 100% of their brain do? Fly? Infiltrate computers systems? Uncover the deep truths of the universe? No, they could seize, and that\u2019s about it. A person with a 100% activated brain would shake uncontrollably and become unable to maintain consciousness. This is a recurrent question on the internet because, from a surface level perspective, it seems weird that the brain is normally not being \u201cfully utilized.\u201d However, the idea that more activation equals more brain power is ultimately a misunderstanding of how biological and information processing systems work. One thing to keep in mind is that the brain synapses are actually firing at all different locations of the brain at every second. No spot ceases activity unless there is severe damage. Neuroimaging techniques (such as MRI, PET, etc.) do not give this impression because they generate a picture based on different criteria stemming from complex statistical methods. The colored areas in a picture represent, depending on the method, blood-oxygen levels, radioactive sugar concentration, and many other things\u2014none of them being simple \u201cactivation.\u201d But, in general, blank areas on a computer-generated image are not inert in real life. Moreover, the brain is heavily specialized: each different part of it serves some specific functions. This means that it simply would not make sense for the brain to fire rapidly all over when no situation would ever require all of its functions at once. For example, if you focus your attention on a motor-task (e.g. playing videogames), the areas of your brain that specialize in this function (in this case, the motor cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia) will become more excited than the rest. Diverting your brain\u2019s precious resources to your social cognition areas would simply be a waste when you are trying to make those difficult jumps in the new Mario game. I think it helps to think about this problem by comparing the brain to a computer. Your computer stores files with binary codes\u2014sequences of 1s and 0s. If you considered the 1 state as \u201cactivation\u201d, this would lead you to consider more 1s as \u201cmore activation\u201d, and thus more 1s would be better\u2026 right? Wrong. If you altered all the 0s in your computer\u2019s code to 1s, it would simply crash and be ruined beyond repair. Both the 1s and the 0s are required for information to be stored, for the programs to work, and for your computer to function. Likewise, pure excitation in the brain is absolute chaos. The organ creates order by carefully balancing activation and inhibition. Hope this helps. ",

We may have the ability to interpret more impulses once we teach our brain to take action, therefore increasing our ability to collectively integrate more thoughts, invoking reason, and finalizing the full total ends in a faster plus more correct manner.  It is proved that Steve Hawking is using 100% of the brian. You can find details information Go Here    Evidently we use different parts of our brain to process different alerts. Your innate a reaction to things such as getting burned up is processed in a single area. Memory are stored in another certain area. Likewise, vision is also computed by another portion of your brain. However, some social people have the ability to understand things faster than others, a lot of people have considerably faster reactions (like certain CS:GO players I understand), just as a lot of people are more creative or intuitive than others. We've math geeks, computer wizards, programming geniuses, scientists, artists, etc. Most of them have a certain center and greater handling power because of their respective areas.  The idea is thought by me to the is based on the accelerate, the accuracy, and the depth of the control of impulses from each certain section of the brain.      The frontal lobe manages recognizing future results caused by current actions, choosing between good and bad activities, suppressing and overriding undesirable cultural replies, and deciding similarities and distinctions between things or events.  Now, for example, when you read a booklet and do not understand a expression, often you miss it. You may listen to it several times in videos then. There could come a period when you ask someone what this means, or you hear or browse the definition for this somewhere. You then start realizing it a lot more commonly, in places where it might have been but you were unaware of its occurrence always.  Practice makes perfect  With enough research and practice you might find the same skills (so long as you don't possess a physical impediment), and could some day exceed his level. The key to the, obviously, is perseverance and being available to try new things.
