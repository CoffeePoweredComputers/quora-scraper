            "answer_text": "3D can be pretty good.  I have done a lot of virtual reality research in the past.  The problem is that 3D TV's rely on staticly rendered images (for movies) and do not update with the position of your head.  Even slight movements can give away the incorrectness of the image.  Some people experience sickness because of the conflict it produces in the brain, but for the most part 3D in movies is toned down a lot.  You can really appreciate the effect if you have a computer and a working product, like NVidia's 3D vision, where you can adjust the 3D effect (separation between R/L images). In short, the tech is young, and the costs are still high (artificially).  Wait 1-2 years, and the costs will lower dramatically.  Hopefully more companies will begin to account for parallax effects as well (which solve the head moving problem) for realtime applications. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not for everyone, but in my experience the best example of effective 3D technology is in the gaming arena. The PlayStation 3 with 3D games is a revelation and adds a whole new dimension (no pun intended) to the experience. Watching a movie or TV in 3D is a little less impressive, and for some people it is downright irritating/nauseating! Most 3D movies (not all!) use it as a gimmick which does not add any true value for the viewer - but hopefully this will improve over time. From a cost perspective, as mentioned in another question, the good 3D TVs are currently also the best 2D HDTVs - so if you're looking to buy a quality HDTV, you're invariably getting the 3D technology free anyway. So yes, it is cost effective! ",
