            "answer_text": "Of all the massive (and largely unnoticed) disasters of Tim Cook\u2019s tenure as chief executive of Apple, the one that would have most appalled Steve Jobs, I think, is the Apple Music app. Music (in the form of the iPod and iTunes) is what made Apple relevant again, and Jobs, as everyone knows, was almost as passionate about great music as he was about making great products. So it would come as an absolute horror to Jobs that Apple\u2019s music app, since the launch of Apple Music, has been a repulsive, preposterously unintuitive mess. He would take one look at it and want to kill everyone involved in its creation. It\u2019s the absolute antithesis of everything that he believed in, as far as software design is concerned. I suspect he would do something along the lines of what I would do (and what Apple\u2019s designers no doubt considered doing when they were developing the app). Split the app into two \u201csides.\u201d On one side, My Music, and on the other, Apple Music. You switch between the two sides by tapping a button in the top-left corner of the screen. When you switch sides, everything on the screen, except the Now Playing bar, changes. The tabs on the bottom of the screen pertain exclusively to the side of the app that you\u2019re on (so when you\u2019re in My Music, the tabs are \u201cSongs,\u201d \u201cArtists,\u201d \u201cAlbums,\u201d etc., and when you\u2019re in Apple Music, the tabs all have to do with discovering new music). This would make the app so fucking simple and elegant. Also, he would make everything far more aesthetically pleasing. Album art would be much more prominent. And the fonts wouldn\u2019t look like the fonts on a website from 1996. ",

            "answer_text": "I think Apple Music launched poorly. The introduction at WWDC was awkward and the app was such a mess that they completely re-designed it within a year. In terms of Steve Jobs\u2019 attitude to streaming music in general, that\u2019s hard to say. He\u2019s on the record as being against it, but he\u2019s on the record as being against a lot of things Apple ended up doing while he was CEO. In fact, one of my favourite quotes of his is \u201cIf the market tells us we\u2019re making the wrong decisions, we listen to the market. We\u2019re just people trying to run this company.\u201d ",
