            "answer_text": "Preparation, preparation, preparation Giving a excellent presentation is all about the preparation that goes into it, and this theme applies to every single aspect you include in your presentation. Think audience When preparing presentation, there is one thing you should always keep in the back of your mind: the audience. The sole purpose of a presentation is to communicate whatever you have to say to an audience. Communicate A presentation is never a one way communication, despite the fact that you are the only one speaking. Communication is always two ways. Although you do not want your audience interrupting your speech, make it engaging: look at the audience, speak to the whole audience. Your audience wants to be spoken to. Ask rhetorical questions, use short pauses when you are, for example, changing the subject or moving on to another topic. Rhetorical questions will often raise the audience awareness as do pauses. Prepare the little things There is truth in the old saying \u201cIt\u2019s the little things that count\u201d. Often when we are preparing a presentation we prepare the content, the slides, the general story line, but it is often the little things that catch us off guard. Structure your presentation The purpose and content needs to be carefully considered. How much detail can you cover in the allotted time? Going back to a point made earlier, what does your audience already know about your topic. Practice, practice, practice Practice and time your presentation. Practice delivering you speech out loud. Record your presentation using the record tool available in PowerPoint. Practice delivering you presentation to an audience, for example, your peers. If you don\u2019t have an audience, practice in front of a mirror. ",
