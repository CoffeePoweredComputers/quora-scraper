            "answer_text": "There is a bunch of thought surrounding this, but a prominent line of thinking, and the one I frankly agree with, is that US data infrastructure providers didn\u2019t see a reason to develop 5G quickly for the longest time. No matter how you look at it, setting up 5G infrastructure manufacturing would harm their profits for the short term. As a result, they felt motivated to wait with going all in on 5G development, and to not develop it as quickly as they could. Instead, they wanted to slow the development pace, minimizing the profit loss by stretching it over time. From a corporate standpoint, this makes a ton of sense, but also comes with a key catch. This strategy is great, and arguably is the most profitable option, so long as there are no companies willing to develop the tech fast enough to not only have it ready to deploy before you do, but to also have it available for less money then your equipment. Given the cost associated with such a development schedule, it was deemed extremely unlikely that anyone would attempt such rapid development. In this case, Huawei did exactly the opposite of what was expected ( it\u2019s widely believed this development pace was at least in part encouraged by the Chinese government as well). At the expense of slower profit earnings in the short term, Huawei now has 5G available not only before anyone else, but for less money then anyone else. The US is behind because they let themselves be behind. ",

            "answer_text": "I am somewhat confused by the question?The US does NOT \"control\" the emergence of new technology and the biggest 5G players are actually European (Ericsson & Nokia) NOT American.So the US has no hand in allowing any global company making technological progress.And it is also very questionable to suggest that Huawei has a \"huge lead\" in 5G technology when compared to European vendors.Huawei's market advantage is often their cheap pricing and vendor finance options - which are backed by CCP controlled banks and subsidized by the Chinese Government in breach of WTO regulations.What the US can and is doing, is banning the deployment of technology from certain vendors based upon very valid national security concerns.It just isn't prudent to let companies funded and controlled by the CCP to have potential monitoring and control of critical national infrastructure in ANY Western country - communications, utilities (power, water & gas), sea and air ports and supply chain.
