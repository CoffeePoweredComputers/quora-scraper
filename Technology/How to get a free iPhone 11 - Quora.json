            "answer_text": "HOW TO GET A FREE IPHONE \u2014 NO SCAMS LEGIT!! (I\u2019m actually not kidding) It\u2019s quite simple and easy. Buy a phone at the Apple storeReturn the phone 2 weeks laterrepeat steps 1\u20132. You can merge steps 1 and 2 by going to the Apple store and asking for an exchange of a different color phone or something like that. Essentially, your new steps would be:Go to your local Apple store and exchange the phone you bought 2 weeks ago with a new phone (yes the first time you do it you will need to do step 1 and 2 individually)Pros to this method: you can get a free iPhone.You are not limited to only iPhones, you can get anything in the Apple store for free (feel free to just try the newest phone or AirPods to MacBook or all the other cool stuff at the Apple store for only 2 weeks to try the product out)Cons to this method: You need to pay $1,000 upfront (put it on your credit card, will get refunded every 2 weeks so won\u2019t get charged interest)Need to return to Apple store every 2 weeks and exchange iPhone.You need to backup your iCloud every 2 weeks (which you should be doing anyway).You need to re-download everything on your iPhone EVERY 2 weeks.You can occasionally run into technical difficulties (the occasional technical difficulties that happen to the average customer will happen to you more since you go and buy and return stuff more than the average customer.)Every iPhone you return Apple has to sell it as \u201cmanufactured refurbished\u201d. Cost them quite a bit of money.Ok, I know the cons seem so much more than the pros, but what pros are supposed to be there? A free iPhone is a free iPhone after all. DISCLAIMER: Yes, I am sad to say I have tried this myself (not long term though, maybe 2 months). Why am I sharing how to do this? I want upvotes. And people always want to discover how they can get things for free or maybe find loopholes. Here you go, straight to you. You can\u2019t expect it to be too easy, but if your desperate enough here you go. \u201cIsn\u2019t it mean to Apple that you\u2019re sharing this with people?\u201d I don\u2019t believe so. Apple is a fairly smart company and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve come up with this possibility but dismissed it. Also, I think most wouldn\u2019t typically do this only few people will. And if too many people do it, I\u2019m sure apple can easily stop people from doing this. No, it will not make Apple bankrupt. If this post gets enough upvotes, I can tell you 2 way how you can actually make decent money doing this. ",
