            "answer_text": "5G comes in three flavors, the super slow super low powered flavor that the iPhone doesn\u2019t use. The super fast mmWave one that many cellular carriers are advertising on TV and a \u201cmodest improvement\u201d flavor called \u201csub-6Ghz\u201d. All of them only effect the speed of the cellular network. They only do so if you are in a location that actually has the kind of 5G network in question installed and ready for use by your cell provider (and sometimes you need a specific plan to be allowed to use it). Some 5G phones also ship with 5G turned off because they all use much more battery power to run. The iPhone (and maybe others) turns on 5G (where available) if it thinks you need extra speed, and turns it off when it thinks you don\u2019t (you can also manually set it to \u201calways try 5G\u201d, and \u201cnever use 5G\u201d). The mmWave 5G really is fast. It also can\u2019t go through walls very well, and has extremely limited range. Like a few blocks. Think of it as a sort of \u201csuper WiFi\u201d that carriers might set up in a urban downtown, a sports arena, or maybe inside an airport. It is as fast as really good WiFi, maybe even twice that fast. If you download music or a movie the little \u201cdownload circle (or bar)\u201d really will move fast enough that you might wonder why it is there. That is about it. It might make actual web browsing feel slightly faster, but it probably isn\u2019t really noticeable there. It won\u2019t make apps launch faster. It won\u2019t make the graphics sharper. Anything where the phone needs to \u201cthink\u201d won\u2019t get faster. Even network things where the server has to think won\u2019t really get faster. Network things where there is congestion anywhere between the server and you won\u2019t feel faster (if you have a one hour 70 mile commute and the last 5 miles of crap road gets replaced with a nice new multi lane paved highway your commute gets slightly faster, but the first 65 miles still suck up most of the time). The sub-6Ghz 5G is a bit better then LTE. Like nowhere near twice as fast. Maybe 20%? Maybe not. In the real world sometimes slower (although I think that is a teething difficulty t-moble is having, not an inherent weakness of 5G). That download ring? It still takes time, just a little less. If it took four minutes to download a song before it isn\u2019t going to be done in 12 seconds like mmWave, it is going to be 3 minutes or so. Sub-6Ghz can punch through walls and get to places people expect cellular coverage. You can expect sub-6Ghz to be \u201ceverywhere\u201d over time. Nothing wrong with 5G, it just isn\u2019t going to be earth shattering. My next phone will have 5G, but I\u2019m absolutely not buying it because it has 5G. I\u2019m sure 5G will be a nice little extra. Much like people are happy when the phone\u2019s CPU is a little faster, but they tend not to buy it for that (or at least not just that). ",
