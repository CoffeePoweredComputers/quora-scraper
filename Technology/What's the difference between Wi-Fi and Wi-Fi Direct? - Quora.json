            "answer_text": "Well I believe I do not need to answer you on what Wi-Fi is, rather I\u2019ll give you definition about Wi-Fi Direct: It allows two devices to establish a direct Wi-Fi connection without requiring a wireless router. Hence, Wi-Fi Direct is **single radio hop communication**, not multihop wireless communication, unlike wireless ad hoc networks and mobile ad hoc networks. Wi-Fi ad hoc mode, however, supports multi-hop radio communications, with intermediate Wi-Fi nodes as packet relays. So roughly.. WiFi can be used by many devices at the same time connected to the same access point. While WiFi-Direct is just a communication between two devices and that\u2019s it. ",
