            "answer_text": "VCRs require amazingly precise engineering on the heads. They need perfect balance and very fine heads. Mechanically, around the heads and drum you most certainly need to salvage one's from a lightly used deck. I would recommend looking at some used professional decks such as Beta SP or S-VHS, especially those with DT or dynamic tracking. DT makes things more complex but it allows you to apply a voltage that can deflect the heads slightly to compensate for inaccuracies in your home made tape transport. Ultimately, your best start is to look at service manuals for existing decks, again professional decks will have the most comprehensive service manuals. Then take some decks apart to learn how they work, then put one back together and see if you can make it work using the service manual. Once you've learned servicing, you probably have enough knowledge to start making a VCR. Alternatively, if you want a short cut which requires less mechanical engineering? Figure out how to turn a used but working SCSI LTO tape machine into a digital video recorder. A Raspberry Pi is good at encoding video and could somehow be attached to an LTO drive. ",

            "answer_text": "It is kind of intriguing what would be the logical reason for a person in wanting to create a VCR, which is an already old technology.. The best approach I can suggest for you to learn How to create a VCR is to get an old discarded unit and dismantle it.. The same process we called as reversed engineering.. I believe it is a better way of learning the mechanics as well as the electronics sections of a VCR..without wrecking your brain and breaking your bank.. ",
