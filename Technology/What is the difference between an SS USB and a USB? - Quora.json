            "answer_text": "SS USB and USB: SS refers to SuperSpeed, a new transfer rate that can transfer data at up to 5 Gbit/s (625 MB/s), which is 10 times faster than USB 2.0. Impressive.  Any USB device can benefit from faster transfer speeds using the SuperSpeed ports. It has been recommended that manufacturers label SuperSpeed ports as SS and that cable manufacturers use a blue color so you know if Superspeed is supported. USB 3.0 has been upgraded to USB 3.1, and finally 3.2 in 2017. Each version supports SuperSpeed preserving the original speeds while still increasing the speeds even further. If your computer was built after 2017, you probably have USB 3.2 which introduced two new SuperSpeed+ transfer modes over the USB-C connector using two-lane operation, with data rates of 10 and 20 Gbit/s (1250 and 2500 MB/s). So, yeah, it's fast. ",
