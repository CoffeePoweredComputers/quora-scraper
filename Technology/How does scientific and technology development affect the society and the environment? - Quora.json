            "answer_text": "Many of the other answers suggest technological innovation is a double-edged sword in the sense that there\u2019s a gain in productivity yet more problems that come with it. While I wouldn\u2019t dispute this claim completely, it\u2019s wrong to think that we should cease to develop technology to solve our problems. In fact, if we cease to develop technology, the current issues we have will never be solved. Ideally, innovation leads to a technology with more benefits than a previous technology with lesser issues down the line. Take transportation. Not counting walking, we started with horse-riding. Horses can travel faster than a human can, but raising a lot of horses at once isn\u2019t very cost-effective. Moreover, there is pollution from manure and horse fart everywhere. Then, we had cars. They can travel so much faster than horses that we actually measure their power as \u201chorsepower.\u201d (Go figure.) Now, cars do emit some gases, but if you measure how much gases are emitted per mile, it\u2019s no contest. Petrol-powered cars win. Now, we are heading into an electric car age. Now, there is no more gases coming out of the tailpipe. The only issue is where the electricity is coming from, but as we know, there are a lot of zero-emissions, renewable energy sources developed right now. (Think solar, wind, geothermal, etc.) Something else to note, when technology develops, any issues that come up won\u2019t be ignored, contrary to popular belief. Innovation requires engineers to look for any means to improve a technology by any means feasible. However, some engineers may think that some problems, such as zero-emissions or some other kind of regulation, will either hold them back, won\u2019t fit their budgets and timelines, or is simply not feasible. There\u2019s no need for sorrow here since there are many different kinds of engineers each solving their own set of problems, meaning there\u2019s always a team of engineers who are working on any issue you can name. TL;DR, Technology doesn\u2019t bring problems. It brings responsibilities. ",

            "answer_text": "Science and technology are the main drive of the productivity but if they are used for the wrong purpose of economy --- satisfy the ever growing material needs and wants of ever growing population, they are a destructive force for the limited real value on earth and a destructive force for human future. Only when science and technology are used for the correct purpose --- human perpetual survival into endless far future, they are a constructive force. Now the science and technology are used for making money, and regardless the pollution it caused and resources exhausted. How much science and technology are used for preventing pollution and resources overuse? Very little, because that doesn\u2019t make money. Science and technology are the tools for human purpose. It is the human that use them, decide how science and technology affecting the society and environment. ",
