            "answer_text": "Brazilia: the federal capital of Brazil, and the best argument both for and against planned cities. Bras\u00edlia was planned and developed by L\u00facio Costa, Oscar Niemeyer and Joaquim Cardozo in 1956 in a scheme to move the capital from Rio de Janeiro to a more central location. The landscape architect was Roberto Burle Marx. The city's design divides it into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities, such as the Hotel Sector, the Banking Sector, and the Embassy Sector. Bras\u00edlia was chosen as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its modernist architecture and uniquely artistic urban planning. It was named \"City of Design\" by UNESCO in October 2017 and has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then. (Wikipedia)In my limited experience, Brazilia looks like the most beautiful train-wreck in the world. You can tell it was planned \u2014 and planned to be better than an evolved city. It works as well as you would expect as the brainchild of central planners. ",
