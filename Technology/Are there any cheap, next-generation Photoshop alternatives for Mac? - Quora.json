            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start by saying this: Photoshop isn\u2019t getting dethroned anytime soon in the pro user market. It has been the industry standard for a quarter century, and has by far the most complete feature set among all currently available graphics editing programs. It\u2019s also freakin\u2019 expensive, especially for those that don\u2019t make a living off what the software delivers. Despite the strong pushback when Adobe introduced its subscription-only model, the company\u2019s subscriber base has been growing and it is unlikely there will be a return to the one-time purchase option. That does leave the door open for Photoshop wannabees to target the prosumer and consumer market\u2014users who need a capable graphics editing program but not necessarily all the bells and whistles. And that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing today, with the emergence of some strong contenders.  Here are a few that are certainly worth exploring: Pixelmator, US$30 Of the new apps on the block, this is the one that is generating the most buzz. It\u2019s not a Photoshop-killer, but it has some serious all-round capabilities. Layers, masks, paths, blurs, Levels and Curves, various selection tools (including Magic Wand), sharpening tools (including Unsharp), retouching tools (including an excellent Repair tool, much like Photoshop\u2019s Patch tool), distortion tools (including Liquify), non-destructive layer styles\u2026you\u2019ll find them all in Pixelmator. (Check out the complete toolset here). Where it scores over Photoshop is speed, ability to share images via Mail, Message, Facebook and Flickr, quick access to your iPhoto library and tight integration with its iPad app. On the negative side, it is only compatible with OSX 10.9.5 and up, there is no History or Actions, third-party plugins are non-existent, and the lack of single-window mode means there are floating panes all over the place causing needless clutter. Still, for $30, it is a good and cheap alternative for a lot of people. Site: Pixelmator for MacReview worth reading: Jumping Ship from Photoshop to Pixelmator: A Switcher's Guide GIMP, Free If Pixelmator is the polished new kid on the block, GIMP is the shabby veteran whose dated UI hides the full extent of its capabilities. The open-source GIMP has most major features that Photoshop offers and scores over Pixelmator by including a plugin framework and greater control over various effects like blurs. However, those who use GIMP say it feels slower and the results aren\u2019t as good as what can be achieved in Photoshop. The GIMP website is also clunky and hard to navigate, and there appears to be little attempt at featuring how-to videos or tutorials to ease the pain for those hoping to make the leap from Photoshop.  Site: GNU Image Manipulation ProgramReviews worth reading:  Gimp vs. Photoshop and Mac Photoshop Alternatives Compared Photoshop Elements, $100 (on sale for $70 at time of writing) At one time a dumbed-down version of Photoshop, the junior Elements has grown in recent versions to be a serious alternative for those without the cash or inclination to splurge on Big Brother. It has a friendlier interface with both basic and expert modes, and a lot of the features in Photoshop though without the same depth of control. Best of all, it can be purchased outright rather than needing to pay a monthly subscription fee. Site: Adobe Photoshop Elements 13Review worth reading: Photoshop vs Photoshop Elements Lightroom, $149 The most expensive of this bunch. Until last month (April 2015), I wouldn\u2019t even have considered including it here, but Adobe is now offering Lightroom as a standalone download instead of forcing users into a subscription-only model. You may say Lightroom isn\u2019t a Photoshop alternative, but if you\u2019re a photographer, Lightroom is not just an alternative, it is better. The handling of RAW files, the control you have over images straight out of camera, the ability to copy-paste edits to a full set of images, the image tagging and folder management features, uploading images to Flickr, geotagging\u2026all these simply blow Photoshop out of the water. Site: Adobe Photoshop LightroomReview worth reading: Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC Affinity Photo, Free (currently in beta) (NOTE: For the post-release update, please see my in-depth review: Archie D\u2019Cruz's answer to Is the just-launched Affinity Photo a credible alternative to Adobe Photoshop?) Affinity Photo is still in beta, but this one could get very interesting. This Mac-only program is taking on Photoshop with some bold statements from the company. It features a strikingly attractive interface and has tools some of the other low-cost alternatives don\u2019t (History, LAB and CMYK modes, Frequency Separation editing, 64-bit plugin support). If the preview video is any indication, this will be the one Adobe will be watching closest of all.   Site: Affinity PhotoReview worth reading: A New Pro Photoshop Alternative for Mac Users ",

The best cheap alternative one is Pixelstyle Photo Editor Mac. It is an easier-to-use alternative to some expensive and complex apps out there (like Adobe's Photoshop). It's very quick, sports features like layer support and non-destructive filters, curves and levels. This best photo editing software for mac even lets you lay in text over your images, along with multiple drawing tools so you can add shapes and objects to your heart's content, including vector-based objects.  here are some other examples for other apps:Try Super Refocus - Add Focus and Depth to Photos Which Does What You Don\u2019t Need A Camera To Do  or Super PhotoCut is really super to instant remove background from photo within a few seconds.
