            "answer_text": "EXTREMELY important, the recent riot instigated by the George Floyd incident, may or may not be racially motivated. You should look at the poor training and prevalence around the world of choking incidents, that people doesn\u2019t understand the cause and effect of victims saying they can\u2019t breath, then normal people will not understand it and just ignore it. You have to be specifically trained in acting upon such statement, and police must be retained by law not to make choking holds of any kind, as we here in Denmark and rest of the world have had police kill or give massive brain damage to victims being strangled. So the media should try to calm the waters and show objective and neutral evidence that death by choking happens to everybody, not just black people. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that context is literally the most important thing, ALWAYS. Let me give two examples: (1) Imagine God, however you define God. ALL ALONE. Even God, all alone, would be nothing. (Some would argue that this is why creation exists.) What, then, of the rest of us? (2) Notice how you judge the actor in the following scenario, in three different contexts. You see a man stab a person in the throat. What did you see? First approximation: attempted murder. Second approximation: a surgeon, opening a blocked airway. Third approximation: a delusional person, who only THINKS he\u2019s a surgeon \u2026 (For a fun exercise, try to come up with a fourth approximation.) ",
