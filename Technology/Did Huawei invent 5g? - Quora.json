            "answer_text": "No, not at all. Actually they have nothing to do with \u201cinvention of 5G\u201d. 5G was \u201cdefined\u201d by the International Telecom Union, section radio, ITU-R. ITU is being established by international law and under UN mandate. They research the future of telecommunications, and try to give the international development a unified direction. Based on their research of current and future demands they set out to publish a document called IMT-2020 (International Mobile Telephony in the year 2020). They also \u201cown\u201d the label 5G, as they already owned the labels 3G and 4G. IMT-2020 is a service oriented document, not a technical specification. The publication of this document triggers standardization bodies to start working on technical standards that should meet the requirements. The largest such standardization body by a wide margin is 3GPP, the Third Generation Partnership Project (a bit unfortunate name, but 3GPP was founded in the late 90s to work on 3G standardization). It consists of 7 international associations and regional standardization bodies, from America, Europe, and ASIA. Companies, universities, research institutes, and others can join it through the membership in one of these regional bodies. Ericsson and Nokia are under the umbrella of ETSI, the European Telecommunications Study Institute. Huawei and ZTE come in oder the Chinese representation. ETSI has study groups to work on a number of standards. Their 5G work was published in 2019 as 3GPP Release 15, and is being prepared for submission to the ITU-R for 5G acceptance. To make a long story short: all big players have their fair share in the development of 3GPP as a global standard. And everybody among the big three (Ericsson, Nokia and Huawei) are approximately on the same level. Don\u2019t confuse Huawei\u2019s marketing noise with real technical achievement. They show a bit of rookie behavior, if you ask me. You don't win contracts by press releases. That is a lesson they will have to learn. Ericsson and Nokia have both secured large deployment contracts in China. Why is this, I ask you, if the Huawei guys were so far advanced? ",
