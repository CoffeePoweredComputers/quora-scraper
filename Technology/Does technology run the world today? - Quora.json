            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s define what technology means. In simple terms, it refers to any tool or machinery that is used to solve real-world problems. Essentially, it makes our day to day life easier. With this logic, everything that minimises human labour counts. So, even the simplest of devices like your cooking stove, door bell, scissors, etc., make the cut. From the moment you wake up and hit snooze on your alarm clock, take out a milk carton or leftover food for breakfast from the refrigerator, drive the car to work, and fall back into bed with a phone in your hand, you constantly rely on technology. Now think for yourself, if we didn\u2019t have these tools at our disposal, would you be able to get through the day in one piece? Would you have been able to perform all those mundane tasks that you currently do so effortlessly? Unless and until you\u2019re a caveman who plucks fruits from the trees for survival, the answer is no. In the contemporary world, technology is often associated with computerized systems and AI. We immediately think of Alexa and other automated robots that can now eliminate human labour. We are no longer running in the hardware era, but witnessing the dawn of sophisticated software and complex algorithms that have blurred the lines between virtual reality and the real world. What we see, hear, think, like and do is heavily influenced by our exposure to technology. Our very basic need for social interaction and acquiring new ideas is made possible with the help of the internet and telephones. On a global scale, the movement of goods, services, and even data and information across countries is possible due to technology itself. The world is running on technology. So yes, I feel that technology does indeed run the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology runs our lives these days. Smartphones, tablets and computers \u2013 we really can\u2019t seem to function without them. In a very short amount of time, technology has exploded in the market and now, many people cannot imagine a life without it. To understand how we left the dark ages (which really wasn\u2019t all that long ago) to where we are today, it is important to understand how technology evolves and why it matters. PURPOSE DRIVES TECHNOLOGY FORWARD All technologies are born out of purpose. For example, search engines were created to sort through the massive amounts of data online. With each new upgrade technology compounds existing technologies to create something better than what was previously used before. And on and on it goes. With the lightning speed of technological evolution, it is no wonder many people have struggled to keep up. To be fair, the scope of technology\u2019s expanse is so great, wrapping everything up into a single blog post is practically impossible. Here is just a brief glimpse into how rapidly the Internet and technology as a whole have evolved in recent years. ",
