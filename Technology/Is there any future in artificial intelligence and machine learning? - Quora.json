            "answer_text": "The future of AI and ML can be seen in the present itself. Flying Cars: It's official A Japanese company has successfully conducted the test drive of the car, it was the first public demonstration. The car, named SD-03, manned with a pilot, took off and circled the field for about four minutes. So soon might be in a decade we would be able to see flying cars and stuck in Air traffic will be the new Normal \ud83d\ude03.Drone Deliveries: Just a week ago Amazon got approval from the FAA, which allows Amazon to quickly start their drone delivery process. Amazon Air is live now. With this many competitors like Walmart have started testing its drones. So in the future get ready to get your Food delivered by a drone \ud83d\ude0bAutonomous Robots: This is not a new concept to the world but is catching a lot of heat nowadays, as in the current Pandemic robots are helping to maintain Social distancing, serve and even cook your food, to become your friend for a talk, and much more. Robots have already replaced humans by doing Mundane tasks with extreme efficiency and would get better In the future.\ud83e\udd16Nano boats: Nanorobotics is an emerging technology which deals with assembling a nanometer-sized robot that can interact with molecules in our body. The nano-robots would be responsible for interacting with biological cells and also perform some tasks to repair damaged cells and tissues this would be a real game-changer in the healthcare industry, where patients could be treated more efficiently and the root cause of disease it could know at a very early stage. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2695\ufe0f\ud83d\udc8aInterplanetary travel: How can I miss this topic yup this thing will be possible very soon, as SpaceX has planned to make this possible in 2024 in which 100+ people will flow to Mars to Colonize and never return back to Earth. Ya that seems to be scary but exciting as well.I might have missed many possibilities and surely there will be many more such upcoming technologies in the future.

            "answer_text": "Wondering what the scope of AI and Ml is? Here are some high demanding jobs in this field, currently in the industry. 1. Data scientist- Data scientists are primarily involved in the process of collecting data from various sources and touchpoints, analyzing this data and interpreting it for inferences and insights to come up with innovative solutions in the business fields. 2. Machine Learning Engineer: Possessing a salary of over $1000, machine learning engineers are considered as some of the most0high demanding jobs in artificial intelligence. These employees are sought out by the company itself and are recruited as and when required. 3. Research Scientist-The role of a research scientist is inter-disciplinary. He or she would go back and forth between working on artificial intelligence and machine learning-based projects. A research scientist would be involved in deep learning, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, computer perception and more. If you intend to become a research scientist, you need to possess skills in parallel computing, distributed computing, algorithms and computer architecture. You can also expect a median salary of over $80,000. 4. Business Intelligence Developer- A business intelligence developer brings to the table business acumen apart from skills on artificial intelligence and machine learning. He or she is responsible for crunching massive chunks of data for business insights and work on increasing the profits of a company from a myriad of perspectives. From designing and maintaining data for cloud-based platforms to optimizing workflows and processes, business intelligence developers are responsible for carrying company growth on their shoulders.
