            "answer_text": "Realme 6 is about to be available in the market soon. According to a couple of surveys, the present year will have overwhelming sales of smartphones. The companies are predicting that as the price of smartphones is lessening and the features are elevating, more and more people with budget devices will shift to smartphones. If this would be the case, the country is surely going to have huge sales soon. Focusing on the fact, Realme 6 will be a huge success because of a plethora of reasons.  I do feel that owing to the Realme user interface, the device becomes ultra user-friendly. This will be one of the considerable reasons for the people to switch to the device. The elderly, nowadays, use smartphones more and more. It is common knowledge that people in their lean days feel lonely as other members of the family are busy in their lives. Mobile phones come to their rescue and they can spend their time indulging themselves in several activities using their smartphones. And when the devices like Realme 6 are available at Rs. 12,999/-, we can expect the sales to go up in lesser time. Not everyone knows the apt ins and outs of the processor but those who know will be glad to learn that Helio G90T would be at the helm. It will empower the device in more than one way. No matter what we use our phones for still we all know that phones are for making calls before doing anything else. Helio G90T provides the best possible call and live video experience, with faster call setup time noticeably better sound quality. Just not this, the triple-ISP design optimizes power and performance in all photographic modes, while an integrated hardware depth engine provides smooth, real-time bokeh previews for the highest quality Portraits. Plus, with HyperEngine game technology, a user will get quick and continuous action in games seamlessly. Next, so that the processor keeps working in a refines manner, the device has 8 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory. Realme also offers 4 or 6 GB of RAM. On the memory front, the device does not lag. It can have either 64 or 128 GB memory. And for those who need even more space can have a memory card in a dedicated card slot. After all these features, let me tell you about the screen size. Realme 6 has got 6.5 inches full screen. It has a 90.5% screen to body ratio and offers 2400 x 1080 FHD+ resolution. Although this size is suitable for any individual from any age group still the people from elder age groups will find the screen size soothing and supportive. Realme always works with great precision thinking about various circumstances. Why I mentioned this has reasons. The display of the device is secure because of Corning Gorilla Glass. Finally, a 4300 mAh battery that can be charged in approximately an hour is exactly like an icing on the cake. Realme 6 would definitely add a feather in the company's cap. ",

            "answer_text": "For me, it would unquestionably be Realme 6 and I can show you why it is the case. Realme 6 is a great device to consider as it has a large battery, a great processor, exemplary performance, brilliant cameras, and lots of cool inbuilt features. The device available to purchase from online dealers and it is available in two different color variants viz. Comet White and Comet Blue.

It is run by Android 10 and has an inbuilt large storage of 128 GB which is expandable up to 256 GB through external expansion like memory cards. The version we are talking about is the utmost powerful one with other storage options of 4 or 6 GB RAM. If a user goes for 4 GB RAM, one gets 64 GB storage, however, in other case, it would be 128 GB again. Realme 6 comes with a high-quality AI front camera of 16 MP (f2.2) which has some builtin features like Portrait Mode, Timelapse, Panoramic view, AI Beauty, HDR, Face-Recognition, Filter, and Bokeh Effect Control.

The device runs on its spectacular UI alongside the Android 10. For memory expansion, dedicated slot is provided to expand the memory storage up to 256 GB. Realme has another slot for a memory card. This can be used any time when one needs to have more storage. Although Realme 6 has either 64 or 128 GB, still for catering to the needs of people who demand for more storage, the company has provided the needed provision. Realme 6 comes with a quite large 4300 mAh (non-removable) polymer battery and is accompanied by power-saving features which help in reducing excess battery drainage, it ensures you're never out of power and always available on the go.

The display is quite large to be holded in one hand . One thing the company could have added is the LED display rather giving IPS LCD . But the screen temperature and quality remains good. It's 120hz display would make you scroll faster and response will be high. For the price range it's one of the value for money gadget. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely overpriced. I mean, leave Xiaomi and the rest, they are competing with themselves. Let's pick their 2-month-old phone, realme X2. The device had better on-paper chipset (SD730G), better GPU (15% more clocking speed than the one used with SD720G) Better display (Amoled, 60hz refresh rate is better than 90hz IPS any day). The only segment realme 6 pro is better than X2 is the camera. But seriously? The only audience who should buy realme 6 pro are the ones who wants to use the telephoto lens. Nothing else. Seriously nothing else. Realme X2 is still the better phone at the same price. Also, they themselves claimed that they are not gonna hire any ambassador for their company. But then you know. Highly disappointed. ",

Realme 6 for the base variant 4+64 is good and it also has 90hz display. Choose poco x2 over realme 6 pro as it has better specs than realme 6 pro and 1000rs cheaper. One can also wait for the redmi note 9 pro which is going to be launched on 14th march. ",
