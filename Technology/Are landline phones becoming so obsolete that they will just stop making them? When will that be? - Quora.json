            "answer_text": "It is no secret that in the first few decades of this century internet phone services have been making deep inroads into the telecom market. On the one hand you have free services such as Skype (Skype.com) that are very good for social calls. At the business end of the market, you have advanced VoIP services like the Zadarma Project (zadarma.com/en) becoming increasingly popular. When I last checked the figures I noted that about a third of American businesses now use VoIP systems. The cost advantages of VoIP in terms of savings in system set up and maintenance costs, and much cheaper overseas phone calls are the prime attractions for companies that make this move. All signs seem to indicate that this trend is going to continue. It is possible that landline phones will follow the telegraph to eventual extinction but it is not going to be in the near future. Consider, for example, the large firms who invested heavily in landline PBXs and will want to get full value out of their investment before considering changing to VoIP. So although the end of landline phones could be on the cards, it is impossible to know when this is likely to occur. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s highly unlikely that landline telephones will be phased out, at least for the foreseeable future. At home, I have broadband, and apparently I get a call bundle with the landline, but I\u2019ve never used any calls on it, as I just use my mobile. For work, we used to have a landline, but I got rid of the landline, and diverted calls from the landline number, to a mobile phone number, it was easier. Customers could also text us. Businesses will have landlines for the foreseeable future. With homes, I would imagine the next 20 years, a landline phone is going to be rare, almost as rare as hen\u2019s teeth. ",

            "answer_text": "I can see maybe residential landline phones phasing out but that won\u2019t be until cellphone coverage is much better and more reliable. There are still a lot of areas in the United States (and probably other countries) that coverage is either very limited or nonexistent. Also, many businesses will always have some form of landline phones. Call centers (where they like to monitor how many calls are taken/place and how long the person is on the call), restaurants, and any businesses where they\u2019re not reachable by phone 24/7 will most likely keep some form of landline.
