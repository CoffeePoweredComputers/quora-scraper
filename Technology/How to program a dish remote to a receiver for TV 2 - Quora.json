            "answer_text": "I have not come across such remotes that will control 2 TV\u2019s. Those supplied by such as Dish tend to be basic and cheap. The only work sound would be some sort of universal control that can be set up as you require and you may need one that as well as being pre-programmed also has a \u201clearning\u201d function. The other alternative would be a second Dish remote. ",
