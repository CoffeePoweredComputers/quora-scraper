            "answer_text": "The best introductory textbook I\u2019ve come across is \u201cSemiconductor Device Fundamentals\u201d by Robert Pierret. Semiconductor Device Fundamentals: Robert F. Pierret: 9780201543933: Amazon.com: Books This book starts with a very gentle introduction to semiconductor theory, and then goes onto basic devices like p-n junction, bipolar junction transistors (BJT), the ubiquitous Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) and Metal Semiconductor junctions. This book is excellent, and I still refer to it from time-to-time. Once you\u2019ve got the hang of the basics of semiconductors and simple devices, and you want to answer deeper questions- why do these semiconductor crystals have bandgaps? How do LEDs/ laser diodes etc emit light(quantum wells)? How do electrons behave in a material (in bulk and 2D quantum wells) with respect to energy distributions? How are solids formed? To answer these questions, I\u2019d recommend \u201cThe Physics of Semiconductors: With Applications to Optoelectronic Devices\u201d by Kevin Brennan. The Physics of Semiconductors: With Applications to Optoelectronic Devices: Kevin F. Brennan: 9780521596626: Amazon.com: Books This book also deals with III-V semiconductors like Gallium Arsenide and Aluminium Arsenide (and their alloys). When different materials are grown on top of each other to vary the potential, you can do really cool things with them which can\u2019t be done with silicon, such as high performance transistors (HEMTs and HBTs), light emitters like LEDs and laser diodes and photodiodes tuned to a specific wavelength.

            "answer_text": "I wish we had a modern equivalent of \u201cThe Golden Book of XXXX\u201d but we don\u2019t. Some of this is because the subject gets \u201cphysics and math\u201d deep pretty quickly. For example: An Introduction to Semiconductor Physics, Technology, and Industry http://users.ece.gatech.edu/%7Ealan/ECE6451/Lectures/ECE6451L1IntroductionToElectronicMaterials.pdf https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-012-microelectronic-devices-and-circuits-fall-2009/lecture-notes/MIT6_012F09_lec01.pdf These are consider \u201cintroduction level\u201d. :-[ One that got me interested in the subject many years ago is the 1977 special issue of Scientific American - it\u2019s still one of the most approachable intros IMO. I still have my original copy! For a fairly non-technical discussion that isn\u2019t talking about the current reality, it\u2019s good. Scientific American Volume 237, Issue 3 Scientific American September 1977 Scientific American, Vol. 237, No. 3, September 1977: Amazon.com: Books Perhaps I should write a book? ",
