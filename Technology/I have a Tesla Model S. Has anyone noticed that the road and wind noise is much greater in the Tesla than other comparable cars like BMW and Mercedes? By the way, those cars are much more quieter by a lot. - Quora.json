            "answer_text": "German Automobile club ADAC frequently does tests with all new cars, and measuring the noise level insides the cabin at 130 kph (80.8 mph) is a standard procedure. The Tesla Model S was measured with 69 db, which is mediocre for a luxury sedan. Some other cars for comparison: Porsche 911 Carrera Coup\u00e9 S 71.2 db Renault Zoe Intens (Subcompact electric car, 2018 model) 70.1 db Tesla Model 3 LR AWD: 68.7 db BMW i3 (compact electric car) 68.7 db VW Golf 2.0 TDI Turbodiesel: 68 db Tesla Model X 100D: 67.8 db VW e-Golf (electric): 67.5 db Ford Focus EcoBoost 1.5 (three cylinder engine): 67.5 db Toyota Prius Plug in 68.5 db Mercedes S 350 BlueTEC (Turbodiesel, 2013 model): 63.7 db BMW 745e (petrol engine, plugin hybrid, 2020 model): 62 db Audi E-tron 55 quattro (electric car, 2019 model): 63.8 db ADAC points out that all tested Teslas lack a proper sound insulation. They are very silent at low speeds but too noisy for their class at high speed. In the report of the Tesla S, ADAC also mentioned that there are some annoying sounds from the drivetrain which would probably be covered from the sound of an IC engine, but the car does not have one. The BMW 745e was the quietest car I could find. It is 7 db quieter than a Tesla S. That means that it is almost half as loud as a Tesla. ",
