            "answer_text": "Well, that depends. Assuming that he truly still holds popularity (and not just among the people you personally know), this may be out of multiple reasons. For one, much of what the media talks about are Trump\u2019s lies and we cannot argue about the fact that he does lie more often than not. However, some people defend him by saying \u201che doesn\u2019t mean it like that\u201d. And then you have a lot of focus on his antics and given that he loves to make fun of people, he brought this upon himself. But some people regard this as partisan hostility when it is done to him, but just good fun when he does it to others. It may also have to do with his massive ego that is pretty fragile if you ask me. And then it comes to actual policy. let\u2019s take the so-called \u201cMuslim travel ban\u201d. He claimed that it would protect from terrorists, but why did he not list countries where terrorists actually come from, like Saudi Arabia? He knows he can\u2019t do that, so he implements a ban to make some people feel safer without making them safer. Or take the China travel ban. Sure, he prevented Chinese nationals from traveling to the US, but he did not prevent thousands of other travelers to come in from China, so what did this actually achieve? Or look at his EO to protect preexisting conditions. You cannot protect preexisting conditions with an EO because an EO is a directive at the executive. When it comes to things like DACA, an EO can have a significant effect, but it has no legally binding effect on private citizens and corporations. And he knows that which becomes obvious when you read the EO because he claims that he wants to protect preexisting conditions, yet doesn\u2019t actually give any directives to do so. In other words, whether or not someone still supports Trump may be affected by how much this person understands these policies and their effects. But the media does not really report on that, at least not if you don\u2019t read more than just the headlines and short articles, because these topics go beyond the surface and in the end, it\u2019s about ratings. So, many people don\u2019t read beyond that and therefore either defend Trump or blame him without actually knowing what\u2019s going on, depending on their biases. And it\u2019s also that people make very self-serving connections. Trump-supporters do not identify with the Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville or the guy who was looking for a sex trafficking ring in the basement of a pizza parlor without a basement. But they identify everyone who criticizes Trump with Antifa, rioting, and the like. You also have to consider that the Republicans Party has a much more loyal following than the Democratic Party. Democrats are much more likely to abandon the party over certain policies than Republicans. This may have to do with the fact that the Republican message is easier to digest. Cut taxes, corporations and the rich are job-creators, so don\u2019t tax them too much, pro-gun, punish criminals, fetuses are human beings, so stop murdering them, big military, and faith. Democratic policies are much more nuanced and also requires more background information to contradict the Republican message. For example, how many people are familiar with concepts such as marginal propensity to consume or price-elasticity of demand? And when confronted with simple messages such as Lawrence Britt\u2019s 14 characteristics of fascism, then you run into a wall of \u201cliberal elitism\u201d, \u201cliberal propaganda\u201d, and the like and are deemed un-American on the spot. In the end, you may as well ask why beliefs and faith are still a thing. People believe what they want to believe and only a few put in the effort of actually being informed and forming their own opinion. They read an article about a bill rather than the bill itself. They watch a YouTube-video about a policy rather than the policy itself. Many people also lack the background knowledge to do that. And those kind of people are split over him; some love him, some don\u2019t. But some people put in that effort and among them, he is not very popular nor ever was. ",

            "answer_text": "This may sound strange, but when I watch his televised rallies (I cannot watch long, and NEVER until the end) I see a combination of a few characteristics that might draw people to him. I do NOT think he has the ability to be a good leader of a democracy. He is way too much of a braggart, lies constantly in order to say whatever he wants to be true, and is a bully. In my eyes he might be able to function as a dictator, but not here, we want to keep our democracy. He is a bit like a combination of Don Rickles, a comedian, and a Carny Barker, and The Enquirer. He works to get their attention, make them laugh at often cruel sarcasm and actions. He makes people listen to him. For some reason I don\u00b4t understand, people perk up when they start hearing bad, nasty, even cruel events, or dreadful insults, often total lies, about people others admire. His stated wealth is a magnet to a lot of people, who would like to be wealthy. It is a simple as that. There are people who feel honored to be close, in any way, to big money. They can\u00b4t think that there is no advantage to that situation. Not only do they approve of anything he says and does, they would follow any order he gives them, no matter how illegal or cruel. Notice how many imitators are in his wake? And the damage they have inflicted on innocent people? It includes death threats, recently aimed at Michigan\u00b4s excellent governor. If you are rich (that may be questionable in Trump\u00b4s case, considering the legal tax and bank records that are surfacing) and powerful (bullies are also powerful) you can likely get away with ANYTHING you want to do. And if they watch, Trump is doing exactly that. He rudely insults journalists who DARE to politely ask questions he doesn\u00b4t want to answer. Instead he immediately tears off a chain of angry insults, more if it\u015b a female, and totally ignores the question. Remember the tape of his \u00a8grab them by the p***y rant, adding that if you\u00b4re rich you can do anything you want? Another instance is his firing of anyone who disagrees with him. That kind of power often appeals to people, especially the powerless. He lies constantly and follows up with \u00a8I KNOW it\u00b4s TRUE, and so do YOU,\u00a8 which resembles a verbal challenge; I DARE you think I am lying. And, quite naturally, if his followers have become attached to all that, it might be impossible for them to see the lies, or even consider using a fact checker. They also probably listen to Fox Noise, and, if they are real, the Trump stations I hear about but can\u00b4t find. Lastly, there seems to be the magnetic appeal of a cult involved. I have heard this suggested and discussed by some bright commentators, and it makes me wonder. There must be something working between Trump and his followers, so they may be right. Elmer Gantry, played by Burt Lancaster, an old movie, has stuck in my mind because Lancaster played Gantry with a powerful appeal, and it was cult like. That\u00b4s all I got! Peace. VOTE ",
