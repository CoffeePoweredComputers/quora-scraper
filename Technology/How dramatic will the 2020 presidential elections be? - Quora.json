            "answer_text": "In my lifetime which dates back to the late 60\u2019s this is the most important because the Dem\u2019s are seriously trying to change American history into one big huge pile of anti-American greatness. Since, America truly started in 1776 the Dem\u2019s are forcing 244 years of growth into one big pile of sycophantic, hatred of American values, morals and discipline into a socialistic, non inclusive hatred built on Marxist system hate. The average Dem voter in the US today has no idea just how profound the Dem\u2019s hate truly is. To put up a guy (Biden)with serious mental issues and a person who can barely talk proves just how low the Dem\u2019s will go into changing America into a poverty, rioting and hateful nation while they themselves will live with Government gun shooting protection behind BIG WALLS, taking and stealing from the Dem voter his rights, liberty and pursuit of happiness. Forget the Constitution, forget the \u201cDeclaration of Independence\u201d and definitely forget the \u201cBill of Rights\u201d you won\u2019t have any. How the Dem voter deliberately pretends this is not happening or does not care shows just on programmed they really are, or obtuse their minds have become diluted. Not one ounce of difference than any cult the Dem voter would cry out against. The hate, the violence, the riots in all DEM STATES are just a start of what the true Dem\u2019s agenda is if they are allowed to win this election. The whole world is laughing at the Dem Congress, the Dem Governors, Dem politician and their constituents who are turning a blind eye to their goals the very least Monarchy to the worst Anarchy and Marxist rule. So, you ask how dramatic is this election? Well if a Canadian (foreigner) can see the writing as clearly as I do then you a Dem voter better vote for Trump or cease to be a nation and acting exactly the opposite to what a Dem President once said, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, ask WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR COUNTRY\u201d! To think this was said by a President that was of the Democratic Party shows you just how brain dead and abhorrent the Dem\u2019s have become as well as its constituents in America. If you are a Dem voter you better start think about this statement and vote Republican or forget about freedom, liberty and pursuit of happiness the only thing you\u2019ll be able to look forward to is 1000 times worse than anything Trump could ever do to your nation. Your jealously, enviousness and pathetic will to hold the Dem party with any level of credibility shows just how gullible you are or how you don\u2019t care for your Country and shows you ask \u201cWhat can the country do for me?\u201d which is not only selfish but absolutely disingenuous and proving you have no interest in inclusiveness and the well being of keeping America so cogently said by your President, \u201ckeeping America Great\u201d! The Dem\u2019s mission statement: \u201cA vote for insanity, violence, war and racism\u201d The Republican mission statement: \u201c A vote for prosperity for all, great economy, health, infrastructure and true \u201cAmerican Pride\u201d.

            "answer_text": "How dramatic will the 2020 presidential elections be? None unless the there is voter Fraud. I predict the lowest turn out of the democratic party in history. The reason because Biden had become the democratic party\u2019s nomination and clear to me that no one want Biden as their leader, and mysteriously no one want to vote for Biden. Its crazy that the polls have Biden up 9%, and disagree with me as far as the pollsters are concerned. The pollsters say Joe Biden will be president is 2021. This is the big lie and maybe the left have decided to fix the election. Some have did thesis on how the indicators are wrong. There is a pollical model which is most accurate based on the predictive primaries, the model developed by political scientist Helmick Norvick, and gives Trump a 91% chance of winning the election in November. What a beautiful prediction, those are very good odds, but also ask Dr Norvick, about the corona virus, and the economic dip, that has this altered your predictions. His answer was October surprises rarely swing elections. What a beautiful thing to hear. There is an important question here, why does the primary model predict a 91% chance of Trump winning the election? The primary model has a couple of factors that has consistently predicted the failures and loss by a candidate. Question to ask yourself what percent chance of trump winning will the primary model identify. A couple of factors success or failure of a candidate, one factor is the swing of the pendulum or the natural even and flow of political sentiment from Republican to Democrat or Republican to Democrat. The other factor is the popularity of a given candidate during their primary election. So as how well did the Democrat nominee fare against the other Democratic candidates against the other Republican candidates, 100% of the delegates for the Republican nomination delegates. For the Democratic nomination it comes down to enthusiasm, we talk about it discussing politics, but we tend to focus more on undecided voters. (Mr, Reagan) But I think this is a mistake, I think for the most part there are no real undecided voters, there are just some voters who say they're undecided. But in reality in the back of their minds, elections really come down to is how many people on the right are going to go out to vote for their guy, and how many people on the left are going to go out to vote for their guy. It comes down to enthusiasm, if voting day comes along, you got something else that seems a bit more fun, will you sacrifice the fun thing to vote, or will you skip the vote to go to the fun thing in this way enthusiasm. It is critical to elections, obvious by voters are voting for Biden, generally because they hate Trump, but republican voters will crawl over hot coals naked, to get to the voting booths, deeper into this today. One must see exactly how enthusiastic people are to vote for Joe Biden. Are they all focus on the polls, we all perceive the difference in the enthusiasm over President Trump, versus the enthusiasm over most of us that know some friends that are Democrats. For people that are trying to get into politics, we've seen several opportunities for people that are trying to run for office. To step up, but with issues like unemployment, with all sorts of money problems, American people be protests happening, killing on the streets, the defense of the police, all this kind of stuff we have been waiting and looking for a strong person. Who be the voice of the American people, no one has stepped up, especially Joe Biden, he disappears for many of these big huge issues and conversations. This need to be happening specifically with all the stuff that happened, where the hell did Joe Biden go. He just disappeared, like a boy nowhere to be found, who should have been out there doing things, and maybe make the right decisions. My chief concern is that Joe Biden is sort of an absentee candidate which is really interesting to me, because most of the criticisms I hear about Joe Biden is that he's corrupt, or that his mental capacities or people are concerned about these sexual assault allegations. Those tend to be the three things that we hear. For those reasons many democrats will not vote democrat or may sway to vote for President Trump. ",
