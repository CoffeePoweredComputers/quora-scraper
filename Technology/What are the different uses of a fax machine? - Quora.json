            "answer_text": "A fax machine is composed of a modem, printer and scanner. It can scan documents and transmit them to another fax machine, using a telephone line (PSTN, ISDN or VoIP).The fax protocol makes sure that the document is received correctly on the other side, if there are transmission errors, the fax protocol will ask for a re-transmission.After the transfer, the fax protocol will also send a confirmation from the receiving to the transmitting fax machine that the document has been received correctly or not. Because of this confirmation receipt, and the fact that sending and receiving fax machines talk directly to each other, a document transmitted by fax has the same legal value of a registered letter, and it can be used in court cases as evidence.

            "answer_text": "Fax machines allow you to both copy a document and instantly send the copy to someone else. Usually for legal documents you cannot email as attachments. It\u2019s for institutions that for some reason can\u2019t accept electronic transmission is just as trustworthy and can be safely transferred. So outdated imo! ",
