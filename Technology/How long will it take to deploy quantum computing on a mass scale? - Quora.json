            "answer_text": "Quantum supremacy will be a remarkable achievement for science. But it won\u2019t change the world any time soon. The fact is that algorithms that can run on today\u2019s quantum computers aren\u2019t much use. One of the main algorithms, for example, makes the quantum computer churn out random numbers. That\u2019s great for demonstrating quantum supremacy, but for anything else? Forget it. The trouble is that quantum systems are exceptionally fragile. To maintain their quantum behaviour, qubit chips are enclosed in sealed boxes fitted with vacuum pumps to remove stray air molecules, or cooled to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. More qubits means more fridges, more connections and more expense. Worse, these devices are exquisitely sensitive to the smallest disturbances \u2013 even footsteps can send them away. Even when housed in far-flung shelters and accessed through the cloud, it is not clear that a million qubit machine would ever remain stable for long enough to function. And that\u2019s not all. Quantum computers are not standalone devices. They need a supporting cast of conventional computers and other devices to program, operate and monitor them. Added to that is the computational burden of the machines output. A quantum computer with 10 million qubits running at a few gigahertz would spew out more than 10 terabytes of data per second. Today, a single qubit will set you back $10,000 \u2013 and that\u2019s before you consider research and development costs. At that price, a useful universal quantum computer \u2013 hardware alone \u2013 comes in at at least $10bn. This for a machine whose true commercial value is far from guaranteed. To make quantum computers commercially viable, the cost per qubit will have to drop dramatically. But how this will happen, no one knows. ",

            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t know. This area is still in its dippers and the scientists which involve, research and build this philosophy-mathematical structure - the quantum computers - are like well-trained people which have only started going within an unknown dark cave - hoping to discover new treasures - new quantum computational knowledge. I would say by the end of this 21st Century - every person could carry a quantum-computer gadget within his/her pocket or even a ring or a chip embedded within a part of his/her body - with a huge capability of quantum computing - while the quantum layer of this computer gadget will work and talk symbiotically and harmonically with its non-quantum parts of memories - like the human layer of the human brain works kinda symbiotically with the other human\u2019s brain\u2019s two layers - the part of the reptile and the part of the mammal.
