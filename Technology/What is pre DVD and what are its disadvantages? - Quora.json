            "answer_text": "Pre DVD is known as Pre-DVD-Rip and this is not any kind of hardware. These are some common terms when it comes to Pirated movies. There are some stages to Piracy when it comes to every movie. The first version will be a CAM-Rip. This is a camera recording the theatre screen. These may be released before the actual movie release or on movie release date or very shortly after the movie release. There are other more professional CAM-Rips depending on Camera placement and quality which I will not talk about since it is not a part of the question. The next is \u201cPRE-DVD\u201d and this is a version that comes before the actual DVD. This may usually contain the video from a camera recording a cinema theatre but the audio from an actual DVD source. So, you may have bad video buy very clear audio. You will not have the unwanted whistles or other theatrical noises. It may also be a recording of an actual DVD before release in an illegal manner. Next, it will be followed by an actual DVD, then a Blu-Ray Rip. Next will be a full HD Rip (This will usually be done using the movie release on OTT sites like Netflix or Amazon Prime) and then finally will come a 4K Rip. Disadvantages? It is illegal.The quality is going to be poor.You definitely will not enjoy the movie as the producers intended it to be.",

            "answer_text": "I have dealt with VHS, video CD, DVD and Blu-ray. Never heard of anything called \u201cpre DVD\u201d. If by pre DVD, you mean what was before DVD, then there was VHS. In between VCD gained some prominence in a few countries. The disadvantage of VHS and VCD were the same - poor quality video. VHS had at least Dolby Prologic surround sound but VCD had just stereo.
