            "answer_text": "I can only shake my head and wonder, what makes you think technology advancement has slowed down recently? I've answered many questions on Quora about inventors and invention, and the one thing I stress often is that invention and innovation is an evolution of ideas. What people often see as a new idea or invention is simply an improvement of something that came before. This evolution of invention and innovation has not slowed down at all in recent years. There is a constant and steady increase in the number of patents filed since 2000. I realize that the number of patents alone is not a perfect indicator of innovation and invention, but it is one piece of objective information I can offer. The attached link shows Annual U.S. Patent Activity Since 1790: U.S. Patent Activity Being a geek is hard work. Most people find the \"nuts and bolts\" of technology boring, they don't want to hear what I did this week to resolve my technology problems. Unless you're Elon Musk, being a geek isn't always sexy. You don\u2019t hear about modern day inventors because that's not what's hot in the news and information business. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what periods you are talking about 1900\u20131999 and 2000\u20132018 ? You need to scale them or choose similar lengths . Also technologies can be much more subtle and not for individuals. For example the use of FPGAs instead of custom chips this is a real advancement but not well known - there are many such advancements (particularly in defence products ie latest phased array radars). If you do the sums I think we are still accelerating but away from individual product to large scale system product that only governments can afford. There is the future with limiting possibilities that of reduced resources and limits to our ability to understand and create new technological products. The brain does have an organisational limit -ie the ability to build ever more complex models = we can increase its limitation by working in teams but then there are overheads that quickly reduce team sizes so we might expect a future where technologies come at a slower rate = mostly for larger projects needed by governments eg the NHS project was a struggle.
