            "answer_text": " I suppose, if you dropped your phone just-so on the popped out camera, that camera might break. I know for a fact that if you dropped your phone just-so on any glass surface, there\u2019s an excellent chance it\u2019ll chip or shatter. That\u2019s not a good reason to stop making phones with glass screens. It absolutely is an excellent reason to stop covering the rest of the phone with glass, and yet, we have all-glass phones.  OnePlus has a good solution to this: the phone senses a fall, and will retract the camera when it detects a fall. It\u2019s of course possible to that it won\u2019t fully retract before it hits the ground, but it sure couldn\u2019t hurt. Unless you\u2019re trying to shoot selfies while falling, I guess. I think the pop-up camera vulnerability is extremely trivial compared to all of the other smashy bits in a modern smartphone. I also contend that the chance of such a camera breaking is terribly small. One big reason is simple: this is the phone for people who have little-to-no use for a selfie camera.  And seriously, Apple\u2026 that ultra-tiny bit of screen to the left and right of that black hole chasm you call a \u201cnotch\u201d isn\u2019t fooling anyone. You don\u2019t make an all-screen phone. At least when Essential did it, it was just a tiny, arguably tasteful notch. Once your notch is 75% or more of the screen, it\u2019s not a notch anymore.  The last time I took an actual selfie was 2015 or so, and I used an Olympus OM-D E-M5 mark II with a 17mm f/1.8 lens\u2026 not a phone. Late last year, I did make a video conference call. That\u2019s about it. I have very little use for a selfie camera. So if you can hide it away so it leaves me with an unbroken vista of a screen, great! Sign me up! If you\u2019re a selfie-addict, this is probably not the phone for you. As soon as someone makes on without a glass back, with an interchangeable battery, and a microSD or UFS memory card slot, I\u2019m there! ",

            "answer_text": "From what I have seen on several of the pop up type camera smartphones, the mechanism is a very robust item. They are designed for not failing so easily. If you like the feature or not the idea is a choice you would need to make. They are pretty successful and many who have them love them. I mean there is always the chance of a failure but then so is dropping your phone and shattering the screen. Every screen will break if it lands on the perfect spot. They are delicate devices, not Tonka Trucks. ",
