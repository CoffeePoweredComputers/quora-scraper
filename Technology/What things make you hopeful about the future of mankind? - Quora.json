            "answer_text": "The future of evolution is going to be great. We are mor like cave men than fully developed. We\u2019ve made steady progress but our larger brains learn very little compared to their capacity and we still believe in fighting when it never improves our situation. Scientist tell us that our brains get frustrated and depressed too often. Evolution is working to increase our intelligence so out grand children will look at us and worry because we seem so dumb. Our feelings will calm down so we worry or cry about important things but not crash and need psychiatrists as often as we do now. These smarter people will study in schools and study being parents and being great students. Parents will need to really think of how they can help this child, play with them and balance their schedules. Hopefully our DNA will take anger and fighting out of us. It has been doing it since we stopped hunting our food but seems confused about the effort we put into being better fighters. No amount of karate will let a little guy beat up a big bully but it improve self confidence and a healthy ego. Guns kill 90% of children deaths in the home and will never be used for home protection actually. Japan has the right idea and Australia took all the guns. We should make a deal with the NRA to have a gun training class available for young people but only normal hunting guns will be available, no auto or semi automatics. No pistols in homes. Guns must stay at gun clubs. Smarter kids will be easier to raise but need more parenting time and their children will be amazing. Doctors will soon defeat cancer and most heart disease. It will take many years to get this technology to the world. Our politicians will take many years to start to solve the bad government we have now. The leftists are just wrong and elected politicians are products of the system that corrupts them. They need to change the education system, change healthcare and remove the insurance system in favor of insurance paying actual cost instead of the 5x numbers. The same is needed in prescription drugs. This is a good start ",

            "answer_text": "The question is, \u201cWhat gives you hope for humanity's future?\u201d My hope for humanity\u2019s future lies in the fulfillment of the age-old promise, given in all of the world\u2019s great religions, that a time will come for the establishment of a peaceful, just, and very long-lasting world-wide civilization, known sometimes as the Kingdom of God on earth. According to the teachings of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith, this time is finally \u201cnear,\u201d according to Divine reckoning, meaning that it is within a few hundred years of realization, and that the processes by which it will come to be are already in place. God\u2019s purpose is none other than to usher in, in ways He alone can bring about, and the full significance of which He alone can fathom, the Great, the Golden Age of a long-divided, a long-afflicted humanity. Its present state, indeed even its immediate future, is dark, distressingly dark. Its distant future, however, is radiant, gloriously radiant\u2014so radiant that no eye can visualize it. \u2014The Promised Day Is Come. This Age, however, will not come about of its own accord. Rather, we\u2014all of humankind\u2014must work to bring it about. Some of the things we must do are to regard all of humanity, of whatever color or nationality, as our brothers and sisters; to work towards the abolishment of extremes of wealth and poverty; to rise above partisan politics; to work towards the creation of a single world currency and a single auxiliary language; to promote the equality of women and men; and to work towards the establishment of an international government. Goals and characteristics of this coming Age are set forth in the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed writings as follows: \u201cHe Who is your Lord, the All-Merciful,\u201d [Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h] has written, \u201ccherisheth in His heart the desire of beholding the entire human race as one soul and one body. Haste ye to win your share of God\u2019s good grace and mercy in this Day that eclipseth all other created days.\u201d The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. A world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth. A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between the various elements constituting this universal system. A mechanism of world inter-communication will be devised, embracing the whole planet, freed from national hindrances and restrictions, and functioning with marvellous swiftness and perfect regularity. A world metropolis will act as the nerve center of a world civilization, the focus towards which the unifying forces of life will converge and from which its energizing influences will radiate. A world language will either be invented or chosen from among the existing languages and will be taught in the schools of all the federated nations as an auxiliary to their mother tongue. A world script, a world literature, a uniform and universal system of currency, of weights and measures, will simplify and facilitate intercourse and understanding among the nations and races of mankind. In such a world society, science and religion, the two most potent forces in human life, will be reconciled, will co\u00f6perate, and will harmoniously develop. The press will, under such a system, while giving full scope to the expression of the diversified views and convictions of mankind, cease to be mischievously manipulated by vested interests, whether private or public, and will be liberated from the influence of contending governments and peoples. The economic resources of the world will be organized, its sources of raw materials will be tapped and fully utilized, its markets will be co\u00f6rdinated and developed, and the distribution of its products will be equitably regulated. National rivalries, hatreds, and intrigues will cease, and racial animosity and prejudice will be replaced by racial amity, understanding and co\u00f6peration. The causes of religious strife will be permanently removed, economic barriers and restrictions will be completely abolished, and the inordinate distinction between classes will be obliterated. Destitution on the one hand, and gross accumulation of ownership on the other, will disappear. The enormous energy dissipated and wasted on war, whether economic or political, will be consecrated to such ends as will extend the range of human inventions and technical development, to the increase of the productivity of mankind, to the extermination of disease, to the extension of scientific research, to the raising of the standard of physical health, to the sharpening and refinement of the human brain, to the exploitation of the unused and unsuspected resources of the planet, to the prolongation of human life, and to the furtherance of any other agency that can stimulate the intellectual, the moral, and spiritual life of the entire human race. A world federal system, ruling the whole earth and exercising unchallengeable authority over its unimaginably vast resources, blending and embodying the ideals of both the East and the West, liberated from the curse of war and its miseries, and bent on the exploitation of all the available sources of energy on the surface of the planet, a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice, whose life is sustained by its universal recognition of one God and by its allegiance to one common Revelation\u2014such is the goal towards which humanity, impelled by the unifying forces of life, is moving. \u201cOne of the great events,\u201d affirms \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1, \u201cwhich is to occur in the Day of the manifestation of that incomparable Branch is the hoisting of the Standard of God among all nations. By this is meant that all nations and kindreds will be gathered together under the shadow of this Divine Banner, which is no other than the Lordly Branch itself, and will become a single nation. Religious and sectarian antagonism, the hostility of races and peoples, and differences among nations, will be eliminated. All men will adhere to one religion, will have one common faith, will be blended into one race and become a single people. All will dwell in one common fatherland, which is the planet itself.\u201d \u2014The World Order of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. Further aspects of these hopeful concepts are set out in Robert Harris's answer to The divisions of humanity run both shallow and deep, can they be resolved for a prosperous future? ",

And, younger generations are in a much better position to confront those problems\u2026and solve them! If our younger generations will conscientiously avoid the awful mistakes older generations have made, they will have the world by the tail, with a down hill pull. There will be nothing to stop them! I believe racism will die, consumed by it\u2019s own hatred. I believe wars will be a sad footnote in the ongoing chapter of human history. I believe starvation and poverty will be eliminated. I believe alcoholism and drug abuse will be, no more. Ever more diseases will be cured or vaccinated against. These things can happen, if our younger generations of humanity want them to happen. I hope to live to see the day, when the leaders of two countries declare war on each other, and the armies refuse to march, the navies refuse to sail, and, the air forces refuse to fly. I hope to live to see the day, when all the world\u2019s leaders are committed to peace and prosperity, for all of us\u2026not death, destruction, and ruinous violence. There are only two kinds of people in this world. There are people who love, and there are people who love to hate. I dare younger generations to love. If they will, I will go to my grave, content in the sure knowledge this world will be left in positively excellent hands. ",

That\u2019s just \u201cmother\u201d nature working and is the nature in the DNA of all the life forms (therefore it\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d). Call me a naturalist. :) :) ",
