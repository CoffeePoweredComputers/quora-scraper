            "answer_text": "Because, perhaps surprisingly, we generally don\u2019t use the word \u201cis\u201d to indicate equivalence relationships. Rather, we use it to define concepts, or to indicate inclusion of some concept in a known set or category. When people actually do talk about equivalence relationships, they often indicate as much using words such as \u201cmatches\u201d or \u201ccorresponds to\u201d or \u201cthe same as\u201d. In this example, if people wanted to claim that the words \u201ccomputer\u201d and \u201cmachine\u201d literally have the same meaning, they would say something like, \u201ca computer is the same thing as a machine\u201d, or \u201ccomputer is a synonym for machine\u201d, or \u201ccomputers, or machines as they are also called, \u2026\u201d. As another example, you might hear someone who is organising a wedding say, \u201cthe number of chairs matches the number of visitors\u2026\u201d. It would be strange to say, \u201cthe number of chairs is the number of visitors\u201d. In the case of this question, \u201cis a\u201d is used to express inclusion in a set or category. A computer is included in the category of machines. But an inclusion relationship is not symmetric. The fact that [math]\\{1\\}\\subseteq\\{1,2\\}[/math] does not imply that the reverse holds as well. Anecdote: I don\u2019t remember what it was for, but at one time there were posters in my city with the slogan \u201ceveryone = designer\u201d. I remember being aggravated by that, because while in natural language \u201cis\u201d can be used to indicate the \u201cis a\u201d relationship, the mathematical symbol \u201c=\u201d can\u2019t: that symbol really does mean \u201cis the same as\u201d.

            "answer_text": "As Peter Bruins says, computer is a subset of all machines (which also includes kitchen equipment such as a blender/mixer or a dish-washer; metal working machines such as lathes, mills and saws; industrial machines that make a car-body from a bunch of flat metal, as well as many, many other groups of machines). You can also split computers into categories, it can be a laptop, a desktop or a rack-mount machine - and several other variants exists. And again, not all computers are laptops, but all laptops are computers. A given laptop may be \u201cWindows laptops\u201d, \u201cMacbooks\u201d or \u201cChromebooks\u201d - they are all variants of laptops. Sometimes things also fall into more than one category. Your Windows Laptop may also be a HP or Huawei laptop (overlapping subsets). Same idea as a cat is an animal, but an animal is not a cat (it could be a cat, but any animal is not the same as a cat). And a cat can be a Siamese, Norwegian Forest, Bengal or \u201caverage cross breed farm cat\u201d. As a logical concept, see the Wikipedia article for sets. Set (mathematics) - Wikipedia However, classification can be done in other ways too. Living things are typicaly classed in taxonomy:Taxonomy (general) - Wikipedia It is still a hierarchical system where the superset contains proper subsets, and as long as the scientists agree (it happens that they don\u2019t for a variety of reasons), there\u2019s one single point where something living can be placed in that hierarchy.
