            "answer_text": "I am from Azerbaijan but my father is Georgian Azeri. There are nearly half million azeris living in Georgia since many centuries. As a result I have been in Georgia very often to visit my grandparents who live in there. In my experience, Georgia is better place in terms of nature, hospitality of people, safety, human rights and corruption. Azerbaijan, though, is better to work and overall richer than Georgia. Azerbaijan also is bigger and a bit more developed than Georgia. Finding a job in Azerbaijan is also easier than in Georgia and as a result many azeris come to Azerbaijan from Georgia for work. PS. Recetlu due to low oil prices salaries in Azerbaijan have decreased and I am not sure about job prospects in Azerbaijan compared to Georgia. ",
