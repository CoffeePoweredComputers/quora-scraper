            "answer_text": "Interface is just like a class but with a collection of abstract methods. An interface consists of blue print of the class. Interface can have only methods not the method body . Class implement interfaces to extend their abstract methods. For eg an interface will have an abstract method called person and properties of that person like age , gender etc. A class will implement the interface person to form a boy named Yash. So here class used interface to take properties of person and extend a boy named Yash. I hope this will help you to understand interfaces. ",
