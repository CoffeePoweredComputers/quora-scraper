            "answer_text": "I am not a parent and so many will say that I have no right to answer this question. I, however disagree. The question isn't whether one's 11 year old son should watch '13 Reasons Why', a question, the answer to which I believe can only be deduced by the parents. The question is whether the programme is appropriate for an 11 year old. As a general question with an intent toward a relatively objective response, I believe myself qualified to answer it. My answer would be no. For several reasons. Not 13, however, I promise. My first reason derives from a conversation on this very subject that I recently had with a friend who is the parent of an adolescent girl. She insisted that her daughter was mature enough to watch a television programme such as this one and determine for herself it's appropriateness and what her own takeaway from it should be. I adamantly disagreed with her. It is the parent's responsibility to be the adult and to determine whether or not a programme, any programme is appropriate for a child of any age. Particularly a programme so polemical and at times disturbingly graphic both in content and themes as this one. Allowing the child on its own to decide the appropriateness of this programme or any other programme for that matter, is irresponsible in my opinion. Would you allow a child to decide for himself whether or not he should attend school and get an education at 11 years old? Or leave him to make his own choices with regard to what to eat, or how to maintain proper hygiene? Whether he can indulge in alcohol at that age? Whether he should indulge in illicit drugs? I would hope not. Healthy choices must be taught to one's children. They can't just be sent out into the world tasked with making choices they are ill-equipped and thoroughly unprepared to make on their own. This includes the media to which they are to be exposed. A parent's input in those choices is not only vital. It is imperative. The adolescent mind (to say nothing of the prepubescent mind) is nowhere near developed enough to digest, comprehend, analyse or interpret what they are watching at all times. Many adults are not even always capable of doing so. This is why there is such a thing as children's television and television specifically targeted for teens and young adults. These are programmes which are designed along the lines of what an average child of that age can properly appreciate and enjoy. Even if such a programme can often be thought-provoking and instructive, it is on a level which can be considered equal to the level from which a child that age can properly understand and actually learn. The issues dealt with in '13 Reasons Why' are adult issues. Nevermind that they take place in a high school setting. The fact that they do, and that these are indeed issues with which young people today are confronted is a societal problem. Because they exist, however, doesn't make it normal for a young person of that age. It is problematic that these issues have become so prevalent in the lives of so many of today's young people. Not something to simply be accepted as normal and to be disseminated as such. Too soon is children's innocence ripped away from them and they are forced to be confronted with issues with which they are ill-prepared to deal. It isn't fair to them. And frankly, I believe it can result in being rather traumatic for them. The world is a difficult place, there is no denying that. But why does an 11 year old need to know that? And in such graphic detail? When I was 11 years old, I had no idea what rape was. I didn't understand the concept of suicide. The idea that someone could be so desperately unhappy and without hope as to take their own life was inconceivable to me at that time. And rightly so. Which leads me to my second reason. Watching a girl commit suicide in all of its horrific detail (I saw the earlier version before they cut that scene out), or watching a girl be raped, a young man strung out on heroin, and even more horrifying, the scene with poor Tyler in the bathroom, these scenes traumatised me and I am an adult. I cannot imagine what they would do to a young child. Children remember things. Some things they carry with them their entire lives. I'm 53 years old and still attending sessions in ACOA to deal with childhood traumas that I have carried into my adulthood and which have affected decisions that I have made and ways that I have dealt with the people in my life. Most of it without my even realising that the source of my actions came from patterns and traumas that I picked up and experienced as a child. Developing minds should not have to carry that sort of burden with them so soon in their lives. Trauma, sadly is going to occur in our lives, there is no way to avoid it. Why should a child be wilfully exposed to it if it can be avoided? The death of a beloved grandparent, parent or even pet can be traumatic for a child. A childhood accident on a bicycle or from some other youthful reckless hijinks can be as well. These are normal traumas for a child and will more than likely be experienced on one level or another by every child at one time or another. An abusive or alcoholic parent, living with extreme poverty or raised surrounded by violent crime are more extreme traumas that can be even more enduring. I fail to understand why, if a child already has so much to deal with, one would allow him to take on even more of that burden by confronting him with things that have absolutely nothing to do with his present everyday life. And which, hopefully, never will. Thirdly, children grow up too quickly today as it is. They should be allowed to experience life in terms of the stages of their own growth. They should not have to be faced with adult problems at a young age. Even if the problems are depicted as being experienced by other people of a young age. As I've said before, this should not be the norm. And I believe that children should therefore be protected from it for as long as possible. I an a firm believer that a parent can prepare his or her children for the trials and tribulations that they will have to endure in life without necessarily having to endure them, even if vicariously, before the appropriate time. Anyone who teaches his or her child to swim by throwing him into the deep end of the pool with no prior experience in being taught on how to swim in the more shallow water is an abusive parent in my opinion. And I apologise but this is what I liken exposing a child to such a television programme as \u201813 Reasons Why' at such a young age as 11 and which, to me, makes it such a terrible idea. My fourth and final reason is two-pronged. First, I don't believe that enough young people (adolescents) who are watching or have watched this programme are doing so under the proper supervision. This is why there was such a rise in suicide when the first season came out. Even adolescents are impressionable and without proper guidance can easily walk away from such a programme and potentially lead themselves to making tragic choices based upon what they have seen. Suddenly suicide becomes an option where it might never have been before the young person having been exposed to this programme. Second, going back to children growing up too quickly, I believe that this leads to a false understanding of their actual level of maturity and leads them into wanting to explore situations prematurely for which they are ill-equipped to properly handle or appreciate. This as well can have long lasting and extremely damaging consequences. Watching a programme as potentially traumatising as \u201813 Reasons Why' without parental or at least adult supervision falls under this behaviour pattern, I believe. And it is for these reasons that I find this programme to be utterly inappropriate for an 11 year old even with supervision. Now, should a child of a young age be allowed or even encouraged to watch this programme, learning about and discussing the issues openly and honestly with a parent or other responsible adult so as to lessen (but by no means eliminate) the chance that they might watch it on their own and take away an entirely distorted message? I have no idea. Only a parent can know his or her own child well enough to be able to determine whether such an endeavour would be appropriate or even healthy for the child. My answer here speaks only to my personal opinion as to the general appropriateness of this programme specifically for an 11 year old child. Or in the more general case of my response, any young person without proper supervision. I would be grateful if no one were to interpret it as my telling any parent what he or she should or should not do with regard to the raising and educating of his or her own child. Because that is not what my response entails. ",

            "answer_text": "I have kids. One of them is a recent teen. I have unintentionally given parenting advice in the past and received a major face palm. And been mommy shamed several times . So I have promised myself never ever ever absolutely never I will ever tell a parent what to do with their child. .but this is different. This deals with a very serious issue that our babies are dealing with so I will give my two cents. As a very anxious over involved in her children day to day lives kinda parent I keep my ears and eyes open for anything flying on teen preteen issues radar. So when this show popped up on Netflix, of course I had to watch it. I found it boring, a bit annoying how they are turning sucha serious issue in a game . Felt like lot of information was left out. All of a sudden everyone started talking about it. Radio, school pto meeting, churches even the kateeb at Friday prayers is telling parents to watch it because it's everyone's issue. Ok then , so now I see it with a different point of view and at first I am thinking I should sit and watch it with my daughter once she is ready for high school everyone is telling me to do so they must see something that I don't. But then I think so how should I answer her questions what should be my approach . That lead me to think what her questions might be and from that point on wards my concerns takes a different direction. What is this show about? A girl committing suicide for 13 reasons got it . Light bulb goes on !!!! seriously! half of those of those reasons exist because she is making a big deal out of things that seriously are not an issue or are just in her head no one else is doing anything. Parents over working? Yelling at her coz she lost money . really? I bet there are kids out there who have suffered worst almost heinous things at the hands of their so called parents and they survived, fought and moved on. Boy not talking to her coz her picture kissing a girl is viral? C'mon\u2026\u2026 I personally think people over reacted to this show. If it does anything it teaches kids to be needy. To try and get attention anyway they can . So no body really need to watch it or make exceptions for it . To wrap it up I will not tell you what to do but I will tell you what I will do . Not watch it with my children or allow them to watch it on their own . ",
