            "answer_text": "A Raspberry Pi is just another computer. The way you can get two or more computers to connect up with each other is via a network connection. So basically you get the Raspberry to sit as a node in the network in which your computer is connected to so that you can engage your Raspberry Pi in communication with other computers in that network. Alternatively, you can do a direct connection between your Raspberry Pi and your Computer / Laptop with an Ethernet cable or via WiFi. There are a couple of ways to accomplish that. You can even connect a USB based Bluetooth to the Raspberry Pi and enable Bluetooth on your Laptop. That\u2019s how I used to connect my old computer and my Laptop together or connect my Computer to internet via my non Smart Phone so that my old model Phone behaved like a Modem and relayed internet to my Computer via Bluetooth. Hope you get the idea. You can replicate the same with your Raspberry Pi too. Your Raspberry Pi has a WiFi and an Ethernet port to introduce it to existing networks. If you have a WiFi router or make your Smart Phone to be a WiFi hotspot, you can connect both your computer and Rasberry Pi to that WiFi hotspot then get the assigned network IPs for both of the Computer and Raspberry Pi and bring the two to communicate together. For example, you can get an application running on your Raspberry Pi to connect to a Database running in your Computer. Similarly, if you have a patch cable ( Ethernet cable with RJ45s on both ends) you can connect it to your computer Ethernet port and the Ethernet port of your Raspberry Pi and be able to do things like File transfer across each device. IF you would like to Setup and Connect to a HEADLESS Raspberry Pi 4 B with No Keyboard, No Monitor and No Mouse for the very first time, you can check out this video I made here.  It is long but I covered and detailed almost everything that you need to do to connect your Raspberry Pi to the internet and to your computer for the first time. I struggled with this bit too while using my Raspberry Pi 4 B hence the reason I felt compelled to capture the same steps I used and archive them on internet so that even me myself can refer to them when I forget how I did it. So when I finally got to connect to my Raspberry Pi 4 B and my computer via my Smart Phone\u2019s Hot Spot, I just enabled the data bundles on my Smart Phone and then both my Computer Laptop and the Raspberry Pi connected to the internet as I had configured the WiFi connection between the Smart Phone + Raspberry Pi and Smart Phone + Computer Laptop. In the VNC client running from my Computer connecting to my Headless Raspberry Pi 4 B you can see me playing back the track La Modelo by Ozuna ft Cardi B from YouTube on my Raspberry Pi\u2019s Web Browser. That was after I connected my Raspberry Pi 4B to the internet for the very first time. If you love this track you know that part of the Lyrics that goes \u201c Rapa pa pai Rapa pa pai \u201c. Of course he is not saying Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi but doesn\u2019t that part of the Lyrics rhyme with Raspberry Pi? That was on a light note. Hope you keeping yourself in good health and that you are having a good time tinkering with your Raspberry Pi while observing healthcare precautions that help us navigate these difficult times.. Let me know if this answer helped you or if there is anything you would like me to add onto it to improve on it. ",
