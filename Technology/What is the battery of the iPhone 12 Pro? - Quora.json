            "answer_text": "Apple has been improving its battery life on iPhones recently, just after it Launched iPhone X. In 2018 with the Launch of iPhone XR we saw almost 3000mAh Battery on it and it was the most long lasting battery on iPhone till then. And last year with iPhone 11 series we saw iPhone 11 Pro Max with the highest battery capacity of almost 4000mAh. Indeed we all know that iPh 11 Pro Max with its comparitively smaller Battery than other Android Flagships runs longer easily. We can hope that this time with iPhone 12 Series we might see somewhat around 4500\u20135000 mAh battery capacity. ",
