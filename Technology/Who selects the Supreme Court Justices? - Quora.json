            "answer_text": "Assuming, as some others have said, that you\u2019re speaking about the U.S. Supreme Court, the current number of 9 (one chief justice and eight associate justices) is set by the Judiciary Act of 1869. That\u2019s the statute that Franklin Roosevelt proposed amending in 1937 during what became known as his \u201ccourt packing\u201d proposal (which would have allowed him to add one justice for every then-current justice over age 70; at the time, it would have given him six new appointments to the court). Roosevelt lost that fight for several reasons. First, public opinion generally opposed expanding the size of the Supreme Court in what many regarded as a naked power grab. Second, Justice Owen Roberts, in what became known as the \u201cswitch in time that saved nine\u201d (i.e., a nine-justice court) started voting to uphold Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal legislation. There is some question whether Roberts had already decided to do so \u2014 some of his votes on pending cases would have already been \u201cin the pipeline\u201d before Roosevelt made his proposal \u2014 or whether Roberts truly was motivated by a desire to try to head off Roosevelt\u2019s proposal to expand the size of the court. And third, and perhaps most critically, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Robinson unexpectedly died in July, 1937 just as the bill to expand the size of the court was coming up for consideration. The bill was referred back to committee by a lopsided vote (70\u201320) and no more was heard of it. But then shortly afterwards, the first of the justices who had voted to strike down Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal legislation announced his retirement, and Roosevelt got his first appointment. Ironically, over the next 8 years, he would eventually appoint 9 justices, although some of those were internal (e.g., appointing Associate Justice Harlan F. Stone to be Chief Justice, and then appointing Robert Jackson to fill Stone\u2019s former seat) and some were multiple appointments to the same seat. James F. Byrnes, for example, who had been a senator from South Carolina, was appointed to the court six months before the Pearl Harbor, and found the monastic court life somewhat boring. Once war broke out, he also was itching to get involved in the war effort, and so left the court after just 15 months, creating another vacancy for Roosevelt to (re-)fill. ",
