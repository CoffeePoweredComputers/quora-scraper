            "answer_text": "We have a lot of experience here and being honest\u2026there is little difference between marketing blockchain technologies and other tech areas. To some extent tech marketing is tech marketing, however creativity can abound based on every different project: I could write for ages on establishing a brand messaing and position, but will skip that for the point of this answer as I think you are looking for tactics. Content and education: Set forth an educational and content curricula that is novel, interesting and informative. Great articles, new data, trendspotting, webinars, event speakerships, meetup groups, association outreach, video, white-papers, research reports. Be a source for exceptional content and exceptional education.Public Relations: It is never simply existing, but the stories that make your tech, product, team, and vision truly unique that engages journalist and analyst intrigue. Trends and insights sell press, data sells press, amazing things you are doing as a company sells price. Simply being in existence does not. PR can be your greatest friend, but it has to push stories that are bigger than just yourself.Social: Social is not about just repurposing content onto twitter and linkedin. It is about actively exposing thought leadership, industry expertise, engaging audiences and being personable. From Github to quora, forums to traditional S.M there are so many possibilities to drive exceptional social that most \u201cPosters\u201d simply scratch the surface of. Establish a solid plan here that leverages your content curricula and let social amplify, engage and provide interaction.Executive Team and Thought Leadership: This may fall under the guise of content and public relations, but it deserves its own mention. We live in a persona driven landscape. Focusing on just tech/product is a shoot-yourself in the foot strategy. What makes your execs unique? What personal stories do they have? What expertise can they provide and how can you make them visible leveraging the above? Moving past this, what amazing things is the entire team up to? Your developers? Your team events\u2026etc\u2026Bottom line: Tech marketing needs to up its game, be holistic and focus on driving the same types of value that your product does. ",

            "answer_text": "Just like any other product ;) Create a content strategy (owned, earned and paid media)Get as much product exposure as possible (go comment on quora & reddit, launch a YouTube channel, interview blockchain opinion leaders, start a blog on Medium)Create content to cover all stages of your sales funnel from awareness all the way through purchase and repeated purchase (e.g. you need a series of educational articles about what is blockchain and how it works, then a white paper that would contain your product development description from technology and marketing perspectives, then you nay need cases to support your statements and big idea, etc)Do social media marketing campaigns and allocate budget for ads on your target social media channels (e.g., FB, LinkedIn, Twitter) and relevant forums (e.g., bitcointalk) and chats such as Telegram or Slack. Post relevant owned and curated content there and make sure it converts followers to your product fans and brand advocates.Find media contributors that can help you get featured on high-profile media publications (e.g. business2community, techcrunch, although you need a magic bullet to get the door opened on TC). Be ready to pay for sponsored content.Do native ads, retargeting and banner ads on relevant sites with huge audiences.Do quality media buying and backlinkingCreate interesting news with high social engagement potential, try to take advantage of and piggyback on newsjacking.Do event marketing, go on a roadshow to increase word of mouth and awareness of your product within a certain community.Find and buy a good email database of potential investors / product users and launch a series of email blast campaigns. Do the same with the media contacts.If done properly, all of the above should work for your blockchain product marketing! Good luck! ",
