            "answer_text": "This is a massive question so here comes a long answer. I will be making some timeframe predictions, but I would like to point out in advance that such predictions are often based on guesswork more than anything else. Also, there will be a lot I don\u2019t talk about, because of the enormity of the subject. Lastly, there is a lot of hype, in part caused by miscommunication between scientists and engineers, and the public, and in part caused by a desperate need for research funds. Nanotechnology is a very broad term and encompasses a very broad set of sciences. This is because any technology where at least one dimension of the critical component is less than 100 nm, and where this fact is important to the properties of said technology, is defined as being nanotechnology. It encompasses everything from gene sequencing to the idea of quantum computing. Generally, nanotechnology is divided into 3 distinct fields, although there is significant overlap: Bio-nanotechnologyNanomaterials (essentially an extension of modern material technology)NanoelectronicsEach of these categories are themselves quite broad, but the following is a short review of each field and my personal assessment of how far the fields have gotten and what the hopes are that they might achieve. Bio-nanotechnologyThis field is probably the one to have made the most progress, at least in certain areas. Gene sequencing, often thought of as nanotechnology, is incredibly fast, reasonably cheap, and easy to do. In other words, a great success. The other major focus of bio-nanotechnology is cancer drug delivery. This is on a research level, and there are a lot of different ideas being proposed, most of which involve some form of targeted treatment. Although the concept has been around for a long time, it happens to be easier said than done. However, my impression is that a lot of progress has actually been made lately and there is every reason to expect that we will see cancer drugs using nanotechnology delivery systems in our life time. I would guess anything from 20 to 50 years, but this is just a GUESS! Science fiction has this idea of nanobots that can swim through the blod stream and perform important tasks. This however, is not something we are even close to being able to do. There are so many fundamental theoretical issues that no serious engineer takes the idea seriously. At least not in any foreseeable future. NanomaterialsThis is probably the broadest field. There are already a bunch of products on the market that use nanomaterials in some shape or form, and a bunch that say they do, but really don\u2019t! Some examples of products that actually do, include certain types of sunscreen (they use ZnO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles because of their optical properties), windows that don\u2019t pass infrared radiation (again an optical property thing, the details of which are a little complicated), hydrophobic coatings that repel water (a nanostructured surface has a high surface area and therefore repels water), etc. The list goes on and on. The truly high hopes though for nanomaterials, lie in solar cells. Nanomaterials tend to have really unique optical properties, and there are a bunch of concepts for how to make more efficient solar cells, including a concept called \u201cintermediate band solar cells\u201d. In fact this idea has been developed and such solar cells exist. In fact, they work very well. The main problem, and this is the case for a lot of nanotechnology related issues, is production time. This makes it incredibly costly and prevents the technology from being truly commercially viable for the time being. This however, is only a matter of more research and more time. There is also some important work being done on batteries and other types of energy storage such as hydrogen fuel cells, in this field. There are a lot of different reasons why nanomaterials are great for this, but suffice it to say that the research on this is being done and is also expected to revolutionise the way we store and consume energy. My guess on timeframe is probably within 10 years from now. NanoelectronicsThe field is concerned with things like quantum computing, spintronics, and a lot of other fancy words to describe things mostly concerning the computer electronics industry. Although most of this stuff truly is still on a theoretical level (for example a good friend of mine is running simulations on thermally stable magnetic domains), there is also an incredible incentive to develop this type of technology. The old version transistor (the transistor is the key component of any logic circuit) is getting so small, that making it smaller won\u2019t work anymore. Fundamentally, this is due to quantum effects kicking in at this size range. If components utilising quantum mechanics, instead of fighting, can be developed, this would be MAJOR! The basic idea has already been proven, but there are of course loads of issues and challenges that need to be overcome. Because of the strong economic incentives, I think there is every reason to expect this sooner rather than later. Other focuses of the field include things like general work on semiconductors, thin films, etc. and there is a lot of overlap between the field of nanoelectronics and nanomaterials. This work tends to be quite successful, but again there is an issue with commercial viability due to production costs. A quick note on commercial viabilityCommercial viability happens to be a very common issue when moving from nanotechnology developed in the lab to a commercially viable product. So much so that, even if we make very big technological leaps in the lab within a short period of time, it will be much longer before we can expect our everyday lives to be affected in a way that lives up to some of the hype!

            "answer_text": " The Future of Nanotechnology in Medicine Around the world, researchers are increasingly thinking smaller to solve some of the biggest problems in medicine. Though most biological processes happen at the nano level, it wasn\u2019t until recently that new technological advancements helped in opening up the possibility of nanomedicine to healthcare researchers and professionals. Today\u2019s infographic, which comes to us from Best Health Degrees, highlights some of the most promising research in nanomedicine. . . What is Nanotechnology? Nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular level. The field combines elements of physics and molecular chemistry with engineering to take advantage of unique properties that occur at nanoscale. One practical example of this technology is the use of tiny carbon nanotubes to transport drugs to specific cells. Not only do these nanotubes have low toxicity and a stable structure, they\u2019re an ideal container for transporting drugs directly to the desired cells. . . Small Systems, Big Applications While many people will be most familiar with nanotech as the technology powering Iron Man\u2019s suit, real world breakthroughs at the nanoscale will soon be saving lives in healthcare. Here are a few ways nanotechnology is shaping the future of medical treatment: 1. Smart Pills While smart pill technology is not a new idea \u2014 a \u201cpill cam\u201d was cleared by the FDA in 2001 \u2014 researchers are coming up with innovative new applications for the concept. For example, MIT researchers designed an ingestible sensor pill that can be wirelessly controlled. The pill would be a \u201cclosed-loop monitoring and treatment\u201d solution, adjusting the dosage of a particular drug based on data gathered within the body (e.g. gastrointestinal system). An example of this technology in action is the recent FDA-approved smart pill that records when medication was taken. The product, which is approved for people living with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, allows patients to track their own medication history through a smartphone, or to authorize physicians and caregivers to access that information online. . . 2. Beating the Big C Nearly 40% of humans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime, so any breakthrough in cancer treatment will have a widespread impact on society. On the key issues with conventional chemotherapy and radiation treatments is that the body\u2019s healthy cells can become collateral damage during the process. For this reason, researchers around the world are working on using nano particles to specifically target cancer cells. Oncology-related drugs have the highest forecasted worldwide prescription drug sales, and targeting will be a key element in the effectiveness of these powerful new drugs. . . 3. Diagnostics Medical implants \u2014 such as knee and hip replacements \u2014 have improved the lives of millions, but a common problem with these implants is the risk of post-surgery inflammation and infection. In many cases, symptoms from an infection are detected so late that treatment is less effective, or the implant will need to be replaced all together. Nanoscale sensors embedded directly into the implant or surrounding area could detect infection much sooner. As targeted drug delivery becomes more feasible, it could be possible to administer treatment to an infected area at the first sign of infection. Examples like this show the true promise of nanotechnology in the field of medicine. Before long, gathering data from within the body and administering treatments in real-time could move from science fiction to the real world. 10,000 years ago, man domesticated plants and animals, now it\u2019s time to domesticate molecules. \u2013 Professor Susan Lindquist . .
