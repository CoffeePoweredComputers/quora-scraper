            "answer_text": "A study found that heavy internet users experience psychological symptoms of withdrawal when they stop using. They found that compulsive internet use by adolescents leads to poorer mental health. They found that Facebook use led to a decrease in happiness and overall life satisfaction. Technology can have a large impact on users' mental and physical health. Being overly connected can cause psychological issues such as distraction, narcissism, expectation of instant gratification, and even depression. Beside affecting users' mental health, use of technology can also have negative repercussions on physical health causing vision problems, hearing loss, and neck strain. How Unplugging from Technology Can Improve Mental Health. it\u2019s actually been compared to having ADHD. The cortex of your brain is designed to, among other things; keep you from being distracted from every new form of stimulation that you encounter. You might not have ADHD but that\u2019s how your brain starts to respond when you don\u2019t disconnect. You\u2019re constantly distracted by every new bing, blip, and notification that comes out of your phone. Bringing Work Home How many of the texts and emails on your phone are related to work? We tend to take our work home with us, responding to emails and chatting with coworkers after we\u2019ve been off the clock for hours. A study by the University of Toronto found that an average of 50% of people bring their work home with them. This interferes with your work-life balance and can be detrimental to your mental health. Make it a point to leave work at work. As the last thing you do before your shift ends, pull out your phone and shut off the notifications for your work accounts. You can turn them back on before your next shift starts, but make sure that your work stuff stays at work. Sleep You\u2019ve finally made it home from work, shut off your phone notifications, and started relaxing. What do you do to relax? Chances are, even though your work notifications are off, you\u2019re plugged in to your computer or phone, checking social media, playing games, and texting friends. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it\u2019s likely that digital processes which are entertaining to the point of distraction have likely produced what many people believe is a surge in mental illness. Autobiographical memory is probably the instrument which causes non-functional mental illness rather than chemical imbalances. Brewer (1986) divided autobiographical memories into categories of personal memories, autobiographical facts, and generic personal memories. A memory system consisting of episodes recollected from an individual's life, based on a combination of episodic (personal experiences and specific objects, people and events experienced at particular time and place) and semantic (general knowledge and facts about the world). If Autobiographical memory is the fountainhead of mental illness, it could explain why treatments currently only suppress mental illness. A open a totally new avenue in which explore cures for mental illness. ",

            "answer_text": "It has been proven to be so regarding (light from tech) sleep, and I\u2019m sure there are other studies. That being said, compared to the BENEFITS of technology, there is NO CONTEST, technology is better for mankind as it gives the average person power they never would have had without. Back in the dark ages, the Catholic Church spoke mass and preached in Latin. Now, this wasn\u2019t done to purposefully keep people in the dark, though that is what it did - it was done out of respect for the bible. You will also notice that mankind makes huge leaps any time communication and dissemination of information increases. See: (in order) More advanced vocabulary/oral communication. Written word. Mass production of the written word. Libraries. Telegraph. Radio. Television. Internet. Cell/Text/Apps You will notice invention becomes exponential. ",
