            "answer_text": "Your question facts are misleading. Shenzhen is home to Huawei in China. Shenzhen has already begun commercial service of 5G in Shenzhen. \u201cSHENZHEN - South China's technological powerhouse Shenzhen will launch pilot project for 5G commercial use in 2019, local authorities have said. Shenzhen will install 1,955 5G base stations this year, according to the city's bureau of industry and information technology. The city is speeding up construction of next-generation information infrastructure and deployment of the Internet of Things and smart and connected vehicles. Chinese cities are adopting the 5G network to meet public demand. In late January, the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in South China's Guangdong province launched a 5G base station. An indoor 5G network will be installed in the Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station by the end of this year.\u201d China is racing ahead in 5G. Here\u2019s what that means. \u201cLast fall, the Fangshan government and China Mobile, the country\u2019s largest mobile operator, outfitted a 6-mile (10-kilometer) road with 5G cell towers. Since September 2018, companies have been using the connectivity to test wireless communications between autonomous vehicles and their surroundings. The 5G network transmits data from car sensors, roadside sensors, and video cameras installed above the road to a local data center, which analyzes the information and sends it back to the vehicles to help them navigate. Under government direction, Chinese companies began conducting research on 5G in 2013 and holding technical trials of related technologies in 2016. \u2026.. Beijing has also committed to giving Chinese operators large chunks of spectrum for 5G. That\u2019s a far cushier arrangement than operators enjoy in the US and many other countries, where they pay regulators billions of dollars for the right to use slivers of spectrum\u2026\u2026. China wants to use 5G in smart cities and connected cars\u2014for starters. A prime example is Xiong\u2019an, a new city that the government is building 80 miles (129 km) southwest of Beijing to ease crowding in the capital. China Mobile and China Telecom have already established test networks there. Companies including web giant Baidu are using these networks to live-stream events in virtual reality and, as in Fangshan, enable autonomous vehicles to transmit data to each other so they can avoid collisions. Local authorities have encouraged developers to create 5G-based applications related to telemedicine and urban infrastructure, while Chinese companies want to use 5G to add connectivity and intelligence to factory equipment. It depends how you define the 5G race. If you count the launch of commercial service in any form, the US is in front of China. Verizon started selling its own 5G service, which is essentially a wireless version of wired broadband for homes and offices, in four US cities in October. AT&T plans to introduce mobile 5G service in 12 US cities before the end of the year. T-Mobile and Sprint say they will turn on their 5G networks by mid-2019. Chinese operators don\u2019t plan to start selling 5G service until 2020. However, if you think a country needs to roll out 5G to all its major cities in order to claim leadership, China looks likely to come out ahead. China Tower, a company that builds infrastructure for the country\u2019s mobile operators, has said it can cover China with 5G within three years of the government\u2019s allocation of spectrum. That points to national coverage by 2023. Equipment makers expect China to be able to roll out 5G much more rapidly. \u201cHistory tells that [Chinese operators] ramp up very quickly,\u201d says Thomas Noren, who heads 5G commercialization efforts for Ericsson, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of mobile network equipment. \u201cThey have [already] built more than an order of magnitude larger 4G networks than those in the US.\u201d China is racing ahead in 5G. Here\u2019s what that means. About South Korea\u2019s 5G rollout, are you sure about Huawei? \u201cWhile security concerns over 5G networks using telecom equipment made by China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd have marred the buildup to the release of these services, South Korean telcos have tried to shrug them off. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a security issue in South Korea,\u201d Park Jin-hyo, head of SK Telecom\u2019s information and communication tech research center, told reporters. Among South Korea\u2019s three operators, SK Telecom and KT Corp do not use Huawei equipment for 5G. Smaller carrier LG Uplus Corp uses Huawei gear. But SK Telecom officials said it was likely there will be an open auction for network equipment makers including Huawei if South Korea needs more base stations for higher frequencies. The country has one of the world\u2019s top smartphone penetration rates.\u201d South Korean, U.S. telcos roll out 5G services early as race heats up Re Australia: \u201cWhen can I get 5G? Telstra hopes to release some 5G devices in 2019, starting with an HTC-made Wi-Fi hotspot.Optus will kick 2019 off by selling fixed-wireless 5G plans to homes in supported areas.Vodafone/MJV won't sell 5G services until 2020.Where will 5G be available? All Australian telcos that built 4G networks started in metro areas first. Expect this to happen again, with 5G slowly making its way further out as its popularity grows and telcos can afford the investment.\u201d What is 5G and when is it coming to Australia? - CHOICE Bottom line: Your facts in your question are all marketing hype. Everyone is stumbling over each other to be first. That first is in the lower 5G frequency band that has less bandwidth than the upper-frequency band. The lower 5G band is similar to 4G LTE. No one has put the 5G millimeter wave band in commercial use yet. No one has built the infrastructure except for pilot and experimental purposes. When you hear that roar passing you bye, it will be Huawei\u2019s China. Who's winning the global race to offer superfast 5G? \u201c2018 saw a lot of progress with 5G. And despite 2019 looking like a big year for network launches, 2020 is when the fifth generation of wireless connectivity will really start to take off.\u201d The Truth About 5G: What's Coming (and What's Not) in 2019 ",

Is the US blocking China's 5G? A: You are factually correct. This is possible because Huawei is not a technological leader in 5G, it never was.Huawei arrived early to the 5G marled because they received millions in Chinese taxpayer subsidies to rapidly accelerate their 5G development effort5G was actually invented in the West, as was 4G, 3G, 2G and 1GHuawei was cooperates with the Chinese government to create a backdoor in all 5G cell towers across the world, that the Chinese Cyber Spy (PLA Unit 61398) agency code then use to spy on everyonePeople\u2019s Liberation Army PLA Unit 61398 (also known as APT 1, Comment Crew, Comment Panda, GIF89a, and Byzantine Candor )(Chinese: 61398\u90e8\u961f, Pinyin: 61398 b\u00f9du\u00ec) is the Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD)[1] of a People's Liberation Army advanced persistent threat unit that has been alleged to be a source of Chinese computer hacking attacks.[2][3] The unit is stationed in Pudong, Shanghai. PLA Unit 61398 - WikipediaHuawei did get their cell tower products to market first but they did not have any inherent technological advantage, they simply stamped out an implementation that would meet with 5G requirements, nothing more, so there was no appeal to attract anyone to their hardwareHuawei announced that they had more 5G patents than anyone else, obviously trying to fool innocent consumers into thinking that Huawei somehow invented something special, which it didn't. Within weeks of the Huawei patent announcement, it was revealed that Nokia already had 50% more 5G patents already granted and had many more filed and on the way to getting approved, so Huawei is not a significant patent leader in 5G, they are actually falling behind.The US didn't discover the Huawei plot with the Chinese government to spy on everyone, it was the Australian Intelligence community that discovered the plat and notified the West of the diabolical plot. The US was simply portrayed of starting the boycott against Huawei, but that was media manipulation, the US was simply following the warning from Australia, as did multiple other Western nations.The US is not blocking Huawei 5G. Huawei failed all on their own.",
