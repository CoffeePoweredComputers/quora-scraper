            "answer_text": "Hello, Specs Thanks to hugely informative videos in May 2020 by EverythingApplePro and Front Page Tech, we now have a great idea of the iPhone 12's specs sheet. A14 processor5.4in/6.1in OLED Super Retina display (6.1in/6.7in OLED with 120Hz ProMotion on Pro models)4GB RAM (6GB RAM on Pro)128GB/256GB storage (plus 512GB on Pro)5GDual-lens rear camera (triple-lens with LiDAR on Pro)A14 processor Let's talk a bit more about the A14 chip, about whose capabilities manufacturer TSMC has dropped a few hints. The A14 will almost certainly be based on a 5nm manufacturing process, compared to 7nm on the A13 (and likely 3nm on 2021's new chip). The benefits of 5nm, TSMC says, mean potential performance gains of around 15% over the iPhone 11. That's assuming Apple puts all its eggs in the speed basket, granted, since the A14 could instead offer 30% lower power consumption. Based on past behaviour we assume Apple will try to combine a balance of these two improvements, but favouring speed slightly more than battery life. We already had a sense that the A14 was going to be crazy fast. Earlier in the year the chip appeared to crop up in some online benchmark tools, and the numbers were phenomenal. Take a look at the following screengrab from the popular benchmark Geekbench, posted by AppleInsider. It compares the score for an iPad Pro 12.9in from 2018 - one of the most powerful mobile devices Apple has ever released, albeit since overtaken by the 2020 Pro and its A12Z chip - with what appears to be a prototype iPhone 12. And the iPhone 12 is scoring higher, even in multi-core.  The 'A14' is clocked above 3GHz - the first of Apple's A-family chips to achieve this - and despite having fewer cores than the A12X (6 rather than 8) it rates higher throughout the CPU tests. How likely is this to be genuine? Reasonably likely. Prototype devices have been spotted in online test suites before previous Apple launches, which makes sense; by this point in the release schedule the company will undoubtedly have created and be testing in-house samples of the iPhone 12. We've also seen alleged photos of the A14 popping up online; this isn't hugely informative, although markings on the chip appear to indicate it was in production as early as April.  RAM When it comes to performance, RAM is almost as important as the choice of processor; the fact that the iPhone SE (2020) has only 3GB, compared to the 4GB in all the other A13 phones, caused such a significant reduction in benchmark speed that people thought - almost certainly mistakenly - that it had been underclocked. For this reason it's pleasing to see the inclusion of a really solid 6GB of RAM in this year's Pro models. The non-Pro models, however, have to settle for 4GB. The 4GB/6GB prediction came from Jon Prosser in May 2020, but was backed up by the usually reliable leaker @L0vetodream in July. Storage As we've suspected for a while, it looks like Apple will remove the 64GB base storage option later this year, and set the minimum at 128GB. Sceptics will observe that the 2020 iPhone SE still offers a baseline 64GB allocation, but that's firmly aimed at the budget-conscious buyer. We feel that iPhone 12 buyers will expect rather more storage. Screens We may now know the full display specs for the late-2020 iPhones. In a tweet that's since been deleted, DisplaySearch founder Ross Young dropped the full list, and it suggests that the iPhone 11's successor will have a much sharper screen Here's how they're going to shape up, if Young is right. iPhone 12: 5.4in (2340x1080, 477ppi)iPhone 12 Max: 6.1in (2532x1170, 457ppi)iPhone 12 Pro: 6.1in (2532x1170, 457ppi)iPhone 12 Pro Max: 6.7in (2778x1284, 457ppi)(Note that we calculated the pixel density figures ourselves using CalculatorSoup, so any errors are ours alone. The original leak quoted slightly different figures of 475, 460, 460 and 458ppi respectively - we're not sure how they arrived at those numbers.) Here's how that compares with the current line-up: iPhone SE: 4.7in, 1334x750, 326ppiiPhone 11 (and XR): 6.1in, 1792x828, 326ppiiPhone 11 Pro: 5.8in, 2436x1125, 458ppiiPhone 11 Pro Max: 6.5in, 2688x1242, 458ppiIt seems logical that Apple would try to offer something a little more impressive than 326ppi on its mid-range phones - that always seemed a little stingy for \u00a3729/$699 - and give Android handsets more of a challenge. What does seem odd is the the idea that the iPhone 12, the cheapest of the new devices, would have a markedly higher pixel density than any other model. For that reason, and because the tweet was deleted, we're not betting our houses on these specs being accurate. Hopefully some corroborating evidence will arrive soon. As for the refresh rate, rumours point to the Pro models getting 120Hz. That's old news in Android land, of course, and is already available (complete with ProMotion dynamic switching) on the iPad Pros, but would be new for Apple's phone line. Don't count your chickens just yet, though: other pundits believe 120Hz is off. EverythingApplePro thinks the ProMotion feature (which is a separate but related matter: it enables a device to switch from 60 to 120Hz as and when it's necessary, to preserve battery life) is nailed on for the iPhone 12 Pro models; Jon Prosser thinks it could yet be \"nerfed in software\" and was still hedging his bets in a video near the end of August, saying some prototype models offered a software toggle to 'Enable High Refresh Rate' and some did not. Finally, what about the glass itself? In late July, the US firm that makes Gorilla Glass announced its latest development: Gorilla Glass Victus. This material is, Corning claims, twice as drop-resistant as the previous version and four times as scratch-resistant as rival glasses - and since Gorilla Glass is used in existing iPhone models, the gossipmongers immediately started to wonder if Victus would make an appearance in the iPhone 12. Apple is such an important customer for Corning that we'd be surprised if Victus isn't already being used in iPhone 12 production; the announcement has been timed in such a way that it would embarrass Apple if it now has to launch the 12 without the latest screen materials. But Cupertino has always been cagey about Corning's involvement in iPhone production, and it's possible that it simply won't say one way or the other. Battery capacity Apple sometimes comes in for mockery when it refers to its latest device as the \"best iPhone yet\" - what else would you expect, people point out. Technology gets better each year, and if you didn't offer better specs than the previous model nobody would upgrade. In one respect, however, it appears the iPhone 12 may be a little behind its predecessor. Screenshots from various databases suggest the new models will have smaller batteries.  If the figures are correct, the iPhone 12 Max has a battery capacity of 2775mAh, 335mAh lower than the iPhone 11. The 12 Pro is also 2775mAh, 271mAh less than the iPhone 11 Pro. And the 12 Pro Max looks to be 3687mAh, 282mAh less than the iPhone 11 Pro Max. That sounds very odd indeed, not just because of the aforementioned expectation for tech to advance every year but also because 5G and OLED screens throughout the range (both expected this year) will mean greater power drain on the new handsets. More power drain, less battery capacity, bad news for battery life. Well, not necessarily. As the Macalope points out, \"we know nothing about what other changes Apple may have made in hardware or software the might affect power consumption\". For example, it's been suggested by TSMC that the 5nm manufacturing process means the iPhone 12's A14 chip could offer up to 30% lower energy consumption than the A13 (although much of these gains may be wiped out if Apple chooses instead to focus on performance). For sure, if the iPhone 12 has half the battery life of the 11, we'll discover that in testing and give it a brutal review. But Apple is aware that people take battery life seriously and we'd be very surprised if it hasn't got a plan. Video capture Pundits and leakers remain comparatively reticent on the subject of the iPhone 12's camera chops, but we do hear that it could be the first smartphone to offer 4K video capture at 240fps ",
