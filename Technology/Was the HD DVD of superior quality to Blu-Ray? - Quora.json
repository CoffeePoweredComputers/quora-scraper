            "answer_text": "Not really. It supported the same set of video codec as Blu-ray Disc does, sure. Buuuut, it only supported a maximum video bitrate of 28 Mbps. (Blu-ray Disc supports 40 Mbps for a max video bitrate, and a total muxrate of up to 50 Mbps; UltraHD Blu-ray Disc goes up even higher, depending on the disc capacity used.) That\u2019s not terrible, but it also has a smaller total capacity - 15 GB for a single layer disc, or 30 GB for dual layer discs. (Blu-ray Disc supports 25 GB on a single-layer disc, or 50 GB for dual layer; UltraHD Blu-ray Discs can be 50, 66 or 100 GB.) This means that practically speaking, Blu-ray Disc could contain whole movies in notably higher quality than what HD-DVD could - versus an HD-DVD, where they could put just the main title on one disc, and any special features on another, but that would increase the manufacturing costs. If the movie was large enough (like oh, say, Lawrence of Arabia), they might have to split up the movie itself. So could it manage similar quality, but not quite as high of bitrates, but could get capacity constrained too. So no, HD-DVD was definitely not superior quality-wise. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn't matter. I've worked in post production and will tell you that true HD footage is 5.6 MB per frame. That's well over a gigabyte per minute. In other words, it's still compressed. And 35mm film is 8K. And I can make a project that's 1 billion by 1 billion in most recent video editing software so long as my video card supports it. You haven't even gotten close to buying your last TV. ",
