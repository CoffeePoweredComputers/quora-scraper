            "answer_text": "It is already the case. In the 90s after two years your 2000\u20ac PC was obsolete. Today, a 10 years middle range desktop PC still works perfectly fine and with just a GPU upgrade you can even run many games reasonably well. The exponential progress of computing power mainly applied to GPUs and mobile CPUs these last 10 years. But for desktop or server CPU the party has been over for some time now even though apparently no one noticed. I have just checked my mailbox for my CPU bills. In 2008 I bought an Intel Core 2 Quad Q9300 for 180 \u20ac. Now for the same price you get a Core I3 8100. I went to Home - UserBenchmark to check the benchmarks results for these CPUs. Result: the second is 111% faster than the first when overclocked. In 11 Years. Underwhelming, isn\u2019t it? ",

If you only need a computer for web browsing, email, watching movies etc. this computer will probably be fine for another 5 years or longer. The usable life of a PC or Mac now can be over 10 years, depending on your needs. If you\u2019re a gamer, it\u2019s less than that, but for most users, they really can expect to get over 7 or 8 years out of a PC or Mac. ",
