            "answer_text": "I can think of a few. 1- cursive writing. They no longer teach it in school. Kids can only write using a keyboard. 2) Typing.. I don\u2019t think they even teach proper typing techniques any more. I took typing in high school. My nephews are amazed how I can type on a keyboard. 3) Reading a clock with hands. My friend is a curator at a museum. He has kids come in that can\u2019t read a clock with hands. They all use digital reading on electronic devices. 4) Driving a car with manual transmission. Who even drives a manual these days? They should have gotten rid of manual transmissions 50 years ago. ",

He harvested and partially kiln dried his own wood and used to to build chairs and tables that used no nails, screws, fasteners of glue and yet were so strong when finished that the joints could not be pulled apart without breaking the wood. He knew exactly what moisture level the wood needed to be at when the mortise-and-tenon joints were assembled and when he is gone so will the multitude of facts required to produce that kind of furniature.
