            "answer_text": "Hi, Greetings From the day!!! On July 21st Oneplus Nord launched its latest budget offering the Oneplus Nord which is easily one of the most favourable budget-friendly choices among the sub Rs 25,000 The Oneplus Nord rocks a very similar design to the one plus 8 and 8 pro with a glass build, protected by gorilla glass 5 on both the front and back, the difference being the frame isn\u2019t made of aluminium like in the flagship offerings by the manufacturer but polycarbonate which isn\u2019t much noticeable and doesn\u2019t feel cheap at all in fact if not told the polycarbonate frame feels very much like aluminium. The design on the Nord is quite plain and minimalistic. The back of the phone is the clean reason being the fingerprint scanner is embedded under the display. The Nord has a 6.44-inch screen with 90hz of refresh rate meaning it can refresh the screen 90 times per second, the resolution of the screen is 1080x2400 pixels or full HD plus simply talking and it has a 20:9 aspect ratio, The screen is an Oled panel with HDR 10+ certification and backing all those pixels up is a 4115mah Li-Po (lithium polymer) battery. Oneplus Nord has a great display to consume content on and the HDR 10+ certification acts as the cherry on top enhancing the content consuming experience  OnePlus 8 is available in three variant, 6GB Ram + 128GB storage: Rs 41,9998GB Ram + 128GB storage: Rs 44,99912GB Ram + 256GB storage: Rs 49,99Oneplus Nord Features Display6.44-inch (1080x2400)Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 765GFront Camera32MP + 8MPRear Camera48MP + 8MP + 5MP + 2MPRAM12GBStorage256GBBattery Capacity4115mAhOSAndroid 10Nord Plus 8 Good Features about this phoneBuilt well, comfortable design90Hz AMOLED display5G-ready processorGood daylight camera performanceSolid battery lifeOnePlus 8 Summary The OnePlus 8 is the spiritual successor of the OnePlus 7 and will go on to eventually replace the OnePlus 7T. Build quality is excellent thanks to the curved-edge front and back glass sandwiching the metal frame. The buttons are easy to reach, and the alert slider is handy as always. The OnePlus 8 has a 6.55-inch AMOLED panel with sloping sides, a wide colour gamut, and a hole-punch cutout in the upper left corner. The 90Hz refresh rate makes usage in general feel fluid and snappy.
