These are solar panels which can be used to pave roads, driveways, sidewalks, or any surface meant for walking. Solar wafers protected under thick layers of shatter-proof Gorilla Glass can be used to generate electricity from any surface. These modules come in hexagonal panels which makes replacement super easy. Additionally, Solar Roadways panels can be programmed electronically to show specific markings on the road. The panels can generate enough heat to melt the snow and thus ensure easy walking or driving over them during winters. All of this while saving the Earth and Earth-dwellers from succumbing to the damage caused by greenhouse gases. 29.

            "answer_text": "The \u2018Hoverboard\u2019 Scooter  Gregory Reid for TIME Developed by multiple brandsPrices vary Part Segway, part skateboard, the self-balancing scooter\u2014generally known as a hoverboard, even though it doesn\u2019t actually hover\u2014is easily the year\u2019s most viral product, drawing fans like Justin Bieber, Jimmy Fallon and Kendall Jenner. Once someone hops on, the device uses a pair of electric gyroscopes (one under each pad) to balance automatically, allowing users to speed forward, backward and around by slightly shifting their body weight. That enables all kinds of fun stunts, ranging from hallway races to motorized dance routines. Maxx Yellin, co-founder ofPhunkeeDuck, one of more than 20 companies making versions of the device, sees larger implications. \u201cIt could evolve as a new form of transportation for cities and colleges,\u201d Yellin says (though British authorities recently caused a stir by outlawing their use on public sidewalks and streets). But convenience comes at a cost: prices range from $350 to $1,700, depending on the brand and its features. \u2014Lisa Eadicicco The Underground Park  Cameron Neilson The Lowline LabDeveloped by Dan Barasch and James Ramsey \u201cIt\u2019s not like any park you\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d says Dan Barasch of the Lowline, an abandoned trolley terminal in New York City\u2019s Lower East Side that he and architect James Ramsey are trying to turn into an acre of lush green space, replete with flowering plants and areas to relax in the sun. The key: a \u201cremote skylight\u201d dish system that captures sunlight from surrounding rooftops and funnels it underground via fiber-optic cable; once there, it\u2019s beamed out via reflective dome, enabling plants to grow. To prove the technology works, Barasch and Ramsey opened the Lowline Lab; it\u2019s a prototype version of the final park, which is still several approvals\u2014and $70 million in funding\u2014away from completion. But Barasch, who attracted more than 3,300 backers on Kickstarter, is undeterred. Even forgotten places, he says, can still be used \u201cfor public good.\u201d \u2014Julie Shapiro ",
