Thr needs may be as simple as providing input to someone\u2019s habitat that will result in less need for generated energy or as complicated as window panes or exterior wall coverings created to act as solar panels. It could be as simple as inverting a liter soda bottle in a hole in the roof of a hut in Africa to provide better lighting inside.

To solve that we will need to learn to consume less and that requires millions of people to adjust their lifestyles; which is hard to achieve in a democracy where people are free to vote for leaders who don't believe there is any need for action on climate change or regulations to protect the environment.

Compounding feedback effects have already been put in motion\u2026 Eventually, we will use molten salt reactors, wind, solar and lots and lots of batteries to convert the remainder of the fossil fuel store into graphene cities that will almost scrape the edge of space. But first, we must use all these clean energy sources, in great abundance, to literally remove the excess CO2 from the air by material and mechanical means. And to power FUTUREWORLD. ",

Another way to look at it is there weren\u2019t these issues (specifically) in 1850 or really even 1950, but especially in 1750. So a return to those sorts of population levels 1/2 or 1/8 or less now, or having the effect of some lower population created by increased technology, is the main way to remove the issues created as time has gone one.
