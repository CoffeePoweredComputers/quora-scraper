            "answer_text": "You should stay away from it. Network marketing or Mult-Level-Marketing is a business model designed to fail. The only people who really benefit are those that get in on the ground floor/creators. Another issue is that people may not be looking for the actual product or products you are locked into promoting. The products could also be crap, which means crazy refunds. I\u2019m going to set my personal feeling aside now. If the product isn\u2019t crap and you feel okay promoting it, you could look for related forums or learn how to make money blogging and use a blog to promote it. That way, your earnings would be residual \u2014 if people actually are looking for what you\u2019re promoting. Good luck. ",
