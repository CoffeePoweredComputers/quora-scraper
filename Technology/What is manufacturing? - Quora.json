            "answer_text": "Well in Latin Manu means hand. ie. Manual labor is labor by hand not machines. The verb Facere in Latin means to make. So manufacture means, in Latin (Roman bronze age terms) to make or craft by hand. Our family motto on my mother\u2019s side is Mente et Manu. That means \u201cwith mind and hands.\u201d As opposed to harvesting fishing, or mining. Manufacturing means making things. Tools have improved since Roman times, and so have processes, and the amount of hand work is minimal. ",
