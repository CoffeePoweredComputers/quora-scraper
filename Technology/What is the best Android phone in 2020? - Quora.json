            "answer_text": "There are two great Android Phones available on the market today. For some people, the most preferable phone is Samsung\u2019s flagship Galaxy S20, while the rest of the Android fans opt for OnePlus 8 Pro. The best phone in the Samsung Galaxy series, the Galaxy S20 Ultra (launch price: $1,399 in the US) comes with an overwhelming 16GB of RAM, the largest 6.9 inches display, the biggest battery at 5,000mAh, and the outstanding camera setup with a primary 108MP sensor, however, don\u2019t get too excited about the 100x zoom feature, since it\u2019s barely usable and is kind of gimmicky. Overall performance is great and you can actually view it as a Statement Phone that wants to be the best and most powerful device on the market. The next one in the line is the Galaxy S20 Plus (launch price: $1,199 in the US). It comes with a slightly smaller 6.7-inch display which is still great for the viewing experience, and a reliable 4,500mAh battery. This phone has three versatile cameras on the back, which are capable of taking amazing photos under different lighting conditions but with less resolution and zoom than Ultra. The regular Galaxy S20 (launch price: $999 in the US) isn\u2019t very different from the Plus model. It has a smaller but easier to manage 6.2-inch display, a smaller but still powerful 4,000mAh battery, and less storage which isn\u2019t a problem today with plenty of cloud storage solutions. You will probably choose one of the premium models if you want to concentrate on portrait photography because the basic model doesn\u2019t have the ToF sensor but overall performance is great. Therefore, if you are aiming for a powerful phone that will provide you with the best lenses out there designed for the best photography experience, you should go for the Ultra model. If you are not so crazy about photography, the cheaper models are still the high-end phones aimed at demanding users, so the choice is up to you. As for the OnePlus 8 Pro (launch price: $899 in the US), I should say that it has all the features you expect from an Android phone in the premium range, including a nice primary camera sensor, full IP68 waterproofing, and finally, wireless charging. The phone has a bright color-accurate 6.78-inch AMOLED display that offers never-before-seen low reflectivity, so using the phone outdoors is just a dream. Some people assume that with its 120Hz display, highly-optimized OxygenOS software, and plenty of under-the-hood tweaks, the OnePlus 8 Pro feels like one of the best Androids phons on the market and it might be so, but again - if you want a phone with the best optical performance - nothing can beat Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra.

            "answer_text": " If you\u2019re in the market for one of the best Android phones, the breadth of options can be overwhelming. But choice is probably the greatest thing about Google\u2019s mobile OS. Android guarantees a similar user experience across many makes and models of phones, while letting you prioritize the features you want. We\u2019ve tested all of the best smartphones in all shapes, sizes and prices here at Tom\u2019s Guide, and the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is our current leader among Android handsets, thanks to its cutting edge design, super fast performance and long battery life. But it\u2019s hardly the only Android device that\u2019s worthy of your consideration. The Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy Note 10 Plus are two other fantastic premium options for those who want to take advantage of Samsung's new S Pen features and improvements in video quality. Android purists should consider the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. These phones, among the first to boast Android 10, offer a faster Google Assistant, motion gesture controls and a ton of other enhancements, though the outstanding cameras remain the Pixels' big selling point, especially since the latest phones add a second rear camera. And they stand to get even better now that Google has announced an initiative to regularly update them with \"feature drops.\" With so many smartphones vying for your attention, it's not easy to pick the best phone. Tom's Guide reviews dozens of new handsets each year, and we evaluate them in our labs and in the real world based on design, features, performance, camera quality and battery life. We also perform in-depth face-offs between flagship phones to decide on our best phone rankings. But not everyone has the budget for a flagship, which is why we also provide recommendations for cheaper phones. One of the biggest phone trends for 2020 is 5G phones. 5G networks are starting to become more robust \u2014 with Verizon and T-Mobile being the most aggressive thus far \u2014 but 5G is not quite widespread enough for mass adoption. Another big trend? That would be foldable phones, even though the Galaxy Fold didn't turn out to be the watershed moment Samsung was hoping for. But more foldable phones are on the way, including the Motorola Razr (which has been slightly delayed) with a pocket-friendly clamshell design. Our best phone list has something for everyone, whether you prefer Android or iOS, a big-screen phone or small phone or you want to save some money by going with an older phone. ",
