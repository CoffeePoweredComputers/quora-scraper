            "answer_text": "The Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 line of phones were unveiled to the world yesterday. They released 3 phones, the iPhone 11 (cheapest at $699), the iPhone 11 Pro (at $999) and the iPhone 11 Pro Max at $1099. They all promise improved screens, faster processors, new cameras, and a much requested longer battery life (fingers crossed on this one!). The iPhone Pro will be offered in two sizes, with either a 6.5-inch (165mm) screen or 5.8-inch (147mm). The better-quality Super Retina XDR OLED displays have a higher resolution, have better colour, are comparatively brighter, and are more efficient on battery. The most exciting feature for this year\u2019s iPhone is a square knob on the back, which has a triple camera system for the iPhone 11 Pro. The three 12-megapixel cameras work in unison akin to the dual-camera system of the previous iPhones, merging an ultra-wide angle, a telephoto and a main camera for increasing from 0.5x to 2x, like rivals\u2019 products.

            "answer_text": "As of today (August) there is no such thing as iPhone 11 Pro so your question cannot be answered. And even if there is, Apple does not announce prices before a product is introduced. Tune in in September when Apple will probably announce their new phones. But the questioner probably is aware of all this and is just posting unanswerable questions like this in order to collect financial rewards under the Partners Program. ",
