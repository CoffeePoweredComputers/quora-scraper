            "answer_text": "If you are trying to start s brand new collection and don't want to end up in the poor house trying to fill it, pick something that is brand new. It can can anything really, regardless of what it is it will some day be valuable just because it is old. Maybe a new magazine that just recently started up? Or a new exciting line of toys that seem like they will continue to release new editions of for years. Again it does not matter what, it only matters they you think it is fun and/or cool. The reason I recommend avoiding types of collections that have been around for a long time is that eventually you will desire some of the older versions and it can get expensive really fast to acquire them. Starting a new collection of some item that just released is not only very affordable, but also keeps your collection \u201ccomplete\u201d from day one and enable you to give it the coveted label of \u201cmaster collection\u201d at all times. Be sure you love the item you choose, and also be sure to properly preserve them from the start. (Hint: NEVER open factory packaging). Hope you find something you love! ",
