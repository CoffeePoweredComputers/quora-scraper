            "answer_text": "Yes. In fact they exist right now. A nation-state is a very particular form of state -it\u2019s not just a synonym for \u201ccountry.\u201d Google defines it as: a sovereign state whose citizens or subjects are relatively homogeneous in factors such as language or common descent. Wikipedia says: A nation state is a state in which the great majority shares the same culture and are conscious of it. The nation state is an ideal in which cultural boundaries match up with political ones. According to one definition, \"a nation state is a sovereign state of which most of its subjects are united also by factors which defined a nation such as language or common descent.\" It is a more precise concept than \"country\", since a country does not need to have a predominant ethnic group. I prefer most academic Phillip Bobbit\u2019s definition of the nation-state. I don\u2019t have the exact quote on hand, but he explains the nation-state as a state that is legitimized by, and exists to serve, the nation, with nation defined as a single ethnic group of culture. Examples of a nation-state, then, would be countries such as South Korea, Japan, Poland, Denmark. The United States of America is not a nation-state, although there was always, and still is, a long running question on whether or not it should be. It would be better to call the USA a multinational or multicultural state. unified largely by secular individualist ideology.  Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s legitimacy rests largely on religion, not any particular nation (as I understand it). The other famous theocracy, the Vatican, is the same.  Other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, are absolute monarchies that gain legitimacy from (among other things) the power and prestige of the ruling family, not a nation within the state. And if you head down to Africa most of the countries there are multicultural/multinational states. And all of these places do indeed have modern technology. ",
