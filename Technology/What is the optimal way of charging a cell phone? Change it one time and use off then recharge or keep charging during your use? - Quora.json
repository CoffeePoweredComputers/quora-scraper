            "answer_text": "You could charge it to 85% and use it until it drops down to 25%. That way you can charge it again (without using it while it is plugged in). This would give you 60% of optimum battery usage without damaging your battery. In case you need to use the phone while it is charging then a bluetooth headset would help you better. You can work while you talk, plus the phone charges simultaneously (Bluetooth is very low power so you won\u2019t be slowing down the rate of charging)  The optimal way is to turn off Wifi, Bluetooth, Data, turn off the screen etc while it is plugged in. That way you are turning off everything that will use the battery while the phone battery is being charged. ",
