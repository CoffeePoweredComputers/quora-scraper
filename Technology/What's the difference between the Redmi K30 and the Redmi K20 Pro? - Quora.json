            "answer_text": "The main difference is the SoC , the redmi K30 comes with the new Snapdragon 730G which is built for gaming , we havr seen this in the devices like Realme X2 & it is great , on the other hand the redmi k20 pro is powered by the Snapdragon 855 , though this is last year SoC but still being 8 series SoC , it is more powerful than Snapdragon 730G , have better GPU. For the display , the redmi K30 spots a IPS LCD display , which is definitely downgrade from last years AMOLED , & i personally don't like it , also this one have that side mounted fingerprint scanner & trust me many people will not like it because of the simple fact that it is not practical placement they should have gone with rear mounted fingerprint scanner , if you have budget & if you can get some good deal i would say still the redmi k20 pro is much better device.
