            "answer_text": "It could be. There is nothing in the idea of a \u201ccomputer\u201d that couldn\u2019t be done mechanically. However current computers are not mechanical machines - they are electronic machines with few (if any) moving parts. Mechanical computers have been designed and built. Charles Babbage famously designed one called \u201cThe Analytical Engine\u201d - and actually built some parts of it. There is a replica of one of his earlier computing machines in the London Science Museum - and it actually works quite well. There have also been thoughts of using nanotechnology to build computers out of tiny pushrods, gears and levers just a few dozen atoms long. Such machines would (by virtue of their TINY size and three-dimensional form) be able to be vastly more complex, much faster and more energy efficient than present day computers. However, none of those have yet been built. I actually own a small mechanical computer (you can read about it here: Digi-Comp I - Wikipedia). They were sold for $5 as educational toys back in the 1960\u2019s. It\u2019s not much of a computer though. It can add together two numbers (so long as they\u2019re both smaller than 3) and it can play a game of \u201cNim\u201d\u2026which isn\u2019t bad for a bunch of cardboard, bent wire and elastic bands!  But it\u2019s stretching a point to call it a \u201ccomputer\u201d at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question, set me thinking anyway. Looking at the machine I\u2019m doing this on I\u2019d say it\u2019s electrical/electronic and mechanical. Mostly the bits of it are solid state, so there\u2019s no moving parts but I am severely inconveniencing a great many electrons. However, there\u2019s a big fan whirring round in it which, though controlled and driven by electricity, is a moving part and sits on mechanical bearings. The hard drive is not solid state and relies on precision parts moving in unison to read and write to a platter coated with magnetic properties, and that platter is spinning. That\u2019s definitely mechanical. The keyboard I\u2019m doing this with has buttons that depress to make contact with an electrical membrane and come back up again by means of a spring and you can\u2019t get more mechanical than that. All the plugs and wires depend on a friction fit into their respective ports apart from the VGA cable which is held in place by a couple of screws and screws are an ancient mechanical device. So given that I\u2019d be inclined to say electrical/mechanical hybrid. ",
