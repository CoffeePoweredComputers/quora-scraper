The accident in New York City involved Winston Churchill. (Some say he looked the wrong way while crossing the street; after all, he was used to traffic traveling on the left side).  The accident in Bavaria involved Adolph Hitler.  1944. President Franklin Roosevelt, seeking an unprecedented fourth term, decides to replace Henry Wallace, his current Vice President, with Missouri Senator Harry Truman. The Roosevelt-Truman ticket wins. Truman becomes the new Vice President on January 20, 1945. Less than three months later, Roosevelt is dead and Truman is the new President. He serves the balance of FDR's term and goes on to win a full term on his own in 1948. But what if Roosevelt had stayed with Wallace? Wallace favored stronger ties with the USSR and was a staunch supporter of civil rights. No one could say for certain whether a President Wallace would have agreed to use nuclear bombs against Japan. By replacing Wallace with Truman, Roosevelt changed the course of American and world history. ",

            "answer_text": "Just to get the answer list rolling, I'll put one out there:The British battle against the Spanish Armada was a complete fluke.  The tiny detail here was the weather prior to approaching the British Isles.  Much of the armada ended up damaged due to the weather, and so the approaching force ended up significantly downsized from the initial formidable Spanish Armada that had commanded the seas for centuries, allowing Queen Elizabeth I to defeat the Spaniards on the seas, securing British naval dominance for the next ~300 years. Considering that British naval dominance is what drove a significant portion of the expansion of the British East India Company and the entire imperial colonial movement, one could possibly attribute the foundation of the US to this British naval victory, and other various monumental changes following 1588. All it comes down to is the fickleness of the weather. Anyone else have a bigger turning point or a smaller detail? ",

It 'probably' was an illusion but the effects were immense in the history of the world. Constantine became a Christian after this and became a patron of the church. Christianity became the official religion and the Roman empire soon became divided and fell. The church became all powerful and the effects on the history are well known. Everything that happened in the history of the Christian church hung on one tiny fact. A man seeing something in the sky. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, if it must be military, then the rout of the Bretons, on William's left flank, at the Battle of Hastings - along with his his own withdrawal of his Normans and Flemish from the immediate fight, as a result, led to an undisciplined reaction from the Saxon shieldmen, who broke ranks in pursuit. Until that point, the English were well on their way to another outright defeat, over an invading army, within one week. The act of abandoning their positions at the top of Senlac Hill was what gave William his chance to rally his attack and win the day. In turn, Harold's death - along with all his brothers - in the subsequent victory, removed any immediate contenders to the throne, and turned what was, in some ways, an opportunistic raid, into a full scale invasion. What would have been different, if not for that? Well, where do we start to seek answers to that question? For one thing, the language (in which my counterpart, from such a future, would be writing this post), would look very different, if it existed, at all. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll see your Spanish Armada and raise you: for the want of barrel staves the Spanish Armada was defeated.  In 1587 Sir Francis Drake raided Cadiz. Among the casualties of the raid were 1700 tons of seasoned barrel staves burned, enough to contain 30,000 tons of food and water.  When Phillip II began outfitting the Armada the following year, he needed those barrel staves and instead had to rely on barrels made from green wood. The green barrels leaked water and food spoiled even before the ships sailed.  The shortage of food became a serious problem in the long return voyage around Scotland to Spain. Thousands of Spanish sailor died on the voyage from the weather, shipwreck, disease and starvation. ",
