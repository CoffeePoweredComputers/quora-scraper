            "answer_text": "As long as T-Mobile and/or Sprint have good networks in your area, you will have a good experience on Project Fi. Additionally, US Cellular is part of Project Fi, but they are only in a few states so it\u2019s unlikely many use them. I\u2019d recommend Project Fi to anyone who fits the following criteria: Currently owns or is prepared to own a Google Pixel/Nexus Smartphone.Uses 3\u20135 gigabytes of data or less per month, preferably less.Is already deeply invested in the Google ecosystem.Possesses patience and understanding that Project Fi, though stable, is technically a \u201cproject\u201d and can sometimes be unstable, unclear, etc.Lives in an area where T-Mobile and Sprint have really good network saturation. It\u2019s okay if only one of these networks is in your area but your experience will be MUCH better if both are present.Project Fi works by utilizing Both Cellular radio technologies present in Pixel and Nexus devices and harnesses Sprint, T-Mobile and US Cellular networks as well as your personal WiFi and thousands of certified Public WiFi hotspots. You can make a call using your Project Fi number on WiFi, using the phone\u2019s native dialer app. With PFi you can use Google Hangouts as a dialer as well, on any device with an internet connection. Network switching works while in a phone call Using a Project Fi Data-Only SIM card, you can bring data only service to your LTE enabled tablet, smart watch or extra smartphone. This data will be deducted from your Project Fi account. With Hangouts dialer integration you could setup an extra smartphone with a Data Only sim to make and receive phone calls using your Project Fi number! Even an iPhone! Since Project Fi was built on Google Voice technology, you receive Voicemail transcripts with your Project Fi voicemail. There is a TON of really cool stuff you can do on Project Fi. Just perform a Google search to find out. Good luck! ",

According to Wikipedia, they currently use Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Three. So, your experience will theoretically be as reliable as the carriers they use combined. ",
