            "answer_text": " What is the thing in the picture above? that\u2019s right, it was a printing press. Maybe this thing is underrated nowadays and even was only a relic. But what people do not know of it\u2019s importance is that this thing made of wood, invented by a German from Mainz, was the basis and the origin of printing itself. Well, this thing made life much more easier for humankind, especially Europeans at the time. But, why? Well, before the the existence of this thing, many books were written by monks in most monasteries, and that was not efficient. Why? Because writing books with ink is really time consuming, and also it does not allow books to be massively produced.So then this guy:  (Yes this is Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of this thing) Who happens to have a financial problem of making polished metal mirrors , suddenly come up with the idea of inventing a printing press. Legend has it, that the idea came to him like \u201ca ray of light\u201d. So by 1450, his printing machine were already set to work and one of the first thing he printed was a German poem. Although most of his works were unidentified and unknown, one of his most famous works of him is this:  Yeah, that\u2019s right. It was Gutenberg\u2019s bible whom he made in 1455, No he didn\u2019t made the bible himself. But he copied it. \u201cIn 1455, Gutenberg completed copies of a beautifully executed folio Bible (Biblia Sacra), with 42 lines on each page. Copies sold for 30 florins each, [24] which was roughly three years' wages for an average clerk. Nonetheless, it was significantly cheaper than a manuscript Bible that could take a single scribe over a year to prepare. After printing, some copies were rubricated or hand-illuminated in the same elegant way as manuscript Bibles from the same period.\u201d As the statement said, he clearly copies a beautifully executed folio Bible. which is a great thing, as it allows Europeans for the first time, mass produce the Bible, which is a really great thing. Eventually, it shows it\u2019s own blossom starting in the 16th century and was used for most religious uses, for example: The spread of the Protestant Reformation was really aided by the printing press, as it mass printing Luther\u2019s 95 Theses. Had the Printing Press was never invented, the spread of the Protestantism, especially Luther\u2019s doctrines (Lutheranism), will spread very slowly. Which makes it spread much more slower and also it\u2019s popularity was not that significant for the whole Europe to be famous.  \u201cThis the portrait of Martin Luther, the father of the Protestant Movement\u201d. Hope this answer helps! Johannes Gutenberg - Wikipedia Gutenberg Bible - Wikipedia Printing press - Wikipedia Martin Luther - Wikipedia Ninety-five Theses - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Recently I read an article which mentioned a new device developed by MIT which is being called as a \u2018Mind Reading Device\u2019 that lets the user communicate with their device without actually speaking loud or any had movements.  The above photograph shows the device which is officially named (atleast for now) as \u2018Alter Ego\u2019. According to a statement released by MIT Media Lab, the device would allow users to send silent commands to the headset simply by thinking of a word. A neural network would translate the muscle movements to speech and do the user's bidding \u2014 totally hands- and voice-free. Checkout this interesting video for an idea about how this device works :  For detail you can go through the link below. It is really interesting for a futuristic world.
