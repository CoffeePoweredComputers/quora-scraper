            "answer_text": "Hard to say exactly - they seem to be launching every couple of weeks - about 120 satellites per month - and they need 12,000 of them in orbit in order to get global coverage. Clearly at this rate, it\u2019s going to take 12,000 / 120 = 100 months or about 8 years. But I very much doubt that\u2019s what will happen. When SpaceX have StarShip working reliably - each StarShip could probably launch 150 satellites a DAY\u2026and then it\u2019ll all be up and running in about 3 months - with just one StarShip doing the work\u2026if they push harder, and have three StarShips - then they\u2019ll be done in a month! At that point, the limiting factor will be how fast the StarLink satellite factory can turn them out\u2026and we don\u2019t know how fast that is. So, clearly we\u2019re looking at StarLink growing slowly across the USA at first - and then a huge rush to cover the rest of the planet when a reliable orbital StarShip comes into being. Trouble is - we don\u2019t know when that will be. Currently, they\u2019re talking about having the first orbital StarShip sometime in 2021\u2026but whether it\u2019ll be needed for other things\u2026whether they have the launch capacity\u2026many things are unknown.

            "answer_text": "The answer depends on your definition of affordable and in which specific countries. The equipment required to connect to Starlink will cost several hundred USD. It is likely that the cost will be spread out in the monthly subscription cost, which will probably be somewhere between $50\u2013120 depending on the terms of the agreement which may vary based on the throughput, data caps, and if the terrestrial equipment cost is bundled in. As for where the service is available, that may be up to the governments regulatory agencies, who may welcome Starlink yet will likely charge access fees, which will be passed onto the subscribers. Some governments may ban Starlink, and others make have to deal with negotiating with incumbent service providers who are already paying the government access fees, and insist on maintaining their exclusive access to the market.
