            "answer_text": "It's kind of like a spy, but where a spy is covert or under cover, surveillance is usually out in the open. Usually. A surveillance worker watches either a person, a group of people, an area, or a specific place. They do it as a way to achieve a sense of quality control. A high crime area might be under surveillance in order to discover establish better security and prevention measures. A person might be under surveillance in order to track their activities for some form of legal purpose or to discern what they do and see if it matches what is expected of them. Surveillance is often seen as a bad thing, but it's done because something bad has already happened and suspicion has been raised. So now there is a watcher who is tracking and reporting everything that happens. One of the most common forms of surveillance is the presence of security cameras in public areas of hospitals, malls, buildings, and sometimes even city streets or sidewalks. There surveillance cameras are not there to hurt anyone, but are there to help if something bad does happen. Surveillance is designed to PREVENT situations that might become harmful to someone or to a place. Security workers are the people who respond to situations that get out of reasonable control, and many of them are police officers who work part time security jobs. While surveillance may seem like an invasion of privacy, it's important to remember that it's present in order to keep the majority of people safe. Surveillance doesn't just pop up out of nowhere. Someone did something that caused harm to another person or place, and now that area or person is under scrutiny. It's one reason that I live by \u201cNever do or say anything you don't want the whole world to know about.\u201d I say this because in my experiences, what one person does is often talked about and spreads through the grapevine faster than wildfire. And surveillance is like that as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Surveillance comes from a French word and means \u201cwatching over\". Police surveillance is done covertly (in a hidden/concealed way) as is spying, but the word is also used in health surveillance, especially in the workplace (occupational health surveillance) which is not at al secretive. A health surveillance worker may be a doctor, nurse, psychologist or an administrative person trained up to work with a questionnaire. The work involves checking in with the employees at regular intervals, which could be monthly or yearly, as appropriate. It is an extra way that an employer can care for the workforce, hopefully picking up on any problems early and get any investigations and treatment in place as soon as possible, to avoid problems getting worse. It shares similarities in meaning with a word derived from Latin roots, \u201csupervision\", but that one is used in education and in training: \u201cYou will be working under supervision until you pass your exams\".
