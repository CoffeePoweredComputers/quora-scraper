            "answer_text": "Apple Music for Business is a very interesting product. Its a great idea, but the main issue is that many stores and business have to pay extremely high licensing fees from the PROs in their country. This is the real pain! The PROs in most countries have a monopoly, so they are able to charge higher and higher fees each year and then the vast majority of that money never makes it back into the artists pockets! Answer: good product - doesn\u2019t solve the problem. ",
