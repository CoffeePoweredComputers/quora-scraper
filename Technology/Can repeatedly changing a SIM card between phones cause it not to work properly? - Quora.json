            "answer_text": "Yes the repeated swapping a SIM between phones can eventually cause damage to the SIM. The damage is because of the contacts receiving pressure and other forces applied to them and can be damaged eventually. There is also the corrosion aspect to consider. We are talking a lot of mishandling and abuse not simply taking it out occasionally. A micro SD card can suffer similar effects but is much more robust because of the housing and design it has. Getting a new SIM from your carrier is rather easy and possibly free so it is a none issue. They will also port the number to the new SIM. ",

Every time you handle it residue gets on it, either oil from your skin or residue from rubber gloves if your wearing them. So to answer you question , yes repeatedly moving the sim card around can cause it to not work properly. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question: \u201cCan repeatedly changing a SIM card between phones cause it not to work properly?\u201d Yes. The metal contacts on the SIM can get scratched or worn off in time - these are not intended for large numbers of insertions. Once the gold (or other metal in cheaper SIMs) is scratched off, since it is quite thin, the connection to the phone becomes bad and the SIM is no longer functional. Plus, the cellular carrier will see the repeated changes and may treat it as fraudulent activity that triggers their fraud detection systems to disable that SIM from their network. ",

Function wise neither phone nor SIM card would care. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, other than the correct answers already given, indirectly too. Skin fat/oil residu may be left on the contacts causing these to malfunction over time. even gold contacts can get polluted. The effect is as if the SIM is malfunctioning or absent. Contrary to a defect chip, this may be solved using a suitable solvent. ",
