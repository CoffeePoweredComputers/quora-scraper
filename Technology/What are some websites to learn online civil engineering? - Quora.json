            "answer_text": "As far as I know, you can subscribe ASCE website journal. It's the forum of US civil engineering society, in which you can see every new updates or research done by the experts, proceeding, journal, etc in every kind of topics of civil engineering you want to see. In short, it's just like this Quora, but ASCE focuses mainly on civil engineering only. And the main difference is that every proceeding, journal, article published in it must have been written by the experts, selected by the experts, and approved by the experts too. As long as you are registered as user, you can access everything you want in it. Usually, if your university have subscribed it, you can use the access, such as user name and password for that online learning. But if not, then you can subscribe by yourself, which means you must pay monthly or annually on your own. It's probably expensive though, but having the access for learning almost everything you can grab in your hand is priceless too, isn't it..? While the other good website I can use for learning, as far as I know, is this Quora. Sorry for I haven't seen other good websites. Good luck.. ",
