            "answer_text": "There are several review platforms out there, I personally manage our company\u2019s profile on CrowdReviews, trustradius, Capterra, and G2Crowd (we have an enterprise-ready iPaaS solution). But when I need to check some enterprise solution or tool myself, I prefer using G2Crowd to all others. First, I believe G2Crowd is the most extensive platform, it has an unbelievable amount of products, solutions and tools. Capterra is the second on the line, the rest cannot compete (yet) at all. Secondly, I have the impression that G2Crowd has more reviews than any other platform. Sometimes, I check several platforms to get the full picture about a tool or solution, and while G2Crowd offers, let\u2019s say, 15 reviews, Capterra would offer only 3, and the rest won\u2019t have any reviews at all. Thirdly, G2Crowd offers the best interface, in my opinion. But really, the second point is the most important. After all, the whole purpose of a review platform is that it offers lots of reviews.
