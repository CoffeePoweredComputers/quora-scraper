            "answer_text": "We would be left in the Stone age for eternity and be stuck hunting animals with our bare hands. Tools and weapons are also considered inventions too, I'm not so sure about fire though, maybe that is all we would have left. If all our inventions disappeared in modern times, then basically every structure in the world would collapse because there was probably someone out there who invented concrete or steel supports and and wooden planks. Technology would be dead too, and just vanish. All that would be left is just humanity and what's left of the environment, back to the pre-historic days of persistently chasing animals until they are exhausted then basically just whacking them with our hand and biting them. In a sense that is what it would be like if there were no more inventions anymore, including all the past inventions too I guess. I hope you can imagine what it would be like too along with me. -But that is just my opinion. ",
