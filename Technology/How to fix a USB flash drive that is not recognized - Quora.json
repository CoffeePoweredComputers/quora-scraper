            "answer_text": "First, make sure if the problem is with the flash drive or the USB port itself. Try to use the flash drive on a different USB port, a different system or laptop and also try to use it on a different device like with a phone using an OTG cable. If the flash drive gets recognized on other devices but not one device, then get the faulty USB port checked with a technician. If the USB is not recognized on any device, then check if you can see if the device is getting detected by your system. Right-click on the Windows icon, choose Disk Manager and check if your flash drive is detected. If yes, then use an application like Recuva to recover all your files. Once you have your files, format the drive and it will start working normally again. If the flash drive does not even get detected under Disk Manager, then there are no easy steps that can be taken by you to repair it. It is best to approach a professional data recovery team if you have important data. If there is no important data, then just replace the flash drive. ",
