            "answer_text": "Technically speaking, Dragon, by Nuance, is the most accurate.  However, it is not just the software that provides accuracy -- especially with background noise.  A quality microphone is essential. From a blog post: For those who wish to understand why Dragon is not working optimally  for them, I explain that Dragon\u2019s accuracy and efficacy is contingent  on: Adequate hardware,Quality microphone (not what was purchased at a local electronics store or necessarily what is on Nuance\u2019s list of suggested devices),The right version of Dragon (believe me, Nuance  would not spend the time working on a medical version of Dragon with  over 50 vocabularies if it did not make a difference in accuracy),How the software was installed (yes, there can be more to it than sticking in the disk and performing a basic installation),The manner in which a user trains and dictates to Dragon,Learning to use the numerous features within Dragon effectively, andKnowing which methods of using Dragon are actually a hindrance to accuracy and productivity and which will promote accuracy and productivity. http://www.speakeasysolutions.com/blog/2011/05/16/benefits-of-professional-training-in-the-use-of-dragon-naturallyspeaking-medical-legal-professional/ ",

            "answer_text": "The best voice recognition software is not one that does perfectly accurate speech-to-text conversion because such technology does not yet exist. Some believe it may never exist. So a good definition for best voice recognition software is one that makes it convenient to correct mistakes, preferably through voice commands. In that sense, SpeechToText Pro takes a leading position because it offers about 40 voice commands allowing the user to select, edit, delete or insert text.  ",
