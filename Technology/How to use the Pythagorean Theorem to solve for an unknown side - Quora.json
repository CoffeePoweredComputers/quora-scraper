If I have a polygon with all information given except one side, I\u2019d just treat each of the sides as a vector and require that the total of all the vectors be zero (since the polygon is closed). That gives me the full description (magnitude and direction) of the missing side. ",

            "answer_text": "a^2 + b^2 = c^2 c = longest side of triangle. Then it's just a matter of filling in the blanks and using basic algebra to find your answer.  E.g: (Numbers may not be accurate) C = 10cm. B = 8 cm. The equation would look like:             a^2 + 8^2 = 10^2             a^2 + 64 = 100            a^2 + 64 - 64 = 100 - 64            a^2 = 34            a = square root of 34 ",
