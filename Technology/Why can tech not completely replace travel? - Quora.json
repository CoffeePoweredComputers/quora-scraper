            "answer_text": "Because they are not the same thing. They are not equivalents. There are similarities between Virtual Reality travel (tech) and real travel, but having experienced both, I can tell you with 100% surety that they are not the same. Love and lust: Not the same. Hamburger and steak: Not the same. Lobster and dungeness crab: Not the same. French fries and sweet potato fries: Not the same. I can give you many, many more examples of things that are similar but not the same. That\u2019s why tech will never completely replace real, honest-to-goodness travel. ",
