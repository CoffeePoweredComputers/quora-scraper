            "answer_text": "Depends on how you define \"web development.\" For basic stuff - absolutely.  It's almost true now.  There are umpteen different ways for a non-technical person to put up a basic web page/site - \"print to HTML,\" various \"build a website\" services, etc. For slightly more complex stuff - you don't need to be a developer to set up a wordpress or Drupal site.  Customize and extend, yes; but a basic blog or forum, no.  For storefronts, you go to Amazon or eBay. For more complex sites - fancy ecommerce or workflow tools, data mining services, games, etc.... now you're still talking serious development, with a scope that probably goes beyond \"web development.\" To me, it's a lot like what happened to typists, and illustrators, and secretaries in a world of MicroSoft office.  Most people type and illustrate their own letters, memos, documents.  Very few people have secretaries.  That's not to say that people do a good job of it, or that it's cost effective to have a highly-paid engineer spend their time formatting reports that a lower-paid \"desktop publisher\" could do in half the time, and produce a better result.  But companies don't like to hire bodies.  Everyone is expected to know how to type and use Office, and do their own work.  There's still a market for high-end people - for proposal preparation, for specialized and high-value documents (magazine, annual reports), and executive secretaries.  But it's a smaller market, and requires very strong skills.  The same logic applies to websites -- it used to be that you could charge $5000 or more to put up a very basic site (for a few years, I made some good money putting up relatively simple organizational sites, at $25k - $75k a pop - but that was in the day when the web was new, and anything fancy was written in perl as cgi scripts, and PHP was just emerging - no platforms other than a basic LAMP stack).  Today, pretty much anything I did could be done by a newbie, using a platform and config. wizards (well, site design still counts for something).  Of course, along with this \"dumbing down\" of site creation, comes a rather huge number of ugly, user-hostile, and horribly slow site (just consider the average magazine when translated to the web --- aaargh). Now when you get into more complicated sites and services - comparative shopping, data mining and visualization (particularly when drawing from multiple sites), MMORPGs, interactive educational systems, anything that has to scale to support millions/billions of users - now we're still talking serious development skills.  But.... these are more in the area of serious back-end software engineering, GUI design, subject matter expertise (in things ranging from physics engines to script writing), and creative skills.  And... even here, as platforms get more capable, the niches will narrow, and get more competitive. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. No way, no how. I\u2019m the senior developer at a large E-Commerce operation, running four stores on Magento 1.9, soon to be Magento 2. We have easily over 20,000 lines of custom extensions maintained by a team of 3 developers (including myself), my boss, and a 3rd party Magento specialist service. This allows us to run our operation OUR way, which is wholly different from how anybody else will run theirs. If I need to setup a connection to a manufacturer\u2019s API for ordering dropshipped products - as needed - that we don\u2019t keep in our warehouse, no out of the box plugin will do that. It takes custom code for the Soap/Curl request to the manufacturer with the order details, the interface to show our purchasing department that the order went through and has been shipped to the customer, maybe a cronjob to submit all the orders at once, at a time that traffic is low so you don\u2019t harm site speed with extraneous operations and so you can include phone orders stored locally, etc. (real life example, I\u2019ve built three such tools in the last year) Then there\u2019s the templates, the front-end stuff, that is wholly unique to us - just like the web presence of any other large organization- ours get updated every quarter or so for every store. As long as a business has a need to change something to increase or at least maintain their bottom line, web developers will always be in demand. At least at my job, as long as the company exists, we will always have work to do, and junk CMS\u2019s like Squarespace will never provide the level of customization that we need. However, they have made the market a bit tighter if you\u2019re looking to build for Mom & Pop outfits. Very small businesses without the budget to hire a full-time developer need us less now than they used to. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make a buck setting up a Wix site or a quick WordPress store or blog and provide ongoing maintenance and updates, but this prospective client has more options than they used to that seem like a good deal (until they start building). I will say that this is a bit relative, because once upon a time, Mom & Pop outfits just didn\u2019t have a website at all. So just choose your target market carefully. I moonlight for small businesses and it pays a bit, but I like having that guaranteed 9\u20135 to fall back on where I know our team will always be needed. But I could also probably make plenty of cash just working for small to midsize businesses. Somebody will always want to show something unique that a plugin doesn\u2019t provide, or have a need for some custom piece of functionality that is specifically crafted for them. ",
