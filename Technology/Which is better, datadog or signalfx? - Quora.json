            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 for what? DataDog is more mature, has been around longer, has an enterprise sales force, and a larger ecosystem of integrations and customers. However it is also showing it\u2019s age in many ways, which is pretty normal. SignalFx is more powerful, has better feature functions, nicer UI, and is more modern in many ways. The downside is that it is less mature, and newer technology with fewer customers. The best way to pick a tool is to document requirements, and rank your requirements against each company. Remember to include non-functional requirements. You aren\u2019t just buying a technology, you are buying a commercial software solution from another company. ",
