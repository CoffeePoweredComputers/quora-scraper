Global warming and CC (they are one fraud in the same), the universe is expanding and yada yada. Any time any \u201cscientist\u201d comes up with some notion, applies for a grant, receives it, spends YOUR money on \u201cresearch\u201d (at expensive restaurants and high-dollar car dealerships) you should first step back and think about the reality versus the story. Hope this helps, Kat ",

We haven\u2019t tried because nobody has yet come up with an ethically responsible reason for trying it. There is no sign of any change to that in the near future. Genetic engineering has been done on human embryos. The doctor who did it got a three year jail sentence. ",
