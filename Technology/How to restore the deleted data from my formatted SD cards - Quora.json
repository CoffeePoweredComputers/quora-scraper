            "answer_text": "Formatting is a process of preparing a data storage device for use, data storage like a hard disk drive, USB flash drive or memory card, etc. It deletes the existing data and information stored on the SD card and assigns a new file system to the device. When you get a new storage device it is pre-formatted and is ready to use. It also helps to remove any errors related to the Sd card. However, sometimes by mistake, we end up deleting data. Can you restore deleted data from a formatted SD card? Yes. Restoring deleted data from the formatted SD card is possible. The restoration depends on whether or not the SD card has been overwritten.
