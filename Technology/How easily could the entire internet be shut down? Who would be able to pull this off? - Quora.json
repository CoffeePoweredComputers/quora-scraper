To shut down the Internet you need an event that would cause a massive EMP or Electro Magnetic Pulse to cover the entire planet at one time. The INTERNET is NOT one location it is a ton of disassociated computers all over the world. That ALEXA device at your home\u2026 That is part of the Internet. Your Smart TV, Game Boy, refrigerator, your car your cell phone. Anything that connects to the Internet is virtually part of the Internet. An EMP blast wipes out electronics. ",

            "answer_text": "The whole Internet? Probably not possible. However, you could do enough damage to isolate large pieces of it and restrict international traffic. Remember, the Internet is a huge number of ISP, corporate and government networks connected together in a country, and these country-wide networks in turn are connected via fibre and satellite links. So, the whole Internet is actually hundreds of thousands of interconnected networks. To shut the whole thing down you\u2019d need to stop each of them from working. We\u2019re almost talking alien invasion tech - enough EMP blasts to destroy all electronics everywhere. Alternatively, and a bit less dramatic, destroy the cable landing stations or cut the undersea cables in several places to make repair difficult and expensive. You\u2019d need to take out the satellite ground stations as well of course. Once satellite internet becomes a practical proposition, you\u2019d need to take out the satellites, anything upto 12,000 in a single constellation. That\u2019s aliens again I think. Individual governments can shut down their part by closing off or reconfiguring the routers so that they drop international traffic. Russia has just passed a law allowing this, and China has had the ability for a while. But that\u2019s on a country basis. ",
