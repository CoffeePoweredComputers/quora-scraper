            "answer_text": "I love the response given by Thomas R. Jackson elsewhere in this thread\u2026I\u2019ll just add a few points to his excellent summary. When we look at our current roughly $12,000 per capita spend on healthcare, we see a few obvious problems. I don\u2019t care what your politics are, any claim to lowering healthcare cost should be strictly scrutinized and assessed based on economic cost/savings as well as any potential impact to services. There are far too many charlatans with emotional arguments that just don\u2019t add up to actual savings, and in my opinion, these people need to be called out and ignored from the debate. To me, the most egregious and obvious issue is administrative cost - a component of our healthcare spend that\u2019s grown from 5% of spending in 1990 to about 30% of spending today. An administrative cost of 30% suggests America is spending over a trillion dollars a year, just on healthcare administration. Even worse, the rate of increase averages double to triple the rate of inflation, so as bad as the problem is today, it\u2019s getting worse quickly. Statistics reveal that since 2000, we\u2019ve hired more healthcare administrators than doctors and today\u2019s average doctor or nurse spends two hours out of every day dealing with administrative tasks of one kind or another. While the cost of actually performing the medicine grows at somewhat less than the rate of inflation, the cost of administration skyrockets. In fact, if we had a magical way to roll back the clock to 1990 and simply limit administrative cost increases to the rate of inflation, today we\u2019d be spending about $5000 per capita - less than half the actual number. In my opinion, the lion\u2019s share of our excessive healthcare administration cost can be traced directly to government\u2019s regulatory overreach. Compared to 1990, we have several laws that massively increase healthcare regulation: HIPAA, SOX, Obamacare and so forth. Plus, we also have nearly 7,000 bureaucratic regulations that healthcare providers must follow, and each of these regulations has direct or indirect compliance cost. Of course, these administrative costs are split across the private sector and the government bureaucracy, and they show up scattered across a lot of different budgets. The reason I bring up these issues is to encourage all of us to remain skeptical of vague political promises, and to demand detailed explanations of where any promised savings will come from. The claim that insurance companies are less efficient than government, and that government can do most of what the private sector does at lower cost, simply doesn\u2019t pass the laugh test. If you want to make these arguments, back it up with data. The simple truth is that as government\u2019s control of our healthcare spending has increased, costs have skyrocketed and service hasn\u2019t improved. This is the predictable outcome when competition and innovation are replaced by bureaucracy and regulation. Government today controls 67% of every healthcare dollar and it\u2019s given us arguably the world\u2019s least efficient system\u2026only the insane would think that by giving government even greater control, costs will decline. Besides the economics, when you strip back some of the claims out there, we also see some pretty ugly things that aren\u2019t consistent with our traditional American values. A simple example would be the federalism issues in a single-payer system. Today, the individual states all have their own unique frameworks of rules and regulations. In order to achieve a nationalized single-payer system, state and local controls over healthcare need to disappear. Are the states okay to turn over their regulatory process to the Federal government in violation of the Tenth Amendment? Will Texas be comfortable with a Biden administration deciding it has too many hospitals and orders some shut? Will California respect similar orders from a Trump administration? Another more obvious example would be arguments to the effect that single payer systems \u201cnegotiate\u201d better deals from suppliers. To say it bluntly, what\u2019s meant is that we want to use the heavy hand of government and its monopoly power to squeeze concessions out of certain American workers. When government can go to a doctor and say, \u201cyou\u2019ll work for half, otherwise you don\u2019t get paid\u201d, this is an ugly thing indeed - it\u2019s thuggery and tyranny, and certainly not our best values at play. Goals like this ignore that many physician wages haven\u2019t even kept up with inflation in recent decades. In 1990, a physician in family practice earned an average of about $108,000 - that\u2019s about $220,000 in 2020 inflation-adjusted dollars. Yet, in 2020 a physician in family practice earns an average of $215,000\u2026as I said, his wages haven\u2019t even kept up with inflation, and now we want to extract concessions from these folks so politicians can claim victory over a gullible population. Plus, in a more selfish way, if you make healthcare less profitable, a direct result will be less healthcare resources. I mean, there is a reason Boston has more MRI machines than all of Canada. What you really want is the opposite: you want innovation and competition to drive productivity higher and higher, so that the same staff can treat more and more patients at lower prices. The wages of the worker aren\u2019t important - what\u2019s important is the productivity you get for that price. Innovation and competition are the primary tools America has used to drive down cost and improve access to goods and services for the masses. Government-dominated healthcare is the antithesis of innovation and competition, and if we turn over the nation\u2019s healthcare system to government that\u2019s already failed to deliver on one promise after the next, we\u2019re likely just going to get more of the same disappointing results. You might disagree, and I\u2019m fine to have the debate\u2026but that\u2019s the point - let\u2019s get the numbers on the table and have a realistic fact-based discussion about where we are, the value we get from things like the current regulatory state, and then let\u2019s plot a path forward. I\u2019m just an economist - I don\u2019t pretend to have all the answers, but I can tell snake oil from legitimate solutions. You\u2019d think we would have learned this lesson after the last fiasco: \u201cif you like your insurance, you can keep your insurance\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll save the average family $2500 a year on healthcare\u201d. \u201cEverything we do will bend the healthcare cost curve downwards\u201d. When we hear simplistic ideas like \u201cthe insurance companies are greedy\u201d, or \u201cFrance does it better\u201d, we need to look at the details to assess the credibility of those making these claims\u2026if they have great ideas, let them share the details and prove their assertions before we blindly head off on what might be the most massive change in American society in generations.

            "answer_text": "There is little evidence of this being true. Even the biggest champion of single payer healthcare for the US, Senator Sanders, never claimed it would reduce spending. The typical argument for a reduction of healthcare spending with single payer is tgat other countries with single payer systems spend less. But this is the same old correlation is not causation fallacy. Even developed countries with multipayer systems spend less than the US does. And countries that adopted single payer systems in the past did not save money. Every expansion of health care coverage the US has made in the past has increased total healthcare spending. Of course it does. If you increase services, spending goes up. People claim that administrative costs will go down. While US healthcare does have higher than usual admin costs, billing is only one component of those cost. Now hypothetically Congress could simply spend less on health care. But again, historically they show no appetite for that, and that is from both parties. They have even tried putting automatic cuts in place to avoid the political fights. They always over ride them. And being generous with funding is the go to way Congress gets political influence for healthcare reform. I would look at any claims that a nationally administered healthcare system in the US with a freight train\u2019s worth of skepticism. On the other hand, of the three major healthcare financing systems in the US (Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance) Medicaid actually does a really good job. But Medicaid is administered by states, which are required to put their own money on the line as well. Medicaid has very low cost shares, and much more comprehensive coverage than the other two major insurance sectors. Its local administration is much closer to most successful universal healthcare systems. It has great performance metrics. It is the lowest cost way to increase healthcare coverage in the US. Thishas been shown many times. And Medicaid enjoys broad bipartisan support. If you want universal healthcare in the US at the lowest cost (not necessarily reduced cost) to taxpayers then Medicaid is the best way forward. ",
