            "answer_text": "The most used phones in the world\u2026 By brand? Samsung 31%Apple 22%Huawei 10%Xiaomi 7%Oppo 4%[1]By operating system? Android 76%Apple 22%KaiOS 0.42%[2]Disclaimer: there are limits to the free data that is available to us mere mortals. By model? There's a good chance that most, if not all of the ten most used smartphone* models are iPhones. Let's look at the evidence available to us: In 2019 three iPhone models and four Samsung were among the top ten best selling models with two models from Xiaomi and one from OnePlus making up the remainder[3];All of Samsung's top selling models were from their budget J and A series while all iPhones compete with the Samsung S series;All Android phones on the list were 'budget\u2019 phones (with the Xiaomi Redmi 6A being the most budget priced of all);2019\u2019s best selling smartphone, the iPhone XR ($800 CAD), sold more units (26 million) than the second place Samsung A10 ($200 CAD) and third place Samsung A50 ($350 CAD) combined (25 million);The iPhone 8 from 2017 sold enough units in 2019 to take fourth spot;The Xiaomi Redmi 6A ($100 CAD) in fifth place sold only about as many units as Apple's most expensive model, the iPhone XS Max ($1380 CAD to $2000 CAD).According to a Wikipedia page (linked below) the iPhone 6 was the most sold smartphone model ever. Chances are it is still in the top ten or twenty for models in active use today (especially so since it was sold new in some markets as recently as 2018). It was Apple's first larger format screen phone and it was the perfect size for a lot of people. Not as big as the silly (IMNSHO) phablets. Not too small like the earlier iPhone through to iPhone 5s. In terms of usability the 2014 iPhone model still meets the needs of 80% of users today, providing enough speed and camera quality to make it functionally indistinguishable from many of 2019\u2019s budget Android phones. The iPhone 6 even continues to receive security updates after it stopped receiving version upgrades a few months ago when iOS 13 came out. The Samsung S4 was the second most sold smartphone from one year earlier than the iPhone 6 but I highly doubt that those phones continue to be in active use to the same extent as the iPhone 6. They were plastic build with backs that readily popped off. Samsung also abandoned the phone at Android 5 in 2015 unlike Apple who continues to support the one year newer iPhone 6 in 2019. The batteries in the iPhone 6 were not at all hard to replace so that model is cheap to keep going. Why do I expect that most, if not all of the top most used smartphone models are iPhones? iPhones last so much longer than the budget Android phones that also sell in comparable numbers because of (1) build quality, (2) SoC power and (3) software support. A big piece of the puzzle in terms of predicting that a model is not expected to be used long by its manufacturer is the software support. You can be guaranteed that all the top 2019 Samsung and Xiaomi offerings will receive no to one year (i.e. version) of upgrades. Xiaomi disappointed people by not upgrading the 6A to a newer version of Android despite hinting at it earlier. Overall Xiaomi has a decent track record for a low cost, high volume manufacturer. Samsung, OTOH, has a poor track record with its A series phones. It has a bad record even with its most expensive S series so if the S series support is poor how could the budget offering be better? Apple, on the other hand, will support its phones for five to six years after release. This allows iPhones to continue to be used as 'current\u2019 for up to five years longer than the budget Androids that showed up in the top ten listing for 2019.

Huawei has catched up pretty quickly and LG has always been a choice for people. Google, while they are somewhat popular in the USA, they actually don't sell a lot of phones internationally.. most users are in the USA and they only sell as much phones in a year what Apple sells in a week. Also, you have to consider Goggle's only device is the Pixel.. to own the market, you must provide all different levels of smartphones and have it affordable for buyers.. in the USA, we have no problem buying high end phones but in other countries, they don't always get to have that opportunity so their phones may be more underpowered and affordable. In South Korea, they either use Samsung or LG.. and in Japan, I think they use Sony. ",
