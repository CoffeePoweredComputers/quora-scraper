            "answer_text": "India without spirituality. I'll tell you why. Religion makes people dumb and urges to accept things on faith.these are not general facts but the most important part which dictates our morals and duties.you might say but religion is not asking people to do bad things but the contrary.well half glass milk and half glass poison doesnt make a glass of milk but a glass of poison. Moreover it asks people to follow what it says blindly which results in people doing most despicable things in the name of religion.according to stats religious violence is much more than you can imagine than the voilence created by human greed. Religion urges you to give up logic and material things and be involved in praying god and indulging in various activities that are written in their respective scriptures to attain mukthi or enlightenment.i mean what is enlightenment to give up in all worldly things if that is so what else are we supposed to live for\u2026?! God..! By giving up on worldly things you are giving up on life itself.when you are not concerned about worldly things why the hell would you put efforts in bettering human condition and human life style\u2026?! Did anything worth while for human betterment and human evolution ever came from religion if then why do you need to pursue science and other stuff.you can sit in one place and keep chanting whatever thats written in your books. Its through science and reason human condition can be developed and improved.if you are teaching people to dispice human comfort,happiness,excitement then how do you expect people to put the work in to improve life on this planet and put efforts to understand this world. Regressive ways will not lead to human evolution and happiness. Thanx ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. It's very good that you are thinking about this. India with spirituality of course. Not only India, but any nation without spirituality is meaningless. Well if you think spirituality is following a certain religion or following a certain belief or say worshipping god then you are wrong. Spirituality is something more than that. We as humans are gifted to have some moral values or you can say certain virtues which make us more human. Spirituality adds a meaning to our life and the purpose of why we are living. Life is a precious gift to us with added consciousness being unique to humans. Spirituality means knowing ourselves and how our life add meaning to this world or maybe life of others living. A search for our connection with the universe. So just earning money or living your dream job doesn't make you satisfied at the end of the day. What matters is whether we have found the purpose of our life and have we done anything meaningful with it. Otherwise we are just like other creatures or robots and India is only a piece of land. Thank you ",
