            "answer_text": "The only type of person you need to be is one with curiosity who is ready to reexamine some of your basic concepts.  The latter means that you can't learn physics through memorization alone.  If you like to play with ideas, you're in great shape for learning physics.  Don't treat physics as a branch of mathematics.  That would keep you from learning the concepts that are the foundations of the different areas of physics.  Once you have a sense of the concepts, applying math in mindful ways can take you deeper, but you won't find meaning in math alone. Perseverance is possibly the most important skill you will need.  This involves some ability to delay gratification as you work through challenges.  Of course, if you enjoy being intellectually challenged, you never need to delay gratification.  The journey toward understanding can be as enjoyable as getting there. ",
