            "answer_text": "Q: Which internet based video conferencing system is the most secure? A: Apple FaceTime is the only one that actually is secure All the others have been shown to be insecure and most of them have advertised that they had great security while at the same exact time they had serious security issues that were not simply a small mistake, they were actually deployed in an insecure mannerApple FaceTime is so secure that the FBI actually complained that even with the help of the NSA/CIA that they cannot penetrate Apple (FaceTime/iMessage/Messages) technology, and that they did not need any help penetrating all other technologiesApple is the only provably secure internet based video conferencing systemAdditional Information:I have written about this before so I will quote myself here:There are viruses, and hacker attacks, written for the Mac, iPhones and iPads, they do exist but Apple is successful at deflecting them because Apple expends a huge effort in keeping their customers safe, protecting customer privacy via an effective multi layer defense system built into many layers of the operating system (which deflects viruses, hackers and other malware). There is no other OS with anywhere near the protection level that Apple provides. That is why you don\u2019t see any active viruses or other hacks on Mac, iPhones or iPads, regardless of how many new strains are made. FBI Director Comey testified before United States Congress that the FBI, with the help of the other government agencies, cannot hack into iPhones, which also means that there is no way to bypass the Activation Lock/iCloud Lock, at all. He also testified that the FBI can hack all other operating systems and products, regardless of marketing claims. Companies like Cellebrite make false claims about being able to break into iPhones, the fact is that they cannot hack any iPhone that has the Secure Enclave chip, the same is true of the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office who has a million dollar hacking lab, they also can only hack (All) Androids they cannot hack any iPhone that has the Secure Enclave chip in it. This is why the FBI is continuously harassing Apple to install a backdoor in to iPhones, which Apple always refuses because Apple is the only high tech company that is actually dedicated to protecting your privacy. Apple responds very quickly to new virus threats, automatically updating all Mac, iPhone and iPad users around the world immediately and invisibly. If you have Automatic Updates\u201d turned on (which is the normal setting for all users), then you will receive updated virus protection, invisibly, the same day that Apple releases it. This is why there is no *Active* virus/malware in the Apple community, so there is nothing to worry about. Apple protects iCloud since has been offering online services since 1986, so Apple has many decades of experience securing online accounts. Apple also avoids hardware exploits in Intel\u2019s CPU (which have multiple security flaws) with the implementation of Apple\u2019s own Secure Enclave, T1, T2, etc. chips that boot completely securely, regardless of all the flaws in Intel\u2019s CPUs. Apple expends a great deal of effort to make its operating systems (macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, audioOS, etc.) secure, safe and private by implementing defenses in many layers of its core OS, which includes but is not limited to: XProtectYara (so you can even add your own rules)GatekeeperSystem Integrity Protection (SIP)Malware Removal Tool (MRT)Core SuggestionsIncompatible Kernel Extensions (KEXT Exclusions)Application Firewall (cannot be disabled)pf Firewall (BSD firewall, optional)FileVault (high grade encryption of all your data)Chinese Word List (SCIM)Core LSKD (kdrl)Flask Security Architecture for flexible mandatory access controlFile quarantineDeactivation of TPM (where applicable) on a hardware levelSafari Fraudulent Sites protectioneficheckMessages (the only text app that is actually secure)iCloud Lock (in addition to Passcode Lock)Protection against \u201cJuice Jacking\u201dApp Store scrutinizes all apps for privacy & security far better than all others in the worldT2 OnwardsPasswords are hashed then the hash is stored in an inaccessible hardware encryption chip (T2 and Secure Enclave chip onwards)Cryptographic BootiPhoneiPadMacSecure Enclave (T2, etc.) chipIs isolated so even if a host device is compromised the Secure Enclave remains secureProvides hardware control of FaceTime cameraFIPS 140-2/-3 Conformance Validation Certificate2018 onwards FIPS 140-2 Security Level 12019 onwards FIPS 140-2 Security Level 2FIPS 140-2/-3 Security Level 3 in newer productsmacOS Mojave onwardCamera or microphone access requires user consent prompt (all but the oldest Macs have the webcam hard wired to the green indicator light so the camera cannot be on unless the green light is on); there is also a, physical disconnect that cuts the physical connection when the lid is loweredMoving or reading files in the Trash (by an app) require user consentPlug-in unapproved list, Safari extension unapproved listmacOS Catalina onwardNotarizationMandatory app code signingSystem Extensions (replacing kernel extensions)System files are stored in a separate read-only partitionEndpoint Security frameworkGatekeeper enhanced with random validation checksGatekeeper now requires a User Prompt and approval for changes (anti-ransomware protection)Camera access, microphone access, screen recording or keyboard input monitoring requires user consent prompt (all but the oldest Macs have the webcam hard wired to the green indicator light so the ca cannot be on unless the green light is on)Downloads require user consent prompting for each domainLocked out ROOT account (not even Admin has access to ROOT)Security & Privacy preference panelAccess control settings permissions for functions like Screen Recording, accessing Files and Folders, Input Monitoring, and Speech Recognition.Activation Lock (like on iPad and iPhone)T2 Security Chip-enabled Macs become nothing more than a brick until the proper credentials are verified, to unlock itApple led the industry to require that Safari only accept digital certificates that are not more than 13 months oldAddress space layout randomization (ASLR)Apple statement on privacy/security: \u201cEvery Apple device combines hardware, software, and services designed to work together for maximum security and a transparent user experience in service of the ultimate goal of keeping personal information safe \u2026 Apple is committed to helping protect customers with leading privacy and security technologies\u2014 designed to safeguard personal information\u2014and comprehensive methods\u2014to help protect corporate data in an enterprise environment.

            "answer_text": "Security is a joke, nothing on the Internet is very secure. However when it comes to video conferencing, I believe simplicity and ease of use trumps all other considerations, therefore I vote for anything based on the WebRTC protocol which is supported/built in all major Browsers. My favorite is WHEREBY.COM. To create a free Video chat room, just type WHEREBY.COM/??ROOMNAME?? and give it to your friends. (Text chat and screen sharing is also supported). ",
