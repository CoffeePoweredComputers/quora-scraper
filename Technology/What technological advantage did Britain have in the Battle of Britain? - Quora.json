            "answer_text": "The RAF had some technical and some organisational advantages The Dowding system of early warning. Radar to spot raids developing, area controllers to move the pieces, bring squadrons up to readiness and warn of attacks, the observer corps who manually spotted aircraft and could identify types and add to the information from the radar operators. Sophisticated control rooms where raids were followed on large maps and squadrons reported their readiness and damages. A good system for rotating pilots and replacing them. The Germans kept their best pilots in action effectively until they were killed, the UK promoted theirs and used them to train new ones Emergency airfields so if a major base was put out of action maintenance and repair crews and pilots could swiftly move to a satellite airfield and keep operating Fighting over home territory so pilots who bailed out were quickly able to get a new plane and carry on fighting Improved aircraft production - the British outproduced the Germans and so the RAF was stronger at the end of the Battle than the beginning, while the Germans lost many of their best pilots and hundreds of aircraft that they could not replace quickly enough. There was also a very efficient RAF system of collecting damaged aircraft and repairing them 100 octane fuel - (thank you America) - 100 octane fuel developed by US oil scientists gave a noticeable boost to the performance of the Merlin engine used in the Spitfire and Hurricane. This edge may well have been a critical factor as the Spitfire and ME-109 were pretty close in performance. It is quite likely that the Luftwaffe was a little cocky and over-confident at the beginning as they had had a pretty good run up to the Battle of Britain and were caught out when the RAF at home turned out to be a lot tougher than they expected. Dowding had refused Churchill\u2019s request (order?) to send Spitfire squadrons to France, so the Battle of Britain was the first time the ME-109 met an equal. Herman Goering, like Hitler, one of the best Generals the allies had. It was Goering who ordered the fighters to stay with the bombers rather than range ahead to take on the fighters, this put the ME-109 pilots at a disadvantage as the attackers could simply go straight in without worrying about getting through a fighter screen first. Whereas we had Hugh Dowding and Keith Park. Keith Park - Wikipedia Hugh Dowding - Wikipedia Who Helped Win Battle of Britain ",

            "answer_text": "The main technological advantage was the integrated air defence network that cast a protective screen along the channel coast. Combining radar with a network of human observers, the system chanelled all information to Fighter Command\u2019s air operations centre. This gave crucial minutes of warning to scramble interceptors that wrought havoc among the incoming bombers. It enabled Fighter Command to marshall their limited resources with maximum efficiency, directing squadrons to the areas of greatest threat, and obviating their scatter-gun dispersal to cover the entire front. Without it, Britain would have suffered even more grievous loss of life and infrastructure vital to the national defence. Moreover, the Luftwaffe was stymied by the fierce resistance and often forced to evasive measures that limited their bombing accuracy and required greater fuel burn limiting their time over target. The Germans also had radar: however, in 1940, it wasn't organized in the comprehensive, highly integrated command and control system designed by Fighter Command. They weren't thinking defensively in their euphoria after their conquest of Western Europe. They were still in the midst of organizing their occupation forces and priority had to be given to such operations. They were a year and more behind Britain in the development of an integrated air defence system. In fact, they improved greatly through 1941/3 but this had no bearing on the Battle of Britain. ",

Fighting over your own soil is a major advantage also\u2026 You can get there quicker and if you get shot down and are not hurt, you just get another plane. ",
