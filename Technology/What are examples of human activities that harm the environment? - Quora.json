            "answer_text": "Harm, that seems rather judgmental. All human activities in some way impact the environment humans inhabit. So everything changes the environment. Which then everything could be harmful to it, subjectively. Which means that answer depends on what an observer believes is harmful to an environment. It\u2019s not an absolute, because it\u2019s an opinion. Perhaps a well thought rationally concluded opinion based upon reasons. But for example, if you are ice skating what is desired is usually different than if you are sun bathing. Or if rather than the environment in general, specific things about a given endeavor. If you are ice skating you would need your pool frozen over, but if you are relaxing in the water you\u2019d want it pretty warm, which either can get very expensive if you have a large pool. Which of course, a deep pool would be terrible for freezing most or all of, and likely too small, you\u2019d want a larger area and maybe an inch or two deep, and if you cooled it from below you could keep the air warmer, and of course for skating there is friction and such so the air temperature doesn\u2019t necessarily matter as much as how you\u2019re freezing the water. And for the heating water to relax in a pool, no, you\u2019d want a smaller something like a hot tub, which of course given the energy it takes to heat water, you would want it directly heated, but not with fire of course; can you imagine a large bathtub on top of a giant stove? Like the butter found out, it\u2019s not nice to fool mother nature. Objectively on the other hand, the planet isn\u2019t alive, doesn\u2019t think or feel, and thus nothing we do or can do harms it in any way. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh god, there are so many. I\u2019ll just pick some random ones out of a hat, since I don\u2019t have the rest of my life to explain (and plus, lunch is in like 20 minutes and I\u2019m [not literally] starving.) If you want any of them elaborated on, just ask about them specifically (it may take me a day to get around to replying.) Farming (primarily monoculture) severely imbalances ecosystems and concentrates toxins and pests up to destructive scales.Materialism (especially planned obsolescence consumerism) drives us to want many many cheap things rather than a few high quality long lasting things, which dramatically increases mining and harvesting of world resources that are dwindling.Mining (see the last one) at large scale destroys ecosystems and releases toxic sunstances into the air and water (and thus into our lungs and food supply.)Traveling (car, plane, etc) and shipping (semis, boats, planes, etc), which each requires vast and ecosystem-wrecking infrastructures to first be built and then incessantly used (which consume vast quantities of atmosphere-and-water-table-altering chemicals.)Each of these could be subdivided into thousands of more specific cases and, yeah, I know \u2018you just described human civilization itself.\u2019 I know. But it\u2019s literally self-destructing and we really need to learn new ways of doing things to pare it back to the point where we (and everything else) can survive. It\u2019s no small task, but it does mean many generations of 100% employment, at least\u2026 ",
