            "answer_text": "Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America is an amazing research and development facility dedicated to the aforementioned automotive electronics (Although all automobile companies have such facilities, my favourite is this one and thus I'm mentioning it here in order for readers to understand what my answer truly refers to. I suggest you have a look at Tesla Motors too). Basically, these are systems which tend to enhance and improve the user experience and the relation that exists between us human beings and our cars. They can either be related to the functioning of the vehicle(engine electronics, transmission electronics, chassis electronics etc) or can be focused on the utility of the car(infotainment systems, connectivity, driver assistance etc). There are loads of examples of such electronics since automobiles today are largely enhanced by the level of technology they possess. However, to highlight a few, here goes:1. ABS(Anti-lock braking system), EBD(Electronic Brake Distribution) and TCS (Traction Control System) concerned with the safety of the car(chassis electronics).2.Blind spot detection, automated parking, lane change assist(Driver assistance systems)3.Navigation systems, theater and audio, heads-up displays(infotainment) With all the advancements in technology, there is a long time before a saturation point is reached in the field of automotive electronics.

            "answer_text": "Traffic sign recognition systems, driver monitoring system, are some of the affordable ADAS system used in modern vehicles. For large scale adoption of the safety system, New Car Assessment Program in China and Europe is mandating Lane Departure Warning and Automatic Emergency Braking. Also, the increasing use of safety systems in vehicles is expected to drive demand for ADAS in future. Asia Pacific being the fastest and largest growing automobile market accounts for the majority of the global market and is expected to drive market growth owing to the increasing demand for low-cost vehicles, superior quality, and customized vehicles. C-NCAP\u2019s safety assessment promoted by Government of China encourages buyers to see five-star rating as a guide top vehicles quality. ",
