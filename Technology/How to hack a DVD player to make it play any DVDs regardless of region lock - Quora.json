            "answer_text": "Only some brands of standalone DVD players allow a hack. Typically the minor brands. The procedure varies according to the model and brand of the remote. There are three variations of the exact procedure. They are roughly Enter a multi digit code from the remote control when in a specific mode Use a specially constructed DVD disk Enter a special mode using keys not normally found on the remote. Sometimes found by opening the remote up and access a key not brought out to the remote front panel or by using a universal remote.
