            "answer_text": "OPOQ: Is it possible to tell what kind of photo technology was used to take this picture? Yes. It was taken on black and white film using a camera. Probably 35mm ( although the photo has been cropped ). Most probably a Leica, As the only photo I have seen of the photographer , Eric Koch, is one of him holding a camera, which looks like a Leica.. That is all that is possible to tell from the info we have. Nothing can be worked out from the image itself. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely on film, but the camera is pretty well impossible to identify because of the lack of EXIF data. There are 18 copies of it on Google image search mostly on Wikipedia in various languages. The Wiki article appears to be written by Eric Koch, but the photographer is not credited. It is just faintly possible he took it himself. The image is held in the Dutch National Archive. ",
