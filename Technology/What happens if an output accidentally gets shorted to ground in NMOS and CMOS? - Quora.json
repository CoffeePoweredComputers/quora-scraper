            "answer_text": "Most current designs for logic are designed to withstand indefinite shorts to ground or its supply rails regardless of output state. I know for a fact that analog op-amp outputs can generally withstand indefinite shorts to ground, but that if driven to one rail and shorted to the other they will most often fail. I.e. a large positive signal and the output shorted to the negative supply rail, will usually result in destruction. I have used op amps in a differential drive configuration to get higher output voltages in a balanced output and had people short the differential outputs together and kill the op amp. ",
