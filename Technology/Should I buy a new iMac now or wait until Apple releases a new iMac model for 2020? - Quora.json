            "answer_text": "That is the perennial question. I think only you can answer that. Do you have a task that you perform on your old system that is substantially hampered because of its age? If so, then waiting is costing you time, a very precious resource. On the other hand, since you\u2019re asking the question, you probably feel that you can \u201cmake do\u201d until the new ones come out. Another thing to keep in mind, is that it\u2019s liable to be a longer wait than you initially anticipated, due to COVID-19. All I can say is that I\u2019ve always had that concern, but I\u2019ve never regretted making the purchase after the fact. One rule I\u2019ve found though. If Leo Laporte has just bought one, definitely wait. It won\u2019t be long. He has such a skill for buying a Mac 1\u20132 weeks before an update is that I\u2019ve heard people call it \u201cbeing Laported.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. There are strong rumors Apple may introduce a new iMac at their next event, which might be as soon as the end of March 2020. I would wait until at least then. After that, the decision really has to be yours, since no stranger on Quora knows your wants, needs, or budget better than you. I will tell you the same thing I tell my clients, however: Apple will always be coming out with something new. Always. If you are happy with what you have, keep it and wait for the next release. When that comes out, if you are still happy with what you have, keep it and wait for the release after that. Keep doing that until you are no longer happy with what you have, then buy the new model.
