            "answer_text": "I don't have a straight answer for you, but I do offer you this bit of weirdness. I use a Macbook Pro with 13\" retina display. Recently I was doing some audio editing in Audacity and when it came time to export and send it back to iMovie, the export dialog wouldn't let me click on the file format menu, meaning I basically had to output it to WAV because that was the default option. Came to find out, it was a glitch in WxWindows (the GUI toolkit Audacity uses), which doesn't properly support the Retina display on OS X. The solution was easy enough -- run it backwards through Retinizer so it renders in its original resolution -- but deretinized apps are rather hard on the eyes because the display isn't designed to anti-alias pixels in groups of 2x2. This will obviously not be a problem with any native Apple app, so if you're using GarageBand or Logic for sound processing, you're good to go. However, if you prefer FOSS solutions for that sort of thing, you may hit a few snags like that, depending on the toolkit used. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on two things: your budget, and what you intend to do most on the machine. From a budget standpoint, I always tell my customers to buy the biggest configuration they can afford. What I mean by that is the most hard drive space, the most RAM, and the most processor speed. Doing this essentially means you can easily get 3-5 years use out of the machine before Apple's yearly updates start making the machine feel of date. But you may not need a Retina iMac unless super smooth graphics are vital for what you intend to do (whether that is graphic work or playing games). Ultimately, only you can make the decision if Retina is that important to you. I have the most expensive iMac you can get without Retina and use it several hours each day. I don't seem to miss Retina at all, but then again, I don't do a lot of graphics work, or play games.  In terms of watching Neflix (or similar services), Retina displays aren't going to do anything for you as they provide more screen resolution than those services currently provide. But that will change in the next couple of years, so if you need something to tip you in favor of a Retina display, that might be it. ",
