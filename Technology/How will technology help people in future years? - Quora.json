            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! Technology is amazing. Technology is the fundamental field that has evolved us much faster than nature could\u2019ve done. From tools like spears and axes to ships to trains to aeroplanes to the Internet. It has helped us over the thousands of years and will continue to do so.  Technology in the future will help us create: Very efficient solar panels allowing us to get rid of these horrible fossil fuels. A virtual augmented reality classroom so people across the world can follow classes, even in the poor areas. But this virtual world can also make lessons more interesting by creating an experience using animation.Body parts whether it\u2019s made using robotics or biologically grown, in the future a missing limb or kidney will be no longer. Transportation systems. Travelling is expensive and consumes a lot of time. Most likely we will be able to travel between continents within 2 or 3 hours.Advanced spacetech. In the future planets like Mars and Venus can be our backyards if we continue to improve spacetech. Artificial Intelligence causing an intelligence explosion so our knowledge expands massively for even more inventions.Smart cities. These smart cities will optimize our living experience in a city by adding technology everywhere.  I could continue this list for a long time. This is why I love technology. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology if I can say is the foundation of the today today\u2019s civilization. Technology enable people to do things they can\u2019t. For education, maybe in the near future people do not need to attend class physically. With AR and VR technology student and teacher can attend class from everywhere in the secure digital classroom. People also won\u2019t need to travel across country anymore for short business meeting, it can help advancing the economy. Today\u2019s internet of things are changing how industry works. More efficient and precision goods and product can be produce with lower price. Today\u2019s industry have less people operating its factory but with higher skill, knowledge and competencies. ",
