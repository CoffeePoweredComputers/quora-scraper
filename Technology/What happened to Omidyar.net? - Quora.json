            "answer_text": "I was there. The software was really unwieldy. There were SO many suggestions of how to improve it and it was just one of those \"needs to be remade from scratch\" kinds of plone instantiations. Also the reputation system was a mess - it was ambitious but it was not really working right (the reasons overlap the same fundamental easons Quora has challenges, actually).  The community did not entirely disintegrate; there are a lot of people who hung together on fb and twitter. There was an attempt to instantiate it elsewhere, but that didn't work. There are occasional meetups for some people. Norbert Mayer-Wittmann was also there and deeply enmeshed in trying to get it worked out rather than shut down. We were able to download our work. It was about as systematic a shut down as was possible - grew victim of its success, really. ",

            "answer_text": "The publicly accessible Omidyar Network was closed for reasons to speculate.  I only understand it did not meet their expectations. I do consider it was a  great public service. As for Public and social good.  The org happens to be one of the stronger supporters of open source software and non-profit supporting efforts around. In many cases I am aware they fund efforts without attribution on request.  We are substantially fortunate they are behind the scenes making the world better for many, including the Internet.  If 1 in 5 investments happens to be a Resort, I see nothing wrong with that. Self sustaining public good and foundations are valuable, just like Hughs, Kaufman, Gates and numerous others. ",
