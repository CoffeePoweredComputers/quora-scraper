Although blockchain is a revolutionary technology in itself but to compete something like PayPal, first thing is to develop alternatives to what PayPal already have in such a way that it overcomes all the problems which PayPal is not able to solve yet. It is well-known that PayPal has became necessity to many people but all are not happy with the PayPal but ultimately they have use it. If someone could build application over blockchain for better money transfer, payment solution keeping in mind all the current problems and giving value to people, then that could challenge PayPal. \u201cIt is said that if something goes up it has to come down\u201d Blockchain & it\u2019s application has the potential to put PayPal out of business.

            "answer_text": "Blockchain is a technology that works on a distributed ledger model which records every transaction and maintains the chronology and authenticity of information on a secure global network which is tamper-proof. The technology allows transacting parties to interact seamlessly, eliminating record keeping activities. Several organizations are utilizing this technology for a possibility transforming Banking, Financial services and F&A operations similar to the ways the internet had revolutionized knowledge sharing and collaboration. PayPal will have to embrace the newer technologies to stay relevant and leader in the market; and is testing waters. A hackathon was conducted in December to understand how PayPal can utilize bitcoin and blockchain technology. In my opinion, PayPal\u2019s slightest interest in bitcoin and blockchain technology will support bitcoin growth. ",
