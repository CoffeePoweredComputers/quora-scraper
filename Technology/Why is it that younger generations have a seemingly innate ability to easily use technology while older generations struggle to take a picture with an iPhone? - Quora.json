            "answer_text": "I, too, puzzled over this same issue for quite a while until I realized that I tend to be a \u201clogical approach\u201d type person. If something can be solved using the logical approach, I will \u201chang in there\u201d until I finally succeed. I learned Calculus I, Statistics I & II only after I could see the logic. I was a mechanic in the old days when cars had many more problems, the solutions which sometimes seemed to defy logic. But knowing there was a logical solution (no digital devices and no software,) I persevered. I really enjoyed the sense of triumph when I finally resolved mechanical problems that sometimes other people could not understand. When I was in the military, I had other people sometimes ask me to help them troubleshoot a problem. I found some very interesting causes of problems with vehicles. I became fairly good at solving problems in other areas. I used to say, \u201cWhen someone told me \u2018there is no solution,\u2019 to a problem that was music to my ears and an exciting challenge. All that having been said, my answer to this question has a lot to do with sloppy UI. When I asked younger people how they were solving user interface issues on digital devices, they gave me very elusive, vague answers. I used to think they were being arrogant because they were closely guarding their secret knowledge; they wanted to appear superior to the older folks. After many years floundering around trying to use programs and digital devices, I finally realized that when dealing with sloppy UI (and there is quite a bit out there) the interface is basically a guessing game. Anyone (including little kids) randomly pushing buttons can easily outperform some of us, including me, who are using the logical approach. This sloppy UI can be found on all things digital (software programs, printers, calculators, cell phones, computers, microwaves, remote controls, etc.). By the way, have you ever heard a \u201ctech-savvy\u201d person tell you that he is just randomly pushed buttons; they themselves may not understand the reason why they are so \u201ctech-savvy.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "As mentioned, you\u2019re conditioned. As for me personally, I\u2019ve thought of this backwards. Thanks to a quora question a while back .. \u201cwhat would you do if you woke up in your 18 year old body?\u201d (I presumed this meant waking up in 1982 with my current mind in my 18 year old body) Well, that provoked lots and lots of fun thoughts. Then, a horrifying thought ran thru my mind \u2026 WAIT!!! WHERE DID MY 18 YEAR OLD MIND GO??? Ohhhh ffffffuu\u2026!!!! NO! NO! NO! NOOOO!!!! So I spent the next few days wondering how my 18 year old brain would ruin my perfectly just fine 56 year old life. Oh God, my savings, my home equity, credit cards, motorcycles ,,, and holy shi.. please don\u2019t find my private pilot certificate! And FFS, take a leave of absence from work!! PLEASE GOD, DO NOT LET HIM GO TO WORK. Hopefully he\u2019ll ask my wife where I work and she\u2019ll have me/him committed, thinking I\u2019ve gone off the deep end. Then I thought, well, my 18 year old brain wont be able to get into my phone or computer, and even if he could, he\u2019d have no clue where to find anything. He\u2019d find about $50 in my wallet. Oh, and the credit cards. Well, he\u2019ll look kind of silly handing the clerk a credit card so they could slide it thru the imprint machine. But with some help, maybe he\u2019ll figure out that chip thing. My 56 year old self is well past setting up open source Unix file servers, Apache web servers and MySQL databases in my house, just for the fun of it. But my 18 year old self never even heard of that stuff. There\u2019s hope! But Im thinking all is safe. My 18 year old mind will be occupied the whole time trying to figure out how to take a picture with my iPhone. He\u2019ll *love* my guitars and amps, maybe that\u2019ll keep him occupied and out of trouble. But when I get back, I will be very afraid to look in my photos. ",
