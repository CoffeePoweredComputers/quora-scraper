            "answer_text": "Well, unless battery technology improves or unless you can get cheap battery replacements, it's a fact that most people will want to upgrade their phone every 2 years. You see, Li-ion batteries have limited charge-discharge cycles. The way that most people abuse their batteries (by fully charging them and fully discharging them), the battery will last for 2 years, maximum. After that, you'll notice that your battery starts getting depleted much faster\u2014 that's because you're starting to max out your charge-discharge cycles. Apple iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones both have pretty fair solutions to this problem that should enable you to keep your phone for longer than 2 years: Apple recently started offering free battery replacements for iPhones that have maxed out their battery charge-discharge cycles (provided you have warranty or AppleCare+), so iPhone users shouldn't have to upgrade their phones every 2 years.Best Buy also has a very similar repair program for Samsung Galaxy devices\u2014 so you should be fine there as well.As for other phones, you can always go to third-party repair shops for battery replacements, but they're not guarantees, and the price can fluctuate pretty heavily depending on the store. For some cheaper phones, it might not be worth the repair, and getting a new phone might be better. And of course, if you know how to repair your own phone, you can always do that\u2014 but let's be honest, most people don't know how, and don't care to learn how, even though it's a fairly simple skill. Now, can you make batteries last longer if you take care of them? Sure\u2014 but it requires much more attention to how you use your phone. Drop the fast chargers; they're convenient, but they wear your battery out faster. Only use trickle chargers or wireless chargers (when available).Don't fully charge your battery. Having 80% or higher charge puts strain on your battery, and wears it out faster.Don't fully drain your battery. Dipping below 20% also accelerates wear on the battery.Charge in increments; never leave your phone on the charger for hours on end. Charge it up 5%, then take it off the charger. Wait some time, then charge it up 5% more. Wait some time, then continue.Yes, I realize how ridiculously tedious and unrealistic this sounds. But if you really want to extend battery lifespan to 4\u20135 years, this is the way to do it. Otherwise, you'll need battery replacements every 2 years. And if you don't want to do that, then it's upgrading your entire phone every 2 years.  Now, this question asks about what I do. Here's the thing\u2014 I'm not your average tech consumer. I buy a lot of the latest tech because I'm an enthusiast; this is my hobby. So I often upgrade my phone every year. For most people, this is a huge waste of money. Don't do it unless you're like me.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t feel the need to upgrade my smartphone every two years. I upgrade them when they no longer receive updates from their manufactures. I will often buy smartphones and test them and then give them away to family members though. My iPhone 5s is still a daily driver for me and I bought it in 2013. It just recently stopped being supported from Apple. It got 6 years of support and has been a loyal and reliable smartphone. It will soon be delegated to other tasks like being my interface to my TV for apps such as HBO, Ruutu, YLE, MTV3, and so on as I hook it up to my TV with the HDMI cable and a HDMI to lightning adaptor. My original iPad mini did that role well and it stopped on iOS 9 yet its apps still also get updated. Some haven't but then it is 4 iOS versions out from the current one ( was bought in 2012). Android phones on the other hand have not had a great history with after support from their manufactures and they wont be used as long. However recently they have gotten better. With the Android One program they get 2 years or os updates and 3 years security updates. My Nokia 3.1 I bought over a year ago (summer 2018) will be getting Android 10 and then another year after that of security updates (into 2021), it started on Android 8 when I got it. So not bad at all. That I may be keeping for three years or so. For a 150\u20ac smartphone when I bought it that is great support. If other Android manufactures could do that type of after support instead of pumping out 50+ different models a year and supporting only a few of them beyond a year or two then things would be much better for them. I know about flashing ROMs, I have done it since 2010. The point is I shouldn't have to just to get an updated os version or to take off bloatware that gets put on some of them. ",
