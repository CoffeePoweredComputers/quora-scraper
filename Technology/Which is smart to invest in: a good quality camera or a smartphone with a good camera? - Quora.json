Unless you are not a professional photographer and want a camera just for the hobby needs, I thin carrying a good smartphone with powerful camera is lot better. And now you do not need to invest much in getting a powerful smartphone camera. In fact, smartphones like Oppo Reno3 Pro and Realme X2 Pro have brought really good cameras and you can get them under 30k. The advantage of smartphone is that you can carry it in your pockets and it is more portable than a dedicated camera. For a camera to carry, you need to be really responsible or have a big heart to lose a huge some of money at once. My personal favorite among these smartphones is Oppo Reno3 Pro which has the newly launched MediaTek helio P95 processor in it. Though the MediaTek processor makes it good enough for all kinds of tasks, the quad rear camera and the dual selfie camera in the smartphone is amazing. Especially, the dual selfie camera takes really good images and I suggest it to everybody who is looking for a good flagship. So first of all, for a hobbyist, a smartphone camera is good enough and secondly, Oppo reno3 Pro with its powerful camera is a really good option.  ",
