            "answer_text": "The Soviet Union made the most powerful nuclear weapon ever tested \u2014 the 50 megaton \u201cTsar Bomba\u201d. But the size, challenge of production, and lack of deployability made it impractical (if you can even truly call any nuclear weapon \u201cpractical\u201d). Does that mean Russia has the most powerful nuclear weapons now? Not necessarily. Yield limits were introduced in nuclear arms treaties and current deployed weapons probably max out around 2.5 megatons, with many or perhaps most in limited arsenals ranging in the kilotons. Quantity matters too, as the combined yield of an all out war is more powerful than one bomb or type of bomb. Russia and the US are by far the top arsenal holders with around 6000 warheads each, though around 1500 are actually deployed per nation. The US has historically produced the most warheads by far, but with Russia also in the tens of thousands, quantity begins to mean nothing when there were enough warheads to vaporize every city and town on Earth . Perhaps what could classify the most powerful arsenal is capability. The US and Russia both have ballistic missiles with global striking range, launched from undergound silos and intermediate range missiles from submarines, and shorter ranges from aircraft and mobile ground launchers. They\u2019ve developed small \u201ctactical\u201d low yield nuclear weapons for battlefield use, too \u2014 even ones that fire from artillery. It\u2019s even possible that secret space programs led to satellite-based platforms, though there\u2019s no direct evidence to support the theory. So both nations posses nearly equal total power in terms of quantity, yield, and deployment. I would suggest that ultimately, the US has the most powerful arsenal in that they have been able to invest more in upgrading, maintaining, as well as high-tech guidance and targeting. The US also has more global deployability from the combined superiority of airbases, aircraft carriers, and subs. That, coupled with greater investment in anti-ballistic missile technology to \u201cshield\u201d targets and destroy warheads in-flight, probably gives the US the overall upperhand. Let\u2019s hope this terrible technology is never deployed, though, and that we survive through the end of global nuclear disarmament. ",

            "answer_text": "The best nuclear weapon is the one launched from submarine. Because it's hidden, it's under the sea, constantly on the move and you never know where it might show up next. So neutralizing the submarine would not be an easy job for the enemy. And in that context too, best is a very relative term, the \u201cbest' for one navy might not suit the preferences of another. Furthermore, nuclear submarine is a very generalized term, since it would include (SSBN) Ballistic Missile submarine and (SSN) nuclear powered general purpose attack submarine. A very exclusive consortium of nations operate nuclear ballistic missile submarine, to enumerate they are, USA, Russia, China, UK, France, India, North Korea. That's only 7 nations on the face of the planet. That being said, If I had to pick my Doomsday weapon of choice. Then it Would be without a doubt the Russian Borei-II class. Borei Class is a Russian fourth-generation nuclear-powered missile submarine. It is intended to eventually replace the ageing Delta III and Typhoon Class submarines and become an important deterrent for the Russian Navy.

It is intended to eventually replace the ageing Delta III and Typhoon Class submarines and become an important deterrent for the Russian Navy. It is the first class of submarines developed by Russia since the soviet era. Designated Project 935, it began in 1996 to manufacture the first unit of the Borei Class submarine. The project name was changed to Project 955 and the submarine was redesigned to accommodate the new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) Bulava (SS-NX-30), in place of the abandoned R-39UTTH Bark missile. Currently Yury Dolgoruky, Alexander Nevsky, Vladimir Monomakh and Knyaz Vladimir are the four submarines ordered under this project. These vessels were designed by Rubin Marine Equipment Design Bureau and built by Northern Machine Building Enterprise (Sevmash shipyard). Russia has plans to build eight Borei Class submarines for its naval fleet by 2020. Development of the Yury Dolgoruky vessel The first in the class of the submarines is the Yury Dolgoruky vessel. The total cost of the submarine is $713m, including aresearch and development expenditure of $280m. Project 955A, the higher version of Project 955, will build the Knyaz Vladimir and other follow-up submarines. This programme involves the construction of new submarines with various improvements and different hull shapes. Construction of the Borei Class submarines \u201cIt is the first class of submarines developed by Russia since the soviet era.\u201d The first submarine, Yury Dolgoruky, was laid down in November 1996. She was launched in February 2008 and began her sea trials in June 2009. The ship was formally inducted into the Russian Navy in January 2013.  (RMS-56 Bulava) ",
