We keep an eye out for the platforms and tools pushing against the barriers in application development, mobile, cloud computing, and in other corners of information technology, and we bring them in for review. At the end of the year, we get together and decide which are the very best. The Dell PowerEdge R730xd, brings together so much flash, disk, and elegance, it makes an ideal platform for software-defined storage solutions such as VMware's remarkable Virtual SAN (also a winner). The R730xd shows that innovation still lives in 2U, two-socket servers.It's fascinating what some vendors can do with commodity parts. The magic, of course, is in the software. In the Tintri VMstore, for example, the Tintri OS uses inline deduplication, compression, and other tricks to turn one part MLC flash and 10 parts SATA disk into something akin to an all-flash array for virtual machines. Lightning-fast flash delivers the IO, while disk provides the capacity.  ",
