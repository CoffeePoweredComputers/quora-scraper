            "answer_text": "It depends what you would like to do with it. If you want to cover all aspects of versatility: Pitch shotsChippingGreenside bunkersit will be your sand wedge. We know that sand wedge lofts usually range from 54 to 58 degrees. It is usually harder to hit a high floating lob with a low lofted wedge (usually by opening up the face) than a low running shot with a high lofted wedge (usually by setting the ball back in the stance). It is also easier to escape bunkers with higher lofted wedges. This is why 58 degrees is a common loft for specialist wedges (i.e. not part of set). Here are some other points to consider: some players prefer to hit a variety of greenside shots with the same club because they are varying feel with length of swing and ball position (Tiger and his lob wedge)The bounce and grind will be a great help for your swing type and course conditions. There are some specific grinds that allow easier manipulation of the clubface whilst still allowing the leading face to lie snugly against the ground (clubs that don't have an unnerving gap between edge of club and the ground and you are at risk of thinning the ball with imprecise technique)It is more important to consider the gapping of your wedges to hit varying distances accurately. Some folks get that gap wedge to fit in between pitching wedge and your highest lofted wedge. That allows all round coverage.If you want a practical test, try this- find a target 50 yards away and pitch to it. Sure a low loft can get you there. Now try hitting 40, 30, 20 and 10 yards. It's easier with a 58 degree. Some pros carry a dedicated lob wedge (60 and above) for those delicate shots. Good players who don't carry a lob wedge, usually have the 58. Best wishes! ",

            "answer_text": "A 54-degree sand wedge, with about 10 degrees of bounce. You can do just about everything between a lob wedge, sand wedge and pitching wedge with this club. Back in the old days, a pitching wedge was 52 degrees \u2014 what we call a gap wedge today. Players like Sam Snead and Ben Hogan were absolute masters with a 52-degree club. But they also carried sand wedges with big flanges underneath for dealing with deep sand. Since you want something that will work well in sand, too, you need a tweener between the classic 52 pitching iron (today\u2019s gap wedge) and normal 56-degree sand wedge with a big flange. If you can\u2019t find a 54\u201310 \u2014 there are many, many 56-degree wedges with 12 degrees of bounce. That\u2019s the standard configuration. They\u2019re often made of forged steel that can be bent by a pro. Get a 56 -12 and have it bent to 54 degrees. This will also reduce bounce by the amount you reduce loft, so you\u2019ll wind up with a 54\u201310. This isn\u2019t weird, by the way. Pros have their wedges and irons custom-bent all the time. ",
