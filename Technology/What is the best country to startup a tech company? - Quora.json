            "answer_text": "I live in Canada, but I would say San Francisco, USA is the best place for a tech startup and here\u2019s why. World\u2019s leading universities are nearby (Stanford, San Jose, Santa Clara, Silicon Valley universities among the most important ones)Government research centers and commercial labs (Aerospace FFRDC from DOD, Ames Laboratory, Arroyo Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory)Start-up cloud (you need a service, you can litteraly walk next door and ask the developper start-up to help you)Large pool of highly educated workersEasy access to venture capitalHighly entrepreneurial and risk-taking cultureAs a comparison, in Canada or in any other educated country, you would only get point 1, 2 and 4. Funding your start-up would most likely require you to go and establish yourself in Silicon Valley. People with the curriculum fit to work high-tech jobs are mostly located in San Francisco and a few other centers, it\u2019s simply easier to hire talents over there. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "None better than Silicon Valley. If you have connections, then it is different. In general Silicon Valley has gathered amazing amount of talented, entrepreneurial, hard working people in many major technical fields; VCs are plenty, even foreign VCs have setup many incubators in the Stanford corridor, all the famous VCs are here; most of the new tech startups have their root here; Berkeley/Stanford, both top 10 in the world, serves as a hub for startups, you can quickly blend into the entrepreneurial system attending their camps open forums, community meetups, etc. And the weather and all it offers!  Don't complain if you can't afford a nice house though, because so many like minded have squeezed in already. :) ",
