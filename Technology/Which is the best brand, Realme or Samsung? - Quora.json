            "answer_text": "Obviously samsung is best in between realme and samsung. Samsung generally focused on his mobile design but realme highly focused on his mobile processor.  Realme always focused that how to make best affordable price mobile with best processors. For which realme occupied a high sailing mobile in midrange. Realme is producing best cheap mobiles but in case of Samsung they are making best flagship mobiles. Realme become a best competitor in midrange which highly compare with xiomi mobiles. Realme and samsung best in their own place. Samsung producing best flagship which are best in camera, display but samsung ignoring a little about its processors. All about i explained but we can't say samsung is best, because they two are best in their own category. Thanks for reading. ",
