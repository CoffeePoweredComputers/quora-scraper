            "answer_text": "Amazon would have to be bigger than Apple by market cap to be able to buy Apple. But even if they were, they would probably avoid any temptation to take over Apple because the merged company would probably be weaker than the companies are individually. As of my writing this, Amazon is worth US$1.44 trillion, while Apple is worth $1.58 trillion. That means that if the two companies were to merge Today, Apple would have more leverage from their greater stock market value. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a ton of synergy between Apple and Amazon. All of Apple\u2019s businesses appear to support their computer/mobile devices systems in some way, while Amazon is in the business of being a merchant of physical and digital goods and services. And the companies have very different philosophies when it comes to how they create and deliver products and services. There are some corporate combinations that create an entity that\u2019s weaker together than the companies would be separate. This looks like it would be one of them. ",

            "answer_text": "Amazon can\u2019t buy Apple as Apple is bigger then them. In fact Apple is the world\u2019s first not governmental company to be worth $1 trillion. This makes Apple the world\u2019s biggest publicly held company. Amazon is still a major company just not as big as Apple. ",
