Not to forget the horrid after-effects which continue to torment generations upon generations of those who might have been exposed to the radiation. All of this was possible because of the discovery of quantum nature of reality. Harnessing the power of the atom to destabilise entire nations and prevent war from ever happening again on a large scale. The MAD doctrine which has emerged from the power of nukes has proven to take advantage of humans\u2019 most inherent tendency of self-preservation. No nation will dare attack any other nation with nuclear weapons. It is due to nukes that now nations are more willing to war on the economic front. They are more willing to invest in soft power. Very ironic indeed, as someone has said (don\u2019t know who), that the worst weapons forge the greatest peace. Amazing.  I am Arjun, by the way. I write when I don\u2019t have much else to do. ",
