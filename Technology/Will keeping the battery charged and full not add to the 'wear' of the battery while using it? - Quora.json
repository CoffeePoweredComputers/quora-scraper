            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Your question is a bit vague. Do you mean will you increase wear on the battery if you charge it to 100% and then use it while it is plugged in? Or do you mean will keeping it charged to 100% all the time will it wear the battery more than if you don\u2019t keep it plugged in all the time? It depends on what kind of battery you are talking about. I see you have assigned \u201cLithium Ion\u201d as a topic, so I am going to restrict my answer to that type of battery. All Lithium Ion batteries made in recent years have circuitry in them that prevent them from overcharging. Most, including Apple and Samsung fast charge to 80%, then they trickle charge to 100%. They maintain that trickle charge so at any given time the battery may not be exactly at 100%, but near it. This constitutes normal \u201cwear and tear.\u201d These batteries will maintain about 80% of their capacity after 500 charging cycles. This is pretty consistent for all mobile devices. (For laptops, it is about 1000 charging cycles.) So let\u2019s go over it again: keep your device plugged in as much as you want. Unplug it as much as you want. It does not matter. You will not wear out your battery appreciably more one way or the other. A charging cycle is a charging cycle. In fact, the more you leave your battery plugged in, the fewer charging cycles you will use, thus preserving your battery capacity \u2014 although to be clear, other factors will still cause your battery to degrade over time. So don\u2019t think you can leave your battery plugged in all the time and still have 100% battery capacity after two years, either. Just use your device however you want. Plug it in whenever you want (or whenever it needs it). Unplug it whenever you want. It. Does. Not. Matter. If you are one of those people who keep your devices for 3\u20134 years or more, then get a new battery when the battery life starts to bother you, it will be cheaper than buying a new device. ",

            "answer_text": "The battery is happiest if maintained between 20% and 80% charged, but frankly, it\u2019s not worth the effort. So, you can fully charge it without much worry, but let it run down to about 20% and recharge it. Depends entirely on how you use it. If it\u2019s not worth the bother, do as you like!!! It is built to give long reliable service whatever you do. I recommend taking the charger off when you are not using device. My laptop is going strong after 6 years; I have not disconnected the charger for the past 2 years. I\u2019m now trying to find out just how long they are good for. They must be pretty rugged!!! ",
