            "answer_text": "As far as the Post-Crisis universe goes, in Superman: The Man of Steel (1991) Issue #115, Superman was taken out by 100 trillion light years by Adam Strange and his Zeta Beams:   When Superman is transported back to Earth instantaneously he calls this distance \u201chalf the universe\u201d:  Making 100 trillion light years the radius of the universe. This would make the diameter 200 trillion light years. In Rebirth, which is essentially a continuation of Post-Crisis with elements of New 52 added into it the universe is infinite. This is confirmed by Justice League (2018) Annual #1 where it is stated that a pin drop of matter expanded with an unspeakable force of energy into an infinite, expanding universe:   This would also mean the Rebirth universe expanded at an infinite rate as it had a finite age comparable to the real universe. In comparison, Action Comics (1938) Issue #732 states that the Post-Crisis universe expanded over 60 trillion light years in half a second:   Since we know the current size is 100 trillion light years, it couldn\u2019t have expanded to more than this and so it would be between 60 and 100 trillion light years. We can take an average of 80 trillion light years, covering that in half a second would make the expansion rate over 5 sextillion times faster than light:  No specific sizes were given for either Pre-Crisis or New 52 other than implications of it being infinite/endless. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "there are 7200 Green Lanterns, 3600 Yellow (Sinistero) and Violet (Star Sapphire) Lanterns, 1 Blue and 1 Orange Lantern, at one time close to 40 Red Lanterns, and more Indigo Lanterns that all the previous corps combined. Not counting the Indigo Tribe, 80% of all those lanterns are from worlds that no other are from lanterns. But again the Guardians don't just protect 1 galaxy, the protect the entire local cluster of galaxies, which is slightly over 50 galaxies, including the 3 major galaxies of the Milky Way, Andromeda, and Triangulum plus all the minor nebulous galaxies that orbit them.
