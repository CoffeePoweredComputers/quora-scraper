            "answer_text": "Benefits of Strategic Management There are many benefits of strategic management and they include identification, prioritization, and exploration of opportunities. For instance, newer products, newer markets, and newer forays into business lines are only possible if firms indulge in strategic planning. Next, strategic management allows firms to take an objective view of the activities being done by it and do a cost benefit analysis as to whether the firm is profitable. The key point to be noted here is that strategic management allows an organization to orient itself to its market and consumers and ensure that it is actualizing the right strategy. In recent years, virtually all organizations have realized the importance of strategic management. However, the key difference between those who succeed and those who fail is that the way in which strategic management is done and strategic planning is carried out makes the difference between success and failure. Of course, there are still organizations that do not engage in strategic planning or where the planners do not receive the support from management. These businesses need to realize the benefits of strategic management and ensure their longer-term viability and success in the marketplace. ",
