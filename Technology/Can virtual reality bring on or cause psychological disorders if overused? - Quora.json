            "answer_text": "From experience with VR it is definitely more immersive than console games so your mind can get \u201cmagnetized\u201d more by associating with content. Actually it's not just the content one is associating with but also the minds of other individuals that use the same applications. I try to stay clear of VR apps that involve excessive violence or are too graphic purely because of this concern. Sometimes I may experience flash backs of content I've used days after using a VR application. Altering mental states does occur but whether it leads to psychological disorders can only be established from proper studies. ",
