            "answer_text": "DSL Internet refers to Internet service that is provided to you using a digital subscriber line, or DSL, service. DSL is simply a technology that allows digital signals to be transmitted and received over standard phone line wiring. DSL, like cable TV\u2019s DOCSIS, and fiber to the home services, is what's typically called a \u201cfirst mile\u201d data service. They're called that because they only deal with getting data between your home or business and your Internet service provider's (ISP) local equipment office. The distance DSL and cable modem links to reach that office is typically just a mile or two, since the signals used on those lines degrade with distance and wouldn't provide useful service beyond that. Fiber services are the exception to the rule. Fiber optic signals can travel much farther with less power and very little interference compared to electrical signals. After that first mile link, though, your ISP is free to use whatever network technology they like to get your data to the Internet. That\u2019s why when you contract with them for, say, a 10 Mbps DSL service, they typically say it's \u201cup to\u201d 10 Mbps. You may get 10 Mbps on the DSL from your computer to their office, but then you have to share their network with everyone else who's using it. ",

            "answer_text": "DSL: Digital Subscriber Line DSL stands for Digital Subscriber Line. DSL is a communication medium used to transfer high speed internet over standard copper wire telecommunication line. DSL offers the best cost, connectivity and services over other internet access types like broadband. Data transfer and telephone conversation can be done simultaneously over a DSL. Over the 'voiceband' frequency range, voice signal is transmitted using low frequencies (0Hz to 4kHz). While digital signals are transmitted through high frequencies (25kHz to 1.5MHz). To make sure that phone call does not get interrupted by high frequencies, DSL filters or splitters are used.  Source:- https://www.javatpoint.com/dsl-full-form ",
