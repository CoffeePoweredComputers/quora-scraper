            "answer_text": "I am actually very proud of something we had done in a retail company that I managed for a while. The company was selling wine. We had a brick and mortar store, but the heart of the business was our e-commerce. We were shipping wines, including small productions praised by reviewers, to customers nationwide (where it was allowed by interstate regulations, which are not to be messed with). But to the point. You know what is frustrating about buying wine online? You read in a magazine about a particular small production label that you\u2019d love to try. You start searching for it online. Chances are, if it stood out to you because of wine reviewers\u2019 praise, collectors and connoisseurs are already on it, and it\u2019s available only at a few stores, if at all. You find some, you pay for the order and relax in anticipation. Then you get a call from the store. Best case, they are short a few bottles. Worst, they don\u2019t have it at all. A customer walked in their physical store and bought what you ordered online. Perhaps it even happened a few days earlier. It is surprising how few stores in the country have digital inventory management. Most do physical stock counts once in a while. There are also some stores that never have the product in the first place, but it works well for them when consumers visit and order a few bottles of something else to fill in the case. Some of the bait and switch artists have made it their primary strategy. Barring that scenario, the issue of inventory discrepancies is actually very frustrating for the stores as well. We did not want to routinely upset customers. Fortunately, I as well as the other founder are all about new technologies and designing solutions to problems like this. We connected all our sales channels with one cloud-based point-of-sale system so that the moment a bottle is sold anywhere (in a physical store, online or on mobile), it is gone everywhere. One sentence, but it took us several months to design, test and roll out. It was a challenge to find one solution that connected different platforms. And while it does not fully eliminate the human factor, it is to the present day the best industry solution I know. It might not be as exciting as inventing postit notes, but this is something we made. And it was a breakthrough for our business. And I am just a girl who is proud when her brain work has impact. ",

            "answer_text": "A family friend told me his daughter had a non responsive Macbook. She had her entire senior thesis for her film degree on it. I heard the drive make a click sound, indicating \u201cstiction\u201d. This is a state where the spinning platter in the drive is literally sticking. I chewed on this a while and grabbed a bottle of Jamesons. Halfway through the bottle, I decided that since the platter is sticking, I need to make it smaller so it unsticks. Time for basic physics. What makes things smaller? I put it in a bag of rice in the freezer. I kept it in there and built a small box with a bunch of fans in it. I removed it from the freezer 1/4 of the bottle later and put it in the box with a SATA-USB interface. The drive spun up and I was concerned about condensation build up which is why the fans were running top speed. I was able to recover the drive completely, and just for S&Gs, I tried restarting to see if the disk reappeared. It didn\u2019t. That was the last time anyone would get anything off that drive. That girl owes her college degree to me. : ) ",
