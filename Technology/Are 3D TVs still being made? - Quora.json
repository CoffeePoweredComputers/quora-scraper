            "answer_text": "No. As of 2017, 3D sets were officially dead. Here\u2019s a thoughtful article that explains why. I predict that somewhere down the line, the technology will come back, but without any glasses necessary. One of these technologies, called Ultra-D, has appeared at CES already. Another company, Dimenco, displayed a lenticular prototype this year. It will take a lot of convergence - manufacturers, programmers, and retailers - to bring this up again. ",

            "answer_text": "2016 was the last year any were made. I have one from that year, an LG 4k OLED - 3D movies on it look better than the theater, even in the middle of the day. It\u2019s really sad that they got it so right before discontinuing it. That said, 3D displays aren\u2019t quite dead. You can still get a projector with support for 3D, but sadly not a TV currently.
