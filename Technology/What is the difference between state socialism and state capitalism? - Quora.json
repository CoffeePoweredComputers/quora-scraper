            "answer_text": "It\u2019s possible to describe state ownership of production facilities as \u201cstate capitalist\u201d where this occurs in a larger capitalist framework, and the state venture has the same kind of hierarchical management, hiring of workers as wage-labor, purchase of inputs from markets as with private capitalist firms. For example, British nationalization of the steel industry after World War 2 or the Iraqi ownership of the petroleum and other industries \u2014 70 percent of the economy \u2014 under the Baath party regime. Whether or not the Soviet Union was \u201cstate capitalist\u201d is controversial among socialists. I believe that it was not due to the complete nationalization of the economy and central direction and price-setting. A sign that the Soviet economy wasn\u2019t state capitalist is that it lacked a key dynamic of capitalism. Capitalism firms are in competition and seek to cut expenses and maximize profit in order to have more resources for competition. If they cannot make profits they will lose out in competition and be driven out of business. So what happens is that capitalist firms constantly seek methods of technical change, work reorganization, speed up and so on to reduce the required amount of labor per unit of output, to reduce the wage bill per unit of output. This is key way capitalist firms seek to make profit. This dynamic I just described was missing in the Soviet economy. Industrial managers tended to hoard labor and resources to make sure they had the best shot at fulfilling the quotas assigned to them in the plans. This led to a problem of labor shortages, which in turn led to declining growth \u2014 a feature of the economic crisis of the Soviet economy in its last decades. The Soviet economy was, I would say, neither capitalist nor socialist. It was a new form of exploitative class divided economy where the class of high end professionals and managers \u2014 the bureaucratic control class \u2014 become the ruling class. Members of this class by the 1980s began the moves to shift Russia to a capitalist economy to escape the economic problems, and also because they saw the possibilities of enriching themselves through seizure of the public assets. Socialism requires two things to exist. First, the immediate producers \u2014 the workers \u2014 must collectively and directly self-manage \u2014 control \u2014 the workplaces and the labor process and the process of technical development. And, secondly, the masses must have a directly democratic form of control over the over-all dimensions of the society and what is produced, to ensure that the economy produces what they want, doesn\u2019t pollute on them, and so on. Both of these features were missing in the Soviet Union. This is why its claim to be \u201csocialist\u201d was fake \u2014 a political cover for the interests of the bureaucratic class. ",

            "answer_text": "To better understand the concept of state capitalism, we start with capitalism first.  Capitalism is an economic system in which trade, industries, and the means of production are largely or entirely privately owned and operated for profit. [1] There  is a misconception about capitalism being a socioeconomic system based  on free market without centralized management of resources. Market  existed already in slavery; slaves were sold free an easily, but it did  not make the system a capitalist one.Also, capitalism should not be  conflated with democracy. Democracy is a type of government and is not  required for capitalism. It can be monarchy, totalitarianism, whatever;  but an economy based on one class making profit from other class labor  is capitalist one.  State capitalism is usually described as an economic system in which commercial (i.e. for-profit) economic activity is undertaken by the state, with management and organization of the means of production in a capitalist manner, including the system of capital accumulation, wage labor, and centralized management. [2] Simply the capitalist class was represented by the state. That is, state capitalism is a merely a flavor of capitalism, a monopolistic one, without market.A good example of state capitalism is the USSR.  Socialism is a social and economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy,[1][2] as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system. [3] Socialism  is a first transient stage of communism. It should not be confused with  the Welfare State [4] which represents capitalism with some moderation  made by the state in order to make it more stable and to reduce social  problems. Modern welfare states include the Nordic countries, such as Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland[2] which employ a system known as the Nordic model. [ibid] There  is no abundance in socialism, and its distribution principle is \"From  each according to their ability, to each according to their  contribution.\"Money and state exist in this society, while there is no profit one social class is making from the work of another class. ________________1.

            "answer_text": "State capitalism. The wages system under new management. State ownership or nationalisation is not socialism, nor is it a step towards socialism. Capitalism is not just a particular form of property holding, but is essentially an impersonal economic mechanism; impersonal in the sense that it is a mechanism that operates independently of the will of people and imposes itself on them as an external force. State capitalism and private capitalism have never existed as pure forms of society; every country has its own historically developed mix. But the main features of a model of state capitalism, drawn from historical examples, are as follows: * State ownership of the principal means of production * Generalised wage labour * Generalised use of money and money calculation * A relatively free market for consumer goods in the form of agricultural products and light industrial products * A market for means of production which is closely monitored by the state * Wide-scale planning activity, allocating supplies and directing products within the sphere of heavy industry, setting production targets, fixing prices and directing the flows of capital * A sizeable black-market. Reading A. Buick & J. Crump, State Capitalism, 1986. What is Socialism? Central to the meaning of socialism is common ownership. This means the resources of the world being owned in common by the entire global population. But does it really make sense for everybody to own everything in common? Of course, some goods tend to be for personal consumption, rather than to share\u2014clothes, for example. People 'owning' certain personal possessions does not contradict the principle of a society based upon common ownership. In practice, common ownership will mean everybody having the right to participate in decisions on how global resources will be used. It means nobody being able to take personal control of resources, beyond their own personal possessions. Democratic control is therefore also essential to the meaning of socialism. Socialism will be a society in which everybody will have the right to participate in the social decisions that affect them. These decisions could be on a wide range of issues\u2014one of the most important kinds of decision, for example, would be how to organise the production of goods and services. Production under socialism would be directly and solely for use. With the natural and technical resources of the world held in common and controlled democratically, the sole object of production would be to meet human needs. This would entail an end to buying, selling and money. Instead, we would take freely what we had communally produced. The old slogan of \"from each according to ability, to each according to needs\" would apply. So how would we decide what human needs are? This question takes us back to the concept of democracy, for the choices of society will reflect their needs. These needs will, of course, vary among different cultures and with individual preferences\u2014but the democratic system could easily be designed to provide for this variety. We cannot, of course, predict the exact form that would be taken by this future global democracy. The democratic system will itself be the outcome of future democratic decisions. We can however say that it is likely that decisions will need to be taken at a number of different levels\u2014from local to global. This would help to streamline the democratic participation of every individual towards the issues that concern them. In socialism, everybody would have free access to the goods and services designed to directly meet their needs and there need be no system of payment for the work that each individual contributes to producing them. All work would be on a voluntary basis. Producing for needs means that people would engage in work that has a direct usefulness. The satisfaction that this would provide, along with the increased opportunity to shape working patterns and conditions, would bring about new attitudes to work.

            "answer_text": "When the state operates an industry in a way that generates income for the state or is internally self-sustaining from its own sales of goods or services, and does this within the larger capitalist framework of competing firms, each seeking profits from its sales, we can regard such an entity as state capitalist. For example at the time of the US invasion of Iraq, the one-party totalitarian regime of the Baath party in Iraq owned 70 percent of the economy, which was heavily based on the oil industry, but the state also owned other industries such as the telecom system. We can say that the Baath party regime was running a largely state capitalist economy. When the British Labour Party nationalized large areas of British industry after World War 2 \u2014 coal mining, steel mills, auto factories, railways \u2014 these continued to be operated in a manner similar to a capitalist business. that is, they produced products and these products were sold and this is how that industry financed itself. So we could regard that as the state capitalist sector of the UK economy at that time. Certainly it was not socialist since the workers didn\u2019t have democratic collective control over these industries. Back in 1911 the Welsh miners union had proposed that the mines in Britain should be collectively managed by the miners \u2014 now that would be a socialist proposal. Similarly when a city, state or federal government in USA takes over production of electric power, or some set of utilities, this is another form of state capitalism. For example, the largest city owned utility in the USA is the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Back in the 1970s there was a major reform movement in L.A. that wanted to get the utility to charge lower rates to working class people. The actual situation was that the utility gave the lowest rates to the big corporate users of electric power. \u201cVolume discounts\u201d you might say. Thus the utility was \u2014 and still is \u2014 operated the same as a capitalist utility business. So that\u2019s another example of state capitalism. A socialist economy differs from state capitalism in terms of the elimination of the power of the capitalist and managerialist classes, so that workers manage the industries democratically and there is a highly democratic form of popular decision making and planning, for the public benefit, that determines the products and things like protection of the ecology and what not \u2014 in other words, the economy is no longer operated on a profit seeking basis, and is no longer under the control of a minority class at the top.

            "answer_text": "Read Wiki on State-Capitalism <State capitalism > it means what ever the speaker wants it to mean.  Based on that entry all forms of government have been called State-Capitalism by someone, depending on what their political views are.  It is more likely that someone on the extremes (left or right) would be calling the US State-Capitalism.  Likewise critics on both sides could call various or all EU governments State-Capitalism.  I have not seen a political use were the term is used positively. More generally (outside of political commentary) State-Capitalism is applied to both states with State-Socialism and failed State-Socialism.  State-Socialism is most often applied to versions of State contorted economies (State-Capitalism) where there are socialist goals and some socialist outcomes.  Were socialism to magically self germinate without the need for a state, that would be called libertarian socialism (without the State).   [In my humble opinion that would be the least likely way for socialist goals to ever be germinated, but then state implementation has also never really been implemented in anything other than name.  Probably the only limited success has been Democratic Socialism, but in mostly homogeneous middle and upper income countries with less poverty and little racial diversity.]  However State-Socialism is also applied to Chancellor Otto von Bismarck's social welfare legislation and policies implemented in Germany around 1883 that were intended to appease workers and prevent support from moving toward socialism (this being implemented after his direct anti-socialism laws were failing). I think you can use both terms however you want to use them, understanding that if you are using them politically then you are most likely offending the named party. ",

            "answer_text": "Capitalism is an economic system emerging from mercantilist times that revolves around people with capital, or men of large property according to an early definition of the word capitalist. In the 1800s, it was about having wealthy industrialists control most of the economy and could also involve political repression as explained in the documentary Plutocracy: Political Repression in the U.S.A. The poor conditions and violence brought about socialist movements that struggled to defend worker rights which were inexistant at the time. Since then, capitalism has become more humane, although there is still a lot of strife because of excessive debt owed to banks causing large swathes of the world population to be economically and socially excluded. So the main difference between capitalism and socialism is about who controls the means of production and whether any form of economic rent should exist such as compound interest. In the case of today\u2019s real world capitalism, it is an owner that should act as an autocrat over a purely private business. In the case of (far left) socialists, the means of production should be owned by workers so they can use the profit for their own ends. As for social democrats, their take is that capitalism should have seatbelts through the Bismarcking welfare state to have a fairer society with social programs that can leave a lot to be desired in not actually solving issues. Capitalism can also refer to publicly traded corporations which should the bidding of a board of directors and shareholders. Howver, this is sometimes mockingly referred to as corporatism by people that are against corporations for various reasons such as corporate personhood and the practise of maximizing shareholder value. State capitalism is a bizarre term which seemingly implies that capitalist-like businesses are owned and run through by people working for the state which would imply public firms. In the case of China, it seems to describe a system of privately-owned businesses that are overseen by the government. Note that government ownership does not necessarily mean something that is public and that private ownership does not necessarily mean something that is benevolent towards private individuals. Also notice all the \u201cshoulds\u201d used here and elsewhere which hint at an ideological point of view that is not necessarily supported by substantiated arguments other than some moral considerations.

            "answer_text": "State capitalism is what happens when a government which purports allegiance to free market, laissez-faire principles nonetheless intervenes with public funds and/or legislative action to prevent the collapse of large corporations (such as lending institutions or manufacturing conglomerates) even where collapse is precisely what those corporations have earned in the free market setting.  In the most general sense, state capitalism is a system in which the means of production are controlled privately and there are no strong state capital controls, but the government acts aggressively to further the interests of business at home and abroad \u2014 such as the use of diplomacy and the military to secure and develop foreign resources and markets, or to eliminate or sabotage competitors. These are not free market capitalist ideals.  It can be intelligently argued that the Soviet Union never actually practiced socialism, and that the United States has never actually practiced free market capitalism. ",

In the second case salaries are paid by government or by state. This is main fault of socialist idea that everyone owns everything that means no damn one owns anything. Even idea of profit is ridiculous in \u201csocialist \u201c society. If anyone gets everything according to his abilities, but planning committee or designers of the factory are inept, the whole factory produces ugly winter coats, which impossible to sell. Everyone working at the factory is paid the same salary, because it is planned by government. Ugly coats are sent to state run orphanage. It is no unemployment under socialism. So this lousy unprofitable factory can work for decades. Super profitable factory producing TV sets, but its workers do not get profit, because they do not own it. It is mutual property with workers of lousy, money wasting factory. How armchair generals - socialist dreamers can resolve this problem, if people from unprofitable factory can not be unemployed? Without fear of losing jobs people become lazy, sleep at work with their eyes open and openly coming drunk. All people dreaming about socialism need to go to see life in any socialist country for a few months. Socialism degrading people and makes them dependent. And worst result they hate each other. Dependence breeds hatred. ",

            "answer_text": "Sorry for my poor English. The socialism in its original imagined form was/is a movement and a final aim of the classical - non communist Social Democracy. One of the founders was Karl Kautsky. see: Kautsky\u2019s article on the differences between the bolshevism and the social democracy, and Lenin\u2019s book on the renegade Kautsky. By Kautsky the socialism is the most democratic form of a half-capitalist society, but this capitalism is based on the self goverment of the proleteriat, and planned economy, without any dictatorial feature. If you study Kautsky\u2019s works you can see, that his ideology is confused, is full of heavy contradictions, nothing more than a mere phantasy, it has no geopolitical reasons, it has no cultural aspects and absolutely anti-bolshevists. It was already out of date after the Bolshevik Revolution and weak up of the Nazism. Unfortunately at this moment I am unable to answer correctly the second part of your question, because the answer would be too long and difficult. But in its purest form the state capitalism per definitionem is an isolated and planned war economy in an isolated state, where every financial transaction, I mean the whole bank system and production process, the distribution, the export-import is directed by the state and the needs of the army. But basically the privat ownership remains as it was before the war. In a communist state the state capitalism means that the only owner of everything and every proces is the party-directed state. The state would like to work as a good capitalist (which is impossible), and would like to prefer the interests of the proletariat and poor peasantry. Sometimes the communist state gives allowances to certain capitalists and gives rights to the richer and more clever peasantry (kulaks in Russia), but does not give back land to the aristocracy or the churches. In a communist state there is no stock-exchange, no multi-level bank system, so it is impossible that one factory buys another factory, if they unify it happens by a state-order. The surplus is confiscated by the state and it will be redistributed by the state. Why we name this economical for of capitalism? Because the workers salary is nothing more than (usualy not mote but less) they need for living, so price of the woriking force is determined strictly by the living cost of a worker as in the capitalism. As I mentioned before the state uses and distributes the surplus. These alltogether mean: the state (the ruling party) decides about the acceptable living standard in the whole country, so it decides about the price of the working forces and try to maximalizies the surplus, any economical competition within the industry or agricultural factor is practicaly unnecessary, sometimes forbidden. The policy decides about the production and plans which results an unproductive equalitiy, but the state defend the society from the unemployment and the crieses and send a lot for culture, healthcare, and for the armament. Pardon me, I have no time to write more, and no time to correct the text grammaticaly. Any good suggestion will be accepted and wellcommed, thanked. My condoleance to the readers. ",

            "answer_text": "State capitalism is a form of socialism in which markets still play a role but the government owns most of the industry, which it runs as profit-maximizing firms instead of having a goal of maximizing a social welfare function. It is socialism because the government directly interferes in the private sector and, in fact, owns most of the means of production. It is not, however, a step that Marx envisioned as he foresaw the economy evolving from a market system to communism. State-owned or not, he would have viewed profit-maximizing employers as exploiters of workers. On the other side, proponents of free markets are just as critical of state capitalism because the government will be strongly tempted to abuse its powers to increase the profits of its firms. There is no expectation that state capitalism will yield efficient outcomes. ",

In the Soviet Union or other countries run by Marxist-Leninist dictatorships, government ownership of factories and shops was officially described as \"socialism\" to distinguish the existing situation from \"communism,\" which was supposed to emerge sometime in the future when the country had become so prosperous that nobody would need to worry about what belonged to them and what belonged to others (as in, \"somewhere over the rainbow.\")  The second purpose of this label was to press the claim that their brand of socialism was the only one worthy of the label - as distinct from Western European social democracy.  Conversely,  someone who finds \"socialism \" attractive in principle, but isn't willing to acknowledge that real socialism was what the USSR was practicing, tends to look for a different label to describe the latter. And what better label than one that smears capitalism? Of course, in reality there's no such thing as \"state capitalism.\"  Capitalism is defined by private ownership of the means of production. If the State owns the factories and shops,  that's not any kind of capitalism. ",

The state is then acting as a capitalist entity. State socialism, on the contrary would be when the areas of the economy controlled by a government are services (health, education, security) rather than the production and sale of goods and they are managed not as a private business but in terms of the needs of society, where said society can participate in the oversight and legislation related to those services. In a certain degree, all states have features of both approaches. But when a state controls the whole of the economy (as in communist countries), it can safely be considered state capitalism. On the other hand, a strong welfare state with progressive taxation and citizen oversight would be more on the side of socialism. ",

If people had the same freedom to choose to enter and leave then it also would this do-called state Capitalism. It turns out that Capitalism boils down to the freedom to choose without infringing on another person's freedom to choose. Capitalism is a voluntary agreement between individuals.

            "answer_text": "To answer that we should first define the meanings of both capitalism and socialism. \u201dCastoriadis\u2019 conceptualisation of socialism stands in direct opposition to both Marxism and capitalist ideology. Castoriadis defines socialism as the collective self-management of the market and of society in toto, based on a direct democracy that introduces a positive notion of freedom, in contrast to liberalism\u2019s notion of negative freedom. His version of socialism opposes the hierarchical bureaucracy of both a communist party and a capitalistic enterprise, as it postulates the equality of all in participating in the creation of the law governing the market and the relative institutionalisation of society.Castoriadis\u2019 understanding of socialism also opposes both a representative and procedural democracy originating in the work of Kant and evolving in all variants of contemporary social democratic theories like the ones developed by for example J\u0178rgen Habermas or John Rawls. Freedom is neither an autonomy deriving from a moral imperative formulated in the law of the state nor the unobstructed exercise of some basic liberal rights, but the equality of all. participating in the creation of the law governing society. Freedom is the precondition of the individual and collective autonomy, for it permits the participation of all citizens in the formation of the rules governing the private and the public sphere\u201c.

            "answer_text": "Interestingly some philosophical thinkers view this from the point of view of philosophical anarchy citing two broad camps - one pointing towards community the other the market. The \u2018communtarian\u2019 view is one largely held by this writer and so my views could justly be called \u2018suspect\u2019 This view holds that in groups small enough (how small is that incidentally?) where everyone interacts with everyone else on a daily basis, social order is relatively easy to attain. Social order on this sort of scale is usually very effective. The weakness of this view is largely the problem of social control in large groups. Much more problematic. The market of course has different problems and different solutions and these work only very imperfectly. And with the acquisition of wealth comes - inevitably - the acquisition of power. We are currently suffering from the behaviour of one billionaire who also now has immense power seemingly unrelated to any principles or intelligence. Also the sickening spectacle of right wing papers like the Mail suddenly defending him since he has met the Queen. Yes I\u2019m not sure why this should follow either. ",
