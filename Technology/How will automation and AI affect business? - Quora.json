            "answer_text": "AI is the thinker (the mind), while RPA is the actor (the limbs). AI systems are intelligence-centric while RPA systems are process-centric. RPA systems are programmed to perform a broad set of actions such as login to a portal and grab a screenshot or key in information. They don\u2019t dwell on what\u2019s a better way to do it, or whether it is worthwhile doing this task in the first place. AI, on the other hand, is more outcome-focussed, correlating data from every source (including what RPA bots can bring) and making the right decision based on time, place, and any other available information and it can do the same tasks 10,000 times a day, with the same efficiency each time. Here is a more detailed version of how IoT, RPA and AI work together for the best results. ",
