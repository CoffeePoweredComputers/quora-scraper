            "answer_text": "Usually, application repackaging means creating a customized installation with all your settings and inputs out of an already packaged installation. For example, you have a setup.exe and you want to install it to many computers in a company network. With that, you want the installation to be installed into the same location, with the same shortcuts, user rights etc. on each computer. Using a special repackaging software (full disclosure: we offer one here) you run an installation, capture all your desired settings, and then package them into an MSI installer that is ready for deployment.
