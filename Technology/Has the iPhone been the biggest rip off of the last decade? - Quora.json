            "answer_text": "Questions like this are amusing, most basically because no one can force another to buy, use and like something. These purchases and ownership of Apple iPhones are not illusions, or forced. With the highest satisfaction levels reported, and with the highest retention of ownership it is clear that iPhone indeed looks to be the highest value smartphone compared to all others. Of course, nothing is perfect and some do not like the item. This is why we have choice and assortment. As well, those that find it too expensive or made other choices may try to justify their position or view through comments such as this. There are several top phones from multiple brands. Competition is safe. Some phones are very affordable. A monopoly is not evident. Viva la difference! ",
