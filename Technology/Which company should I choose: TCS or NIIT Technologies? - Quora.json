            "answer_text": "I have worked with NIIT and well, those were the worst days of my life. Though they have some employee friendly schemes like an off on birthday with complimentary cash, etc but who'd care about that if the immediate senior starts treating you like a liability, that too without a reason in the very first year of joining. I badly wanted to get out of that madhouse because it was literally making me lose my sanity and confidence. On the other hand, TCS is a good option, some of my acquaintances & friends are working with this company and they seem pretty satisfied. Good luck! ",
