            "answer_text": "Forest fires are different from urban fires; they are hard to control and pose a greater threat to people and property. Drones play a crucial role in detecting, containing, and extinguishing forest fires. The primary objective of using drones is to gather situational awareness, which can be used to direct the efforts of the firefighters in locating and controlling hot spots. Just like urban fires, forest fires too require monitoring so that firefighters know what they are dealing with. In the event of a forest fire, time is of the essence. This is why it makes sense to use a drone for two primary purposes: initial detection and initial rescue. Advantages of using drones lies in :: 1) Drones can quickly be airborne, fly to a location, map the area affected by the fire, and share the information with all relevant agencies within a short time. 2) A drone can carry a whole range of sensors, including a thermal camera that supports multiple color pallets. The combination of all these sensors provides a better picture of the spread and speed of the fire, which can help civil authorities to come up with a relief plan. ",

The drone imagery, both at visible-spectrum and infrared, can be used for two things: detecting the current fire boundary and analyzing the type of vegetation and its dryness. But we can improve on that and provide a near-real-time tool that can be used on the ground, incorporating a small portable weather station and drone imagery. The local offline weather station will provide for a real-time wind forecast at a more granular level than traditional weather stations. The drone imagery, both at visible-spectrum and infrared, can be used for two things: detecting the current fire boundary and analyzing the type of vegetation and its dryness. When we combine those three things: Fire boundaryWind patternsType and dryness of vegetation",
