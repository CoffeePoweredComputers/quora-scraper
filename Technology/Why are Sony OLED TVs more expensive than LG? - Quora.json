            "answer_text": "Thanks Alexander for the incorrect question \"Why are Sony OLED TVs more expensive than LG?\" It's actually the other away around... LG make two versions of OLED sets and you absolutely don't want the budget versions, which have very bad upscaling of standard definition as DVD and some serious picture problems (according to tons of owners) and then make LG a rather fine version, where they buy finer electronics for picture processing... But the rather fine LG 65 inch versions, cost actually MORE than Sony's cheapest 65 inch whiteOLED sets - which have screens from LG and Sonys own excellent electronics, that for examples scale up most DVD's or good TV broadcastings so everything look like BluRay's and show no picture problems! And deeper info, to help you select the best TV alternative... A note to Quora... This is a direct answer on the question (a different answer would simply be missing vital info or even be wrong) originally written by me, based on my deep experience and NOTHING is copied from anyone else! Many wonder about the best TV brand and that is almost too easy to answer today... * Sony is clearly best, especially with their excellent 65 inch budget TV's and Samsung is also a very fine alternative... Then have Panasonic very fine, but normally more expensive alternatives... And there are also some silly expensive \"design\" brands, but they don't make finer screens... Mainly because the electronics for really fine picture processing, which your TV must have to show a really fine moving picture - without any irritating errors and especially with advanced upscaling (so most DVD's and even standard definition broadcasts look almost as sharp as fullHD BluRays) are very complicated to produce, or very expensive to buy... And many makers like LG don't want to pay extra for finer electronics, so LG only pay for \"rather fine\" picture quality in some very expensive models... And that is also why the otherwise amazing low cost OLED from LG have some irritating picture problems and very bad upscaling, according to many user reviews... But Sony and Samsung have already excellent picture processing technology \"in house\" so you get really fine picture processing, even in their budget LCD models and Sony have also some amazing OLED models, with WhiteOLED panels from LG and excellent Sony electronics inside, which give you the absolute finest picture quality today and they cost anyhow less than LG's rather fine OLED models, but they are naturally a bit more expensive than LG's budget OLED models! * Note that Samsung QLED have nothing to do with OLED and give actually not a clearly better picture than Sony and Samsung very fine 65 inch budget models, with classic LCD panels... * The LED in names, is normally the type / method of white backlight that practically every modern LCD screen have... * Then has it only been a few 1 to 4 inch TV's and game screens made of colour LED pixels... Plus three amazing TV prototypes with Sony's \"Crystal LED technology\" which mainly are colour LED pixels, but they was a lot more expensive to make than OLED so they did not begin to mass produce them... But some companies, including Samsung and LG are recently working on 75 to 146 inch \"MicroLED\" screens, which also use colour LED pixels and that technology seem to become the absolute best alternative, sometime in the future... But maybe never, at ordinary prices... Yes \"MicroLED\" work just like the first version of Organic LED or OLED with pixel groups of three colour subpixels... But the blue OLED subpixel did die twice as fast, so LG invented WhiteOLED which are groups of four white subpixels, with a colour filter over three subpixels and the last white subpixel, compensate then for the loss of light the filter create... And that also mean that every smartphone with classic OLED screens, will die extra fast.* And then have many famous original makers (as Philips) simply stop producing TV's and sold the brand name to factories in China... The Chinese company Hisense produce for example low quality sets as Sharp (who originally made the finest big screens in Japan) and Toshiba for America... And a company in Poland make the last screens (of very low quality) for the Sharp that are sold in Europe... And the Turkish company Vestel make clearly worse quality TV's for Europa, which are badged with over 30 old brand names as Hitachi, Toshiba, JVC, Sanyo and even some budget Panasonic, including the 4k CX400 model! * The same TV can also cost very different in different shops, so use always a price comparison site, even if you want to buy in a shop! * Look then for the right size, so you can view the finest details... A great TV should naturally be just like a clear window to another place and you need both perfect eyes and a 65 to 75 inch screen, to be able to see the finest Full HD details from 263 to 303cm distance... See more in my list below* Then are anyhow extra popular sizes as 50-55 inch extra expensive, compared with slightly bigger or smaller... See more about that below...* And you get normally most smart TV functions, even in a budget 65 inch TV so you get automatically that functionality without any extra cost!* Some shops try to fool you that you need 100hz or more... The truth is that some fine modern 50hz sets, handle movements very smooth and sharp... But not all 50hz sets, of course... And some older 100hz sets are actually worse than a fine 50hz set... A few shops show even special made videos to demonstrate the \"huge\" difference and sets with 50hz look then dramatically worse, sometimes even horrible... Even if exactly the same 50hz TV show movement just as nice (smooth and sharp) as other 100hz TVs, with a normal / ordinary signal, from a film or broadcast... Okay, it may still be a tiny difference, but it's practically impossible to see!* A really fine VA LCD screen must be able to show almost total black (some times after some adjustments) fine details even in dark shadows, details in white shirts and be able to produce very bright white... Any screen use to show great colours right from the front... But VA screens use to dim colours dramatically from the side... And an IPS LCD screen show rather fine colours, even from the sides BUT the \"black\" look then normally like very dark grey, instead... Except with some amazing Sony IPS screens (as mine) which anyhow can show fine deep black... And WhiteOLED combine finally the best, total black and perfect colors even from the side, but the fine are very expensive and the budget versions form LG have both some picture errors and bad upscaling!* Fine upscaling, as you find in a big budget Sony or Samsung with UltraHD can make fine old DVD films (that not even is in FullHD as BluRay films) almost as ultra sharp as UltraHD films - but budget TV sets from LG and many others, give a lousy blurry result with old DVD films.* Demo TV's in shops have often strange blue tint settings and too strong colors, but that can you normally adjust at home... Just change to the \"film\" or \"movie\" mode and then will you normally get the best picture.* Turn also OFF all or most of the artificial \"picture improvements\" change to a \"warm\" colour setting - for a truly natural picture, like a clear window to another place...* Finally sound most modern TV speakers rather awful, so you should always connect the set to a hifi equipment or at least buy separate loudspeakers, that may be rather cheap and still give a GREAT improvement! And here have you a very exact answer about the optimal viewing distance, with help of 3 great methods... 1) The first method is extra easy, made by me and also the only method that work perfect, even if you have extra fine OR bad eye sight... We begin with a special version for 4K UltraHD simply because most screens has that resolution... Stand first so incredible close to the screen, that you really can see some of the pixels and measure then the distance, between your nose and the screen... Then are BluRay films and most HD TV broadcasting max FullHD and people do normally not want to sit that extremely close to the screen (see more about that below) anyhow... So you can simply double the nose to screen distance you measure, to get the best viewing distance for FullHD and there can you truly enjoy the finest details in a Full HD picture... And that is the max distance, even with a UltraHD 4K screen, because if you move back more, will you naturally see less and less of the finest FullHD details... And then the version for a Full HD screen... Stand first so close to the screen, that you just can see the pixels and move then back 6 cm... Then can you enjoy the finest details in a Full HD picture... That is simply the optimal distance, because if you move back more, will you naturally see less and less of the finest details and if you sit closer, will you see some pixels... Yes, most people don't want the screen very close and sit actually too far away, to even see the finest FullHD details... They have normally a 55 inch TV about 300cm from the sofa, when a 55 inch screen should be max 224cm away (if you have perfect eyes) and then is it naturally impossible to see the finest FullHD details... And then have 4K or UltraHD even finer details, which naturally are even more impossible to see, if you sit too far away (as most do) and not extremely close... You must actually sit max 115cm away (with perfect eyes) from a 55 inch 4K screen to see the finest UltraHD 4K details... Which mainly means, that you never have to invest in a UltraHD player or films... And remember that most programs are shown in max Full HD anyhow... But a fine 4K UltraHD screen cost about the same as a fine Full HD and if your kids sit very close to the TV, can they naturally enjoy the extra up-scaled 4K details... And then can you also use a fine 40 inch 4K screen as a giant computer monitor (at the perfect 85cm distance) instead of four 20 inch screens *hehe* 2) If you use method one, with a FullHD screen and have perfect eye sight, will you see that the screens diagonal size in inch x 4 simply happen to be the almost exact optimal distance in centimetres (and cm x 0.3937 is inch) and if you sit further away, will you see less and less fine FullHD details... But this method work ONLY if you have PERFECT eyes, otherwise must you first move closer, until you can see some pixels and then move back 6 cm... And to see the finest 4K or UltraHD details (with perfect eye sight) must you actually sit little closer to the screen, than the screen is wide! 3) Here you have the optimal viewing distance in numbers, to enjoy the finest 1920x1080 FullHD details, with perfect eyes... Because you can see a 1mm object max 346cm away, with perfect vision and then must you move back max 6cm, to not see any pixels and max details! 15.6\" notebook screen (show FullHD pixels max 62cm away) 64cm32\" 704x396mm 27.9dm2 (pixels to max 127cm +6cm) 133cm37\" 814x458mm 37.3dm2 - 152cm or max 76cm for finest UltraHD40\" 880x495mm 43.6dm2 - 164cm or max 85cm for finest UltraHD details! 42\" 924x520mm 48.0dm2 - 172cm44\" 968x546mm 52.7dm2 - 181cm46\" 1012x569mm 57.6dm2 - 188cm49\" 1078x606mm 65.4dm2 - 200cm52\" 1144x644mm 73.6dm2 - 212cm55\" 1210x681mm 82.4dm2 - 224cm or max 115cm for finest UltraHD details!60\" 1320x743mm 0.98m2 - 244cm65\" 1430x804mm 1.15m2 - 263cm or max 134cm for finest UltraHD details!70\" 1540x866mm 1.33m2 - 283cm75\" 1650x928mm 1.53m2 - 303cm or max 155cm for finest UltraHD details!80\" 1760x990mm 1.74m2 - 323cm or max 164cm for finest UltraHD details!87\" 1920x1080mm 2.07m2 - 352cm And an extra tip... A really fine 55 inch smart TV cost often the same as a truly excellent \"budget\" 65 inch from Sony or Samsung... Because 55 inch are the most popular size, so they are normally overpriced and many think wrongly that 65 inch are too big, so they are often under priced! But even 65 inch are too small, to show the finest Full HD details from a normal sofa position... So if you want the best, do you need a 75 inch max 3 meters away and that's why that size suddenly cost TWICE as much! And can you really trust my words?? John Randall did comment... \"Having worked for 40 years at Sony in the service side, I have yet to hear such a great report on TV\u2019s. This is very well reported and very factual. Good work and well said!\" Originally written by me, to help everyone find a finer TVAnd I'm from Sweden, so I may write slightly strange... But I hope my answer will be a great help, anyhow! ",
