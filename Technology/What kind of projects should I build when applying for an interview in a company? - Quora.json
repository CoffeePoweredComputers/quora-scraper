If you are an experienced them you will be having the knowledge of applying for the project in which you have worked. I believe the same goes will all the backgrounds in case of experienced. But they will check your projects even if you are a fresher. In that case, your projects should have been based on the companies domain, like robotics, solar etc.,. But those are just added advantage. Generally companies just test your knowledge. ",
