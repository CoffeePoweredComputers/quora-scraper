            "answer_text": "To start with numbers, There are 75000 customers using Amazin web services in India alone. I would assume, 75%+ of these 75000 are startups. Enterprises are evaluating their Cloud strategies, and few of them have already started using cloud Solutions. So, cloud is becoming big, very big. You can be rest assured that this trend continues for atleast next 10 years. Where to start? This is the questions many fresh graduates have in their mind. To start with, go in the below specified order. Learn Linux. This is a key area you need to focus as OS is considered the base of any platform and thats where applications run. To cut down the cost of ownership of the service, many organisations are choosing Linux. If you choose to learn Azure cloud platform, learn windows server administration as well.Then learn VMware. This is a very very important part as all the cloud platforms we know runs in top of virtualization and VMware is a leader in that space. By focussing on VMware, you understand how backend of Cloud platforms work.Learn programming languages and Scripting. Today a programmer can launch and run virtual servers, the same job was done by system admins. Secondly, programming languages are ever green. Why scripting? Thats because world is moving towards automation and to stay in the race you need to script.Learn Either AWS or Azure or Google Cloud platform. For now, Amazon is super hot, with 70% YOY growth.Bottom line: Cloud is emerging day by day. Its more secure than running servers on premise and its highly available than having services running on prem. For any queries or trainings, just pung me. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Swati, Due to the adoption of cloud technologies by various organizations, the scope of cloud computing is getting wider and wider every day. Now more and more new technologies are get in to cloud computing technologies. Programming skills are very important for any of the cloud technology developments. So you should always strengthen the programming and scripting fundamentals to get in to any cloud technology areas like Azure, SFDC, AWS, etc Once you become expert in core and basic technologies, you can quickly adopt and learn the these cloud technologies. You should also start understanding the concepts and differentiation for IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, etc If you wanted to develop you skills in PaaS platform, then you may need to focus on your development skills on Application Programming Interfaces (API) and started developing program applications in Microsoft\u2019s Azure, Googles\u2019s Google App Engine, SalesForce.com\u2019s Force.com platform. Similarly for SaaS technologies. Hope this give you some basic idea on where to start. All the best. ",
