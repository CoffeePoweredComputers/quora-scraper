There are two main reasons that may turn your USB drive data inaccessible. Such as if the drive is unmounted improperly from the port, it can lead to data corruption. Another reason can be invalid data in the Master Boot Record (MBR) or Partition Boot Record (PBR) or directory structure on the USB drive.
