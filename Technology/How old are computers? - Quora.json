            "answer_text": "If you mean what we now consider to be a computer based on electrical operation then around the beginning of WW2 computers that could be made to do general things were being made. I say general because special purpose units for things like gun fire control and process control existed. Both the US and England built electronic computers that were used to compile the firing tables for artillery. After the war non-military computers were designed using vacuum tubes such as the Bendix G-15  but they were very big, ran hot and required a lot of power. The invention of the transistor in the late 1940s permitted the manufacture of more powerful machines that didn\u2019t run quite as hot and used less power.  But it was the development of integrated circuits starting in the 1960s that really boosted the industry, Then the introduction of computer processors on a chip started the massive expansion of computer tech that we enjoy now.

            "answer_text": "The modern electronic computer had it\u2019s beginning during World War II and then became more common after the war and by the 1950\u2019s they were common in larger companies. But there were many mechanical computers going way back to automatic looms in the 1800\u2019s and Babbage\u2019s (unfinished) calculating machine. In the US, the first census to use \u201ccomputer\u201d tablulating machines and paper punched cards was the census of 1900, about 120 years ago. This was what got IBM in the computer business, to census of 1900. So 1900 has the year when massive insitutional-size data processing got it\u2019s start. 45 years later we had specialize electronic computers to replace the mechanical computers and by the 50\u2019s we had computers you would recognize as what we think on as a \u201ccomputer\u201d. From that point they have only gotten ,smaller, faster and less expensive by factors of a million ",
