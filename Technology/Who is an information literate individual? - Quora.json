            "answer_text": "An information literate person is one who can obtain and read with comprehension from a variety of sources in order to obtain meaning that is needed. This could be a person who can find a cookbook, read a recipe and then create the meal, a person who can look up online how to hook up and use a printer, then successfully do so, etc. The situation is important; I can be informational literate in an area I have good background knowledge in (cooking) and not so much in an area in which I have little or no background knowledge (advanced chemistry). Other influences for informational literacy include interest, vocabulary, and the purpose of obtaining information. This is further sited in one\u2019s culture. What might be reasonable for a 25 year old from Western Europe would be different from that of an African elder or other person who didn\u2019t grow up with computers. ",
