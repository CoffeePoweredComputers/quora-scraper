            "answer_text": "Eh? What exactly are you comparing against? Trust me when I say that Apple doesn't offer anything cheap. Whenver an Apple product can be considered on the cheap side, it's because it possesses significant compromises. Take the macbooks for example. Asus's G14 is faster then any Macbook on the market, and it starts at a lowly price of 1,000 USD. Apple has nothing that can come close to matching the performance per dollar math of Asus's offerings. Even against the HP specter and Dell XPS line up, the value isn't great. On the iPhone side, Apples price range for a flagship is currently 700 to 1450 dollars. Assuming equivilant maximum storage, the android market ranges from 650 to 1600 dollars. Flagship versus flagship, Apple has no real price advantage except at the extreme top end, although given the spec differences ( 5G, 120hz refresh, 45W fast charging, etc), it's completely understandable to be charging more. Even on the iMac side, again, not a great bargain. Apple products have their good traits, but a competitive price tag usually isn't one of them. Now, it's possible they can seem cheap, but you have to factor in the build configuration. Comparing a system with an intel dual core CPU against an octa core Ryzen processor isn't a fair comparison.
