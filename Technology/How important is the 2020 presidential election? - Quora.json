            "answer_text": "A2A it\u2019s important in the sense that all presidential elections are. For better or for worse, the executive branch of the US government has managed to consolidate far more power than I think that it should, and as the head of that branch, the president has significant influence over the general direction of the country. This election is more important than many, though I find claims that it is \u201cthe most important in our history\u201d to be way overblown. Despite claims about threats to our democracy, or creeping fascism, or the threat of socialist takeover - none of which is actually the case - what we basically have is a choice between traditional, experienced leadership, represented by Joe Biden and the Democrats, and heterodox, inexperienced leadership, represented by Donald Trump and the Republicans. Whatever one thinks about the actual policies of the current president, the real choice I see here and why I think he should not be elected is that he really seems to lack a coherent plan, and his claim to being a \u201cbusinessman, not a politician\u201d has revealed the problems with having inexperienced leadership that reacts rather than plans. That \u201cgoes with its gut\u201d instead of convening expert opinion. That fails to follow, or even understand, the proper channels to make policy. In a word, Trump vs Biden is chaos versus stability. In more normal times, this might be something that we could live with. In fact, creative chaos can lead to innovation. But in a time where the country faces something like COVID-19, the shortcomings are all too obvious. Trump, should he win, will be in office for four more years. In a year or two, COVID-19 will be controlled. No; it won\u2019t be in the next month. Or two. Or even six, I fear. But it will get sorted. Trump will spend his remaining years trying to clean up the damage of COVID both socially and economically. But then he will go. And whoever follows him almost surely is going to be a \u2018normal\u2019 politician. \u201cTrumpism\u201d as it is called here, is a one-trick pony. If Biden should win, on the other hand, he will move the response to COVID to a more central, top-down one. Maybe he\u2019ll put in place national mask guidance (he simply does not have the authority to order universal mask usage; not any more than Trump had the authority to block states implementing masks). He will surely stop having antagonistic encounters with the press and undermining the CDC. That will bring a certain quiescence to the fight. It\u2019s not going to solve COVID, however. He, too, will try to repair what has been damaged. But he will likely do it by trying to get congress to raise taxes (ostensibly on \u201cthe rich,\u201d but in reality, in ways that are going to fall on all of us). Will that work or will it lead to a slowdown? I don\u2019t know. The general direction of the country is going to be nudged one way or the other, as it always is. But I am far from convinced that this choice is epochal as we are being told by some. ",

            "answer_text": "The 2020 presidential election is the most important election in my lifetime and very possibly the most important election in the history of the United States. This election, without hyperbole, is about whether we give up on the American experiment of a democratic republic under constitutional rule of law, and become a full-on, authoritarian, dictatorship embracing the law of rule, instead. Trump regime is a hybrid of a kakistocracy/kleptocracy. His regime now officially says \u201cherd immunity\u201d is their official response to COVID-19. Of the 215,000 + Americans who have already died from COVID-19, easily 100,000 of those deaths could have been prevented. But, the kakistorcracy/kleptocracy care nothing about you or me. It cares only for the silk-lined pockets of the super rich who are complicit in Trump\u2019s madness. And, herd immunity is just a name they can give to doing nothing, which is what they have always been doing while pretending to do something and lying about it. The harm Trump\u2019s done to the rule of law in this nation will take many years to reverse. But, that\u2019s if and only if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris take leadership. ",
