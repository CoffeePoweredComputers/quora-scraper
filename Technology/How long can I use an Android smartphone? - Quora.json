            "answer_text": "From a purely technical standpoint, your smartphone will work as long as nothing goes wrong with it, or it becomes obsolete. Here, I won\u2019t equate old technology with obsolescence since a lot of us use really old 2G feature phones and are fine with it. So here goes - Battery Life - All batteries have what are called charge cycles ie the number of times the battery is charged and discharged. As the charge cycles build up, the ability of the battery to hold charge diminishes and the battery\u2019s performance falls.  At a point of time, you have to change the battery. Nowadays, you can\u2019t change batteries yourself as these are locked into the phone and the back cover isn\u2019t removable. So you have to take it to a service center. But service centers won\u2019t keep batteries of devices over 1\u20132 years old (at most). If your device dies after this time has elapsed, you might as well sing its swansong. But note that some devices, like my Samsung Galaxy Y Duos, is chugging along even though it is far older. That said, I haven\u2019t heard of anyone being able to maintain reliable battery performance on a daily driver for longer than 4\u20135 years. So that\u2019s one limiting factor.Display - The display of a device is also prone to getting weaker over time. In  some cases, the display will give up working in 3\u20134 years, though this is not common. More likely you\u2019ll end up with weird tints and dead pixels like you find in old TV sets, but that doesn\u2019t make the phone unusable.Internal Memory - Like charge cycles, memory has write cycles. These are the times when you write stuff afresh onto a certain block of memory. Over time, some sections become unusable. In layman\u2019s terms, we say that the memory is corrupted and unusable. If your core device files end up in these corrupted sectors (or get corrupted otherwise), you may have to do a system reset. But if it\u2019s bad enough, that may not help. Your phone gets \u201cbricked\u201d and you have to get a new one. Can\u2019t set a timetable for this, because I\u2019ve seen memory get corrupted in as less as a year. But usually, memory corruption doesn\u2019t set in faster than  battery weakening.Network obsolescence - This will happen, but hasn\u2019t happened anywhere, to any smartphone, yet. Each smartphone has a radio that manages to connect to certain frequencies. Depending on what the tech behind those frequencies are, we call them 2G, 3G, 4G and recently, 5G. Over time, you\u2019d expect networks to shift entirely to shift to say 3G or 4G, and dispose of old technologies. These may make very old smartphones obsolete because the radio won\u2019t be able to find those frequencies anymore. But as I said, this hasn\u2019t happened yet, and wont\u2019 happen till we\u2019ve probably hit a couple more generations.Damage - Obviously, if the damage is severe enough, you can\u2019t use the device anymore.Those were some of the ways  in which you may be forced to stop using your smartphone. Note that I\u2019ve listed them in decreasing order of frequency, with 1 being most frequent and 4 being completely hypothetical. 5,  of course, can happen anytime unless you\u2019re careful. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I really want to know what was the longest you owned your android phone and is it still running as smooth as when you first bought it? is there a consensus that an apple phone last longer than androids? I just ordered an iphone 6s and it will be my first iphone. I am coming from an HTC One M8 and from what I see and hear, there's more complaints coming from android side than iphone. Having my HTC One m8 for years now, I kinda agree, which is why it prompted to get an iphone due to its overall durability.But I am having a little buyer's remorse because I don't know if I am ready to go from an android to an iphone. my life revolves around google A LOT. EDIT EDIT: I guess apple made it easier for me to say good bye http://www.androidcentral.com/apple-makes-switch-android-ios-even-easier ",
