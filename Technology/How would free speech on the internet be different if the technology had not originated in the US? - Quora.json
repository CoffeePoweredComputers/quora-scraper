            "answer_text": "This belief that freedom of speech is an american invention\u2026.depressing\u2026 No, it\u2019s not. Sorry to disappoint you, but there is more to the world than the US. The idea has first been coined in ancient Greece (as for the Democracy concept), early in 5th century BC, revived by England\u2019s Bill of rights of 1689. It then became famous with the French, in 1789, with the declaration of the rights of Man and the Citizen, following the French Revolution. For comparison, although The US Constitution has been drafted in 1787, and ratified in 1788, the first Amendment, which defines the freedom of speech, has been adopted only in 1791. Also the internet has nothing to do with freedom of speech, which makes your question badly formulated. The pioneers of freedom of speech were, well, public speakers, who are still a thing in UK. Newspapers ( the \u201cPress\u201d) followed. Technology only made possible for us, the ordinary citizens, to join the conversation on a global (and faster) level. On the technological side, it\u2019s true that the current internet derives from Arpanet, an US military project dating of 1969. But it became accessible to the public only in the early 1980\u2019s. At this time, France (again) had already developed the Minitel, a (free of charge) integrated keyboard and monochrome screen terminal, using regular phone lines and a standard modem connection, which provided similar functionalities (databases, news services, messaging, chat) , but with lower bandwidth and graphics abilities, due to restrictions on speed. A later model, the Minitel 2, had a color screen, better graphics and next generation modem, allowing connection speeds similar to the first personal computers. University and corporate computers were on another level though, as local connections allowed for far greater connection speeds to the on-site server. Short answer : Freedom of speech is not a consequence of technology, so the question makes little sense. Freedom of speech is as old as the concept of democracy, dating back to ancient Greece. But it was the Press who promoted it, and Technology only made it more accessible. ",
