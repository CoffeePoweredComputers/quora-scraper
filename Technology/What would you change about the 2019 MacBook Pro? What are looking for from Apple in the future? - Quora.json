            "answer_text": "My answer is for Apple to throwback to an earlier time. If you\u2019re going to call a machine Pro, charge a lot of money, and mean it, then it should be repairable, upgradeable, use accelerated graphics with dedicated video RAM, have an high quality display and good feel keyboards and more that 2 ports for connection to off computer devices. It should also be well enough cooled that out can run all CPU cores and the graphics at maximum clock rate for a sustained period instead of throttling the CPU because it\u2019s in danger of overheating. Kinda like my 2011 MacBook Pro. It allowed me to upgrade the RAM to 16GB, upgrade hard disk to an SSD of whatever size I wanted and could afford, has an easily replaceable battery, a less easily but still replaceable keyboard with good feel, and a good display. I use a dock at home to expand to an external display, ethernet, removable or other hard drives, and other accessories. It has accelerated graphics on board (that have been problematic due to a AMD chip design issue) and runs off the built in CPU graphics when running apps not requiring accelerated graphics or when running a single display. So Apple, if you\u2019re reading, give me something like that. I expect a Pro device to last longer (some upgrades and replacement parts), be more flexible in configuration, and be a powerful performer. A portable workstation when I want or idle down to something to type answer on Quora when I don\u2019t want. That, and reliable, easy to use software and operating system, is worth paying a premium to have. My TCO (total cost of ownership) will be way lower than with cheaper windows hardware. I\u2019ll even pay for OS upgrades IF you give me solid upgrades, not 80% baked like some recent releases have been. (Unfortunately, after joking on stage at WWDC about \u201cfully baked,\u201d it seems the only thing \u201cfully baked\u201d about the initial releases of iOS 13 and MacOS 10.13 releases were the executives, engineers, and quality assurance staff that decided to release it.)
