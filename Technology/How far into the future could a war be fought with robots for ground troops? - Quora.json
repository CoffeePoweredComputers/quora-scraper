            "answer_text": "Not as far as you\u2019d think, there\u2019s plenty of weaponized robots and drones currently in use all around the world controlled by soldiers and pilots in different locations, sometimes even back at home. Only difference compared to what you\u2019re possibly thinking of something like the Terminator franchise, is these robots are mainly used for support alongside humans. Fully autonomous/AI based weapons systems that\u2019s an entirely different matter, don\u2019t expect them to appear anytime soon especially thanks to the UN considering banning AI weapon systems and many political leaders have also mentioned they have no plans to replace front line soldiers entirely with robots. Removing any sense of moral or political considerations: at the current rate of technological development, it would be reasonable to assume that a full robot only battle could take place within the next 100-years.
