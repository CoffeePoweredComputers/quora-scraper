            "answer_text": "Oh yes, and they destroy the device when they do. Insects especially cockroaches like to eat the insulation that covers copper wires. Sooner or later you end up with a piece of bare wire, which shorts against something, and that\u2019s the end of the device. They\u2019re also attracted to warmth. They\u2019ll crawl into the ductwork of the fan that\u2019s cooling the device and the circuitry will overheat. I had this happen to a microwave oven more than once. The roaches would block the fan which was cooling the RF power transistors. Next time you go to microwave a burrito, the transistors blow. I\u2019ve opened up laptop computers and found them inside. All they have to do is block the CPU cooling fan and that\u2019s the end of your laptop. They get into everything and destroy it. As for resistance to electricity, their exoskeleton tends to conduct it away from their vital organs. I once tried making a bug zapper by simply wrapping a grid of bare wire around a lightbulb. Flies would constantly land on the grid and then fly away again unharmed. The only way they were killed is if they somehow got wedged in the grid, and were exposed to the current for a long time. If you take apart a bug zapper you\u2019ll probably find a large capacitor. The capacitor stores enough electricity to deliver a large jolt of current all at once. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, and there\u2019s a famous story of when they were working on the first computer the ENIAC. They had a fault and went to troubleshoot it. They found a short caused by a moth. Ever since then, we\u2019ve used the phrase \u201cto debug the circuit\u201d. The outcome depends on things like: 1) voltage, 2) resistance of the bug, 3) does the bug eat the insulation etc. So it\u2019s hard to generalize the outcome. ",
