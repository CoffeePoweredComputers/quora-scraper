            "answer_text": "Much like with most \u201cshould I study X?\u201d questions, when it comes to computer science the default answer should be an astounding no. Let me reiterate my points: There are far too many \u201cexperts\u201d in the field. If you don\u2019t plan to be really good, better don\u2019t walk into it.The bar is very high. Being \u201cabove average\u201d would by far not be enough.To beat this bar, one would need to put in a lot of effort. It\u2019s not a nine-to-five \u201cjob\u201d to learn some skills and techniques in a few months.The best people who are your prospective peers have put in years worth of late evenings and sleepless nights. They have been incredibly motivated to do it, and your willingness to work hard just won\u2019t nail it.Besides, in computer science the difference between good and great is literally orders of magnitude. If you\u2019re flipping burgers, or driving an Uber, it\u2019s okay to be just okay. In IT, especially in software development and data science, being \u201cokay\u201d would get you nowhere: you\u2019ll be a relatively skilled kayaker among nuclear subs.I hate to say it, but, stoicism and persistence aside, talent matters too. I don\u2019t know of a single person who\u2019s really good at computer science but did not show significant analytical abilities in elementary and middle school.Contrary to what some modern feminists may think of me, I am not making a statement one has to be at least somewhat autistic, or have at least some for of Asperger's in order to reach the tops when it comes to computer science. But it\u2019s essential to have one\u2019s sense of beauty trigger well aligned with understanding algorithms, Unix design principles, and realtime dataflows in order to be even barely noticeable in the field of or related to computer science. If logical, arithmetic, and physics puzzles did not fascinate you before you entered the two-digit age then, chances are, it\u2019s not for you. Some humans can\u2019t sing. Some can\u2019t paint. Some can\u2019t produce babies. And some can\u2019t grasp computer science.* * * In an effort to make the answer deliver a point on a bit deeper level, go through these two pieces. If they don\u2019t resonate with your mindset deeply enough to forfeit everything else, you would very well be better off not entering the computer science field altogether.   ",

            "answer_text": "I was asking this exact question 3 years ago and no one really gave me a satisfactory answer. In fact, I was still asking this question AFTER I had been accepted for the CS program at the University of my choice. I was just out of High School and was really interested in artificial intelligence and data analytics. I did some research and realized there was a fair bit of math involved. Now I was never really great at Math. I always managed above average marks but I had to put in HOURS to get them. I probably spent as much time on math as I did on all the other subjects combined and I aced all those other subjects. I just didn't get math. Anyway, I applied for a CS degree, and got in. I'm now in my sixth semester (only 2 left. yay! ) The thing you need to know is that there are lots of different math courses in a CS degree. Some, you may not get at all; I took 2 Calculus courses, I got a C+ on both of them. But there are other math courses that I took that I didn't find particularly hard like Linear Algebra, Discrete math, Probability and statistics, Numerical analysis; I got As in those. Just because you\u2019re not very good at high school math doesn't mean you\u2019re not going to be good at all these courses. And that's not even the point. Computer science is a VAST field. There are so many things you can do without math or with only a basic understanding of math. From Computer networking to Computer architecture to web/app development, operating systems. There is a lot to choose from. Unless you plan on getting into research, don't expect to be sitting at a desk solving differential equations all day. In the last three years, I\u2019ve worked as a web developer, created programming courses, worked at a robotics lab, worked at a Computer vision and AI lab (there was math here, but it wasn\u2019t very hard) and done some freelance projects here and there. So if the only thing that's stopping you from getting a CS degree is math, then don\u2019t even sweat it. I'm sure you\u2019ll get through it. Wish you all the best. UPDATE: It has been 3 years since I wrote this answer. I completed my degree 2 years ago and had multiple job offers before I graduated. I even built my final project in the Virtual Reality domain, which was very math heavy, but I got through it because it was an interesting idea. I am now employed full time as a Software Engineer and have built enterprise software used by the likes of Intel, Unity, GE and Shell. I have never felt disadvantaged in my career due to my aversion for math and I\u2019m very satisfied with my career choice. This is for all the people out there who are contemplating a career in tech but are reluctant because they aren\u2019t good at math or aren\u2019t \u2018techy\u2019 enough. Take it it from some one who has \u2018been there, done that\u2019. JUST DO IT ! Give it your best shot, dont use your fear of math as an excuse for complacency. Study hard. Then, If you dont like or understand the parts in your degree related to math, know that the majority of tech jobs only require rudimentary mathematical knowledge. ",
