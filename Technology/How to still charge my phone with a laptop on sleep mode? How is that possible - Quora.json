            "answer_text": "Some laptops are designed to continue to provide power to the USB ports when they\u2019re in sleep mode. Some are further designed to only do this when the laptop itself is plugged in, or in some cases allow the user to change a BIOS setting that allows it to power USB from its own (larger) battery, precisely so the user can charge a device over USB from the laptop even while not actively in use. There\u2019s no particular magic to it, it simply uses its own internal battery in that event, and will stop charging the device if its own battery gets too low. ",

            "answer_text": "There are various levels of sleep, some levels on some machines leave the usb port energized so when you come out of sleep the hardware doesn\u2019t have to re-mount Both of my laptops keep the usb port active and my phone charges in sleep, don\u2019t know what you\u2019d have to change to get yours doing it Make sure you\u2019re not entering hibernate instead of sleep, that mode cannot keep the usb port active ",

For some hardware configurations it will be utterly impossible.For other configurations it is not enabled, but can be enabled with firmware changes. The update may come from a hack someone online found or from the manufacturer.It may have been factory enabled by the manufacturer.",
