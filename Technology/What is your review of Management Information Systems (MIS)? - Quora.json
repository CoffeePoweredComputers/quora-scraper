            "answer_text": "It is extremely good! MIS is one of the best degrees that you can get right now because it provides you with the exceedingly rare combination of computer science and finance/accounting skills. I have a Bachelor\u2019s in MIS, and I received two job offers from a large bank with very attractive pay. I am currently pursuing a Master\u2019s in MIS where the job placement rate is 100% and the starting salaries range from 60\u2013100k per year. MIS is just as lucrative (if not more than) Computer Science. You can't go wrong with either degree. ",

            "answer_text": "I think MIS is a good degree to have, however it has challenges and drawbacks. I graduated with MIS degree and got a job related to my field. Depending on the structure of the MIS program, it can help you understand the back end/lower level or the high end/upper level of the structure. I would recommend MIS if you are passionate/care about business and want to look at business through the lense of IT. ",
