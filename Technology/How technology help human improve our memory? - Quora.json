Or write the names of the appps that's you're daily using. We can't but our partners can list some 100 or 200 names of Thier daily using things. What is the first name occurred in ur mind when I say to find this place. Google map right. But we forget that this Google map can't give those care and accurate information we're we can get from the other unknown person s. Where you like search about products what you want. Amazon right But can you remember those days were you're hole family members use to visit no matter it's nearby place and pick as per their wish and bargain for that one product and get back to home with peace. Now a days we drink green tea for no use But we're are those days were we just be alright by place our head on our mother or father leg and their hands komb our hair and we forgot anything and feeling like out of the world. I can list of more were the technologies make us to do and want to become one of them. I m not against all but some thing which we created to terminate us which we do so. It's like a same thing that you rip off your hands then I give a robotic hands to help yourself. We Become so handicap with this technologies Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "The 10% theory of mine should answer the question, but it has to be tested in a lab, its in the bottom half of this original question. This is relevant to what you were asking in your question. This is going to be the greatest neuroscience project. I am currently trying to find a way to build a human memory erasing machine, that uses a modified gamma knife machine, to ionize micron cubic sized groups of neurons in the brain. It would be tested safely on animals first. Could this technique be safer to use than electroconvulsive therapy, at erasing specific memories from people with PTSD. The next step in Andre Fenton's work is to erase spatial memories specifically in a mouses brain using a modified gamma knife machine. The steps to doing this technique is below.The yet to be built INUMAC MRI machine (for imaging Neuro disease Using high-field MR, And Contrastophores) can image a area of about 0.1mm, or 1000 neurons, and see changes occuring as fast as one-tenth of a second.It would allow much more precise functional imaging of the brain at work, than is currently available. You cannot really discriminate what is happening in the brain at the level of a few hundred neurons.Combine the INUMAC with the latest CT scanners.With the latest CT scanners, the final picture is far more detailed than an X-ray image.Inside the CT scanner is a X-ray detector which can see hundreds of different levels of density.Combine the INUMAC, and latest CT scanners with Magnetoencephalography (MEG), and Electroencephalogram (EEG) to see the electro signals, happening in real Magnetoencephalography, the SERF (spin exchange relaxation free) magnetometer in being investigated for future machines.This will help increase the accuracy of the electro signal in the brain.Now you have both BOLD, and electro and chemical signals to deduce what neurons hold which specific spatial memory.Modify a Gamma Knife machine, currently the ball lenses need to be worked on to ionize micron sized groups of neurons, in cubic areas in the brain.Remember a gamma wave can pass through something as small as an gamma knife surgery they ionize tumors in the brain the size of a pea, so ionizing a cubic area in the brain of around 20 microns would be way safer than gamma knife surgery.The diagram for this modified gamma knife is in the download below at the bottom of this page. The way the modified gamma knife machine works is it just uses two to twenty five beams.But two beams will make the smallest meet are in the center where the gamma waves beams intensity is the strongest to ionize the cells. The two gamma knife beams are adjusted in width by the collimater, to ionize groups of neurons in cubic sized area in the brain.Two gamma knife beams are best to use to make a smaller meet area in the center, but more than two beams can be used if it helps better with ionization of a cubic area of a group of neurons. How long the groups of neurons need to be ionized is also a factor in ionization.A neuroscientist may say \" you need to find very group of neurons associated with a specific memory, and then you would need to ionize every group of neurons associated with that memory to erase that specific memory.\" You do not need to find EVERY group of neurons in the brain that holds a specific memory. Ionizing SOME of the groups of neurons is enough to disrupt a specific memory. And here is how you do it.You look for the groups of neurons that hold the bad memory on the INUMAC MRI, and FMRI, CT EEG, and MEG technology. You find the bad memories, by asking the person to recollect the bad memory. When you have identified which groups of neurons could hold the bad memories.You ask the person to recollect the bad memory, as you ionize the neurons associated with the bad memory, you keep asking the person to recollect the bad memory, the more you ionize, the more hazy the bad memory becomes to the person, as you ask him to recollect it. So gradually the bad memory should be erased, but the point is you did not need to find, and ionize EVERY group of neurons in the brain to erase the bad memory. Which would be like finding a needle in a forest. So what you have done here is you have stopped the neurons from communication with each other to make a complete working bad memory to the person. By ionizing SOME of the neurons you have disrupted the neurons communication process with each other that forms the bad memory to the person. Is it better the person leaves confused, and things in his mind not making a little sense, or the person being severely depressed with PTSD. Of all the neurons that hold the bad memory just ionizing less than 10% of the groups of neurons, could be enough to disrupt the communication process between these neurons to successfully erase a memory. This is a lot more safer than electroconvulsive therapy it can cause confusion, and memory loss, of either good memories, or memories of important this you should know. and this technique with INUMAC, and FMRI, and a modified gamma knife is more specific, at erasing the bad memories, and leaving the good memories, and memories of things you need to know.ZIP (Zeta Inhibitory Peptide), and Optogenetics is never going to work in a human. ZIP (Zeta Inhibitory Peptide) would almost wipe a persons memory out.In Gamma Knife surgery they ionize a area in the brain the size of a pea, I want to ionize a cubic area a few microns in size, so this would be way less dangerous than gamma knife surgery.Also gamma waves may not need to be used, X-rays could be used to ionize the groups of neurons, which would be more safer. Safety is the most important priority in this idea. This idea to erase specific memories, is a option that is a safer, more specific technique better than electroconvulsive therapy. Stanford scientists have demonstrated a technique for observing hundreds of neurons firing in the brain of a live mouse, in real time, and have linked that activity to long-term information storage. The unprecedented work could provide a useful tool for studying new therapies for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. The researchers first used a gene therapy approach to cause the mouse's neurons to express a green fluorescent protein that was engineered to be sensitive to the presence of calcium ions. When a neuron fires, the cell naturally floods with calcium ions. Calcium stimulates the protein, causing the entire cell to fluoresce bright green. A tiny microscope implanted just above the mouse's hippocampus \u2013 a part of the brain that is critical for spatial and episodic memory \u2013 captures the light of roughly 700 neurons. The microscope is connected to a camera chip, which sends a digital version of the image to a computer screen. The computer then displays near real-time video of the mouse's brain activity as a mouse runs around a small enclosure, which the researchers call an arena. The neuronal firings look like tiny green fireworks, randomly bursting against a black background, but the scientists have deciphered clear patterns in the chaos. \"We can literally figure out where the mouse is in the arena by looking at these lights,\" said Mark Schnizer, an associate professor of biology and of applied physics. When a mouse is scratching at the wall in a certain area of the arena, a specific neuron will fire and flash green. When the mouse scampers to a different area, the light from the first neuron fades and a new cell sparks up. \"The hippocampus is very sensitive to where the animal is in its environment, and different cells respond to different parts of the arena,\" Schnitzer said. \"Imagine walking around your office. Some of the neurons in your hippocampus light up when you're near your desk, and others fire when you're near your chair. This is how your brain makes a representative map of a space.\" The group has found that a mouse's neurons fire in the same patterns even when a month has passed between experiments. \"The ability to come back and observe the same cells is very important for studying progressive brain diseases,\" Schnitzer said. For example, if a particular neuron in a test mouse stops functioning, as a result of normal neuronal death or a neurodegenerative disease, researchers could apply an experimental therapeutic agent and then expose the mouse to the same stimuli to see if the neuron's function returns. Although the technology can't be used on humans, mouse models are a common starting point for new therapies for human neurodegenerative diseases, and Schnitzer believes the system could be a very useful tool in evaluating pre-clinical research. If you combined my modified gamma knife machine idea, to ionize neurons in the mouses brain, in this experiment you could prove my 10% theory that you do not need to find, and ionize EVERY neuron associated with a spatial memory. You just need to ionize 10% of the neurons associated with a specific spatial memory, to erase the memory. Proving this theory that you do not need to find, and ionize every neuron in the brain to erase a bad memory, ids the next step in the experiment done by Andre Fenton Andre Fenton erased spatial memories in mice using ZIP (Zeta Inhibitory Peptide) but it cannot erase memories specifically, it would be more a more advanced experiment based on his experiment with the mouse in the placement avoidance task. Memories appear to be created as changes of a few molecules made in selected synapses dispersed throughout many brain regions, and not in whole neurons, nor in sets of neurons located next to each other. You might be able to deduce by ionizing neurons at micron scales, how memories are consolidated in this technique. Also if you can help I am requesting a grant for this modified gamma knife to be built from a University , as well as a internship to start building this prototype gamma knife, and start doing this experiment. Most Neuroscientists are either not interested in this project, or to busy with their own projects to build a prototype. This is what is stopping this technique from happening. ",
