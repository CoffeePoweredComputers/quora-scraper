            "answer_text": "No. The real threat to humanity is organized religion. Particularly in the United States, the religious folk have infiltrated policy makers and government offices at nearly the very top of our government [VP Pence- Trump has no religion whatever]. They believe it is hubris to think that mere mankind is capable of altering their god\u2019s planet.  Senator Snowball, R. Square Flat State*, explains his screwey religious theory as to why global warming is a hoax, \u201cOnly God can alter his Earth!\u201d Apparently the good senator does not comprehend that the Earth has two hemispheres: When it is record breaking hot down under, it is winter up in Washington DC! *Senator Jim Inhofe, R, Oklahoma frmr chair on a Senate Environmental committee. Well surprise surprise, turns out Humans are GREAT at destroying ecologies and extincting species. in the last fifty years, we have ushered in the Sixth Great Extinction!  Then too, each of the Abrahamic religions extol their followers to \u201cgo out and multiply\u201d as well as to spread their particular sky daddy message, but also to increase profits for the heads of the various temples, mosques, and churches.  [Orthodox] Jews, Christians, and Muslims all push for large, fecund families. The Catholics take the reproductive cake on that one: Pope still says \u201cAids bad, condoms worse.\u201d So they are not only mindless breeders [in the face of dwindling natural resources] but anti science [just ask Galileo about the Sun and the Pope]. As comedian Jim Jeffries says, We are all on a train, humanity is, and the religious are holding back progress. If we could just usher them all into the back of the train, pull the coupler, and be on our way, everyone would be a lot happier. [of course the way He said it it was very funny] ",

            "answer_text": "No. Fatalism is. Every major increase in total wealth has occurred by humans using more energy. The fact is, we are currently maximizing our production of fossil fuels. We can\u2019t reasonably use more than we already do. The only way we keep our planet safe and our lives long is if we find a new source of energy, and that source of energy is solar. Why solar? Because it is already everywhere. Because it already gives us so much energy (in the form of heat) that we actually spend energy to get rid of the thermal energy the sun gave us (air conditioning). There are dozens upon dozens of new recent technologies that, when paired with green energy, solar first and foremost, would allow local communities to take back control of their own energy generation. Local jobs, local profits, local development. Some involve molten-salt batteries to store renewable energy for later use: New Thermal Battery Could Be A 'Game Changer' For Storing Renewable Energy A South Australian company has unveiled the world\u2019s first operational thermal energy device (TED). The TED creators report the battery can store renewable energy, has higher storage capacity than traditional batteries, and is completely recyclable. The thermal battery has similar functionality to lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries; it can take any form of electrical input and create alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC). Unlike existing batteries, it can charge and discharge at the same time, according to Serge Bondarenko, chief executive officer from CCT Energy Storage. And rather than storing an electrical charge, it converts the electrical input to heat. \u201cIt\u2019s a device that takes any form of electrical input on the front end and converts that to thermal energy,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe use silicon as our phase-change material, melt it and store the heat from that.\u201d Housing to use thermal battery for energy storage CCT Energy Storage will use its thermal battery, or Thermal Energy Device (TED), at homes being developed by Eco Build & Renewables to store cheap power using a phase change material. It demonstrated its first system, a 24kW TED, in March this year. Some involve using carbon-based photovoltaic materials to lower manufacturing costs and allow the panels to be flexible: Organic solar cells set new energy record Manufacturers have long used silicon to make solar panels because the material was the most efficient at converting sunlight into electricity. But organic photovoltaics, made from carbon and plastic, promise a cheaper way of generating electricity. The term organic relates to the fact that carbon-based materials are at the heart of these devices, rather than silicon. The square or rectangular solid solar panels that most of us are familiar with, require fixed installation points usually on roofs or in flat fields. Organic photovoltaics (OPV) can be made of compounds that are dissolved in ink so they can be printed on thin rolls of plastic, they can bend or curve around structures or even be incorporated into clothing. Commercial solar photovoltaics usually covert 15-22% of sunlight, with a world record for a silicon cell of 27.3% reached in this summer in the UK. Organics have long lingered at around half this rate, but this year has seen some major leaps forward. In April researchers were able to reach 15% in tests. Now this new study pushes that beyond 17% with the authors saying that up to 25% is possible. This is important because according to estimates, with a 15% efficiency and a 20 year lifetime, organic solar cells could produce electricity at a cost of less than 7 cents per kilowatt-hour. This is what technology always promises: new ways to live better. Is anyone really surprised when we find out that technology has kept advancing? So the question is this: who profits by you not using this technology? The biggest names in the energy business \u2014 the oil companies, the coal companies, the gas companies \u2014 cannot profit from this technology. They can\u2019t profit from these technologies for the same reason why they can\u2019t stop the sun from shining. They saw the writing on the wall decades ago, and they knew, even way back then, that the only way they would still be profitable today is if they stopped investment in solar energy, kept people doubting that solar is profitable, prevented people from making their own electricity from sunlight. And the way they did that is by spreading the idea: first, that climate change does not exist; then, that climate change is not actually a problem; and now, that climate change cannot be reversed anyway. They are the ones who profit from your decision not to look forward to the day when you can create your own electricity yourself, at home or in your own local community. You are the target audience for their fatalism. That fatalism that they invented, is the real threat to mankind right now. ",
