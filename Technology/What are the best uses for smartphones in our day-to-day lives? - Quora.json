Here I'm telling you few advance uses of smartphone in daily life Measure your heart health AliveCor\u2019s Kardia mobile heart monitor is smaller than a credit card and takes just 30 seconds to capture your EKG and tell you if your heart rhythm is normal. Prevent drunk driving The compact keychain device measures the alcohol present on your breath in just five seconds, then wirelessly sends your BAC reading to smartphone. The included app predicts how long it will take for your levels to return to 0 percent. It can even call an Uber for you! Remind you to drink enough waterYes, I'm talking about hidrate spark.

Name that group as Vocab builder or which ever you likeMake a group of 2\u20133 members, as soon as group is created remove all the members from that group. What you will see that the only member is you now. Voila ! now you can use that group asa personal diary in which you can write your day to day experiencesA to-do-listas a plannerBut remember that there is no such thing as Whatsapp is a necessity now a days.
