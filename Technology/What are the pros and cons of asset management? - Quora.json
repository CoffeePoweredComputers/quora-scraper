            "answer_text": "Hello, Asset management is the process of developing, operating, maintaining, and selling asset in a cost-effective manner. Most commonly used in finance, the term is used in reference to individuals or firms that manage assets on behalf of other entities. There are several reasons why businesses should be concerned about asset management. 1. Enables a firm to keep tabs on all of its assets:- The process makes it easy for organizations to keep track of their assets, whether liquid or fixed. Firm owners will know where the assets are located, how they are being put to use, and whether there are changes made to them. Consequently, the recovery of assets can be done more efficiently, hence, leading to higher returns. 2. Helps guarantee the accuracy of amortization rates:- Since assets are checked on a regular basis, the process of asset managment ensures that the financial statements associated with them are kept updated. 3. Helps identify and manage risks:- Asset management encompasses the identification and management of risks that arise from the utilization and ownership of certain assets. It means that a firm will always be prepared to counter any risk that comes its way. 4. Removes ghost assets in the company\u2019s inventory:- Instances exist where lost, damaged, or stolen assets are still recorded on the books. With a strategic asset management plan, the firm\u2019s owners will be aware of the assets that have been lost and, thus, not keep recording them in the books.  ",
