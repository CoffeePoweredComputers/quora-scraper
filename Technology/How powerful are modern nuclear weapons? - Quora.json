            "answer_text": "Taken from another answer of mine \u2026the footnotes will take you there for references. Multi Megaton Weapons Now Obsolete What has changed that the world no longer is building megaton weapons? The need for multi-megaton weapons was the result of low accuracy of warhead delivery on target\u2026. we needed a sledgehammer approach to take out hardened targets and the way that was done was through very high yield bombs >=5 MT typically. The average nuclear weapon size today in 2017 is about 443 KT at full yield but a large portion of those bombs can be adjusted in the field to a very small fraction of their potential yield. Today the accuracy of on target delivery has improved significantly ..we hit what we aim for. Making a weapon twice as accurate has the same effect on lethality as making the warhead eight times as powerful. Phrased another way, making the missile twice as precise would only require one-eighth the explosive power to maintain the same lethality. [3] This means we need less hammer to do the same job. In the 1980\u2019s the development of earth penetrating rounds was another game changer. Not only were we on target but now we could penetrate hundreds of feet of earth and concrete before detonating the warhead. This allowed a 100 KT weapon to do the damage of a >1 MT surface detonation. This is the primary method now for targeting hardened targets and is the final driver for smaller yield bombs. (Note that conventional warheads can penetrate 100\u2019s of feet through concrete, nuclear warheads are usually limited to less than 30 ft in concrete due to the complexity of the warhead not surviving further penetration. Soil penetration depth varies with composition but to get full ground coupling of energy only 4 or 5 meters is required) The net effect of the use of EPW\u2019s (Earth Penetrating Weapons) is a reduction in the number of casualties as compared with the number of casualties from a surface burst. This is primarily due to a 96% reduction in the weapon yield needed using an EPW. The greater coupling of the released energy to the ground shock for a buried detonation is the same as a surface burst with 25 times the explosive energy. For rural targets, the use of a nuclear earth-penetrator weapon is estimated to reduce casualties by a factor of 10 to 100 relative to a nuclear surface burst of equivalent probability of damage.[4] To exploit that efficiency, in 1997 the US replaced its aging 9-megaton bombs with a lower-yield but earth-penetrating 300-kt model by putting the nuclear warhead from an earlier bomb design into a strengthened alloy-steel casing and a new nose cone. [5]  Pictured above is the first US precision guided EPW tactical nuclear gravity bomb. The B61-12 is designed to have four selectable explosive yields: 0.3 kilotons (kt), 1.5 kt, 10 kt and 50 kt. The B61-12 will be integrated on virtually all nuclear-capable U.S. and NATO aircraft: B-2, LRS-B (next-generation long-range bomber), F-35A, F-16, F-15E, and PA-200 Tornado.[6] Continued from above\u2026\u2026 To fully appreciate this evolution consider a targeting scenario as it was in the 1970\u2019s as compared to 2020. In the 1970\u2032s a hardened silo target required multiple megaton bombs to destroy a 1000 psi rated silo. Since weapons accuracy was no better than 200\u2013300 yards you needed surface burst weapons greater than 1 megaton to take out the target. Now advance to the early 2000\u2019s. That same target can be destroyed with a 70 kt EPW with a 100 yard accuracy. Fast forward to 2020 and that target can be taken out with a 1 kt EPW weapon with an accuracy of 10 meters. It isn\u2019t the same nuclear war we grew up under its familiar shadow. It is completely different. [7]  The US Mega-tonnage peaked in 1960 and has been in decline ever since while Russia\u2019s stockpile peaked in 1989 at over 3 times the US arsenal at that time.[8] ",

            "answer_text": "As \u2018powerful\u2019 as they NEED to be. Both the USA and Russian Federation usually have a feature in their weapons called \u201cDial-a-Yield\u201d, wherein various stages of the two-part process usually found in a thermonuclear weapon can be altered and/or interrupted to reduce from the full possible yield. Why that feature? It permits design and manufacture of a common weapon which is simpler to maintain and administer, to use against a greater variety of targets without causing UNINTENDED (\u201cCollateral\u201d) damage. For example, a W76 warhead, the most common type used by the US Navy in it\u2019s SSBNs atop its Trident II D5 missiles, can be dialed down to as \u2018low\u2019 as 5 kT (still quite a \u2018bang\u2019). The days of the 10 to 20 MT \u201cCity Busters\u201d are long gone, as the few of them that could be (singly) delivered by an ICBM had a Circular Error Probable, or CEP, of two or three MILES, so a large weapon was necessary to ensure the destruction of a high priority target. The existence of these weapons also had a great \u2018fear\u2019 factor. However, since use of even one might simply trigger an all-out retaliatory strike against our own population centers, we were understandably reluctant to use them at all, and to see weapons which could be more \u2018selective\u2019. Accuracy, rather than raw yield, is a greater factor in a nuclear weapon\u2019s effectiveness. ",
