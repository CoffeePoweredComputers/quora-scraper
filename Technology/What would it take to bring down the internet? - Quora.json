            "answer_text": "Is it possible?  Yes. but it is highly unlikely.  The internet as a whole is a framework of many independent networks controlled, run and maintained by different people and institutions. It is designed to be redundant which implies that even if one portion of this huge network goes down other users can still access their destination in most cases. But there are some examples of large scale shut down -  In late 2006 Asia experienced a series of earthquakes that damaged undersea cables that caused wide Internet and phone related issues in that part of the world. However, the remainder of the world still had access to the Internet. Governments can setup firewalls and other protection schemes to prevent users from accessing pages on the Internet or totally block access to the Internet.  For example, in 2011 the Egypt government shut down the Internet several times during protests to prevent any information leaking out onto the Internet. However, even during this strict shutdown, citizens were still able to find ways to access the Internet.  Sources : How Egypt shut down the internet - Telegraph; Worst Internet disasters of the decade  Further if you see this TED talk - The Internet could crash. We need a Plan B given by Internet pioneer Danny Hillis you get inclined to think that yes this is possible. Danny believes that internet wasn't designed for this kind of scale, and urges that we should be ready with a plan B. Also see : Knowing How the Global Internet Works - And How It Can Crash There is a Reddit thread that discusses this same question - Can the Internet (or at least the World Wide Web) crash, or fail globally? What could cause that?   Skeptics of a large-scale Internet crash scenario have plenty of ammunition for their argument. After all, what we call the Internet is actually a network of millions of other networks, massively redundant, the most sophisticated communications matrix in the history of technology. There's no way it can crash. Right? When someone says 'What could cause it?\", the safest reply is that it's exactly what we don't know. It could be anything from a global catastrophe to a new cyber attack that can globally affect computers using the internet.  in any system, it's impossible to root out every conceivable problem. If the circumstances are right, you get a catastrophe. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Any man made network the size and complexity of the Internet will have a handful of major choke points and handfuls of minor choke ones.  As these are removed, the network will fragment into smaller and smaller chunks.  So the question is how much fragmentation would be equivalent to taking down the Internet?  My guess is below ten well chosen points could cause the net to be unusable for most things.   Most, if not all, of these points are fairly well protected in the real and digital world.  Physical damage of that magnitude would mean something so severe that I don't know if the Internet would be our main concern.  Digital damage would require a number of well crafted and highly organized zero day attacks. That said, the Internet is more likely to be harmed by an indiscriminate worm.  It was very noticeable way back in the day of the Morris worm.  If someone were to create an equivalent with a zero day that attacked any of the major components used today, we could be down for days. ",

            "answer_text": "I read somewhere that Anonymous (Hacker Group) is planning to take down Internet on March 31st. Whole plan seems to feasible and if done, huge population will face No-Internet situation (At least non-techs)  Whole statement was as below :  In order to shut the Internet down, one thing is to be done. Down the13 root DNS servers of the Internet. Those servers are as follow: A       198.41.0.4B       192.228.79.201C       192.33.4.12D       128.8.10.90E       192.203.230.10F       192.5.5.241G       192.112.36.4H       128.63.2.53I       192.36.148.17J       192.58.128.30K       193.0.14.129L       199.7.83.42M       202.12.27.33 By cutting these off the Internet, nobody will be able to perform adomain name lookup, thus, disabling the HTTP Internet, which is,after all, the most widely used function of the Web. Anybody entering\"http://www.google.com\" or ANY other url, will get an error page,thus, they will think the Internet is down, which is, close enough.Remember, this is a protest, we are not trying to 'kill' the Internet,we are only temporarily shutting it down where it hurts the most. While some ISPs uses DNS caching, most are configured to use a lowexpire time for the cache, thus not being a valid failover solutionin the case the root servers are down. It is mostly used for speed,not redundancy. We have compiled a Reflective DNS Amplification DDoS tool to be used forthis attack. It is based on AntiSec's DHN, contains a few bugfix, adifferent dns list/target support and is a bit stripped down for speed. The principle is simple; a flaw that uses forged UDP packets is to beused to trigger a rush of DNS queries all redirected and reflected tothose 13 IPs. The flaw is as follow; since the UDP protocol allows it,we can change the source IP of the sender to our target, thus spoofingthe source of the DNS query. The DNS server will then respond to that query by sending the answer tothe spoofed IP. Since the answer is always bigger than the query, theDNS answers will then flood the target ip. It is called an amplifiedbecause we can use small packets to generate large traffic. It is calledreflective because we will not send the queries to the root name servers,instead, we will use a list of known vulnerable DNS servers which willattack the root servers for us. DDoS request --->       [Vulnerable DNS Server  ]       <---> Normal client requests                                                       \\                                                        | ( Spoofed UDP requests                                                        |   will redirect the answers                                                        |   to the root name server )                                                        |                                        [       13 root servers         ] * BAM Since the attack will be using static IP addresses, it will not relyon name server resolution, thus enabling us to keep the attack up evenwhile the Internet is down. The very fact that nobody will be able tomake new requests to use the Internet will slow down those who will tryto stop the attack. It may only lasts one hour, maybe more, maybe evena few days. No matter what, it will be global. It will be known. ",

The idea behind it was to get the scientists talking about inventions.  However, they had a problem.  The Russians could easily destroy communication methods (blow up a telegraph tower), so  they needed a way around this; the Internet. If a computer is destroyed the whole internet doesn't collapse, in fact if a whole country no longer had internet the rest of the world would be able to communicate. Data is sent around in packets from computer to computer until it reaches its destination. If one computer is broken on the root that a packet is travelling down, then it simply finds another way. Sure it is possible to destroy the internet. But I not sure whether it would be destroyed because something better came along or simply some other massive change in the digital world. ",

It will be complete impossible that anyone can take down the internet as we all know that internet is a source of communication in the modern era and almost all the personal and entrepreneurial work has been integrated with internet. So, i guess neither it can be done nor it shouldn't be. We have been seeing that SOPA and PIPA has been deliberating the internet users and all around the US it was the most popular news in the air. Now, finally the issue has been resolved at some extent and the bill of SOPA and PIPA has been withdrawn :) So, its a good news for everyone for us. Enjoy internet with complete freedom and explore the world of technology :) ",
