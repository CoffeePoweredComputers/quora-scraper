            "answer_text": "It was still hard. Like all schools, obviously they had far fewer applicants at that time. They all (except for Cornell) accepted only male students until the 1970\u2019s (1980\u2019s for Columbia.). However, they always took the smartest students in high schools And that has not really changed. ",
