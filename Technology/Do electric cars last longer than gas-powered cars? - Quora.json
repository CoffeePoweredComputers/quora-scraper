            "answer_text": "They aren't old enough yet to be able to tell. Bodywork is the same as any other car. Well made cars with higher quality thicker steel, or aluminium bodies will last longer (or much longer).Running gear, suspension and the like is likely to need a bit more care as most EVs are heavier than their ICE counterparts.Non-traction electronics, windows, wipers, lights etc are the same.Drivetrain will last much, much longer than IC engines and transmissions. The motors could easily do a million miles maybe more. They have one moving part. There is nothing to go wrong and the motor controllers will only drive them within their capabilities.Batteries. Currently there are 8-9 year old EVs with battery degradation between 8\u201325%. They degrade slower over time too, so you see more degradation early on. But prices have gone from $800/kWh to $100/kWh in 8 years, which means that replacing the batteries gets a lot cheaper every year. Now this might start to tail off, or with production of EV batteries ramping up to really big scale - continue to get cheaper. When your EV is 15 years old, if you still have it (I sold mine at 8 years with 79% battery health for a very satisfactory amount) assuming the other things above haven't failed or have been maintained well, replacing the battery really won't cost as much as you think. You will either get the same capacity pack for much less than you've saved by driving EV over ICE (in reality if you are a higher mileage driver then many times less than you've saved - I saved \u00a32500 over 26k miles) or an enhanced capacity pack for a bit more. The old pack/cells you can sell on and they will still be useful for stationary storage, make yourself a home battery.Conclusion, I expect EVs to be useful vehicles much further into the future than ICE cars. All the IC cars that get scrapped because of engine and transmission failure will be the EVs that are still going strong. Sure some will corrode, so making them out of aluminium or carbon will ensure they have, like aircraft, a long life. Motors and solid state electronics are likely to last a long time. Batteries will degrade but keep getting cheaper and improving, the anticipated cost of replacing them assuming you are the lifetime owner of the car is a fraction of what you save over an ICE car. ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on how you consider the meaning of \u2018lasts\u2019. Does the first major breakdown count as the limit, or do you mean economically repairable, or a major failure perhaps? These are all difficult to define and econmics varies hugely depending on whether you do work your self or pay a dealer/mfr to do it. Ideally a product should never need repaired within its normal life unless you physically damage it. Any parts that wear should be part of service checks and regular replacement. The battery is the main weakness as it does wear out, but there are different levels ranging from 100,000 miles to 3,000,000 miles maybe more depending on technology, management and use. In practice product life varies hugely between companies and products. My favourite ICE engine, a Volvo Redblock will last indefinately, it has been used in various forms since the 60s and is not known for wearing out ever and is hugely strong, capable of some of the highest BHP/Litre ratios available. I also believe it was copied by Nissan, 2 cylinders added to make the 2JZ. It isn\u2019t possible to know if \u201cElectric\u201d will be better than this for several decades, but I doubt it. Average combustion cars are not used much beyond 200,000 miles because of rust, cumulative defects, bad repairs or bad servicing. Electric cars avoid alot of this by not needing maintenance atall, but they are new designs and it only takes a minor design error to cause a unexpected failure after 5 or 10 yrs. Whatever the definition.. as for Electric cars lasting longer, theoretically yes, they have less moving parts, less stress, less heat and less wear. In practice its hard to say for sure but I think the trend will be better. ",

            "answer_text": "I have answered similar questions many time before. All cars will essentially last forever provided you do the require maintenance. By this I mean the schedule maintenance, plus any breakdown maintenance that occurs. We have all seen cars built well over 100 years ago that are still running. The cost of returning them to operating order and keeping them running is invariably large and few people would choose to do this for their daily runabout. However if you are willing to spend the money, they will keep going. Even when spare parts become hard or impossible to get, you can make one offs, but the cost is high. So the life of a car is more around economic decisions that how long they will last. Once we understand this, you can see that EV\u2019s or ICE have no particular advantage, it is more about the design and manufacturing capability of the manufacturers. A reliable well built car of either power train is going to cost less to maintain that a poorly designed and built car of either power train, and hence will be kept in service long. A good start point is to look at consumer reports (USA only) and cars on the top of the list can be expected to last longer and those towards the bottom will last less time as they cost more to keep running. This isn't entirely reliable as once a car reaches a certain age, you can expect to see major repairs with major costs. I suspect that few people are going to want to spend the money on a new EV battery pack once it reaches end of life, and I know of people who have written off an older ICE car after a transmission failure.

            "answer_text": "No, First we have to define how a vehicle die, because, assuming spare parts endless availability, no car, Electric or gas-powered car will die, it can last forever! Usually, we can define the end of age of a car by the \u201cdying\u201d of it\u2019s main components. In a Gas powered car, this is the ICE engine. Modern ICE engines usually lasts from 300,000 KM up to 1,000000 KM, usually it lasts something like 500,000 KM that\u2019s the average now and that\u2019s for gasoline engine. It can last much more for a Diesel engine. An EV main component is the battery, which usually dies at 200,000 KM, some cars needs a new battery even at 100,000 KM. Even with that, replacing or fixing the ICE engine is much cheaper than replacing an EV battery, which can cost 80% of the car price sometimes! While rebuilding an ICE engine usually costs only around 5% of the car price. However, in some countries, most of the cars will die for another reason. For example, in Europe and coastal areas cars got rust long time before engine or battery replacement is needed. ",

Gasoline cars need complicated gear boxes and clutches\u2026those also tend to die at 150,000 miles. Electric cars don\u2019t have gearboxes or clutches\u2026so not a problem. Brakes are another item that end up getting expensive - but with an electric car, you use the brakes MUCH less often because the car uses \u201cregenerative braking\u201d - so there is a good chance that the brakes will last longer than the rest of the car. Then there is the radiator, water pump, gas tank, gas pump, fuel injectors, electronic ignition and so on. All of these parts can fail - but don\u2019t exist in an electric car. ",

Electric cars have batteries and they wear out, but depending on how they are managed, they can last a decade or more with no major issues. It would be at that point whether or not it makes sense to replace the batteries or scrap the vehicle. Gasoline powered cars at 10 years old, if in good condition, will continue to run without major repairs for the most part. ",
