            "answer_text": "If you think about it, an enzyme is simply \u201cany way of making any part of a reaction more likely\u201d. Since RNA can, like protein, fold into many complex shapes, and since RNA, like protein, consists of H-bond donors and acceptors, hydrophobic regions (on the bases), and negative charges (backbone) and in essence, positive charges (Mg++ attracted to PO4\u2014 in backbone), you can pretty much make any surface out of RNA that you could out of protein. Since holding two substrates close together in just the right orientation is a fine way of being an enzyme, you can conceive of an RNA being an enzyme for many, MANY reactions that put together or take apart molecules. Indeed, folks have found RNAs capable of performing all sorts of reactions Method & examples: https://molbio.mgh.harvard.edu/szostakweb/publications/Szostak_pdfs/Wilson_Szostak_Ann_Rev_B_99.pdf ",

            "answer_text": "Also, RNA itself catalyses the reaction joining of amino acids into polypeptides. In fact, ribosomal RNA stripped of proteins performs this reaction, just inefficiently. It was on the cover of Science ~15 years back. Really awesome work. So RNA makes proteins\u2026 cuts and ligates nucleic acids, acts as a genome AND messenger (in viruses), and more. All the above supports the idea that RNA was the primordial living thing. ",
