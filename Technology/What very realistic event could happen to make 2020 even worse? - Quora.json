So we asked the owners daughter (who was supposedly a business major who was gonna take over her dad\u2019s company) if she had a contact number for the structural engineer her dad normally dealt with when having his buildings renovated. She looks at the three of us (me, my assistant superintendent and project manager) and goes \u201cOh yeah! But he\u2019s busy working on my car at the moment.\u201d All three of us.....\u201dWhat?\u201d Her: \u201cYeah he\u2019s working on my engine in my car, why do you guys need him? Engineers work on engines not buildings.\u201d Thumbs Up. ",
