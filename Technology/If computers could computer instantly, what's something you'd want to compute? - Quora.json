I know it\u2019s not useful for anything, but the first thing I\u2019d like to know is the first 1,000,000 digits of Graham\u2019s number. If you can literally do an infinite number of calculations in zero time, I\u2019d also figure out the truth behind Goldbach\u2019s conjecture, the twin prime conjecture, and whether the Euler-Mascheroni constant is irrational. Oh, and you could also test the Riemann hypothesis, too, by plugging in a statement about the integers that is equivalent to the hypothesis. ",
