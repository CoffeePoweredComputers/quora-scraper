            "answer_text": "In the comments section for this question, the original poster wants to create a VoIP system to sell.

One amazing thing with VoIP is it\u2019s move to the cloud. There are several providers in the market that have taken out most of the above mentioned concerns by building their own infrastructure to sell service. Some are even willing and eager to partner with entrepreneurs to provide white label solutions (just Google white label VoIP). Instead of selling XYZ VoIP brand, you\u2019re placing your own and marketing to prospective customers. By partnering in this manner, a lot of the risk is taken out of the equation. Which allows you to focus on selling while developing your reputation in the market. Plus consider how much less the capital requirements are pursuing this route. Over time, you could even revisit the idea of building out infrastructure that you own. The choice is yours to decide. White labeling is an option to consider which can take the pressure off of this incredible journey you\u2019re own. Best wishes and I hope this helps. ",
