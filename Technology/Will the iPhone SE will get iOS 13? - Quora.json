            "answer_text": "Yes, it will. Here are some reasons: iOS releases and the devices they support have been a relatively easy matrix since iOS 8 in 2014. Whenever they drop support for older devices, it typically includes an entire class of their chips (A5, A6, etc). iOS 8 dropped the A4. iOS 10 dropped the A5. iOS 11 dropped the A6. iOS also occasionally is released for the same devices as the previous release. iOS 9 supported all iOS 8 devices. iOS 12 supports all iOS 11 devices. Using the above as a reference, let\u2019s look at the currently supported chipsets. iOS 12 supports anything with an A7 or newer. This means the iPhone 5s, iPad Air, iPad mini 2 and iPad mini 3. When iOS 13 launches, the A7 is likely to lose support. (Though it would be quite impressive if they continued to support the A7). The iPhone SE has an A9 chip, the same as found in the iPhone 6s. Using the above information, we can assume that, in the \u2018worst\u2019 case, the iPhone SE and all A9 iOS devices will get iOS 13 and iOS 14, losing support with iOS 15. However, it\u2019s possible that they may even get iOS 15, assuming 13, 14, or 15 supports all devices from a previous iOS release. ",

Even though the SE is still current, it will most definitely be able to accommodate the new OS of 13.As a side note, when I updated my lowly iPhone 6+ with 16GB of ROM, the new file system created 2.5 GB of optimized space after the upgrade. Way to go Apple! Edit: I just got a text from Quora that my answerer had been distributed over 1,000 times! I'm truly humbled and amazed at the same time. I'm just guy who likes to read about Apple and tech in general with a little splash of motorcycling thrown in for good measure. I appreciate and respect the Quora community especially Mr. Chuck Rogers. I've learned a lot from that man that I could never pay back. Thank You Chuck! I'd like to think my writing skills are improving as I answerer more and diverse questions. Thank God for spell check! And thank all of you for asking your questions. For without you, we'd be scribbling notes to each other. Remember, the only dumb question is the one you don't ask. ",
