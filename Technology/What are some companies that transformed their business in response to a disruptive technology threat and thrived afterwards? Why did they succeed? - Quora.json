            "answer_text": "Disruption is an ongoing concern for competitive businesses. They worry that rivals will disrupt the business model and unsettle the industry. Wrong assestment can happen. Think about the Polaroid Corporation: They were the image pioneers in the 1960s, but they did not make the necessary innovation in the 1990s, when digital photography overtook film. As a result, their business failed. Here are two major companies that used disruptive innovation to transform their industries. Netflix They started as a company supplying DVD mailouts. Netflix was offering a cost effective and convenient product to an area of the market that was previously overlooked. By targeting people who were movie buffs but not necessarily interested in new releases, Netflix was providing a tailored product to a specific group of people. As a result, Netflix did not pose a threat for Blockbuster at the beginning. But, after their initial success, Netflix were bold to disrupt its own business model, and break into streaming media. This move allowed them to enter in the same competitive space as Blockbuster, and eventually pushing them out of the market. Their latest disruptive endeavour was in 2013 when Netflix entered the production business. Netflix proved that they have what it takes to cope with disruption, and to innovate and succeed. iTunes 2001 was the year of the iPod, a portable media player that could hold an average of 1,000 songs. A range of other similar devices already existed and although the iPod was considered as a better product, it did not target a new market. However, it was the combination of the iPod and the simultaneous release of iTunes that brought a fresh disruption, opening up new ways of buying and playing music. It made iPod users into purchasing music from the iTunes store but more importantly, it offered convenience and a lower price point. Apple used Internet\u2019s disruptive innovation to change the foundations of the way people listened to music. As a result, Walkmans, CDs, MP3 players and record stores today are considered ancient history. ",
