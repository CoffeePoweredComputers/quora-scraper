            "answer_text": "There is a recent test and review of the Nikon Z mount 24-70 mm 2.8. It is not cheap, but the conclusion is that it is on par with really good, and I mean outstanding prime lenses, compared at focal length 24, 35, 50, 70 mm, the last one compared with a 85 mm lens. I think this should be one of the best in its class. ",
