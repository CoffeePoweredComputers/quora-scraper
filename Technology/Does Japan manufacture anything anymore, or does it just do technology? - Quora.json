            "answer_text": "I am not so sure of what you mean with the question. Do you mean if Japan still makes stuff other than electronic appliances, phones and cars? In that case yes, clothes, pottery, toys and an array of daily use are made here in Japan. Now I imagine this question aimed a bit more to ask if Japan still used manpower to make all the stuff that is made in Japan, instead of just putting up robots or mechanical arms for everything. And again yes humans still do a major part of the work. Assembly lines use a lot of mechanical aids to lessen human errors, However there are things that require extreme precision (like making a special kind of screws) that have to be done by humans, because even now, the human instinct, based on the experience of the craftsman/mechanic/worker, has a smaller error margin than any other machine.

            "answer_text": "Yes. They are still manufacturing products with high added values. Japan is still the third largest manufacture country in the world after China and the U.S. Manufacture industry of Japan is very competitive on sub sectors such as, chemistry,material, mechanical, automobile, medicine and steel.
