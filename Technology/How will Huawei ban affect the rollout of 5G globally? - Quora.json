            "answer_text": "Very minimal because HuaWei produces her own chipset, transmission, power, radio, core, switches and routers, uses UNIX and open source OS for her servers and software. It is mobile handset that has slight issue. Google has stopped HuaWei usage but recently has flip flopped quietly on HuaWei using their mobile OS. HuaWei is still moving on the launch of their own mobile OS \u2026. Hongmen But on May31st these guys flip flop on their announcements. SD associationsWiFi AllianceBluetooth SIGGoogle android Qit might be due to HuaWei holding certain patents in these associations\u2026 meaning if they ban HuaWei then these American associations have to stop using these standards and immediately make changes to their existing standards (take out HuaWei patents would take time and in the meantime everyone has to stop producing WiFi, Bluetooth, SD products) \u2026. MAD scenario Also China is creating a unreliable list (similar to US entity list) to target companies, associations and individuals who harm Chinese interest because of dirty politics. Also a couple of days ago FedEx was caught diverting 4 parcel to America which were(2 from Japan, 2 from Vietnam) supposed to be deliver to HuaWei. The excuse they used were really unconvincing thus the Chinese government has officially started a probe into this FedEx affair.(Same thing like what USA did during Project Prism\u2026 Edward Snowden via Wikileaks) If China would prevent American companies to use 5G (over 1/3 of all 5G patents are held by China) then most American firms would be permanently harmed beyond repair. There is no way Americans can come out with their own standards in a couple of years time (All American telecommunications manufacturers have either been bought over or bankrupted long ago \u2026 Motorola, Harris telecommunication, Lucent Technologies ). Even their 3G /4G would be affected by China\u2019s patent. Unless America comes out with a new law and steal Chinese patents. ",

            "answer_text": "Remember that the Huawei nonsense is part of the warmonger Bolton\u2019s attack on Iran. Nothing to do with any rational consideration of the issues. Nations that want 5G at the best price and quality as soon as possible will choose Huawei. Nations whose governments are captured by the 5 Eyes Consortium of spooks will choose other suppliers willing to allow the NSA Prism system to snoop on you and me. The interface between Huawei kit and the kit from Cisco and others will be tricky. The spooks will want to have an \u201cair gap\u201d between their network and the rest. This is probably technologically and organizationally clumsy and expensive. I suggest that as the USA - China trade war limps to a conclusion, the US will suddenly discover it was all a bad dream, and Huawei does not pose any risk whatsoever that is UNIQUE to it, compared to 5G AND \u201cThe Internet of Things\u201d. They will put Huawei into the basket of goods that they can argue about with China. ",
