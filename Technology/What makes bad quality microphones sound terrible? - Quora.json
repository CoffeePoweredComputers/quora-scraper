            "answer_text": "A microphone could sound \u201cbad\u201d to a user because inadequate isolation of the capsule causes too much handling noise or vibrations traveling up the stand to be picked up. Microphones that were not engineered for a smooth frequency response will sharply boost or cut some frequencies in a way that can\u2019t easily be corrected. That having been said, there are a number of applications or technique errors that can cause sub-optimal results: Today, even modestly priced condenser microphones have specifications that can look great on paper. However, if these microphones are used in a radio studio, they end up suffering from \u201cplosives\u201d (low frequency transients) when sounds like \u201cb\u201d or \u201cp\u201d are spoken. Part of this is a technique issue (and it will be most severe with guests who have no experience in talking on a microphone). This can be largely corrected by putting a windscreen on the microphone and attenuating frequencies below about 80\u2013100 Hz.Microphones designed for use with public address or intercom systems are designed to have a restricted frequency response. Frequencies outside of the range of about 300 Hz to 3 kHz are considered non-critical to the intelligibility of the human voice. Reproducing these non-essential frequencies is considered a waste of amplifier power\u2014particularly if the frequency response of the speakers were limited, as well, as would be the case with PA horn speakers. If one of these microphones were used in a recording or broadcast application, the sound might be described as \u201cbad,\u201d even though the microphone meets the design goals for its intended application.Microphones designed for two-way radio use are similar to public address microphones, although the frequency response curve may have additional enhancements to complement that of the radios with which the microphone might be paired.Microphones designed for computers or tape recorders is likely to be designed primarily for low cost, and it might be designed with the assumption that the user has no knowledge of the nuances of microphone technique.A microphone that is insufficiently directional may pick up excessive amounts of reverberations and ambient noise.A microphone that is too directional might result in inadequate pickup of sounds that are intended to be picked up.",

            "answer_text": "In my mind, there\u2019s no such thing as a bad mic, it\u2019s about bad application. I\u2019ve had my share of application problems. For example, I once thought that my non powered condenser would work with a powered PA speaker I have. My simple SM58 style microphones will work with the powered speaker, but in this case I got a really low signal on my condenser. The condenser just isn\u2019t made for such an application. I also tried my condenser mic with my Tascam MP3 recorder with the same results. Even when I tweaked my recorder settings I still had problems. So, I went the opposite route. I bought a glorified lavalier microphone (it has condenser like housing) and it worked like a charm. It\u2019s low quality helped a lot because it reduced crowd noise. The soundtrack to this video was made using that setup.  ",
