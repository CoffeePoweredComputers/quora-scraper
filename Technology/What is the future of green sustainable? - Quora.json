            "answer_text": "Short answer, not yet. Consider this, if you base more than ten or fifteen percent of your power grid on wind, you are guaranteed to have brown-outs. Wind is not a constant. I lecture on the past, present, and future of renewable energy. While perovskite-based solar panels are showing a glimmer of promise, the big game-changer will be fusion. If we can crack that nut, then who needs wind? Solar always will be with us. It is vital as a form distributed power generation, especially off-grid. Ever seen one of these?  That\u2019s a solar powered refrigerator. It allows for the proper storage of heat sensitive drugs like insulin. It can go anywhere and save lives wherever it goes. Most of the so-called green initiatives are highly inefficient and thoroughly overpriced. For instance, most household recycling is a sham. Many folks dutifully wash out their used containers before placing them in the bin. Typically they use hot water. The waste of water and heating energy totally outweighs the value of recycling. Here\u2019s another dilemma: Disposable diapers. They are hellishly convenient and hellishly expensive. Using cloth diapers means using a lot of hot water. Where\u2019s the downside? Babies have very thin skin and placing them in contact with the plastic of a disposable diaper\u2014especially in a moist environment\u2014is very questionable. But wait! There\u2019s more: It is estimated that anywhere up to TEN PERCENT of our landfills consists of disposable diapers. Just wait until all those feces leach down into our water tables. I know that the example of disposable diapers wasn\u2019t on topic. It was my intention to illustrate how there is no silver bullet, especially when it comes to sustainable green technologies. There is an apocryphal tale that Germany\u2019s green programs require a quarter-million dollars per job created and displaces another five or ten workers. I\u2019ve been to Germany twice and you would not believe the size of their wind turbines.  That\u2019s just one blade (not the tower). When at speed, the blade tips approach transonic velocities, this results in a subsonic rumbling that is beginning to be recognized as noise pollution. Additionally, during winter, when the blades ice up, they can fling a multi-kilo chunk of ice for around a quarter mile. Then there\u2019s the birds.  Not for nothing are these monsters called the, \u201cCuisinart of the Skies\u201d. My whole point is that this early stage, sustainable green technology is a matter of trade offs. Far too many in the green movement are intractable and that makes these compromises nearly impossible. Additionally, lawmakers just can\u2019t keep their noses out of things, despite how you can\u2019t legislate physics. Finally, here is a Sankey diagram showing the sources and destinations of America\u2019s generated energy. Please examine the upper left corner closely, you will see that solar, hydro, wind, and geothermal, put together, don\u2019t even match the input of nuclear power\u2014which provides a tiny fraction of overall global energy. Now let your eyes drift over to the right-hand side. Notice how the rejected energy exceeds that of energy services (58.1 vs 37.0 respectively)? If that doesn\u2019t scare the living crap out of someone who\u2019s concerned about green sustainable, I don\u2019t know what will. At present green technology remains in its infancy. I hope this helped.  ",

            "answer_text": "Hopefully, after watching The Planet of the Humans, short. Instead of spending $1.5 trillion a year on all these anti-carbon things that don\u2019t actually work, but make a lot of people a great deal of money, we should instead spend only $ billions on research. Nobody with any sense buys the first iteration of a new technology; it\u2019s big and clunky and very expensive. You wait a few years and buy it when it becomes smaller, much more useful, and cheap. In a decade of serious research, we could have saved, say $14 trillion, and now buy proper, working technologies. Currently, we\u2019re buying solar panels and wind turbines that produce minimal electricity, only when the wind blows and in the daytime. I\u2019d rather spend the money on Thorium liquid salt nuclear power, and battery storage. And other technologies not yet thought of. End all subsidies to wind and solar, except for research grants. Ten years delay will save us a fortune, and won\u2019t cause any damage to the planet. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming you mean energy, neither wind or solar will EVER compete with the concentrated and portable energy of oil. We may through some breakthrough with batteries make electricity portable enough to be useful (in which case it becomes competitive) but I have been watching that research since 1972 and seen a 5% improvement from useless to slightly less useless. Obviously stationary uses like a factory floor or a kitchen oven can and do make great use of electricity but when you must move it all breaks down. We will be better served using nuclear fission for electricity generation of base load with natural gas for peak and working hard to move on to fusion. Mobility will still require gas or diesel until that magic occurs in batteries. ",
