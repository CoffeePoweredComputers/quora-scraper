I wanted a song recorded, then I wanted a song with a video, a song with a band, perform on a stage, own it. Now, it\u2019s completely a different story. I sit at home, I don\u2019t play out, I write, and record and create for the sole purpose of streaming and an income using my passion that I can pass on to my children no matter how big or small it is. Maybe for you Touring is what you want to do. The old fashioned way selling tickets and Merch on top of Sales and Streams.

I know, I know\u2026it sounds cliche in the music business to hear (cue my old man voice) \u201cYou must network if you want to be successful!\u201d Nevertheless, it is true. You must network and you must do it properly. How do you do it properly you ask? Here's how: Move to where the music business is.Build up your courage and move to a music town. I struggled with this for a while. I thought \u201cOh, since streaming has changed the music industry I can just make music in my garage and never leave - that's gonna make me successful. Right?\u201d Wrong.You need to be around like minded individuals. You\u2019re gonna be hard pressed to find them in your sleepy town. In fact, my experience has been there are more fakes and wannabes in non-music towns than in legitimate music towns. Why? Because it's easy to walk out your door, get a bar gig and act like you're the greatest gift to mankind. It's difficult to move 100s of miles away from where you grew up and start over. That fact alone weeds out a lot of the junk.Put in the time to network.Once you move to a music town, go to where the successful people are hanging out. Actually go out to the bars, clubs, and venues and stand next to these people. Strike up a conversation. You'd be surprised where it can lead. Don't sit on your can and watch TV all day.Ask people out for lunch. Don't be afraid to spend money on food, coffees, and beers for other people. It\u2019s much easier to get to know someone one on one at Starbucks than it is to yell at them over the PA in a dark, crowded club.Be genuine.Successful people KNOW people. They did not become successful by not knowing their way around a conversation. Don't constantly talk about yourself. Shut up and listen. You might just learn something.Don't bullshit people. Just don't. They will figure it out. Know your craft so you don't have to fake.Meet people with the intent of building a relationship with them. Try not to think about how they can further your career.Apply good judgment on who you associate with.Find people who are real. And don't be afraid to challenge them on what they know. Just do it respectfully by asking questions.People who smoke too much, drink too much, or do heavy drugs. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.People who lie and cheat are not who you want to be around. You do not have to lie and cheat to be a professional musician. Anyone who says otherwise is a snake. Run from snakes.Be a \u201cgood hang\u201d. This is the single most important thing you can do.No one gives a rat\u2019s behind how good of a songwriter or player you are if you are an arrogant knucklehead. People are fragile. They hate jerks as much as you do. Don't be a jerk.Get to know people. Let them talk about themselves. Let them open up. People LOVE to talk about themselves. Understand this and remember this at all times.Serve people. Ask them what you can do for them! Don't ask people to do favors for you. Be proactive and people will notice.If this all sounds like a bunch of hogwash to you then might I suggest you read How To Win Friends And Influence People. The guidelines in that book have helped me tremendously. If you follow them well, you will go far. Better paying gigs will come. I can still hear my piano teacher saying in his Philadelphia accent, \u201cSuccess is preparation meeting opportunity.\u201d Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "18 Ways Musicians Can Make Money  One of the biggest challenges facing musicians is generating income. Gone are the days when a band could rely solely on music sales and touring to earn a living. Part of the reality of being a working musician today is the need to diversify your revenue streams. Although sales of recorded music have gone down significantly in recent years, there are new sources of income available to musicians. A mix of traditional and more modern income streams can help today\u2019s musicians earn a living. Here\u2019s a list of 18 ways to generate revenue for your music career: 18 Ways Musicians Can Make Money 1. CD Sales: If you\u2019re going to be playing live shows, having CDs on hand is still a good idea. They make great takeaway souvenirs that can easily be signed by band members. 2. Vinyl Sales: Vinyl sales surged 30% in 2013. Again, if you\u2019ll be playing live shows, printing a small batch to have at your merch table can help generate extra income. 3. Digital Sales: You should be selling digital music through your own website to make the most money, but also through online retailers. Keep in mind that online retailers take a percentage of sales (ex. iTunes takes 30%, Bandcamp takes 15%). Some digital distributors that place your music in stores like iTunes and Amazon will take a cut on top of that. 4. Streaming: Although per-stream payouts from streaming services tend to be small, they can add up over time. Keep in mind that these services also help new fans discover your music, and shouldn't be seen solely as an income generator. 5. Live Shows: Money made from live shows can vary greatly, but it\u2019s still one of the best ways to earn income. Not only can you make money from selling tickets, but it\u2019s also one of the best ways to sell merch. 6. Physical Merch: Income from physical merch can depend heavily on the amount of live shows you play. If you go out on tour, be sure that you have some t-shirts, as well as smaller items like buttons and stickers that you can sell to fans after the show. 7. Digital Merch: You can also sell digital merch items like PDFs, videos, and images to your fans. Things like lyric books, live concerts, sheet music, exclusive photos, artwork and more. 8. Crowdfunding: Crowdfunding can be a great way to generate income for your music career. A well-executed crowdfunding campaign can help you raise enough money to offset the cost of producing and marketing your album. 9. Publishing Royalties: You should be signed up to a performing rights organization so you can collect royalties on your music. This includes public performance royalties (radio, TV, live venues), mechanical royalties (sales through retailers, streaming, etc.), and sync royalties (commercials, film, TV). 10. Digital Royalties: Whenever your music is played on services like SiriusXM radio, Pandora, and webcasters, they must pay royalties. 11. Live Performance Royalties: When performing original material, you can earn royalties from live performances. Whether you perform at a bar, restaurant, club, or other music venue, Performance Rights Organizations (PROs) will pay royalties from those live performances. 12. Licensing: If you get your song placed in a film, commercial, or TV show, chances are they\u2019re going to pay you a licensing fee. These fees vary greatly, depending on the budget for the project, and how badly they want your particular song. 13. YouTube: On YouTube, whenever your music is used in videos that are running ads, YouTube pays a portion of that advertising money to the rights holders of the song. Digital distributors like TuneCore and CD Baby can help you collect that money, as well as Audiam. 14. Sponsorships: If you\u2019ve built up a fan base, some companies are willing to sponsor musicians to reach those fans. Sponsorships can range from cash, to free products, services, and gear. 15. Session Work: Another way to make some extra money is to put yourself out there as a session musician. As a singer or instrumentalist, you could do session work for other musical projects, or even in advertising. 16. Songwriting/Composing: If you\u2019re a songwriter, you could write songs for other musicians, or compose music specifically for film and television. 17. Cover Gigs: Playing cover gigs at bars, restaurants, weddings, and other private events is frowned upon by some musicians. But those shows can pay really well, and allow you to get paid to play your instrument. There\u2019s no shame in that. 18. Music Lessons: Many musicians teach their instrument to others to help generate revenue towards their own career. This can be a nice way to supplement your income, and allows you to hone your craft at the same time. ",

            "answer_text": "The flippant (but accurate) answer is by finding someone who will pay you for what you do. An independent musician makes money by being versatile and reliable. You need to be the person people think of when they need a substitute, extra musicians for recording, are putting together a new band. You\u2019ll get a lot of work by referral. Part of it is running in the right circles, and getting there is down to planning more than luck. Have most professional musicians in your area gone to a certain music academy? Have they generally played a lot in a certain venue or with a certain band? Knowing these things can help you plan a trajectory that will lead to you to a place where you can support yourself making music. You\u2019re going to have to manage your expectations. You need to take a look at what professional musicians in your area really do and how much they really make after expenses. You\u2019re going to be working a lot more than 40 hours a week, have a very unstable schedule, and you\u2019re probably going to be making a lot less than you like. You also work a lot more than it might appear. Practice and rehearsals are the bigger part of the work you\u2019ll do. You\u2019re going to have to be prepared for indefinitely supplementing your income by giving music lessons, leading school bands, teaching at band camp, or driving a taxi. You need to be highly organized.You can be booked for a gig with anything from 40 minutes to two years warning. These bookings can change at a moment\u2019s notice. You are going to have to find time to rehearse with other people with similarly chaotic schedules. A quick way to piss people off is to agree to a gig then cancel because you\u2019ve double booked yourself. Never ever EVER cancel a gig because something better paid or more prestigious came along. That is a quick way to get a bad reputation, and it makes you a terrible person. It doesn\u2019t matter if you promised to play on a street corner in the suburbs with an eight year old playing a rainstick, you committed yourself so you do that job. If you feel a job is badly paid or isn\u2019t otherwise worth your time, don\u2019t take it. End of. Above all, there\u2019s going to be compromises you have to make. If you really want to support yourself full time, you are going to have to be prepared to take jobs that aren\u2019t 100% in line with your passion. How much you\u2019re willing to compromise is up to you. Here in Norway, for example, you can make good money, play and tour regularly as part of a danseband. That said, most musicians would rather carve out their own kidneys and eat them than do that. On the other end of the spectrum, you might have a very cool but niche band that you love playing with, and you\u2019ll be lucky to see the day that the band is merely break-even with income. Or to use the main band I play with as an example, we do make fairly good money, but we decided we\u2019d rather put the money back in the band than get paid individually. So instead of the band being a way to truly supplement our income, we tour on our own conditions, record albums we want to record, things like that. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s 8 ways you can make money with music. They won\u2019t work for everyone but try them and you might be surprised. Being able to make it in music also means taking risks. So here you are.. 1 \u2014 Distribute Your Music Without a Label The boom in digital music distribution has made distribution available to all artists, not just those who have contracts with labels. You don\u2019t have to spend your entire budget on promotion or split your royalties if you do it yourself. Getting your music to Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, Google Play and other platforms makes it available to your fans wherever they listen to music. Of course, royalties won\u2019t be huge right away, but it gives you a channel to continue promoting your music and grow your fanbase in other ways. In addition, playlists are the leading actors in the digital music era. Streaming platforms help recommend your sound to music lovers who have never heard you before. And those people are your fans of the future who will pay for tickets to your shows, buy albums and merch, and stream your music. Distribution ensures that all your music promotion efforts are not lost when someone searches for your tracks on their favorite platform. Place your music where it needs to be. Your music promotion directs all those ears in the right direction. 2 \u2014 Share your music for free. But do it in style. It\u2019s not enough just to sell your album. Streaming has definitely changed things when it comes to selling music. People want music at their fingertips. The customers still want to support the music. The listeners just want something special. And on their own terms. That\u2019s why many artists have started giving away their albums online, but with a few extras. Selling your album \u2014 or sharing it with the world \u2014 must be as creative as the music itself. So get creative about how you release your album. Sell an experience; not a \u201cthing\u201d. 3 \u2014 Fiverr Fiverr is one of the biggest sites where musicians can sell their music. It is an online community where people can sell their services from 5 euros or more, including the sale of beats, songs, and other music-related services for different purposes. There is already a large community of people selling tracks on Fiverr. But it\u2019s not so hard to make yourself unique. Another great site where you can sell your \u201cmusic services\u201d is Upwork. Tip: tracks that have passed through mastering tend to stand out and sell better. 4 \u2014 Musicians are getting royalties every day, and you can too with ASCAP Did you know that every time you hear music in an elevator, the artists who owns the rights get paid? Now I\u2019m not saying to go out and make elevator music (but if you want to, go ahead). What you should do is get in touch with the organizations that take care of the royalties for the artists. In the United States it\u2019s ASCAP. In Canada it\u2019s SOCAN. And so on. But most of the important countries have services that take care of royalties for artists. In 2016, ASCAP paid $918 million to artists. What are you saying? A lot of money, huh? 5 \u2014 Synchronize Synchronization (or sound) licenses refer to music used in other media such as TV shows, movies or commercials. The sound recordings are usually handled by music supervisors or agents. They use sound libraries to find music for their projects. One of the best sites to start with synchronization licenses is Versus Media. They put artists in touch with small television and film projects that need music. In addition, registration is free. Pump Audio is also a good site. Just send 2 tracks to get \u2018the green light\u2019 and then upload as much as you want in their library. 6 \u2014 YouTube ID YouTube is the number one music streaming service on the internet. Yes, It beats iTunes, Spotify and Tidal for hassle-free total streaming. If your music is uploaded, you should be paid. YouTube has a system called Content ID that finds exactly where you use your song on YouTube. If it can find your music somewhere and you are the copyright owner, you can choose to monetize it by placing ads on the video. It\u2019s like having your own little YouTube booking agent. Click here to find out more. 7 \u2014 Engage with merchandise If you sell t-shirts and records at a concert or shoes on eBay, selling merch is a great (and affordable) way to make grain fast. Fans want something authentic that comes from the artist, something digital streaming can\u2019t give. So give them the option. You don\u2019t have to do it in person. Sites like BigCartel and Bandcamp give artists the tools they need to sell merchandise without stress. 8 \u2014 Super Fans   The most valuable currency in music is not money. It\u2019s your catchment area. Cuddling super fans is hard work. But in the end, it will pay more. It means being a human first and aspiring musician afterward. Superfans really love your music and support it in any way they can. Forever and ever. And you can use platforms like Patreon that enables you to receive recurrent payments from your supporters with monthly subscriptions. So talk to them. Meet them in person. Find a way to answer them when they contact you. Perhaps one of the best things about the do-it-yourself promotion is the authentic fan/artist relationship. Build it! More money, less problems. Now that you have a few extra cash in the till, the best thing to do is to invest in your project again. Make sure you have an artist fund that you only touch when you have to. Set aside and use the funds wisely to make your project grow even more. Just don\u2019t blame us when all your less experienced friends start borrowing from you. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a well-known fact that the traditional music business has more or less flip flopped on itself following the turn of the century. Record sales were once the primary driver of the industry, with bands touring and selling merch in order to promote an album. Now, a recorded album is often a loss-leader for touring and merch, which now drives the industry. Consequently, the way bands make money has drastically changed over the last few decades. Here are three main ways you can make money from music: Sync dealsBrand partnershipsStreamingSync Deals Sync deals have seen a significant surge in popularity following the decline of traditional record sales. In short, a sync deal enables bands to make money by having their music featured in some kind of visual media (movies, TV shows, video games etc). In a sync deal, an intellectual property owner (such as a band) grant a visual media business with a music synchronization license, allowing them to use their work in an agreed form of visual media for a flat fee. Sync deals can be incredibly lucrative, often netting a band thousands (or even hundreds of thousands) of dollars. How you can earn money from sync deals: The good news is that you don\u2019t have to be signed to a record label or have a significant following to land a sync deal. In many cases, you simply have to have great music . If you\u2019re hoping to land a sync deal, you will usually need instrumental versions of your recorded music (lyrics can sometimes get in the way of narration in a TV ad or movie). Additionally, you will need versions with clean lyrics (swearing is almost always a no-go when it comes to daytime TV ads etc). The best way to submit your music for sync is to sign up to a music publisher that will pitch your music for you. Brand Partnerships Much like sync deals, brand partnerships have seen significant traction as a main source of income following the decline of traditional record sales. This is where a band makes money by either endorsing a particular brand\u2019s product or service, or working with a brand to make a signature product. Common brands that bands partner with are musical instrument manufacturers, clothing lines, social media app developers and grooming product lines. How you can earn money from brand partnerships: This one is going to be much more difficult to take advantage of until you have a sizeable following. Understand that brands are paying to get their product in front of an established audience, not trying to help you grow one from scratch. One of the best ways an independent band can make a consistent income from brand partnerships is by having a solid online presence and a significant social media following. Once you have an established online presence, you will start to see endorsement requests from brands on a consistent basis (often in the form of sponsored posts, social media takeovers, product reviews etc). Whilst you might not be designing a signature line of Gibson guitars for a few more years, there\u2019s no doubt that you can make a regular income from brand endorsements. Streaming Whilst many independent musicians are quick to dismiss the earning potential of streaming services, it often serves as a fantastic source of income. Whilst payouts are indeed much smaller than traditional record sales, they add up over time and provide a healthy source of income for artists with monthly listener numbers in the hundreds of thousands. More importantly, streaming services often act as social platforms and introduce new listeners to your work on a regular basis via algorithmic playlists. This allows you to grow a dedicated fanbase, which can be monetized long-term via more lucrative income streams (such as touring & merch). How you can earn money from streaming: Firstly, you\u2019ll need to go through a digital distributor in order to get your recorded music on streaming services. The most affordable and artist-friendly distribution service I\u2019ve found is Distrokid; they allow you to upload an unlimited amount of music and retain 100% of your rights for only $19.99 a year (many competitors charge double that for a single album). You can also receive a 5% discount on your first year of distribution by using this discount code. The giant of the streaming world is undoubtedly Spotify; for more information on how to grow and monetize a Spotify following, check out our article How To Organically Grow Your Spotify Following [FULL GUIDE].

            "answer_text": "It's not easy, but I know a handful of people who are doing it. In one case the musician, a singer-songwriter and guitar player, saw some success in his younger days. He still gets residuals on his older recordings, plays locally, and puts out new material. His wife has the proverbial \u201cstraight job\u201d with medical benefits, and he'll jump in and load UPS trucks for a couple months every year around Christmas. I know a couple of husband and wife pairings who preform together. That allows them to bring in a larger percentage of the band payout than by just having one member of the household in the band. She also does coffee shop solo gigs, and he does recording engineering in the basement. I play in a band, handle booking for 3 small venues, and build backing tracks and film scores - but I'm retired - so making a living isn't really my goal. It can be done, but it's usually a matter of doing multiple things within the industry to talley up a total income that gets you by. I don't know of any good or inexpensive way to include such luxuries as health care or a dental plan. I would say that the earlier you start, the better, and having realistic expectations is important. If you're willing to work as hard at your music as you would any other career and can manage your finances in a \u201cfeast or famine\u201d lifestyle, you'll be good to go. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the biggest challenges facing musicians is generating income. Gone are the days when a band could rely solely on music sales and touring to earn a living. Part of the reality of being a working musician today is the need to diversify your revenue streams. Although sales of recorded music have gone down significantly in recent years, there are new sources of income available to musicians.  I highly recommend you using social media. Social media doesn\u2019t always directly lead to income (although it can), but what it does is make your name and brand known, and if that results in more fans, it can result in more record sales. Many of today\u2019s music stars got their start, not from getting discovered by a label, but by getting discovered on YouTube. In fact, going \u201cviral\u201d on YouTube can also mean more income because when videos reach a certain number of views, YouTube starts sharing advertising dollars with those users. Youtube is one of the most common way people use to promote their music. On YouTube, whenever your music is used in videos that are running ads, YouTube pays a portion of that advertising money to the rights holders of the song. Digital distributors like TuneCore and CD Baby can help you collect that money, as well as Audiam. So make the most of this. Learn how to use social networking to your advantage. And I want to emphasize that if you want to be successful in promoting your music in social media, especially Youtube, and earn much money, Viewers and Subscribers are the two most important factors you must pay attention on. The number of viewers has directly impact on how you can earn from Youtube. Having a large number of viewers and subscribers also mean that you are really polupar, famous and you have lots of fans. If you want to have a go with social media and get more views, Sell Real Likes is a good choice for you. I\u2019ve used it to promote my channel on Youtube for 2 months and the result has been effective up to now.They gave me non-drop subscribers and viewers, which help me to build a strong social proof for my channel. And I am so satisfied with their services: Safety, Guarantee, \u2026. ",

Source: Pixabay In my opinion, there is a huge difference between this question and the one you asked. The reason for this is that times have changed. CDs and Vinyl are not the only sources of income. When it comes to making money, you should diversify your income stream. Release new albums/musicMarket yourself as a musician rather than a collective - this might seem ambiguous but to give you an idea, there's a band called Periphery. All of the members have their own side-projects. So they market their side-projects through their band.If you have enough money, own a record label. Because if you work under a record label you will be liable for paying royalties, so technically you wouldn't get 100% of your earning. However, if you own a record label, not only will you make 100% of your earning but will also receive realities from bands in your roster.Do not underestimate streaming platforms - I had to put this because many artists think streaming sites should be boycotted for the small payment they offer per stream(if I'm not wrong it is in pennies lie 0.0028 dollars or something). But, it is the streaming sites that give you the attention and earn you fans. If you don't have fans, you won't earn from your concerts/live shows. Hope you get the chronology here.Gear endorsementsSponsorshipsIt all boils down to how you market yourself. You need to get your name out in the public to earn. There are many ways that you can earn through music. I have only skimmed through them. I'm planning on making a comprehensive list soon. I've been researching on the same for quite some time now. I also help artists market their album/single. So if you need any help feel free to reach out. I'd be more than happy to help! ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing to do is to get good at playing your music. After that, find a way to record some of what you do so you can play it for others. The two best ways to get paid for music starting out are playing paid gigs and merchandise. To get paid gigs you need to have some sample music to get booked. Nobody wants to hear you play live in front of them to decide whether or not they like your music. Bein Play gigs that pay you a set amount for the time you play, not the amount of people you bring in. This is good for many reasons: getting people to commit to coming to your gigs consistently starting out is very hard, you don\u2019t make much money, and you end up becoming more about promoting your shows than playing them, and people get tired of being begged to come see you. A good starting off rate is about $50/hour at least. By having merchandise such as t-shirts, you can definitely make more money. Make something simple, but also something you would want to wear. If you can make the shirts for $5, and sell them for $10 people will be happy to buy them knowing that they are supporting a local artist, and got a reasonably priced t-shirt out of it. Remember though, the most important thing is that you get out there, and play in front of people. This will make you a better musician and performer. The Beatles used to play in strip clubs for 10 hours straight! Being on stage more often will help to kill any stage fright, and will get your music in front of more people. Best of luck! ",

If it's about how to make money as an artist with your music, there are books written on the subject. As an artist manager, my job is to make sure my artists are making money. If I were to rely on only music sales, there wouldn't be much to make, unless they have reached a significant level of sales. Making money WITH your music as an artist means that you have to utilize your music to build a brand. By building a brand and gaining lots of followers and fans, you are building leverage to take it to the next level. And what is that? You team up with brands - local if you're small, domestic or even global if you have some buzz going on.  Clothes, instruments, accessories, jewels, shoes, beverages, technology, cars, you name it - most brands are open to connecting to an artist, and to paying them money, because the artist can reach their demographic in a way no one else can. Relationship marketing is so powerful that they are ready to pay up for it. If you are good at thinking outside of the box, you can definitely supplement your music sales income with much bigger revenue streams as an artist. Touring, strategic partnerships, sync fees, merch sales - there are lots of options. Just take action, and things will happen! ",

And, you\u2019ll more than likely need to take gigs that aren\u2019t your dream job and might even bore you \u2014 for example, even if you only enjoy composing music for drama and mystery you might have to take a comedy gig to stay afloat financially, or collaborate on works you don\u2019t feel as passionate about. Those are actually the main reasons I decided not to pursue a full-time musical career. But, if you don\u2019t mind all that, it can be done. Getting rich in the music industry is like winning the lottery because there are so many over-qualified people (there are probably 10,000 people as talented as the average Hollywood composer but aren\u2019t making big bucks because they don\u2019t know the right people), but making a living is very doable.

Since there are so many options, knowing yourself as a musician/band and having a strong business foundation will equip you to figure out the best ones for you. The bands who know the business side of their profession tend to have a leg up over others. Business practices such as knowing your brand, your market, your fans, your marketing plan, managing the operations and finances, which revenue sources to focus on, and getting outside funding when needed, all will increase your chances of making money with music.

The idea of money was there, of course, but for me it has always been about the music. The best possible music. Then the rest follows. That is still a basic way to have some sort of income. There are lots of other ways that are music-related but I have always stuck close to a band.  I never quit my day job until I was very sure the money was there, and I have followed another career where I could work off and on if I needed to. The thing is, being a musician (for me) is sometimes a very iffy proposition and I had to give up a lot for it sometimes. It doesn't really have a degree program as such, nor a career path. I play rock n roll so that is the place I am coming from. The safe way is to go to school and be a \"straight\" musician and find a symphony. I've always come in on a wing and a prayer and I prefer that level of excitement, so the money is there when it's there and I make up for lack of it in other ways like fixing computers when I need to.

So you need to market yourself as well.Also it's better to be a nice person, I know some fabulous musicians who don't get work because they are (or have the reputation of being) a-holes.So Parth, what music do you want to play?

There is a direct relationship between talent and money in the music business; the more talent you have, the less money you need to be successful. The less talent you have, the more money it will take you to be successful. You need money to pay for the studio, musicians, transportation, recordings, marketing, and distribution. The will is important because there are thousand of really talented people (like that guy who works as a lineman for an electricity company, goes to a talent show, no one is expecting much, and then starts singings as if he was the reincarnation of Frank Sinatra). If you are waiting for that great opportunity to come to you, it never will; you have to work hard for it. ",
