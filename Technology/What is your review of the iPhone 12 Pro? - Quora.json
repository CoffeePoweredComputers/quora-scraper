            "answer_text": "Apple iPhone | 12 Review Good things and Bad things.  Introduction I am going to tell you about the Apple iPhone 12 pro Unboxing, Setup and First Looking in this blog. Which I have tested myself before and now I will tell about the bad and Good thing's about this phone. So let's see you. Specifications . It has 6GB RAM . It weight has 189 Gram . Apple iPhone 12 pro has a 12MP Rear camera and 12 MP front camera and 4k video Recording . It has a Apple A14 bionic (5nm) chipset . It has a 2815mAh Li-Ion Battery . Apple iPhone 12 pro has a Scratch-resistant ceramic glass, oleophobic coating protection About the Apple iPhone 12 pro Apple iPhone 12 pro has been my main phone for the past five to six days. I've been using it full time. i switched from an 11 pro max to test this out and so far. I'm really enjoying it. But i want to talk about the good and the bad. And so the first good thing is the camera in fact this entire video is being recorded with the back camera of the iphone 12 pro in 4k 60 frames per second. And as you can see here it's in hdr so if you have hdr as an option on your browser or youtube make sure you turn that on as this is in 4k hdr. So you can see the uality of the camera in Apple iPhone 12 pro. i'm not using any external microphones. So whatever you hear whether it be the environment the ambient sounds around me or just my voice. It's all coming from the microphone of the iphone 12 pro. So this should give you a general idea of what to expect now of course. We do have two other cameras and they take really nice photos. I think they fixed some of the color issues. That they were having in previous years and in general i think the photos are a little bit better. I took quite a few as you can see here this is the same sort of area that. I'm in now and i think they look pretty good in general. They're nice and clear and even the night photos look amazing of course. If you're using a 30 second exposure on a tripod. You're going to get the best experience. And you can see how bright and vibrant these are with. The new lens that's in the Apple iPhone 12 pro. Now along with the great camera during the day. We have the new lidar sensor at night. And it does a great job with auto focus. And tracking because it's using lasers to actually sense depth. It's bouncing lasers off me back to it to sense the actual depth. Where you can't normally see depth in this sort of dim lit condition. It also is great for augmented reality with maybe sensing object tracking and also with 3d scanning. I've seen some of this on the ipad pro with room scanning. And what it can do is pretty amazing. So i think what we'll have in the future will be much more significant than. What we have right now but for now. It's great with auto focus and portrait mode and augmented reality. So hopefully we see more of that maybe in the years to come now.  We'll have to wait for the Apple iPhone 12 pro max that has the new sensor shift stabilization. And bigger sensor but i think in general this is an upgrade over last year it may not be a giant jump. But it's definitely an improvement now one thing that really contributes to the overall quality of the photos and the video. You're seeing now is the new neural engine that's found on the a14 cpu. And this is a very big upgrade. If you're coming from an older phone in fact my wife switched from an iphone 10 to the 12 pro and immediately noticed. HOW fast applications were opening and just said this thing feels. So fast and so that's not something i considered coming from the 11 pro max. But if you're coming from a phone from a couple years ago you'll definitely notice an improvement in overall speed. And usability switching between apps isn't a problem. In Apple iPhone 12 pro. And apps stay open longer. When you're in it ram management is great they don't normally close and hopefully. I don't get rain down here but they don't really close in the background and in general it's just a much faster processor that. I think will last years to come. So at least five years or so because this thing is so fast just in general now one of the big changes this year is its. Overall design it's somewhere between the iphone 4 and 5 and the reason. I say between is because the outside rim is stainless steel with glass front and back. So you have that stainless steel on the outside like an iphone 4. But you have sort of the flattened edges of the iphone 5 and 5s. So this is a great design it's one of my favorite designs in fact this is my favorite design except for the stainless steel being very prone to fingerprints. There's not really any negatives to this design. It's easier to grip because. It's squared off and it doesn't feel like it's going to fall out of your hands because of that it is a fingerprint magnet. So you'll want a case if that's something that bothers you or a skin or on the outside edge. But the matte finish on the back is something. I really like and just in general. i love this Apple iPhone 12 pro design and that leads me to the display. The display is easy to see in the sunlight it goes up to 800 nits of brightness. And it's hdr when you're watching hdr content it goes up to 1200 nits of brightness. And you definitely can see this hopefully. Then i can see it on this video but there's some amazing brights and darks in this display. And it's an oled display every display gets oled this year and some people may be turned off by. That if pwm bothers you and you have sensitivity to light but. I have that problem in this display doesn't bother me at all even though. It's flickering it must be at a higher rate where there's something different about. IT so it really doesn't bother my eyes at any brightness level despite it flickering. At all now along with that display of course you need some quality speakers. If you're going to be watching hdr content on it and i would say apple delivered again on this it was great with the 11 pro max. I think the only difference is. It's a little clearer at higher volumes with the Apple iPhone 12 pro definitely. The best watch apple has made. And i don't just say that because it's new there's a lot of positives. But first let's talk about what's new so the first thing that's new. So it goes nice and loud around two decibels louder or maybe about the same. But in general it's nice and loud sounds good. And i really have no complaints when it comes to the speaker now before. We talk about what's bad there's a few things that are good and bad. And so the first thing has to do with the display it has ceramic shield. So it's four times less likely to break. If you drop it the problem with that is is i'm not seeing much of an improvement with scratch resistance in fact. The iphone 12 has the same ceramic shield on it. And it had some light scratches on it after the first couple days of use i'm not sure where they came from.  I can comparesion between Apple iPhone 12 and iPhone 11. But it was scratched now it may scratch less than last year's iphone 11 and 11 pro and 11 pro max. But in my experience most people are going to want a screen protector on this display. Because of that so just keep that in mind it's glass glass scratches depending on what you're hitting it with whether that be rocks or a diamond from a ring. IT will scratch. And it will scratch if you bump a sapphire display camera into it as well so just keep those things in mind put a screen protector on it if that's something that's going to bother. You now another sort of neutral thing is magsafe connects to the back of a case or the back of the phone and allows you to charge wirelessly while using it. So it's using wireless charging technology but also adheres to make for a better charging experience and faster speeds. I'm sort of neutral about this because you still have to disconnect it from the back of the phone. And of course you have these wireless charging cases in Apple iPhone 12 pro. Which are nice. And i'm kind of mixed about this ring i kind of like it. But it reminds me of the apple campus or ample park campus. So i think it's nice and it will make for some interesting accessories in the future. And i think that's what it's all about but i like magsafe overall whether or not you need that wireless charger though. I'm kind of neutral about it if you already have a fast charger you might want to skip it because. You're going to have to plug into the port anyway. But i think it is the first step in apple offering a fully wireless iphone. So maybe we'll see that with next year's iphone or a couple years out. But because it has a magnetometer and nfc and maybe in the future it can transmit data back and forth. I think that is the first step towards the next phone. Which will be wireless i'm thinking that's what apple's doing. Now the last thing that's both good and bad or sort of neutral is 5g and the reason. I say good and bad is 5g is super fast now where i live t-mobile has very good 5g coverage that's who i'm using at least in this phone. And i've got two bars of 5g at 2 bars of 5g in Apple iPhone 12 pro. I have plenty of speed it's super fast. And i have an improvement over 4g not everybody is seeing this depending on the carrier it makes a big difference. But some people may see a big improvement some may not. And if you have verizon and you have 5g with millimeter wave. You'll get an improvement as far as that goes because you'll have that extra speed however the millimeter wave antenna is only. Available in the united states. And it's really hit or miss in the charlotte area where i'm at. It's really hit or miss you have to be downtown in the charlotte area or uptown. As they call it here in a certain corner kind of in line of sight and holding out your phone. To get the best speeds. Apple says up to four gigabits per second i'm not going to see that because i have t-mobile. And i don't have millimeter wave that i'm aware of in any areas around me. So it's really a verizon thing and soon an att thing maybe. We'll see it more widespread later on. But it's really hit or miss and to me that part's not worth it but 5g in general is an improvement. But the area. Where it's not an improvement is the battery in Apple iPhone 12 pro. If you're using 5g. A lot you're going to notice a battery hit of one to two hours depending on how much you're using it of course. There's an option to turn off 5g if you want to do that and you can do that certainly. If you're not seeing a benefit. But apple is actually managing this by themselves giving you 5g when. It's a benefit and when it's not they turn it off even though it still shows 5g in the upper right. This does help save battery and that moves me over to my first negative is battery life. If you're using 5g like. I am five and a half to six hours is what i'm seeing consistently on. The iPhone 12 pro now with the 12 pro max. Imay see an improvement but i got five and a half hours with a hundred percent use of my battery yesterday. And a couple hours of screen off time meaning. It's playing music in the background or something along those lines where you just have some media playing or. It's doing some background activity consistently i'm seeing five. And a half to six hours with my normal use.  So that's something that may or may not matter to you. But that leads me over to the next thing is there's no charger in the box now. This is not a problem for me. I see this is sort of a hit or miss it really depends on. What you have as far as chargers lying around you'll get the best speeds with apple's 20 watt charger you could use a macbook charger. You could use last year's charger but if you don't have one. You're going to have to spend about 20. To get one on a positive note apple is giving you an extra 64 gigs or so of ram with. The Apple iPhone 12 pro over last year's with the price. So they didn't change the price this isn't really a positive or negative it's just the same price but they are giving you an extra 64 gigs of ram for the same 9.99 to start. Apple iPhone 12 pro is awesome smartphone. So that's a positive and that sort of makes up for. The lack of a charger. So it's kind of a win but a mess with the charger it just depends on how you look at it i kind of see it as a neutral thing depending on your experience overall. And whether or not you have a charger lying around the house in conclusion. The iPhone 12 pro is a great size. I think the display overall in the overall feel of it is probably the right size for most people. I think this is something that i could use full time instead of the 12 pro max. I'll have to wait. And see once. I get that and see if there's any huge improvements in the camera with the new sensors. But the Apple iPhone 12 pro is definitely recommended especially if you're coming from an iPhone 10 or 10s i think it's a big upgrade as far as speed and cameras. If you're on an 11 or 11 pro now you may want to wait until next year's phone it really depends on what matters most to you. The new design is something i've been waiting for for years. And so this is something that i've been waiting for to have. And i would upgrade just for the design personally. But it really depends on the budget how you're using your phone regularly if it's something you use a lot or not. So this is the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Review. And The Good thing's and The Bad things are here.  Price in India Apple iPhone 12 Pro price in India started at Rs 1,19,900. And the colours available in pacific blue, Gold,. Graphite, and silver.

            "answer_text": "hey guys this is my review of the iPhone 12 pro. The iPhone 12 joins the plans of the iPhone X and the amazing iPhone 4 and comes out looking and feeling new, with 5G, a superior screen and improved cameras. The new iPhone costs from \u00a3799 and sits between the marginally more modest \u00a3699 iPhone 12 Mini and the \u00a3999 iPhone 12 Pro and \u00a31,099 12 Pro Max. The iPhone 12 denotes the greatest change to Apple's cell phone line since the 2017 iPhone X and feels like the biggest hits from the company's plan groups in the course of the most recent decade. It has a similar all-screen plan that shook things up for Apple in 2017 with the iPhone X yet the level aluminum sides closely resemble 2010's iPhone 4 or the iPhone 5 from 2012. The mix feels new and is a huge update on the plan of a year ago's iPhone 11. Contrasted and its archetype, the iPhone 12 has more slender bezels however the equivalent estimated 6.1in screen, making it 4.2mm more limited and smaller, 1.3mm more slender, and 32g lighter. Joined with the compliment sides and a grippy covering on the glass back, the iPhone 12 is a lot simpler to hold and utilize one-gave. Know more ",
