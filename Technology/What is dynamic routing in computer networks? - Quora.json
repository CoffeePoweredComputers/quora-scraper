            "answer_text": "Dynamic routing Dynamic routing is used to find networks and update routing tables on routers dynamically. It's easier than using static or default routing, but it will cost you in terms o router CPU processing and bandwidth on the network link read more\u2026  Advantages of dynamic over static: \u00b7 There is no need to know the destination networks. \u00b7 Need to advertise directly connected networks. \u00b7 Update the topology change dynamically \u00b7 Administrative work is reduced. \u00b7 Used for large organizations. \u00b7 This is easier than using static or default routing. Administrative distance The administrative distance (AD) is used to rate the trustworthiness of routing information received on a router from neighbor routers. An administrative distance is an integer from 0 to 255, where 0 is the most trusted and 255 means no traffic will be passed via this route. Default administrative distance Connected interface = 0 Static route =1 EIGRP =90 OSPF =110 RIP =120 External EIGRP =170 Unknown = 255 (this route will never be used).
