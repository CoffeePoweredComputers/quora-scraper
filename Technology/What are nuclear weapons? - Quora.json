            "answer_text": "There are two main types of nuclear weapon: fission weapons and fusion weapons.  Fusion weapons rely on a fission weapon to trigger them. A fusion weapon relies on the principle of nuclear fission - the splitting of an atom.  When an atom splits, a large amount of energy is released.  If it's just one or two, the net amount of released energy is miniscule, but when billions split, the sum of their energy is enormous. Fission weapons typically rely on either uranium or plutonium.  Both are large atoms and have several isotopes - versions with different numbers of neutrons.  Uranium has an atomic number of 92, meaning it has 92 protons in the nucleus.  The most common isotope is Uranium 238 (or U238) which has 146 neutrons.  However U235, which has 143 neutrons, is less stable and easier to split.  U235 is less than 1% of all Uranium found.  For this reason, Uranium is often refined, the 235 separated from the 238 to \"enrich\" the Uranium (this is often done through gas centrifuges which spin uranium hexaflouride gas and help separate the two as the slightly heavier 238 is pulled away leaving a higher concentration of U235 behind).  A uranium bomb typically takes concentrations of closer to 90% (the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima was enriched to 80%).   When a large enough mass of Uranium 235 is brought together at a high enough density, it reaches a point known as critical mass.   This will trigger a nuclear chain reaction. When an atom of U235 splits it releases not only energy and two smaller daughter atoms, but it also releases some stray neutrons.  When a stray neutron strikes another atom of U235 it causes that atom to become unstable and split as well - releasing more energy and more neutrons.  U235 atoms split naturally all the time, but because the space between atoms is, relatively speaking, large, the odds of one of those neutrons striking another atom is pretty low. But when critical mass is achieved, the liklihood of one of those neutrons striking another atom is increased greatly.  What happens then is that each time an atom splits and releases a few neutrons those neutrons trigger at least two more splits, which release neutrons and more splits.  This is a nuclear chain reaction.  Each \"generation\" of splits increases exponentially.  This continues until the mass heats up and expands to a point where the mass is no longer critical.  However, in doing so it releases an enormous ammount of energy. This is the same principle on which nuclear reactors operate - however they do so in a much more controlled manner - the criticality is moderated and kept from becoming a runaway reaction.  In a reactor, this released energy is harnessed in the form of heat which is used to boil water and turn turbines.  But thats not what we're discussing... In the case of a fission bomb, the release of energy, which happens in an extremely short amount of time, causes incredible heat.  This heat causes expansion at an explosive rate.  In essense, then, a nuclear weapon is simply a very powerful thermal explosion that happens to have some additional effects in that it releases other forms of radiation (notably gamma radiation). The majority of the blast effects, however, are through the heat released by the weapon, which leads to explosive expansion at an enormous speed.  As this blast expands, it devestates everything in its path until the explosive force dissipates.   Other fission bombs use Plutonium instead of Uranium.  Plutonium has a much higher fissile rate and is eaiser to produce in lage amounts.  However, it is also significantly more radioactive.  When a fission bomb explodes, only a small amount of the fissile material actually splits before the explosion causes the remaining material to dissipate and is no longer critical.  Uranium, though radioactive, is not so heavilly radioactive to be dangerous in small amounts.  So when a uranium bomb explodes the remaining uranium that's spread out is not all that hazardous. Plutonium, however, is horrifically dangerous.  Even small amounts are radioactive enough to be harmful.  When a plutonium bomb explodes, the remaining plutonium leaves lingering radiation that persists, leaving the surrounding area radioactive long-term. Fusion weapons are a different beast.  Fusion takes place when two atoms are forced together.  This requires enormous temperatures and pressures.  As immortalized in Boyle's law, pressure and temperature are directly related.  Thus increasing temperature increases pressure, and vise-versa.  A fusion weapon requires a trigger to create massive heat - usually a fission bomb.  The fission bomb detonates, creating the heat and pressure requiredto cause a supply of  hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium atoms. Just as fission releases energy, so does fusion (our sun and all stars are essentially massive fusion reactors converting hydrogen into helium).  Fusion releases enormous amounts of energy, more than fission.  When this happens, the explosive force is often orders of magnitude more powerful than a fusion weapon.  The effects are similar, but on a grander scale. If you want more information, I would recommend two books: 1.) The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes (it can be long, dry, and boring at times, but is immensely informative).  He also wrote Dark Sun aobut the creation of the hydrogen bomb.  2.) The Sum of All Fears by Tom Clancy - while a work of fiction, discusses how nuclear weapons work in great detail and in a much more readable manner (though some people do consider it among his drier works).

It can be said as the second most deadliest weapon humans have ever created. It can be launched from any where Under Sea  Land  Or air  Nuclear weapons however will never be used because use of a nuclear bomb by any nation will ultimately lead to world war 3. ",
