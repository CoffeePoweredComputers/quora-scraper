            "answer_text": "Increased automation in the workforce has caused many to fear their jobs will soon be taken over by robots \u2013 and, experts now warn even the military will be affected by the shift.  The use of robots could help the US military to cut costs and would allow them to remove soldiers from potentially dangerous environments, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. Experts say the move has already begun in many ways, with newer warships like the USS Zumwalt designed to be manned by half the crew of previous destroyers, and Navy researchers experimenting with \u2018ghost fleets\u2019 of underwater drones. As driverless cars hold the potential to take over taxi and truck driver jobs, a similar scenario could play out in the military to support troops. Robots could take on a number of tasks, from managing and delivering supplies or analyzing thousands of legal documents, to quickly diagnosing diseases and assisting in the operating room.  Just as in the civilian economy, automation will likely have a big impact on military organizations in logistics and manufacturing,\u2019 Michael Horowitz, a University of Pennsylvania professor and an expert on weaponized robots told the San Diego Union-Tribune. \u2018The US military is very likely to pursue forms of automation that reduce \u2018back-office\u2019 costs over time, as well as remove soldiers from non-combat deployments where they might face risk from adversaries on fluid battlefields, such as in transportation.\u2019 Robots could also be used to detect and dismantle mines. Horowitz also points to current technologies that already aim to reduce the number of human operators, such as the guided-missile destroyer Zumwalt. The ship carries 147 sailors, half that of similar warships, and deploys up to three MQ-8 Fire Scout helicopters. Unmanned drone helicopters can pinpoint targets, map terrain, and detect bad weather. Recent reports have shown that the use of robots and artificial intelligence in the workplace is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. A report from the White House published in December warned that machines could soon replace millions of human workers. Less-skilled workers are likely to be hit the hardest, which could cause an even greater divide of wealth inequality. But, the report also suggests AI could improve the country's productivity growth, which would result in higher wages and fewer work hours. 'These transformations will open up new opportunities for individuals, the economy, and society, but they have the potential to disrupt the current livelihoods of millions of Americans,' the report states. Whether AI leads to unemployment and increases in inequality over the long-run depends not only on the technology itself but also on the institutions and policies that are in place.' REPORT REVEALS JOBS WITH HIGH POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATION In a recent McKinsey report, researchers analyzed more than 2,000 work activities for over 800 occupations, looking at the amount of time spent on particular activities, and the feasibility of automating these tasks. For jobs that involve performing predictable physical activities, the researchers say the feasibility of automation is roughly 78 percent. The findings include: 59 percent of manufacturing activities could be automated. Within this field, the researchers say 90 percent of the activities of welders, cutters, solderers, and brazers could be done by a robot.73 percent of activities in foodservice and accommodations could be automated53 percent of retail work could be automated; 47 percent of the salesperson\u2019s job could be automated, while 86 percent of bookkeepers, accountant and auditing clerks has this potential For jobs that involve performing predictable physical activities, the researchers say the feasibility of automation is roughly 78 percent. But, this is not the only factor to be considered when determining which jobs could soon be taken over by robots They also detailed the activities with low potential for automation: EducationHealthcare, especially those which require expertise and direct contact with patients, like a dental hygienist'Knowledge work,' including management jobs",

            "answer_text": "True AI doesn\u2019t exist and probably never will exist. Calling a system \u201cAI\u201d is simply a marketing buzzword. Fully autonomous combat systems are only useful in very limited situations and it is highly unlikely that the technology to support wider usage will ever be achieved. So, humans will remain in control of any general use combat systems for at least several decades into the future. The \u201cfuture of war\u201d will not be fought by military robots, or drones, or other toys that look great in Star Wars cartoons and in defense contractor sales pitches. Although several countries (including the US) have politicians stupid enough to think such systems are desirable and worth investing a few billion dollars, the simple fact remains that there are valid technical reasons why it is impossible to have enough remote control circuits to control a \u201cwartime\u201d number of such systems simultaneously with humans in control. Automated systems and remotely controlled systems will play a larger role, but such systems are neither flexible enough nor robust enough to replace humans on the battlefield. ",
