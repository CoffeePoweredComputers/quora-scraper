            "answer_text": "7 Ways that Digital Technology Changes the Face of Education:- Benefits of Online Courses and Applications: Among the very first easy observations concerning digital technologies and instruction is that online schools and courses are getting to be widely accessible. Much free online courses known as\"MOOC's\" otherwise called Massive Open Online Courses have become popular. Online classes and entirely online applications allow it to be possible for students young and older to combine from all around the world in any given time, and to get easy access to your class or program in your home.Learning Textbooks Are Now Digitized: Check the backpack of many high school and college students, and you will find that physicals textbooks are slowly being replaced with iPads and various forms of devices connected to Online Media. With the fast-paced development of online media, e-books, e-readers, and learning programs developed for Smartphones, iPhones and iPads, the textbook is becoming \u201cextinct\u201d in some areas. You can forget the time when your backpack was loaded down with a stack of textbooks because learning is going online.Mobile Learning: A combination of the result of the sharp and sudden increase in the availability of online courses and programs, and the wide availability of online resources and books, you can now study from your phone. MOOC\u2019s such as the well-known \u201cBYJUS\u201d Smartphone Applications allows you to access your course(s) from your smartphone. Just open the course, plug in your headphones, and follow the content and the classroom discussions.Personalized Teaching and Learning: Due to the increase in the presence of Technology in the classroom, teachers now have more ability to personalize lessons, instructions, and projects for each group or child. By using devices and programs to distribute classwork and assignments, teachers can personalize lessons and focus on the work of each student. Individualized lessons can be provided to each student, and learning tools enable students to work, perform, and excel at their own pace. Teachers can also now provide feedback, grades, and reports directly to students through online platforms, and online school portals and log-ins.Advice and Education from Diverse Teachers: The growth of electronic technologies has also influenced the accessibility to varied teachers and teachers for students globally. One student could be within a multi-cultural online classroom with instructors with roots in South Africa, England, Brazil, Spain, Russia, and United States all in precisely the same moment. Teachers from various backgrounds and nations all contribute their unique viewpoints, cultures, and languages to the table of studying.Collaboration and Peer-to-Peer Learning in the Classroom: Having a rise in accessibility to online instruction, whether a part or complete instruction is supplied online, improved opportunities for students to collaborate from many different areas becomes possible. Student figures, subsequently, could be composed of students from all around the planet, with each continent represented. Students may communicate ideas and convey via applications supplied with their schools and informally through social media applications like Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest. Peer-to-Peer learning has become more and more popular as students discuss their thoughts with each other via online conversations and share files through applications like Google Docs. Teachers are supporting and establishing classrooms which inspire and occasionally need peer conversations.Data-Driven Instructions and Results: Another change that is occurring due to the rise of digital technology is the increase in data-driven instruction and results. Although some teachers are being forced to use online grading tools and devices, analysis tools are also becoming more precise. These devices and grading tools can provide more accurate results regarding student performance, but can also result in a teacher\u2019s limited ability to judge a student\u2019s performance based on the context of their writing, classroom performance, and other contributions.Conclusion:- Digital learning tools and technology fill the gaps where traditional classroom teaching falls behind. In fact, some of the efficiencies such tools bring are simply unmatchable by traditional learning techniques. From the environmental impact recognized by the need for less paper for handouts and books to saving time with quick access to information and the ease of research, digital learning provides an effective way to cut costs, maximize resources and heighten both reach and impact for students and educators alike.

            "answer_text": "The biggest obstacle to technology in education are teachers.  The quality of the profession has always been uneven at best.  If the quality of instruction is average or poor, technology will only help marginally. This idea will seem completely out of left field, but bare with me.  The federal government should give James Cameron a few billion dollars to redesign our entire middle school curriculum (where most students get off track, especially in math & science).  Let Cameron recruit the best and the brightest teachers & technology providers to build a cohesive and immersive classroom and equip the schools with the technology that makes the most sense in conveying these experiences. Imagine daily lectures in 3D that get students inside the human body to  understand how it works.  Or having every student taught math by an engaging teacher who can actually explain to students where they might use Calculus later in life.  Only someone like James Cameron could pull together the resources needed to pull something like this off.  It sounds crazy, but this guy takes on a project every decade and has a track record of pulling off some amazing feats.  If he were interested in a challenge like this, it would totally disrupt our lagging education system.  If the experiment is successful, let him take on high school, etc. ",
