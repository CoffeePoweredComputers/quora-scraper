            "answer_text": "Over what? DVD were more durable than VHS. DVDs did not wear out with playing, or get tangled up in the player. DVDs don\u2019t have tracking issues. DVDs have better video and audio. You could instantly seek to a new chapter, or ffwd/rev. VHS didn\u2019t suffer from problems with getting scratched. That is the only advantage I can think of. CDs are superior in every way to cassette and vinyl from a usage, fidelity perspective. Vinyl was better for showing off the album art though! CDs being smaller didn\u2019t have nearly as impressive album art, and album art probably became less important CDs and vinyl both scratch, but cassette tapes don\u2019t scratch. Vinyl can warp badly if left in a hot car, etc. Cassette tapes rapidly degraded their audio quality with each play. Over time they become susceptible to jamming. CD is far superior in almost every way to cassette and vinyl. Reel to reel is maybe not as bad for wear as vinyl and cassette, but it\u2019s hardly portable! ",
