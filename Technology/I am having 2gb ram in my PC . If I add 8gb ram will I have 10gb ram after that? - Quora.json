            "answer_text": "Hey brother, First of all RAM doesn\u2019t work like this. If you already have 2GB RAM you can only insert 2GB more not 4 or 8 GB. RAM runs in parallel series. So, if you thinking to make better you can add 8+8 GB RAM and it will be run as 16GB of RAM or you can add 4+4 GB of RAM and it will be run as 8 GB RAM. Depends on your system how much you system can support. Hope this helps! Regards, Ramandeep Singh ",
