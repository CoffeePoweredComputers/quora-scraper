            "answer_text": "By backup one would mean to look back later for the data you stored on this day. Currently pen drives, ssd\u2019s and the cloud are being used because of their robust way of solid state storage in tetra bytes. There are no mechanical moving parts to limit the mtbf. In this scenario, would you consider a medium that can accommodate few mega bytes that would probably be a small portion of your program? Floppy disks also have fungal growth problem that inhibits the readability by the drive. All these factors lead to the technological advances and the result are the currently used backup devices mentioned in the beginning. ",
