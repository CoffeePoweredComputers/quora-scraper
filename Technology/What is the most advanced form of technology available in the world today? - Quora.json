            "answer_text": "The question whats the most advanced technolgy we have is really broad and technolgy comes in many forms. Im gonna put forward my belief that the most advanced \u201cUSE\u201d of technolgy is the modern military. For example. Tanks have gone through more technological growth and devlopment in the past 100 years than any non military automobile and no kind of aircraft can compare to the speed of which fighter aircraft have been developing over the past 50 years. No ship in the world can compare to the multibillion aircraft carriers wirlding the latest detection, targeting and identification systems. The military funding is astonishing and every new kind of technolgy is alwasy there to be implemtned into military hardware. Wether it be peripherals, AI, materials, gadgets or even physics. It can be easy to say something like artifical intelligence, or quantum computing but in reality they are in their infancy. Quantum computing can be incredibly useful for the futurte but it has no practical use today. Right now quantum computer research is at its roots, were just getting started ready for when it becomes viable, cheap and better than the alternatives we have today so i wouodnt class that as the most advanced today. Artifical intelligence is definately up there but yet again its already being used within the military. AI is really new, really cool but yet still, in its infancy and i wouodnt count it as the most advanced. Right now almost nothing commercially can compare to military grade. ",

            "answer_text": "Can\u2019t say \u201cthe most advance\u201d but, i believe the growth in VFX (Visual Effects) and SFX (Special Effects) technology in movie making has been astounding in past few years. For those who don\u2019t know SFX are the effects which are physically created during filming of a shot, like bruises on face or bullet marks (makeup involved), blasting a car (if actually done). And, VFX are computer generated imagery applied to a live action footage during the post production of a movie. We love seeing them, because they take us to the world we otherwise couldn\u2019t ever visit. The first ever movie to handle SFX is basically a footage from \u2018Two ways of life\u2019 by Oscar G. Rejlander called \u2018The Execution Of Mary\u2019 in 1857!! Yes 1857! That\u2019s a long ago. Coming along towards 21st century, we came across Jurassic Park (1993) by Dir. Steven Spielberg, showcased digitally generated dinosaurs on big screen, which opened the mind to power the application of CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) in shots and exploited the possibilities of it. T-REX in JURASSIC PARK (1993)  Nowadays every single movie rely on the power of VFX, new techniques are being instituted by the studios such as Motion-Capture which enables to extract the performance of an actor (like expressions and movements) which is later applied to the animated characters. The highest grossing movie of all time (as per 2017), AVATAR (2009) by James Cameron, majorly scaled the use Motion-Capture, resulting in dynamic performance of the animated characters which feels identical to their real world counterparts.  Camera to the front enabled to capture performance (facial expressions) in real time. Progressing from simple 3-D animation to Motion-Performance-Capture in such short span is staggering. This advancement brought us many of our favorite characters to life on screen, like King Kong, Hulk, Iron Man, Caeser (planet of the apes) and many many others. Caeser from The Rise Of The Planet Apes.  Massive use of Green Screens during filming helps adding up to necessary details (especially landscapes) in the shot which makes totally impossible to exceptionally realistic. Here are some shots before and after affects. 300-Rise of and Empire    The Avengers  The Rise Of The Planet Apes  The Chronicles of Narnia   The Wolverine   Life of Pi  Doesn\u2019t end here, It\u2019s interesting and sad to know that now you don\u2019t need an actor to play. A fully Digital human can be easily created of same attributes. Young Carrie fisher in Rogue One  Young Steve Rogers in Captain America  ..are digitally created. Its notable to see that Carrie Fisher in Rogue one didn\u2019t really acted, but, to make performance feel rational, many other actor\u2019s performance was patched over her digitally created face and many of her reference videos were used. It doesn\u2019t end here too, Now comes the future i.e. VIRTUAL REALITY 360\u00b0 As VFX is the most expensive part of movie making, so live action movie in VR will cost hefty amounts of money as the VFX needs to be applied to 360\u00b0 but not just a bounded rectangle frame. Earlier in the days of movie making it nearly took 12 hr to render the T-Rex scene in Jurassic world, which now takes few minutes and comes up with astounding real touch. Tools such as Lytro Cinema, captures all the rays of light within a scene, providing a rich amount of Light Field data. Every pixel has color properties, directional properties, and its exact placement in space. Lytro Cinema is defying the traditional physics of on set capture by virtualizing creative camera decisions. Infinite creative choices can be generated in post-production including unprecedented control over focus, perspective, aperture and shutter angle \u2013 recreating impossible shots. That\u2019s where this technology is headed in such a short span, creating impossible! Source: Google Images & Lytro ",
