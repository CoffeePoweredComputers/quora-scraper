            "answer_text": "Hi, thanks for A2A. It depends on the adapter that have come with the power bank you bought. Lets take a look at this concept. The charging time basically depends on the charger you use. A formula to solve how long to charge a power bank: Charging time in hours = ( power bank capacity in mAh) /(charging rate in mA) Literally there are 2 factors will affect the charging rate : Output of charger ( Tap ) & Input of power bank ( Water Flow ) Currently most power banks are designed with 5V 2A input standard, which stands for the biggest amount of flow it can accept. Theoretically the charger you use to juice up such a power bank should be able to provide 2 A current flow which exactly match the needs. However, considering an estimated 15% power consumptionduring charging/discharging process, the actual input current would be 1700 mA ( 1.7A ). Applying the formula above the power bank 20000 mAh rated charging time = 20000 mAh / 1700 mA = 11.76 hours If you use a 1A rated charger, the charging time will be doubled to around 24 hours, which is not that acceptable. Hope it helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. The charging time massively depends on the type of charger you use. If you use a 2A charger, the time will be 16000 mAh / 2000 mA / conversion rate, assume the conversion rate is 85%, the charging time is 9.4 hours. Some power banks support input quick charge and dual input ports, the charging time would be much less. Details on EasyAcc Quick Charge 3.0 20000mAh Fastest Power Bank with 2 Inputs and 4 Outputs ",
