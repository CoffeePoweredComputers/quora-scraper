            "answer_text": "To my understanding, that is a pretty broad question. There are different approaches: Simply trying because of the hype.Systematically and seriously pursuing the field.I\u2019ll try jotting my two cents on the latter. Let\u2019s take a simpler example. Consider pursuing AI like running a marathon.  First and foremost : It\u2019s a pretty darn long marathon. This is not to discourage you, but also not suger-coating reality. A lot of people I\u2019ve come across fashion themselves as AI enthusiasts after trying the Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng on Coursera. This is certainly not true. Thus, it is important to make your target clear : Why do you wish to pursue it?What are your motivations? and most importantly\u2026What problems do you wish to solve. (Note: Getting a buzzword to slap on your Resume, isn\u2019t a valid problem.)Part 1: Start by getting a better understanding of the field. Aspects like the primary goals of AI, approaches in terms of schools of thoughts and most importantly, applications. There\u2019s a reason athletes warm up before a workout. Part 2: Once you\u2019ve cleared that, commit to trying on someone hands on like a MOOC. Note: Before you decide to dive in completely, it is important to test the waters and not with both your feet. Remember, attrition rate from top MOOC sites have crossed 95%. This is also important viewing that initial encounters with the dry theory and math part might either disinterest or intimidate you. You see, Tony Stark\u2019s cool and all but sometimes you do gotta walk before you can run. Coursera : Machine Learning by Stanford UniversityUdemy : Artificial Intelligence A-Z\u2122: Learn How To Build An AIUdemy : Deep Learning A-Z\u2122: Hands-On Artificial Neural NetworksPart 3: Ensure a Math BASE. By now, you\u2019ve decided to wholesomely devote at least 6 months of time for pursuing the discipline in a full fledge manner. Make sure you\u2019re ready with the prerequisites. Consider this to be preparing for the long run. A common mistake I\u2019ve seen people make while learning field is run from math. Do NOT run from math. You math arsenal should contain: Linear Algebra (MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005 - YouTube) and here\u2019s a cherry on top of that (Essence of linear algebra - YouTube)Probability (Statistics 110: Probability - YouTube)Differential Equations (MIT Learn Differential Equations - YouTube)Here\u2019s a shortcut but I don\u2019t suggest taking it (The Math of Intelligence - YouTube)Common Mistake : I was suggested by some not to get into the prerequisite part, but it doesn\u2019t work that way.Part 4: Ensure a Programming BASE. Until you plan on doing calculations for a single problem for the rest of your life (still not end up completing it) you\u2019ll need computing muscle. You can choose your preferred language, but python is suggestible. You can find ample of resources on Youtube and among MOOCs for pursuing this one. Part 5 : Ensure an Algorithmic BASE. A lot of people miss this one. Although a major part of it can be learned along the way, if you want your journey to be smooth, I suggest eating this frog first, preferably on that language you took up. Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization by (Data Structures and Algorithms | Coursera) This one\u2019s more practical.Algorithms Specialization by Stanford University (Algorithms | Coursera) This one\u2019s more theoretical.Introduction to Algorithms by MIT OCW (MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms, Fall 2011 - YouTube) Done with the BASE. Now the actual training begins. (Hit the Rocky track!)  This might not be perfect, but necessary sufficient in my opinion to get you up and flying to challenge yourself with implementing some of the state of the art methods. Lets divide the training in three parts: Machine LearningDeep LearningReinforcement LearningPart 1: Machine Learning Go through Andrew Ng\u2019s Stanford Lectures (Lecture Collection | Machine Learning - YouTube). Note : These are much more comprehensive than the Coursera version and actually cover the important math part and intuitions for deriving results.Follow his lecture notes and do finish the four problem sets. (This is the best way to prepare a great runway for your flight to take-of) There was some discrepancy with the Stanford link for the course material but you can find it at this Github repository (Yao-Yao/CS229-Machine-Learning). Simply binge watching the video lectures won\u2019t help.Now, try to apply what you learned. Here\u2019s a great Youtube playlist for that (Machine Learning with Python - YouTube).If you want more, follow a textbook. I suggest Elements of Statistical Learning as a comprehensive guide for this one.Part 2: Deep Learning Depending on your capacity in terms of intensity, start with a MOOC if you prefer to get an overall understanding. I would definitely vouch for Deep Learning Specialization by none other than Ng.Back to business. For thorough understanding, go for Hugo Larochelle\u2019s online course. (Hugo Larochelle) Try to cover as much as you can from the course contents.Note : One important part from Deep Learning will be cracking your head at papers, especially in cases with relatively newer models. Don\u2019t shy away from it.Follow the Deep Learning Book by the masters of the field namely Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. Do it. Period. (Deep Learning)Next you can choose a direction if you wish to specialize for example:CS231n for Computer Vision. (CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition)CS224d for Natural Language Processing (CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing)There\u2019s an NLP course by Oxford and DeepMind too. (https://machinelearningmastery.com/oxford-course-deep-learning-natural-language-processing/)Again time to get your hands dirty. I couldn\u2019t find a better place to start than Fast.ai (Deep Learning For Coders-36 hours of lessons for free)Some other resources if you wish to try are (Deep Learning Tutorials) and (Creative Applications of Deep Learning with TensorFlow | Kadenze).Part 3: Reinforcement Learning Level 1 : Try this Udacity course on Reinforcement Learning, shouldn\u2019t take long. (Reinforcement Learning)Next hop on to lectures by David Silver. You can find the course contents here : (Teaching)You can add the lectures from UC Berkley too for better understanding. (CS 294 Deep Reinforcement Learning, Fall 2017)  Phew! That was quite a marathon. Now you can start your true AI journey by taking on the AI classic text : Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mperkows/CLASS_479/2017_ZZ_00/02__GOOD_Russel=Norvig=Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach%20(3rd%20Edition).pdf For Video Lectures on Artificial Intelligence: MIT OCW (MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2010 - YouTube)Lectures by Pieter Abbeel (CS 188 2014 Artificial Intelligence Class by Pieter Abbeel - YouTube)Trust me, if you\u2019ve been through all that with sincerity, you\u2019re more than prepared to put some serious dents in the field and also to make your path from then on.  Some sources to stay up to date with the field: Open AI Blog (OpenAI Blog)DeepMind Blog (News & Blog | DeepMind)ML Mastery (Start Here With Machine Learning - Machine Learning Mastery)Some other groups to follow would be Google Brain, FAIR etc.Follow active professionals on Twitter to stay tapped into the front foot discussions and twists and turns.There are some interesting newsletters too: Jack AI, Import AI, Machine Learnings, Morning Paper, MIT Tech Review, Wild Week in AI.Some mistakes to AVOID: Please don\u2019t run away from the Math.Don\u2019t unnecessarily abstract away with things. What I mean is that maybe in the end you are going to work with high end APIs that is going to simply apply your pipeline but if your process breaks down (which is almost certainly will while building) you won\u2019t know how to fix it. And this, according to the experts, is one of the biggest barrier to flow in the field.Don\u2019t fall into the resource dump. There\u2019s a ton of resources out there and it\u2019s not practical or required to cover everything. Often you\u2019ll come across something people around you are doing or even organically you land upon that might make you want to jump ships. Remember, the grass is always greener on the other side.Be persistent. You will naturally like some parts of the run more than other. But we all know what happens to a download when it stops at even 99%.Personal note : AI as a field started in 1960s, went through bubble phase, a winter after that and now again. It is important how you see it, as a gold rush, or as an enabling tool to solve problems. In the end, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re weak at Math or suck at programming or lack the necessary background, if you have your goal clear as to why you started, you\u2019ll triumph. To give an estimate, the entire saga shouldn\u2019t take more than 6 months, conservatively speaking, and if dedicated enough is possible to accomplish in 3 months. (Yes, that\u2019s true!)  Good luck buddy!  ",
