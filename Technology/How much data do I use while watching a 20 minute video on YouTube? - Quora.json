            "answer_text": "The Data that is used or transferred during a 20 minute video watching is mostly depends on the quality of the video being watched. Here, quality means the resolution of the video (Eg: 728*1024, 2048*1080 and so on or we can simply say 1K, 2K, 4K and so on) , the framerate of the video that is basically measured in Frames Per Second (FPS) and some other characteristics. You may see that the quality difference of an 2MP(MegaPixel) Camera\u2019s Picture and an 8MP Camera\u2019s Picture and you can also see that the size of the picture also varies when pixels per inch (PPI) increases or as resolution increases. Same theory applies here. That when the resolution and frame rate and some other characteristics that determines the quality of the video increases the size or the data used by the video also increases. Typically. a general .MP4 video of 20 minutes of quality 720p needs 150MB of data, and it increases if you choose a video with 1080P resolution. You can also shrink the size of the video without much lose (Data Compression) and many other video extensions like .mkv provides much lesser size video when compared to same .mp4. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a lot of variance of the file size of videos, but the average for regular HD 720p is around 4 MB per minute. That would mean on average it would take 80 MB of your data allowance to watch the 20 minute 720p video. There are so many factors that determine the size of a video, but one of the main things is how static or dynamic the visual content the video is. If the video has more static images like a \u2018slideshow\u2019 then file size will be less than 4MB per minute. But if the video is dynamic, meaning each frame of the video keeps changing such as an action shot of a sports event, then the file size will probably be well over 4MB per minute. You can also control the quality of the video. If you want to use less data then reduce the quality. To learn how to control the video quality of the playback google the following \u201cadjust youtube video quality on mobile\u201d. ",
