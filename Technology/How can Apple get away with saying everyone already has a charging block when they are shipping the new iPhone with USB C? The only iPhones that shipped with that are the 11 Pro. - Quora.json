            "answer_text": " Apple\u2019s pretty much expecting today\u2019s new iPhone 12 user to already be an iPhone user, Macintosh user, or iPad user. If you have owned an iPhone or iPad since 2012, you already have a power brick (aka, charging block, charger, etc\u2026 it\u2019s not actually a charger, but that\u2019s what everyone calls it) with a Lightning cable and you don\u2019t even need the Type-C to Lightning cable in the box. If you have a recent Macintosh or an iPad Pro, the cable in the box will let you charge from a Macintosh or a Macintosh/iPad Pro power brick, both of which use USB Type C. What\u2019s maybe not being said is that you\u2019re supposed to either trade in that old iPhone or toss it out. So you don\u2019t need a new power brick, you can use the one from your old phone. Apple claiming that leaving out the power brick is for the environment is pretty rich coming from Apple. After all, their unreplaceable battery, their unserviceable cases, their fighting against right-to-repair laws, their all-glass cases, etc. are all aimed at making the iPhone relatively short-lived, a thing you replace every year or two, not a thing that lasts for years, not a thing you can as easily sell used or give to a kid when you\u2019re done with it. How does Apple get away with this? The same way they get away with non-replaceable batteries, USB 2.0-only interfacing, no video output, proprietary connectors, small batteries, high prices, huge profits, no headphone jack, no fingerprint reader, only 12 megapixel cameras, etc\u2026 they\u2019re Apple. They\u2019re the only company that makes iPhones. You get what you get and you don\u2019t get upset, or you jump over to Android, which may be a tall hill to climb for people who like Apple. And just to be fair, yes, leaving the power dongle and earbuds out of the box is a good thing for the environment, it\u2019s just the one that probably makes an additional billion or two dollars for Apple in the process. Rather than, say, making the phone out of things that don\u2019t smash to bits when they drop, or building in a battery that lasts two days. But this will go beyond Apple, because once Apple gets away with it, you can expect others to follow.  Another factor: saving money. Apple does love their high smartphone profit margins. This year, though, they didn\u2019t raise the prices, but they did include a 5G-NR cellular modem, the Qualcomm X55. But that\u2019s actually less of an issue than you might think. Qualcomm and other traditional telecom manufacturers have long ago integrated cellular modems into their system-on-chip designs. But when new technology comes out, it comes in the form of an external modem which will eventually get integrated in a future SoC. So in 2019 and 2020, 4G/LTE phones don\u2019t have an external modem, 5G phones often do. But Apple doesn\u2019t have their own modem technology (they bought Intel\u2019s earlier this year, but it\u2019s not ready yet). So they\u2019ve always had an external cellular modem. In fact, they were Intel\u2019s last major customer, which is why Apple pretty much had to get in-house cellular modem technology\u2026 there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll always get what you want as an external component. So going to 5G-NR is not any different than what Apple\u2019s done in the past. Sure, any 5G radio system is more power hungry, with more antennas and other components in addition to all the hardware you already had to support 3G and 4G.  It\u2019s actually, in a weird way, a good branding move, too. Even after Apple started supporting fast charging (USB Power Delivery) in the iPhone, they still shipped with the low power 5W power adapters. So users did not routinely see fast charging, and they didn\u2019t necessarily experience wireless charging. Now, while some users will stick with \u201cwhatever they used for the previous iPhone\u201d, others will buy new power bricks or wireless pads. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Apple discontinues their cheap 5W device, but even if they don\u2019t, they have the opportunity to sell you on fast charging without having to spend 3x as much to drop it in the box, and if you buy a cheaper 3rd party unit and it doesn\u2019t perform, well, it\u2019s not the iPhone\u2019s fault. Same idea with earbuds\u2026 they ship with awful quality earbuds, and that\u2019s what most users are listening through\u2026. those who listen. Everyone else drops the earbuds in a drawer, eventually they work their way to landfills. If you\u2019re paying for some kind of earbud or headphone, same quality issues: buy the pricey one from Apple or you\u2019re to blame for bad sound. Not Apple. ",

            "answer_text": "The two gentlemen who answered the question before me don't seem to be getting the \u201cUSB-C\u201d part. I'll elaborate. Traditionally all the iPhones were shipped with USB-A to Lightning cable and a USB-A charging brick.   The exception was the iPhone 11 where it was shipped with a Lightning to USB-C cable and a USB-C charging brick.  The problem arises here. The iPhone 12 comes with a Lightning to USB-C cable but the only people who have these adapters are those who own the iPhone 11 series. But they are unlikely to upgrade to the 12 series (exceptions exist in every scenario). The people who buy the iPhone 12 series will then have to buy a seperate USB-C adapter which costs about 20$ (\u20b91900 in India) plus shipping. The Magsafe one costs 39$ (\u20b92900 in India) plus shipping (All prices are offiicial prices from Apple store). To the people who say I could just use an old adapter and cable, sure you could, but you wouldn't get the 20W fast charging then. You'll get a standard 5W output. Now coming to the actual question \"How does Apple get away with this?\" Simple answer? Because they can! And the millions of Apple fans will still buy it! (No offence). The environment aspect was just a cover up. Apple removed the charging brick so that they can promote the new MagSafe charger, very similar to how they removed the headphone jack to increase sales of AirPods. There are many leaks already that the iPhone 13 will not have ANY charging port and will completely move to wireless charging, thus forcing people to buy the MagSafe charger extra on top of the iPhone. With this they not only save huge amounts on cost and shipping but also drastically increase revenue from sales of the new products. I mean, when you run out of ideas to gouge customers, you have to go lower and lower. Remember the 1000$ stand and the 700$ wheels?? Sure its a bummer for the public, but a great way of taking advantage of millions of Apple fans. Bomus! Here's a Dad-joke- Q- why did Apple remove the charger and earbuds from the box? A- Because they like to think Out-of-the-box! I've managed to earn an eye-roll from you! ",
