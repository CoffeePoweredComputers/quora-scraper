            "answer_text": "Empathy and imagination. Sometimes it is the smallest thing that can make the difference and understanding an individual\u2019s difficulties sprinkled with some imagination can make a huge difference. Listening is important. Often what makes things difficult is quite alien to you and individuals may have a compensating advantage. I can remember once being quite shocked to learn one individual could learn phone numbers from the sound they made when dialled in an electronic device. Another individual was always fiddling and I think was probably told off by others. She once tied several treasury tags on the handle of my laptop bag. I saw her doing so and it was not worth making an issue of it; she recognised that I was not irritated by it and I recognised that the fiddling somehow helped her learn/concentrate. The next time I saw her I had left the treasury tags on my bag and as I got it out she looked up at me with what I can only describe as gratitude. For some reason the fact I had accepted what she had done was incredibly important. There are few formulas and the rewards do not always come as qualifications in the pupils. In fact I once did a little teaching in a mental hospital for youngsters. The psychologist who always did an exit meeting with teachers who came in rather than those based there permanently, was buzzing after one session. He\u2019d heard that one of their most troubled pupils had smiled - twice! It seemed odd that he\u2019d been told and was so pleased about what seemed trivial. (I do like to think my pupils in general had lots of smile moments). he looked at my puzzled face and pointed out that the successes in that establishment were measured in smiles and progress, not GCSEs. Hopefully this lengthy reply gives you an idea of some of the skills that are useful but have no certificates as well as some of the rewards. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many but these two are what I would consider the most important ones: Patience Sensory processing tends to be slower in persons with learning disabilities. Therefore, interactions and reactions usually occur at a slower pace. It is not uncommon to wait for five seconds or longer after asking a question to get a reply. This must be taken into account, as any signs of frustration due to the slower pace can emanate through body language and cause anxiety. An interesting thought is how a learning disability can affect one\u2019s perception of time. Generally speaking, the lower the IQ, the quicker time appears to pass. That five second delay for you won\u2019t feel that long for them. Adaptability Everyone is unique. What approach works for one person may be the complete opposite of what is required for another. To be able to adjust to the various wavelengths of personalities is key. It\u2019s also important to adapt your language to varying levels of verbal ability. It can be so easy to slip out an idiom or turn of phrase that could be taken literally. Thinking about cats and dogs falling out of the sky when it\u2019s raining may scare some people. ",

            "answer_text": "Resilience When you whole world is upside-down, no one will ever believe it, and those who could will not understand that when the sun shines, it lights the skies above them, it shines for them alone\u2026 But when you shine your world from within you, that light can defy even the laws of nature, and you can light up your world how you want\u2026  To do that, you have to master your own strengths, and never forget, all those times you did, it was your own resilience, the one that grows with every loss and every victory.  Personal Experience For the past 6 years, I\u2019ve been earning a rather small stipend for research I am trying my best to deliver on. For the past 6 years I\u2019ve been working with the kindest person I know, and yet my 18 years of trying to get the proper diagnosis for my condition in order to find the right support to cope with unpredictable and disabling executive dysfunction have left me in slow painful death since I finished my degrees. Before that, I finished my undergraduate degree in 4 years plus one summer and all the summers in between. And in that final year, I was diagnosed with ADHD and visual processing learning disability, and put on medication. Still I managed to get a scholarship and immediately went on to finishing my masters, which took 5 years instead of 2. After 10 years of trying to find a way to cope with ADHD, I am trapped with another half-baked medical negligence act of my doctors, who basically say it is Asperger\u2019s and then refuse to help me get properly documented. They claim my problem is I need to change my perspective on life. They kicked me out of their office a couple of years later, this past November, and they had the audacity to do it while I was still being prescribed medication, and not even notify my family doctor who also does not even care. For the past 6 years, while I was at home, I was always told by others, we are working so it makes sense that you take on the endless \u201cupkeep\u201d chores, like getting building maintenance to fix stuff. Which I did, and even threw in a few things like cleaning and organizing since that also kept my life in a good shape while things get sorted out. I need to be able to wake up and work. And I need to do it dealing with 6 years of unrelenting and progressively more disabling executive dysfunction. And I need to do all that alone. I need to do it knowing that the system is failing to give me my due right, they are failing to help me properly document the provisional cause of my suffering. I need to do it knowing that at least 10 mental health workers have heard my pleading\u2026 I am not suicidal because that would hurt those I love, but I want nothing more than to be dead\u2026 And I need to do it knowing that they maybe think they did their job, and sure they tried, but they never put down in writing anything that could actually help. In fact, some of them prefered to sign off their emails saying they are going on vacation, and I should call 911 if I needed help. Since COVID, I\u2019ve been the only person at home who is earning for a living and this morning I decided to I was going to up my game\u2026 I decided to tell my family, there is 2 of you, I have to go to work in my room all week, there are 2 things that needed urgent fixing for so long now, and you should get on top of that. I told them I want to feel that when I was offended left and right on account of you working hard, that it was not just cheap talk now that things are flipped around. Shortly after, I was getting overwhelmed by all the negative karma that I accumulated over the years, and so I got up from my seat with my running shoes which I bought and never used for running, I decided to bounce around the house landing delicately as I possibly could on the tip of my feet\u2026 and I made a wonky incoherent sound like I would when I was 7 years old\u2026  I did 3-4 steps at a time, then tried very very hard to stop myself from falling on the ground from laughing\u2026  The stim did its job, but the real pick me up came after my family said to me \u201care you okay\u201d with as many imaginary exclamation marks it would take to signal that they still think I see doctors who help fix my crazy \u2026  To which I replied\u2026 \u201cOh, just pumping my mood to get things done for the day\u2026 how are you today?!\u201d  The difference between what blissfully ignorant so called \u201cable and normal\u201d people call resilience and what I learned it to be, it is when it comes from within you when no one in your reality is empowering you to be. I was graceful when I was being resilient, and I always had to find it from within. But those around me who I know have always shown resilience, they grow addicted to being motivated by an always fleeting sense of false empowerment they could have in the extremely discriminatory thing we call society. And once they were addicted to its perversions, they forgot to remember their own strengths, and they contaminated the resilience within with a reward dynamic they have no control over. They will need to learn to find their own resilience. Just like I had to. Just like I must continue to remind myself when I forget. And just like I have to find non-toxic ways to unleash it within me and not be bothered by what little those who mistake blind empowerment with resilience would think.  Why?! Because the world will never relent, it will always find unintentional and socially appropriate ways to very very criminally tear your ambition to shreds\u2026  And so, you must learn to be resilient so that you would find the harmony within. Hope this helps \u2014 Thanks Roksana! ",
