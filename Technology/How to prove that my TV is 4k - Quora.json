            "answer_text": "I'm not I'm not being a butthead here, unlike I was just treated earlier so just in case all these formed things all end up together and stuff I just want you to know this is not me being rude. So let's get to the point, first of all it's going to be no more than a year old more than likely. Second if you just got it look at the Box it'll say 4K or UHD or or either 1440p or 2600 p I forget which for television versus computer monitor but one of those two. If that doesn't help, before going through the trouble of simply looking up the brand name and the model number on the manufacturer's website or even just Google. You should have HDMI ports on it and more than likely cable if you use cable also nowadays more than likely you have a DVD or a Blu-ray player which one plug into the HDMI port. Now on your remote there should be a input button which changes which Port receives a signal on the side of your TV or the back. So plug in your other device I mean even Chromecast or fire Fire TV stick require HDMI ports. But actually they might not go all the way up to 4K they might stop at 1080p Essence there actually using the internet. Anyways so turn on whatever device you plugged into the HDMI port and turn on your cable box. Turn on the TV find that button that says input actually even before doing that look on the remote 4 a button that says display it may be a button that does two different things like and has the word display written on top and subtitle written on bottom. But anyway if you see a display button hit display and on the screen of the television it will tell you all the information that you need to know like what for its using what resolution it's using which is what your question is and how many hertz it's running which will be either 50 60 or 120 hertz if it's for K it's going to be 120 unless somehow are you managed to find a miracle deal. So back to the input button if there is no display button with each device is plugged into the television all turned on cycle through the input button and generally up in the corner or down on the bottom as it each input starts receiving a signal from an outside device it won't pop up a quick display of the resolution and the Hertz and the port number like well I don't know what like that's just how it should be. By this time you probably found that answer, cuz I'm really good at just rambling. But if you still haven't been able to find the information out. Go to the manufacturer website and just type the make and model in their search box on their webpage once you do that when you get to the page that's actually showing the actual TV that you have read the stats or it will actually say statistics and and features usually companies put the same things and stats and features but stats is like Technical and features is displayed in a manner that's easy to understand. And if that doesn't work at the bottom of their web page will be a contact us tab just call him and they'll tell you where to look. Good luck. Oh, by the way it would be kind of cool 2 let me know if then if it's a smart TV and what brand it is and what service that uses if it is a smart TV out of curiosity of my own. As my buddy literally just bought last week a Roku TV which has a built-in Roku I on the other hand would buy a Fire TV, and my brother who uses an iPhone would buy an Apple TV. So you could see my curiosity ",

            "answer_text": "If your tv is smart tv, chances are it might have support for youtube. Goto YouTube , search for 4k video and play them. While the video is playing, use your remote to open the player ui . There will be a icon in left bottom corner named 4k , highlighted in blue color. This indicates that the video is being played in 4k. Another method is to simply download any 4k video from youtube or any other site, copy them to your pendrive and playback it in your tv. ",
