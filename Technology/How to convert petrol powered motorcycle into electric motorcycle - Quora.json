            "answer_text": "Hi, Sure thing it\u2019ll take some time but it\u2019s not that hard. The hardness of the project depends on the specifications that you request from end result. I am currently doing an electric conversion project with my \u201993 Vespa PX200E. You can follow the whole process via 220 Garage youtube channel. There are many different details in this work but it\u2019s not as hard as it seems. You need to do little bit research. I just try to make you think about what you need, what you are going to do. Select the motorcycle you want to convert.First of all you need to decide the motorcycle itself. It\u2019s better if you choose a lightweight motorcycle with convenient space for your battery pack, controller and motor. Also weight of the motorcycle will let you know the required electric motor size.What is your purpose of using the motorcycle?The answer of this question will let you select the correct electric motor type for your project. Simply, if you need a high performance and speed electric motorbike it\u2019s better for you to use mid-drive motor. You need to calculate the correct gear size to use this one. But result will be better than hub-motors. If you need a commuter and don\u2019t need highest performance, then hub motor is the perfect fit. It\u2019s easier to use hub-motors. It\u2019s very easy to install.What will be your target range?By replying this question, you\u2019ll decide for the amount of batteries that you need to use.Electric Motor SpecsAccording to the weight and performance needs, you can decide the power of electric motor. Working voltage and motor type.Which battery technology are you going to use?Of course there are different battery technologies being used. Most popular technologies are 18650 Li-Ion batteries and Gel Batteries. Li-Ion is more expensive but charges faster, lasts longer and lighter. It\u2019s vice versa for gel batteries. Battery pack for electric motorcycle is probably the most expensive part.ControllerController will depend to your electric motor and battery pack. You can find cheap or expensive products. Main difference is performance and life of the controller. Since this piece will control the amount of electricity flowing to the motor, it affects the range and performance of the bike.Mechanical work and assemblyWhen you decide to all ingredients, now it\u2019s time to use your mechanical power to assemble and testing.This was a very short summary and there are many missing points. Please do research, plan and practice before starting your electrification project. ",

            "answer_text": "It is really good that people have started understanding the need of environment and have started the use of green mobility solutions. It\u2019s even exciting that many companies have started manufacturing electric mobility solutions such as electric skate boards to electric scooters to electric cars. If you too want to opt for eco-friendly transportation and want to convert your conventional bike into e bike, then I have a way. There is a Sweden brand that has developed such a product that can be utilized to convert any regular motorcycle into motorcycle. They have a smart engine which converts any bike into an electric one! Check this link. ",
