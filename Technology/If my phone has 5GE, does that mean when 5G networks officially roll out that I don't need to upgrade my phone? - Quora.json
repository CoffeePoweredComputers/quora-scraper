Th fact that you have \u201c5GE\u201d immediately tells me that you are using AT&T\u2026 and therefore, you are another, yes, another victim of the marketing campaigns of AT&T and their misleading publicity. Don\u2019t get confused. 5GE means, according to AT&T 5G Evolution\u2026which in real terms, it a 4G LTE network. Enhanced LTE actually. BUT, that DOES NOT means that you are on a real 5G network when you are connected with the so called 5GE mode. See, cell phone companies are sometimes big liers, just to grab customers, they lie in terms of what type of network they are really offering to their customers. When 4G came out, many networks announced 4G when in reality they were offering very high quality 3G speeds. Now, the story repeats, AT&T offers their \u201c5GE\u201d which has the \u201c5G\u201d in there and thus confuses people, making them believe there are on the latest and newest 5G when they are not. Maybe they will, eventually, but not at that moment with 5GE. Here is a link to an article that explains more in depth this situation and even provides speed comparisons among different cell phone companies, one being AT&T on their \u201c5GE\u201d conconction. Don\u2019t fall for the lies. https://www.tomsguide.com/us/5ge-explained,news-2932 ",

            "answer_text": "5GE is AT&T\u2019s dumb name for one of the faster variants of LTE (in other words what everyone else calls 4G). When 5G networks roll out nobody needs to upgrade their phone. Or to be more accurate when 5G rolls out the 4G networks remain in place and nobody needs to do anything to keep their current phones working. If you want the modest speed bump 5G gets you (and if you are on \u201c5GE\u201d you have one of the faster 4G variants) you do need a 5G phone. At some point the 4G network will go away. AT&T is still running the 3G network until feb 2022, so it is fair to assume that 4G will continue for a long time. Well, except most carriers have (or are at least buying) some technology that can dynamically split up some of the frequency range between 4G and 5G on the fly so 4G might both actually stay longer, but actually get squeezed out harder then 3G. At any rate I do think you have a few years before you need to care. ",
