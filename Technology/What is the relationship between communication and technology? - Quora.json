            "answer_text": "Heya. I\u2019ve noticed a mostly positive relationship between communication and technology - at least there has been for me. Three months ago, my baby sister moved to America (by baby, I mean 19, but she\u2019ll always be my baby sister). Before we had technology in hand, I probably would have had to send her letters, wait a month for it to arrive, then wait for a reply. Maybe call on important occasions, after saving for a month or three beforehand. Instead, I have her on the other end of a cell phone. It was my dad\u2019s 50th the other day, she called him on his birthday, got videos and photos of his huge party, then I spent nearly two hours on the phone with her the next day talking about it all. I spent nearly two hours video calling my sister in the United States, and it cost me nothing. We already have unlimited internet, so there are no huge internet bills. That\u2019s on the opposite side of the word, and I could hold a conversation with her like she was standing right in front of me. My father is (in simple words (I can\u2019t remember the actual job title) a business coach. In fact, for a while he was a coach coaching other coaches, signing them up and helping them through the start of their own businesses. Most of his clients are overseas, and he uses all sorts of fancy websites, and IP calling to talk to them. He uses technology and communication to keep his business going. When I got diagnosed with my first chronic illness, I became Isolated. I lived Rural, and could no longer drive to see people. My friends lived an hours drive away with no busses, nor licenses of their own. For a tiny bit of background info, I am an extrovert, hands down, no questions asked. So I started struggling, massively. I turned to the internet again, and more specifically, the friends I made on PlayStation. They became what kept me afloat when I was bedbound. So for me, the relationship between communication and technology is a lifeline, some days quite literally. It does have its downsides. Sometimes I just want to be alone, but most of my technology can be turned off, or has a mode where people don\u2019t get alerted that I\u2019m online. Plus sometimes I just plain refuse to open messages until I\u2019m ready to deal with whatever it happens to be about. I hope this answers your question. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically, technology enhances communication. It makes it better, faster, easier. What is technology? It is simply the application of scientific knowledge/know how for practical purposes. In the 19th century, letter writing was the extent of our technology, and it made communication between people in different countries possible, but very slow. One had to write a letter, send it to the post office, and hope that the letter gets posted to the person. There was a third party involved in this communication process, without whom your letter may not reach its destination, and even if it does, it took days. Then, came the phones, which made us communicate with people all over the world as fast as we called. I just have to input your digits correctly in my phone, and voila!, we get communicating as much as we want, all things being equal. Social media has also made it possible for us to communicate with words and pictures as well. You can therefore see that as technology advances, communication becomes better, easier, faster and more fun. ",
