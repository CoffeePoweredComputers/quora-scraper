            "answer_text": "Arts have more impact on society, If we look at early paintings we can find that there are paitings of animals. They were highly influenced by animals and nature. Art is internal expresions of extreme feeling/sensations. It is an imagination by humans. It is an impulse. In latter course of time, of course society affects arts. Society is a fact, can not be illustrated by imagination, it is a fact, a reality we live in it, but art is an imagination we live by it. In everything there is a bit of art, art is second most important thing for human, that straight comes from their feelings and it affects the society as a whole. Whatever things we are using today are merely a creation of human imagination, letter we learn to live with it. I begin with a recent design craeted by Microsoft based on imagination and fine combination of color, imagination and technology\u2026.  A  the Altamira Cave was the original cave where prehistoric paintings were found. Paintings were of such a high quality that scientific society had doubts about their authenticity and accused its discoverer of forgery. (36,500 BCE)  Bhimbetka, central India, contains more than 600 rock shelters adorned with prehistoric cave paintings. The paintings generally depict the times and lives of those living in the caves. ( Mixed influence of society as well other associated phenomena, 13,000 BCE).  23000 BC,Brazil, Serra da Capivara National Park houses a number of rock shelters which are adorned with cave paintings. These paintings include sceneries of hunting and rituals, animal capivaras, and trees. Some researchers think the oldest cave paintings inside the park were created 25,000 years ago.

            "answer_text": "I think that society affects artists on many levels, but the most honorable example would be artists who react on rebel against societies norms. This reaction is usually based upon negative aspects of society: racism, violence, uneven distribution of wealth, sexism and the prevailing political climate. It would be wonderful if Artists influenced society, but we are observers. Of course there are artists who are involved in community art projects and these angels truly have an impact on one select population, and by their successes they might influence others to do the same. Society as a whole, not yet. ",
