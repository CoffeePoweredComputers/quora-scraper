            "answer_text": "A potpourri of answers:  I'm most prone to find out about interesting places to see or things to do via friends and word of mouth.   Facebook events that friends have shared, or events that show up in my news feed because friends have RSVP'd to them, are pretty effective. I have used Yelp's \"nightlife\" and \"sports + outdoor\" + \"local flavor\" to find places that might be interesting to visit.  I sometimes look under Yelp's Events but have rarely or never actually attended an event I found out about through Yelp.   I sometimes use Yelp and Google Places' mobile apps to look for things nearby without much luck.         I have also browsed Craigslist Events from time to time, with basically the same level of (no) success as using Yelp Events for finding things to do.   I used to check out sf.funcheap.com but haven't lately. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re based in India, there are several apps and websites that feature events or activities on a daily basis. To check out music gigs, workshops, comedy events, flea markets, marathons, plays and much more, you can refer to Insider.in, BookMyShow or EventsHigh. These websites offer a massive variety and quantity of events. Besides these, MeraEvents also hosts countless events across the country. From seminars, summits and educational camps to music performances and runs, you can find them all. At the same time, mobile wallets such as PayTM feature offers, deals and specific events by themselves. One sure shot way of finding things to do in your city is to discover events on Facebook. The option is available on the side of your homepage as \u201cEvents\u201d under the explore tab. ",
