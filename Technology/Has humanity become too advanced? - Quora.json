Do you mean transcending into something more than just what we can do as humans? Or is it about our life expectancy that you are referring to? If it is the former, it varies from person to person, so only ourselves can answer this. If it is the latter, one can live to be 100 but only a few humans live past the age of 100 today. Perhaps someday a technology could be invented to not only increase longevity, but also help us become stronger and more advanced. ",
