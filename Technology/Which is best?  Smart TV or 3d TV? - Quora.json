            "answer_text": "The first TVs, which can reproduce 3D image appeared a long time ago. If the first models had a number of limitations related to the insufficient degree of development of the technology of displaying a 3D image on the screen, the modern 3D TVs have no drawbacks. TV manufacturers are introducing volumetric technology not only in LCD TVs but in plasmas, too. Before choosing a 3D TV, you need to carefully read all the details and to determine for yourself the model that to the maximum extent satisfies Your requirements. Choosing 3D Technology Modern 3D TVs are developed in several directions. So there are models for which you need special glasses (active or passive technology), and there are instances allows you to watch 3D image without glasses or other additional equipment. Have we already considered the question of what 3D technology to choose: active or passive? TVs, that use an active 3D, shape and transmit the image to the left and right eyes in turn. To view the volume image, you need shutter glasses. The work point is that they very quickly close the left and right eye. Thus, each of eyes sees the image from different angles, and the brain connects the picture together. Active 3D TVs allow you to watch your favorite movies in their original resolution, that is, if the image is displayed on the screen in 1920\u00d71080 resolution, in this resolution You will see. However, the technology is quite expensive, so these TVs are considerably more expensive than the models that use passive 3D. Plus, the image refresh rate reduces, because the image is formed for each eye. Despite the disadvantages, the active 3D televisions provide the 3D image of excellent quality, and most manufacturers adhere to this development. Passive 3D TVs are cheaper but the image quality is appropriate. The screen displays the picture for the left and for the right eye. Special glasses equipped with filters, which cut off the unnecessary part of the picture and each eye receives its own image. But the final resolution of the perceived image is reduced two times. However, the use of passive points almost does not tire the eyes, unlike the shutters. In general, the passive 3D TV provides the 3D image of lower quality than the active one. Nowadays, 3D TVs without glasses, unfortunately, are not yet able to provide the decent picture quality, so while it is not necessary to think about their purchase. What type of TV to choose The market is presented by an impressive number of different model types. Most commonly, 3D technologies are realized in LCD and plasma TVs . Modern TVs that use backlighting LEDs have an excellent image quality. The high picture parameters such as depth of color, sharpness, and black level gives you a comfortable viewing your favorite videos. Besides LED TVs have a low thickness and a very low power consumption. Size and resolution As already mentioned, the most enjoyable viewing 3D video requires a large screen. On the big screen the 3D effect is most realistic. If resources allow, it is better to stay on the model with a diagonal of 50 inches and more. Of course, the size of diagonal affects the price. If You plan to place the TV in a small room, you can stay on the model with a diagonal of 32 inches. Video Signal Source When choosing a 3D TV it is worth thinking about the source quality of the video signal. The most basic can be considered a 3D Blu-ray player that delivers the best quality content. The good news is that television is gradually developing and there are channels that provide 3D content. However, even if don't have the video source, you can choose a TV with the function of converting 2D images to 3D. This is made possible through the use of the most powerful graphics processors. But in this case, you should not rely on excellent quality. Satellite 3D is still better if not to consider additional costs. Functional connectorsYou must ensure that you have a connector that will allow for high-speed data transfer from media to the TV. For nowadays, the best interface is HDMI v1.4. It bears a USB connector that allows you to connect a USB flash drive or external hard drive. The greater the number of connectors on the TV, the wider connectivity of peripheral devices!
