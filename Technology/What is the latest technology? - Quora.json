            "answer_text": " If you\u2019ve been following the news on exciting tech trends like artificial intelligence, then you\u2019re probably aware that emerging technologies are changing the way we work and interact with others. In fact, with things like machine learning and touch commerce becoming increasingly popular across every industry from banking to healthcare, technology is revolutionizing the way we do business and making high-tech approaches an integral part of our lives. Here are the top five technology trends you need to know to work in any industry. 1. Internet of Things (IOT) One of the biggest tech trends to emerge in recent years is the Internet of Things. Simply put, the Internet of Things (abbreviated IOT) is the idea that all technological devices can be connected to the internet and to each other in an attempt to create the perfect marriage between the physical and digital worlds. How will this impact you? It depends on your industry. For example, for those who work in marketing, advertising, media or business management, IOT could provide a wealth of information on how consumers engage with products by tracking their interactions with digital devices. In turn, this data could be used to optimize marketing campaigns and user experiences. How it\u2019s affecting industries: The really cool thing about IOT is that it\u2019s not only changing the way we do business but also the business models we use to do it. For example, pay-per-use models are becoming increasingly popular across all industries as new customer data becomes available. 2. Machine learning Another exciting emerging technology is machine learning, which is essentially a computer\u2019s ability to learn on its own by analyzing data and tracking repeating patterns. For example, social media platforms use machine learning to get a better understanding of how you\u2019re connected with those in your social network. They do this by analyzing your likes, shares and comments and then prioritizing content from your closest connections, serving you that content first. How it\u2019s affecting industries: In addition to shaping your day-to-day interactions with friends on social media, machine learning is also changing the way companies do business with customers. Companies like google are using machine learning on mobile devices which can continue learning even when offline. The result? Machine learning is reshaping the way businesses interact with their customers in a big way by helping them anticipate and meet customer needs more easily. 3. Virtual reality (VR) Remember watching movies about virtual reality and thinking how cool it would be if it was actually like that in real life? Well, it\u2019s about to be. Although VR has been around since the 1950s, until recently the technology wasn\u2019t able to deliver the fully immersive digital experience users have been craving. That\u2019s about to change with recent improvements to both hardware and programming, and the effects are going to be felt across almost every industry from retail to education. How it\u2019s affecting industries: Virtual reality has been a popular component of video games for several years and this trend is continuing to expand. In addition to video games, VR is likely to affect companies across the board as they adopt the technology to help them engage customers more effectively and optimize their sales and marketing efforts. It\u2019s also a potentially useful tool for learning and is increasingly being adopted by educational organizations. 4. Touch commerce Being able to buy anything you want with the touch of a finger may have seemed like a fantasy a few years ago, but it\u2019s now a reality. Merging touchscreen technology with one-click shopping, touch commerce allows consumers to buy products easily from their phones. After linking their payment information to a general account and enabling the feature, customers are able to buy everything from clothes to furniture with just a fingerprint. How it\u2019s affecting industries: This is one of the biggest things to hit eCommerce in recent years with purchases of this type expected to increase by 150% this year alone and retailers in almost every industry anticipating an increase in sales directly related to this new technology. 5. Cognitive Technology Cognitive technology is in the same vein as machine learning and virtual reality except that it\u2019s a broader concept. For example, the cognitive technology umbrella includes things like natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition. Combined, these different technologies are able to automate and optimize a lot of tasks that were previously done by people, including certain aspects of accounting and analytics. How it\u2019s affecting industries: Although cognitive technologies have a broad range of applications, one of the industry sectors most affected by this trend initially will be the software sector. Automated analysis of user data and experiences will be particularly useful for software companies hoping to scale. With emerging technologies changing professional industries including banking, eCommerce, healthcare and education, staying up to date on the latest trends will give you a better understanding of your chosen industry and make you a more competitive candidate.

            "answer_text": "Verizon on Thursday announced that the first holographic phone in the world, the RED Hydrogen One, is going to be available to subscribers later this year. The carrier didn\u2019t specify a firm release date (and the first RED phone is delayed as it is), but it certainly looks like the Hydrogen One is going to soon be available in stores. Coming from a company that\u2019s known for its camera business, the Hydrogen phone looked like vaporware when it was first announced last August. That\u2019s because the phone is supposed to be the world\u2019s first holographic phone, a device that would offer users 3D-like experiences without glasses. That\u2019s something not available on any other handset right now, whether they run iOS or Android. Apple, for what it\u2019s worth, has patents detailing holographic screens. But RED is actually making and releasing one. The Hydrogen One is supposed to be a 5.7-inch device featuring high-end specs and design, as well as some sort of Moto Z-like modularity. You\u2019d be able to add modules to your phone to improve certain features, a trick mentioned in Verizon\u2019s announcement as well. In addition to the phone, RED is also launching its 4-view Hydrogen content network. Reports a few weeks ago said the phone has been delayed to August, and RED founder Jim Jannard confirmed that designing such a phone is tricky because nobody really knows how to do 4-view displays on anything before.

            "answer_text": "Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) Technically this isn't a new technology, it has been around since the 1950s. But it is getting a lot more attention today.   They are a class of generation IV nuclear fission reactor in which the primary nuclear reactor coolant, or even the fuel itself, is a molten salt mixture (primary of them being  liquid fluoride thorium)  MSRs run at higher temperatures than water-cooled reactors for higher thermodynamic efficiency, while staying at low vapor pressure. The other advantages to MSRs are:   The waste has medical uses The waste has no weaponized uses. MSR's are scalable, theoretically they could made small enough to power personal vehiclesThe fact that MSRs can be scaled down, are safer than water cooled reactor as well as  provide more energy. Makes them the perfect candidate to replace any type of carbon based power plant as well as any other type 'renewable' electric generation system Algae Based Biofuel This is the fuel that could spell the end cellulosic (plant) based biofuels. Here are the advantages: Bio-based fuel with essentially carbon neutral combustionDrop in replacement for petroleum-based liquid fuelsInherently renewableAbsorbs carbon dioxide as it growsBoth waste CO2 and wastewater can be used as nutrientsHigher energy per-acre than other bio-fuelsCan be grown on land unsuitable for other types of agricultureAccording to a 2013 Smithsonian.com artcle: Out of all the clean energy options in development, it is algae-based biofuel that most closely resembles the composition of the crude oil that gets pumped out from beneath the sea bed. Much of what we know as petroleum was, after all, formed from these very microorganisms, through a natural heat-facilitated conversion that played out over the course of millions of years. Now, researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, have discovered a way to not only replicate, but speed up this \"cooking\" process to the point where a small mixture of algae and water can be turned into a kind of crude oil in less than an hour. Besides being readily able to be refined into burnable gases like jet fuel, gasoline or diesel, the proprietary technology also generates, as a byproduct, chemical elements and minerals that can be used to produce electricity, natural gas and even fertilizer to, perhaps, grow even more algae. It could also help usher in algae as a viable alternative; an analysis has shown that implementing this technique on a wider scale may allow companies to sell biofuel commercially for as low as two dollars a gallon.--Scientists Turn Algae Into Crude Oil In Less Than An Hour  ",

            "answer_text": "There are some new and mind blowing technologies which are yet to come or under process.. Google\u2019s Quantum Dream Machine  Bringing together the best of two types of quantum computer for the first time, researchers at Google have created a prototype that combines the architecture of both a universal quantum computer and an analogue quantum computer. By digitizing the traditionally analogue computations that can be done with an adiabatic quantum computer, the team\u2019s system is one step closer to a universal quantum computer that could solve any computational problem. This is particularly relevant to some of the more complex and practical applications that scientists hope future quantum computers can tackle, including synthesizing new pharmaceutical drugs or deciphering long-term weather patterns. A universal quantum computer is one that, in theory, can perform any computation exponentially faster than a classical computer. The race towards building a truly universal quantum computer currently involves a number of experimental groups and companies the world over \u2013 including Google, IBM and D-Wave \u2013 each of whom turn to different methods and technologies to achieve the same goal. The new computer would let a Google coder run calculations in a coffee break that would take a supercomputer of today millions of years. The software that Google has developed on ordinary computers to drive cars or answer questions could become vastly more intelligent. And earlier-stage ideas bubbling up at Google and its parent company, such as robots that can serve as emergency responders or software that can converse at a human level, might become real. The theoretical underpinnings of quantum computing are well established. And physicists can build the basic units, known as qubits, out of which a quantum computer would be made. They can even operate qubits together in small groups. But they have not made a fully working, practical quantum computer.  Harmut Neven (In the Middle) Google\u2019s Hartmut Neven, head of the Quantum AI Lab, explains . \u201cWe found that for problem instances involving nearly 1,000 binary variables, quantum annealing significantly outperforms its classical counterpart, simulated annealing. It is more than 10 to the power of 8 times faster than simulated annealing running on a single core\u201d.  Large Hadron Collider  The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and most powerful particle collider, the largest, most complex experimental facility ever built, and the largest single machine in the world. It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) between 1998 and 2008 in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 countries, as well as hundreds of universities and laboratories. It lies in a tunnel 27 kilometres (17 mi) in circumference, as deep as 175 metres (574 ft) beneath the France\u2013Switzerland border near Geneva, Switzerland. Its first research run took place from 30 March 2010 to 13 February 2013 at an initial energy of 3.5 teraelectronvolts (TeV) per beam (7 TeV total), almost 4 times more than the previous world record for a collider, rising to 4 TeV per beam (8 TeV total) from 2012.On 13 February 2013 the LHC's first run officially ended, and it was shut down for planned upgrades. 'Test' collisions restarted in the upgraded collider on 5 April 2015, reaching 6.5 TeV per beam on 20 May 2015 (13 TeV total, the current world record). Its second research run commenced on schedule, on 3 June 2015. The LHC's aim is to allow physicists to test the predictions of different theories of particle physics, high-energy physics and in particular, to further test the properties of the Higgs boson and the large family of new particles predicted by super-symmetric theories, and other unsolved questions of physics, advancing human understanding of physical laws. It contains seven detectors, each designed for certain kinds of research. The proton-proton collision is the primary operation method, but the LHC has also collided protons with lead nuclei for two months in 2013 and used lead\u2013lead collisions for about one month each in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 for other investigations.  The Higgs boson (or Higgs particle) is a particle in the Standard Model of physics. In the 1960s Peter Higgs was the first person to express the idea. On 14 March 2013, scientists at CERN tentatively confirm that they have found the particle.    It is one of the 17 particles in the Standard Model. The Higgs particle is a boson. Bosons are thought to be particles which are responsible for all physical forces. Other known bosons are the photon, the W and Z bosons, and the gluon. Scientists do not yet know how to combine gravity with the Standard Model. It is the quantum excitation of the Higgs field\u2014a fundamental field of crucial importance to particle physics theory.[6] Unlike other known fields such as the electromagnetic field, the higgs field takes a non-zero constant value almost everywhere. The question of the Higgs field's existence has been the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics and, according to some, \"the central problem in particle physics\"  Peter Higgs - The man behind the Invention Of Higgs Field leading to the proposal of Higgs Particle or God Particle. This would mean a huge leap in Mankind\u2019s Understanding of the origin of Universe and understanding of laws of physics.!  Autonomous car An autonomous car (driverless car, self-driving car, robotic car) is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Autonomous cars can detect surroundings using a variety of techniques such as radar, lidar, GPS, odometry, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage. Autonomous cars have control systems that are capable of analyzing sensory data to distinguish between different cars on the road, which is very useful in planning a path to the desired destination. Google Self-Driving Car is any in a range of autonomous cars, developed by Google X as part of its project to develop technology for mainly electric cars. The software installed in Google's cars is named Google Chauffeur. Lettering on the side of each car identifies it as a \"self-driving car\". The project was formerly led by Sebastian Thrun, former director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and co-inventor of Google Street View. Thrun's team at Stanford created the robotic vehicle Stanley which won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge and its US$2 million prize from the United States Department of Defense. The team developing the system consisted of 15 engineers working for Google, including Chris Urmson, Mike Montemerlo, and Anthony Levandowski who had worked on the DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges.  To know more about the google\u2019s self-driving car project : Google Self-Driving Car Project But Google isn\u2019t the only one in this race.! The Tesla Autopilot.! The electric-vehicle maker sent its cars a software update that suddenly made autonomous driving a reality.  Sedans with a dozen ultrasonic sensors discreetly placed around both bumpers and sides. For an additional $4,250, Tesla customers could purchase a \u201ctechnology package\u201d that used the sensors, as well as a camera, a front radar, and digitally controlled brakes, to help avoid collisions\u2014essentially allowing the car to take over and stop before crashing. But mostly, the hardware sat there, waiting, waiting, and gathering reams of data. A year later, last October 14, the company sent a software update to the 60,000 sensor-laden cars it had sold in that time. The software update was officially named Tesla Version 7.0, but its nickname\u2014Autopilot\u2014was what stuck.

Wireless power is a generic term that refers to a number of different power transmission technologies that use time-varying electric, magnetic, or electromagnetic fields. In wireless power transfer, a wireless transmitter connected to a power source conveys the field energy across an intervening space to one or more receivers, where it is converted back to an electrical current and then used. Wireless transmission is useful to power electrical devices in cases where interconnecting wires are inconvenient, hazardous, or are not possible.  Nikola Tesla conducted the first experiments in wireless power transfer at the turn of the 20th century. From 1891 to 1898 he investigated wireless transmission of electrical energy using his radio frequency resonant transformer called the Tesla coil, which produces high-voltage, high-frequency alternating currents. The Tesla coil was first developed as a high-voltage radio-frequency power supply for his \"System of Electric Lighting\" patented in 1891. With this basic resonance transformer design concept he was able to transmit electrical energy over short distances without interconnecting wires by means of resonant magnetic inductive coupling. The transformer's primary LC circuit acted as a transmitter. The transformer's secondary LC circuit was tuned to the primary LC circuit's resonant frequency and acted as a receiver. The Tesla coil transformer itself could be configured as a wireless transmitter and used to transmit energy by capacitive inductive coupling. While demonstrating this technology during lectures before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1891, the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1892, and at the 1893 Colombian Exposition in Chicago he was able to wirelessly power lamps from across the stage and out into the room.

Gesture recognition Gesture recognition is a topic in computer science and language technology with the goal of interpreting human gestures via mathematical algorithms. Gestures can originate from any bodily motion or state but commonly originate from the face or hand. Current focuses in the field include emotion recognition from face and hand gesture recognition. Many approaches have been made using cameras and computer vision algorithms to interpret sign language. However, the identification and recognition of posture, gait, proxemics, and human behaviors is also the subject of gesture recognition techniques. Gesture recognition can be seen as a way for computers to begin to understand human body language, thus building a richer bridge between machines and humans than primitive text user interfaces or even GUIs (graphical user interfaces), which still limit the majority of input to keyboard and mouse.I wrote about this in one of my previous questions. Few of them are- 1.Glove Gest has gesture control on hands Gest is a wearable that brings interaction to a whole new level. When it comes to interacting with a computer, your options are either two-dimensional like the mouse, or binary like the keys on your keyboard. But your hands are three-dimensional and non-binary, so your tools should be too.Gest lets you map hand gestures to keyboard shortcuts, so you can control almost any app. Change the song? Flick your finger to the right. Increase the volume? Twist your hand. The best part is that you get to decide which gestures map to which actions.The coolest part is that Gest is extremely versatile. You can program custom gestures into actions on your devices. Just make a movement with your hand, then tie it to any action you want. It has not yet come into the market.

Soli sensor technology works by emitting electromagnetic waves in a broad beam.Soli tracks and recognizes dynamic gestures expressed by fine motions of the fingers and hand. In order to accomplish this with a single chip sensor.The sensor can track sub-millimeter motions at high speed and accuracy. It fits onto a chip, can be produced at scale and built into small devices and everyday objects.

It can also be mounted onto a virtual reality headset. Using two monochromatic IR cameras and three infrared LED\u2019s, the device observes a roughly hemispherical area, to a distance of about 1 meter.The LED\u2019s generate pattern-less IR light and the cameras generate almost 200 frames per second of reflected data.This is then sent through a USB cable to the host computer, where it is analyzed by the Leap Motion software using \"complex maths\" in a way that has not been disclosed by the company, in some way synthesizing 3D position data by comparing the 2D frames generated by the two cameras.In a 2013 study, the overall average accuracy of the controller was shown to be 0.7 millimeters You can buy it at : Leap Motion Controller Gesture Motion Control for PC or MAC To watch an in depth video :  ",

And printing objects with anything other than plastics\u2014in particular, metal\u2014has been expensive and painfully slow. Now, however, it\u2019s becoming cheap and easy enough to be a potentially practical way of manufacturing parts. If widely adopted, it could change the way we mass-produce many products. 3-D Metal Printing BreakthroughNow printers can make metal objects quickly and cheaply.Why It MattersThe ability to make large and complex metal \u00adobjects on demand could transform manufacturing.Key PlayersMarkforged, Desktop Metal, GEAvailabilityNowIn the short term, manufacturers wouldn\u2019t need to maintain large inventories\u2014they could simply print an object, such as a replacement part for an aging car, whenever someone needs it. In the longer term, large factories that mass-produce a limited range of parts might be replaced by smaller ones that make a wider variety, adapting to customers\u2019 changing needs. The technology can create lighter, stronger parts, and complex shapes that aren\u2019t possible with conventional metal fabrication methods. It can also provide more precise control of the microstructure of metals. In 2017, researchers from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announced they had developed a 3-D-printing method for creating stainless-steel parts twice as strong as traditionally made ones. Also in 2017, 3-D-printing company Markforged, a small startup based outside Boston, released the first 3-D metal printer for under $100,000. Another Boston-area startup, Desktop Metal, began to ship its first metal prototyping machines in December 2017. It plans to begin selling larger machines, designed for manufacturing, that are 100 times faster than older metal printing methods. The printing of metal parts is also getting easier. Desktop Metal now offers software that generates designs ready for 3-D printing. Users tell the program the specs of the object they want to print, and the software produces a computer model suitable for printing. GE, which has long been a proponent of using 3-D printing in its aviation products (see \u201c10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2013: Additive Manufacturing\u201d), has a test version of its new metal printer that is fast enough to make large parts. The company plans to begin selling the printer in 2018. \u2014Erin Winick Artificial Embryos  UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE In a breakthrough that redefines how life can be created, embryologists working at the University of Cambridge in the UK have grown realistic-looking mouse embryos using only stem cells. No egg. No sperm. Just cells plucked from another embryo. Artificial Embryos BreakthroughWithout using eggs or sperm cells, researchers have made embryo-like structures from stem cells alone, providing a whole new route to creating life.Why It MattersArtificial embryos will make it easier for researchers to study the mysterious beginnings of a human life, but they\u2019re stoking new bioethical debates.Key PlayersUniversity of Cambridge; University of Michigan; Rockefeller UniversityAvailabilityNowThe researchers placed the cells carefully in a three-dimensional scaffold and watched, fascinated, as they started communicating and lining up into the distinctive bullet shape of a mouse embryo several days old. \u201cWe know that stem cells are magical in their powerful potential of what they can do. We did not realize they could self-organize so beautifully or perfectly,\u201d Magdelena Zernicka\u00ad-Goetz, who headed the team, told an interviewer at the time. Zernicka-Goetz says her \u201csynthetic\u201d embryos probably couldn\u2019t have grown into mice. Nonetheless, they\u2019re a hint that soon we could have mammals born without an egg at all. That isn\u2019t Zernicka-Goetz\u2019s goal. She wants to study how the cells of an early embryo begin taking on their specialized roles. The next step, she says, is to make an artificial embryo out of human stem cells, work that\u2019s being pursued at the University of Michigan and Rockefeller University. Synthetic human embryos would be a boon to scientists, letting them tease apart events early in development. And since such embryos start with easily manipulated stem cells, labs will be able to employ a full range of tools, such as gene editing, to investigate them as they grow. Artificial embryos, however, pose ethical questions. What if they turn out to be indistinguishable from real embryos? How long can they be grown in the lab before they feel pain? We need to address those questions before the science races ahead much further, bioethicists say. \u2014Antonio Regalado Sensing City  SIDEWALK TORONTO Numerous smart-city schemes have run into delays, dialed down their ambitious goals, or priced out everyone except the super-wealthy. A new project in Toronto, called Quayside, is hoping to change that pattern of failures by rethinking an urban neighborhood from the ground up and rebuilding it around the latest digital technologies. Sensing City BreakthroughA Toronto neighborhood aims to be the first place to successfully integrate cutting-edge urban design with state-of-the-art digital technology.Why It MattersSmart cities could make urban areas more affordable, livable, and environmentally friendly.Key PlayersSidewalk Labs and Waterfront TorontoAvailabilityProject announced in October 2017; construction could begin in 2019Alphabet\u2019s Sidewalk Labs, based in New York City, is collaborating with the Canadian government on the high-tech project, slated for Toronto\u2019s industrial waterfront. One of the project\u2019s goals is to base decisions about design, policy, and technology on information from an extensive network of sensors that gather data on everything from air quality to noise levels to people\u2019s activities. The plan calls for all vehicles to be autonomous and shared. Robots will roam underground doing menial chores like delivering the mail. Sidewalk Labs says it will open access to the software and systems it\u2019s creating so other companies can build services on top of them, much as people build apps for mobile phones. The company intends to closely monitor public infrastructure, and this has raised concerns about data governance and privacy. But Sidewalk Labs believes it can work with the community and the local government to alleviate those worries. \u201cWhat\u2019s distinctive about what we\u2019re trying to do in Quayside is that the project is not only extraordinarily ambitious but also has a certain amount of humility,\u201d says Rit Aggarwala, the executive in charge of Sidewalk Labs\u2019 urban-systems planning. That humility may help Quayside avoid the pitfalls that have plagued previous smart-city initiatives. Other North American cities are already clamoring to be next on Sidewalk Labs\u2019 list, according to Waterfront Toronto, the public agency overseeing Quayside\u2019s development. \u201cSan Francisco, Denver, Los Angeles, and Boston have all called asking for introductions,\u201d says the agency\u2019s CEO, Will Fleissig. \u2014Elizabeth Woyke AI for Everybody  MIGUEL PORLAN Artificial intelligence has so far been mainly the plaything of big tech companies like Amazon, Baidu, Google, and Microsoft, as well as some startups. For many other companies and parts of the economy, AI systems are too expensive and too difficult to implement fully. AI for Everybody BreakthroughCloud-based AI is making the technology cheaper and easier to use.Why It MattersRight now the use of AI is dominated by a relatively few companies, but as a cloud-based service, it could be widely available to many more, giving the economy a boost.Key PlayersAmazon; Google; MicrosoftAvailabilityNowWhat\u2019s the solution? Machine-learning tools based in the cloud are bringing AI to a far broader audience. So far, Amazon dominates cloud AI with its AWS subsidiary. Google is challenging that with TensorFlow, an open-source AI library that can be used to build other machine-learning software. Recently Google announced Cloud AutoML, a suite of pre-trained systems that could make AI simpler to use. Microsoft, which has its own AI-powered cloud platform, Azure, is teaming up with Amazon to offer Gluon, an open-source deep-learning library. Gluon is supposed to make building neural nets\u2014a key technology in AI that crudely mimics how the human brain learns\u2014as easy as building a smartphone app. It is uncertain which of these companies will become the leader in offering AI cloud services. But it is a huge business opportunity for the winners. These products will be essential if the AI revolution is going to spread more broadly through different parts of the economy. Currently AI is used mostly in the tech industry, where it has created efficiencies and produced new products and services. But many other businesses and industries have struggled to take advantage of the advances in artificial intelligence. Sectors such as medicine, manufacturing, and energy could also be transformed if they were able to implement the technology more fully, with a huge boost to economic productivity. Most companies, though, still don\u2019t have enough people who know how to use cloud AI. So Amazon and Google are also setting up consultancy services. Once the cloud puts the technology within the reach of almost everyone, the real AI revolution can begin. \u2014Jackie Snow Dueling Neural Networks  ILLUSTRATION BY DEREK BRAHNEY | DIAGRAM COURTESY OF MICHAEL NIELSEN, \u201cNEURAL NETWORKS AND DEEP LEARNING\u201d, DETERMINATION PRESS, 2015 Artificial intelligence is getting very good at identifying things: show it a million pictures, and it can tell you with uncanny accuracy which ones depict a pedestrian crossing a street. But AI is hopeless at generating images of pedestrians by itself. If it could do that, it would be able to create gobs of realistic but synthetic pictures depicting pedestrians in various settings, which a self-driving car could use to train itself without ever going out on the road. Dueling Neural Networks BreakthroughTwo AI systems can spar with each other to create ultra-realistic original images or sounds, something machines have never been able to do before.Why It MattersThis gives machines something akin to a sense of imagination, which may help them become less reliant on humans\u2014but also turns them into alarmingly powerful tools for digital fakery.Key PlayersGoogle Brain, DeepMind, NvidiaAvailabilityNowThe problem is, creating something entirely new requires imagination\u2014and until now that has perplexed AIs. The solution first occurred to Ian Goodfellow, then a PhD student at the University of Montreal, during an academic argument in a bar in 2014. The approach, known as a generative adversarial network, or GAN, takes two neural networks\u2014the simplified mathematical models of the human brain that underpin most modern machine learning\u2014and pits them against each other in a digital cat-and-mouse game. Both networks are trained on the same data set. One, known as the generator, is tasked with creating variations on images it\u2019s already seen\u2014perhaps a picture of a pedestrian with an extra arm. The second, known as the discriminator, is asked to identify whether the example it sees is like the images it has been trained on or a fake produced by the generator\u2014basically, is that three-armed person likely to be real? Over time, the generator can become so good at producing images that the discriminator can\u2019t spot fakes. Essentially, the generator has been taught to recognize, and then create, realistic-looking images of pedestrians. The technology has become one of the most promising advances in AI in the past decade, able to help machines produce results that fool even humans. GANs have been put to use creating realistic-sounding speech and photorealistic fake imagery. In one compelling example, researchers from chipmaker Nvidia primed a GAN with celebrity photographs to create hundreds of credible faces of people who don\u2019t exist. Another research group made not-unconvincing fake paintings that look like the works of van Gogh. Pushed further, GANs can reimagine images in different ways\u2014making a sunny road appear snowy, or turning horses into zebras. The results aren\u2019t always perfect: GANs can conjure up bicycles with two sets of handlebars, say, or faces with eyebrows in the wrong place. But because the images and sounds are often startlingly realistic, some experts believe there\u2019s a sense in which GANs are beginning to understand the underlying structure of the world they see and hear. And that means AI may gain, along with a sense of imagination, a more independent ability to make sense of what it sees in the world. \u2014Jamie Condliffes. Babel-Fish Earbuds  GOOGLE In the cult sci-fi classic The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, you slide a yellow Babel fish into your ear to get translations in an instant. In the real world, Google has come up with an interim solution: a $159 pair of earbuds, called Pixel Buds. These work with its Pixel smartphones and Google Translate app to produce practically real-time translation. Babel-Fish Earbuds BreakthroughNear-real-time translation now works for a large number of languages and is easy to use.Why It MattersIn an increasingly global world, language is still a barrier to communication.Key PlayersGoogle and BaiduAvailabilityNowOne person wears the earbuds, while the other holds a phone. The earbud wearer speaks in his or her language\u2014English is the default\u2014and the app translates the talking and plays it aloud on the phone. The person holding the phone responds; this response is translated and played through the earbuds. Google Translate already has a conversation feature, and its iOS and Android apps let two users speak as it automatically figures out what languages they\u2019re using and then translates them. But background noise can make it hard for the app to understand what people are saying, and also to figure out when one person has stopped speaking and it\u2019s time to start translating. Pixel Buds get around these problems because the wearer taps and holds a finger on the right earbud while talking. Splitting the interaction between the phone and the earbuds gives each person control of a microphone and helps the speakers maintain eye contact, since they\u2019re not trying to pass a phone back and forth. The Pixel Buds were widely panned for subpar design. They do look silly, and they may not fit well in your ears. They can also be hard to set up with a phone. Clunky hardware can be fixed, though. Pixel Buds show the promise of mutually intelligible communication between languages in close to real time. And no fish required. \u2014Rachel Metz Zero-Carbon Natural Gas  MIGUEL PORLAN The world is probably stuck with natural gas as one of our primary sources of electricity for the foreseeable future. Cheap and readily available, it now accounts for more than 30 percent of US electricity and 22 percent of world electricity. And although it\u2019s cleaner than coal, it\u2019s still a massive source of carbon emissions. A pilot power plant just outside Houston, in the heart of the US petroleum and refining industry, is testing a technology that could make clean energy from natural gas a reality. The company behind the 50-megawatt project, Net Power, believes it can generate power at least as cheaply as standard natural-gas plants and capture essentially all the carbon dioxide released in the process. Zero-Carbon Natural Gas BreakthroughA power plant efficiently and cheaply captures carbon released by burning natural gas, avoiding greenhouse-gas emissions.Why It MattersAround 32 percent of US electricity is produced with natural gas, accounting for around 30 percent of the power sector\u2019s carbon emissions.Key Players8 Rivers Capital; Exelon Generation; CB&IAvailability3 to 5 yearsIf so, it would mean the world has a way to produce carbon-free energy from a fossil fuel at a reasonable cost. Such natural-gas plants could be cranked up and down on demand, avoiding the high capital costs of nuclear power and sidestepping the unsteady supply that renewables generally provide. Net Power is a collaboration between technology development firm 8 Rivers Capital, Exelon Generation, and energy construction firm CB&I. The company is in the process of commissioning the plant and has begun initial testing. It intends to release results from early evaluations in the months ahead. The plant puts the carbon dioxide released from burning natural gas under high pressure and heat, using the resulting supercritical CO2 as the \u201cworking fluid\u201d that drives a specially built turbine. Much of the carbon dioxide can be continuously recycled; the rest can be captured cheaply. A key part of pushing down the costs depends on selling that carbon dioxide. Today the main use is in helping to extract oil from petroleum wells. That\u2019s a limited market, and not a particularly green one. Eventually, however, Net Power hopes to see growing demand for carbon dioxide in cement manufacturing and in making plastics and other carbon-based materials. Net Power\u2019s technology won\u2019t solve all the problems with natural gas, particularly on the extraction side. But as long as we\u2019re using natural gas, we might as well use it as cleanly as possible. Of all the clean-energy technologies in development, Net Power\u2019s is one of the furthest along to promise more than a marginal advance in cutting carbon emissions. \u2014James Temple Perfect Online Privacy  MIGUEL PORLAN True internet privacy could finally become possible thanks to a new tool that can\u2014for instance\u2014let you prove you\u2019re over 18 without revealing your date of birth, or prove you have enough money in the bank for a financial transaction without revealing your balance or other details. That limits the risk of a privacy breach or identity theft. Perfect Online Privacy BreakthroughComputer scientists are perfecting a cryptographic tool for proving something without revealing the information underlying the proof.Why It MattersIf you need to disclose personal information to get something done online, it will be easier to do so without risking your privacy or exposing yourself to identity theft.Key PlayersZcash; JPMorgan Chase; INGAvailabilityNowThe tool is an emerging cryptographic protocol called a zero-\u00adknowledge proof. Though researchers have worked on it for decades, interest has exploded in the past year, thanks in part to the growing obsession with cryptocurrencies, most of which aren\u2019t private. Much of the credit for a practical zero-knowledge proof goes to Zcash, a digital currency that launched in late 2016. Zcash\u2019s developers used a method called a zk-SNARK (for \u201czero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge\u201d) to give users the power to transact anonymously. That\u2019s not normally possible in Bitcoin and most other public blockchain systems, in which transactions are visible to everyone. Though these transactions are theoretically anonymous, they can be combined with other data to track and even identify users. Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-most-popular blockchain network, has described zk-SNARKs as an \u201cabsolutely game-changing technology.\u201d For banks, this could be a way to use blockchains in payment systems without sacrificing their clients\u2019 privacy. Last year, JPMorgan Chase added zk-SNARKs to its own blockchain-based payment system. For all their promise, though, zk-SNARKs are computation-heavy and slow. They also require a so-called \u201ctrusted setup,\u201d creating a cryptographic key that could compromise the whole system if it fell into the wrong hands. But researchers are looking at alternatives that deploy zero-knowledge proofs more efficiently and don\u2019t require such a key. \u2014Mike Orcutt Sources: 7 Technology Trends That Will Dominate 2018 - Forbes ",

Telemedicine saves time as patients and healthcare providers communicate via technology for check-ups or prescription updates. Telemedicine has been particularly effective in the mental health field. Internet therapy provides people with much-needed treatment regardless of location or lack of providers. The Cloud and Mobile DevicesNo more playing phone tag with patients to arrange appointments or relay test results. In 2018, estimates are that 65% of health care facility-patient interactions will take place with a cell phone. Also, a large number of health care facilities now store patient health data in the cloud so patients have access to it around the clock. (Be aware of HIPAA though \u2013 make sure all ePHI is secure and protected!) The Internet of Things (IoT) and WearablesMobile devices can do ECGs, blood tests and take temperatures nowadays. People can also be reminded to take medicine, check their weight, pulse and oxygen levels and then enter the information into patient portals for providers to access. Not to mention preventative wearables like FitBits and such that help patients remain healthy. Big dataWith the rise of IoT, mobile and wearable devices, more data than ever before is being collected for patients\u2019 medical records. Clinicians can utilize the data to identify risk factors and recommend preventative treatments. Plus \u2013 the pooled information can be reviewed to predict health care trends for the overall good.

            "answer_text": "An artificial heart (or more specifically total artificial heart) can be considered as a prosthetic device implanted into the body to replace the organic mammalian heart. The synthetic replacement in humans acts as a type of mechanical circulatory support system wherein the patient\u2019s native valves as well as ventricles are explanted. The device is usually powered pneumatically. Artificial heart is considered in many ways a technology marvel in clinical history, notwithstanding the many limitations pertaining to functionalities, and is usually used in case of patients suffering end-stage biventricular heart failure awaiting transplantation. In addition, artificial heart is also in demand for patients for whom heart transplantation surgery may not be appropriate. However, they are still to garner noticeable traction in the medical sector, with the implantation done only in a small subset of patients requiring transplantation. The rise in global burden of cardiovascular diseases, together with its growing mortality in an aging population, is a key factor underpinning the swift expansion of the artificial heart market. The rising volume of global patient population with end-stage heart failure, including congestive heart failure, coupled with the paucity of transplants available is a crucial factor bolstering the demand for artificial heart. Together with various cardiac-assist devices, artificial heart plays a vital clinical role in managing end-stage heart failure in worldwide patient population. Furthermore, artificial heart is also emerging as a viable option for patients with acute biventricular dysfunction. Gather Complete Research Study Regarding the Artificial Heart Worldwide : http://bit.ly/2EybhBP Relentless efforts made by researchers and substantial development activities by device makers are focused on increasing the durability of mechanical circulatory support. This has a direct bearing on improving the functionality of these synthetic heart replacement. The lack of timely availability of heart donors is also a key aspect catalyzing the demand for artificial heart implantation. Several concerns inhibit the commercialization of artificial hearts. The key factor is limited durability and longevity marred by faults, either in membrane or power source. Nevertheless, constant advances being made in design and functionality will expand the therapeutic potential of artificial hearts. Growing number of clinical trials to evaluate the role of total artificial heart as destination therapy in patients who have life-threatening biventricular heart failure is likely to augur well for the expansion of the market.

            "answer_text": "The 10 technologies of 2020 that will change the world: Each year, the MIT Technology Review lists the 10 recent technological innovations that have the potential to change the planet and society. On the menu for 2020: virtual currency, anti-aging drugs, or the advent of the quantum computer. Between climate disasters, cyber-attacks, and emerging diseases, the world has never seemed so threatening. Fortunately, technological progress is making great strides, as these 10 technologies selected by the MIT Technology Review in its 2020 edition show. See you in a few years to verify these predictions. The secure quantum internet Ransomeware, data theft, hacking of connected objects \u2026 The Internet is under the threat of large-scale cyber attacks. \u201cAn Internet-based on quantum physics will soon make it possible to secure communications,\u201d predicts the MIT Technology Review. Researchers at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands are working on a quantum Internet infrastructure where communications are coded in the form of qubits and entangled in photons flowing in optical fibers, so as to render them impossible to decrypt without disturbing the network. The technology should be operational within 5 to 6 years for long distances and a worldwide network is possible by the end of the decade, according to the researchers. For when? 5 years Hyper-personalized medicine \u201cGenetic medicine made for a single patient to make it possible to treat previously incurable diseases,\u201d says MIT. In 2019, little Mila Makovec, suffering from a rare and fatal genetic brain disease, was offered a tailor-made treatment to restore the function of the failed gene. The development of such personalized drugs is made possible by rapid advances in sequencing and genetic editing. However, they require major resources (a year of development in the case of Mila) and the mobilization of specialized teams. The question of cost, therefore, risks limiting the generalization of such drugs. For when? Already in progress Virtual currency It was believed that virtual currencies had fallen into oblivion with the collapse of Bitcoin in 2019. But Facebook\u2019s announcement of its Libra universal currency project in June raised the hopes of its supporters. Despite the flood of criticism and serial disclaimers (Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and eBay have left the ship without explanation), Libra has the capacity to become a nearly universal currency and independent of central banks thanks to the billion Facebook users. Above all, it initiated a movement on the part of all the major players in finance. The People\u2019s Bank of China has announced to the creation of its own cyber currency and Banque de France has launched a call for projects for the first quarter of 2020 with a doing an experiment with a possible \u201cdigital euro\u201d. Anti-aging drugs Several treatments intended to slow down or reverse aging are currently in the trial phase. They block the aging of cells linked to age and reduce the inflammation responsible for the accumulation of toxic substances or degenerative pathologies, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, or cardiovascular diseases. In June 2019, the American start-up Unity Biotechnology, for example, launched a knee arthritis drug test. The biotech Alkahest promises to curb cognitive loss by injecting young blood components and researchers are testing rapamycin, an immunosuppressant, as an anti-aging treatment. For when ? 5 years Artificial intelligence to find new molecules \u201cIt is estimated that there are 1,060 molecules that can give potential drugs, more than all the atoms in the solar system,\u201d announces MIT. This offers practically unlimited chemical possibilities \u201d. In order to explore this ocean of molecules, researchers rely on artificial intelligence (AI), which will screen the molecules and put them in relation to potential targets, such as a protein or a cellular receptor. In July 2019, an Australian team designed a flu vaccine with an adjuvant designed by an algorithm. And, in February 2020, Insilico Medicine managed to develop a fibrosis drug in just 46 days thanks to its AI, where the development of a conventional drug takes up to 10 years. For when? 3-5 years Megaconstellations of satellites After 120 satellites launched last year, SpaceX plans to deploy up to 42,000 to create an Internet connection everywhere on the planet. The company isn\u2019t alone in the niche: OneWeb\u2019s constellation will include 600 satellites by 2022, and Amazon has announced plans to launch 3,236 satellites in low orbit to cover white areas. All these thanks to the low cost of launching these nanosatellites which weigh only a few kilos. However, deploying so many objects in space poses problems in terms of interference with other satellite services such as weather, increasing the risk of collision, and disrupting astronomical observation. For when? Right now Quantum supremacy We have been announcing the arrival of the quantum computer for over 50 years. These machines, where the bits are replaced by qubits with superimposable states, are in theory much faster and more efficient, but hitherto suffered from decoherence problems. In October 2019, Google however announced that it had achieved quantum supremacy (superiority of a quantum computer compared to a conventional computer on a particular task) by performing in three minutes a calculation that would require around 10,000 years on a conventional supercomputer. A figure disputed by IBM, which estimates that a classic computer program could have solved it in just 2.5 days. Nevertheless, we are witnessing the take-off of the quantum computer, with major players such as Microsoft, D-Wave, Atos, or the CEA who have all joined the race. Miniature AI The computing power required to train artificial intelligence algorithms doubles every 3.4 months, according to a study by OpenAI. In addition, the supercomputers dedicated to these programs require enormous energy consumption. The digital giants are now working to miniaturize technology to make it accessible to the general public. Google Assistant and Siri thus integrate voice recognition systems on a smartphone chip. The AI is also invited in digital cameras, capable of automatically retouching a photo by removing an annoying detail or by improving the contrast for example. \u201cLocalized AI [rather than in the cloud] is better for security since your data no longer need to leave your device,\u201d says MIT. For when? Already now Differential confidentiality How to massively collect personal data without infringing on privacy? This is the whole challenge of the US Census Bureau, which will have to secure 330 million profiles for its 2020 census so that it is impossible to identify each individual. To do this, it will inject \u201cnoise\u201d into the database, in order to complicate any de-anonymization. This method called \u201cdifferential confidentiality\u201d is already used by Facebook and Apple to aggregate data without reaching to the exact identity of the people. This scrambling system is fundamental for many sectors using sensitive data, such as medical research. For when? Already now Taking climate change into account Until now, even experts have been reluctant to attribute this or that climate catastrophe to global warming. This is starting to change, and we are now able to model the exact role of climate change. This should notably allow insurers to anticipate and distribute the costs of floods, storms, or droughts. The Caisse centrale de r\u00e9assurance (CCR) in partnership with M\u00e9t\u00e9o France has thus calculated that the cost of claims should double by 2050, climate change accounting for 20% of this increase. Thanks to detailed satellite data, it is also able to model a tsunami or predict how much water will rise during a flood. For when? Already now TO KNOW MORE According to Bill Gates, here are the 10 innovations that will change the world The 10 technologies of 2020 that will change the world The 10 technologies of 2020 that will change the world: Each year, the MIT Technology Review compiles its list of 10 innovations that can change the planet and society. This year, they were selected by a special guest: Bill Gates. We find in this list many subjects dear to the philanthropist through his foundation. \u201cThere are two kinds of progress: those which increase the quantity of life and those which increase the quality of life,\u201d Bill Gates wrote in his introduction to the MIT Technology Review magazine. In human history, we first focused on the former. Now that our life expectancy has doubled since 1913, our attention is focused on the second \u201d. One does not exclude the other, of course. New drugs can save lives and improve the quality of life for people. On his list, the billionaire cleverly places many startups in which he himself has invested or that he has helped with his Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. But that\u2019s normal: after all, when you invest in a company, you believe it has the potential to change society. The new nuclear Vilified by environmentalists, nuclear power is nevertheless energy of the future, believes Bill Gates, who also supports several startups in this sector. But not the \u201cold school\u201d nuclear-like that of EPR: the billionaire bets on small modular reactors (SMR), presenting much less financial and ecological risks, like those of NuScale. Research into nuclear fusion may also soon be successful, providing virtually unlimited zero-carbon energy. For when? Ten years. Clever robots If today\u2019s robots are very good at performing repetitive tasks on an assembly line, they are not very agile at individually manipulating objects according to their shape or context as humans do. By combining visual recognition, deep learning algorithms, and robotics, robots will, tomorrow, be able to do as well as them, hopes Bill Gates, who cites the example of Dactyl, a robotic \u201chand\u201d developed by the OpenAI association. The personalized cancer vaccine With nearly 10 million deaths each year, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world after cardiovascular disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Among the hundreds of new therapeutic approaches, that of the German startup BioNTech caught the attention of Bill Gates. This young shoot detects mutations in cancer cells and uses patients\u2019 own immune systems to develop vaccines to target these mutations. For when? In testing. The endoscope pill Haven\u2019t you heard of environmental enteropathy (EA)? This disease, which results in inflammation of the intestine and leads to malnutrition, causes retarded growth and psychomotor development. Detectable only by endoscopy, it could be better diagnosed with an electronic pill to swallow that will inspect the intestine and perform biopsies. Developed by Guillermo Tearney, biologist and engineer at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, it can also be used to treat other pathologies, such as colon cancer. Meat without meat In 2050, the planet will have 9.8 billion inhabitants who will consume 70% more meat than in 2005. However, the production of a kilogram of beef requires 70 times more surface area, eight times more water, and emits nine times more greenhouse gases than the production of one kilogram of soybeans. Cultivated in vitro with stem cells or based on plants, \u201cfake\u201d meat is, therefore, the subject of great ambitions on the part of startups like Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods, in which Bill Gates has also invested. The toilets without sewer WCs in developing countries is one of Bill Gates\u2019 great idiots. Some 2.3 billion people today still lack access to clean sanitation, he says over and over, which encourages people to defecate outdoors and promotes the spread of disease. In 2011, the philanthropist launched the \u201cToilet Challenge\u201d calling on innovators around the world to create low-cost, self-contained toilets. Dozens of prototypes have already been presented. For when? Within 1 to 2 years.ECG connected watches Last May, Apple proudly announced that its connected watch had saved the lives of two people by detecting an abnormally high heart rate. The latest version of the Apple Watch is indeed equipped with an electrocardiogram (ECG) function analyzing heart impulses. However, current devices with a single sensor cannot detect a stroke in real-time. That will soon change: the American manufacturer AliveCor gave at the last Congress of the American Cardiology Association a device with two sensors supposed to detect certain types of attack. For when? Right now.Carbon capture To prevent global warming, 1,000 billion tons of carbon would have to be removed during the 21st century, according to UN experts. As recently as February 26, Australian researchers presented a method to capture and convert atmospheric CO2 to storable solid carbon. Bill Gates cites the startup\u2019s Carbon Engineering (in which he has invested) and Climeworks, which transform atmospheric CO2 into biofuel or industrial gas. \u201cIt is still expensive and difficult, but given our inability to reduce our emissions enough, there is no other option,\u201d said fatalist Bill Gates. Predicting premature births Fifteen million babies are born prematurely each year, a million of whom will die as a result of complications, according to a report by around fifty organizations and universities. \u201cIn the feature, a simple blood test will identify whether a woman risks premature labor,\u201d says Bill Gates. Stanford University researcher Stephen Quake has developed a test that detects the expression of certain circulating RNA genes (outside of cells) associated with a risk of premature birth. Mothers at risk could thus be identified and taken care of. For when? Within 5 years.Intelligent voice assistants Amazon Alexa, Siri, Google Home \u2026 Connected speakers have been massively adopted in the United States, but their capacities remain quite limited for the moment. The deeper understanding of human language combined with the improvement of synthetic voices will soon make it possible to have a real conversation with voice assistants, assures Bill Gates, who notably cites the example of Google Duplex, capable of calling to make an appointment. you in your place.

            "answer_text": "Here are some of technology trends you can look up to: Internet of Things (IOT) One of the biggest tech trends to emerge in recent years is the Internet of Things. Simply put, the Internet of Things (abbreviated IOT) is the idea that all technological devices can be connected to the internet and to each other in an attempt to create the perfect marriage between the physical and digital worlds. How will this impact you? It depends on your industry. For example, for those who work in marketing, advertising, media or business management, IOT could provide a wealth of information on how consumers engage with products by tracking their interactions with digital devices. In turn, this data could be used to optimize marketing campaigns and user experiences. The really cool thing about IOT is that it\u2019s not only changing the way we do business but also the business models we use to do it. For example, according to Deloitte, flexible consumption models (also known as pay-per-use models) are going become increasingly more popular across all industries as new customer data becomes available. Machine learning Another exciting emerging technology is machine learning, which is essentially a computer\u2019s ability to learn on its own by analyzing data and tracking repeating patterns. For example, social media platforms use machine learning to get a better understanding of how you\u2019re connected with those in your social network. They do this by analyzing your likes, shares and comments and then prioritizing content from your closest connections, serving you that content first. In addition to shaping your day-to-day interactions with friends on social media, machine learning is also changing the way companies do business with customers. According to Deloitte, companies like Google are using machine learning on mobile devices which can continue learning even when offline. The result? Machine learning is reshaping the way businesses interact with their customers in a big way by helping them anticipate and meet customer needs more easily. Virtual reality (VR) Remember watching movies about virtual reality and thinking how cool it would be if it was actually like that in real life? Well, it\u2019s about to be. Although VR has been around since the 1950s, until recently the technology wasn\u2019t able to deliver the fully immersive digital experience users have been craving. That\u2019s about to change with recent improvements to both hardware and programming, and the effects are going to be felt across almost every industry from retail to education. Virtual reality has been a popular component of video games for several years and this trend is continuing to expand. In addition to video games, VR is likely to affect companies across the board as they adopt the technology to help them engage customers more effectively and optimize their sales and marketing efforts. It\u2019s also a potentially useful tool for learning and is increasingly being adopted by educational organizations. Touch commerce Being able to buy anything you want with the touch of a finger may have seemed like a fantasy a few years ago, but it\u2019s now a reality. Merging touchscreen technology with one-click shopping, touch commerce allows consumers to buy products easily from their phones. After linking their payment information to a general account and enabling the feature, customers are able to buy everything from clothes to furniture with just a fingerprint. According to Deloitte, this is one of the biggest things to hit eCommerce in recent years with purchases of this type expected to increase by 150% this year alone and retailers in almost every industry anticipating an increase in sales directly related to this new technology. Cognitive Technology Cognitive technology is in the same vein as machine learning and virtual reality except that it\u2019s a broader concept. For example, the cognitive technology umbrella includes things like natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition. Combined, these different technologies are able to automate and optimize a lot of tasks that were previously done by people, including certain aspects of accounting and analytics. Thanks ",

            "answer_text": "Machine Learning. First there is Watson. If you remember the Jeopardy game played by two world champion Jeopardy players and Watson, Watson destroyed both contestants. Recently, IBM opened Watson up to international corporations for executive-level decision-making consulting, and to the public for the development of knowledge-based apps. So the Jeopardy problem and The Turing Test have been passed. Watson may exceed human intelligence today. The Singularity may have occurred. No one knows how to evaluate that. Watson itself may have to develop The Watson Test. And by opening Watson up, vastly new problems are being posed, and vastly more machine learning is going on, even at the global level. \"Watson, can tell us how to solve the fresh clean water problem in an manner that is ecologically responsible while it reduces system risk of failure and bring profits to the corporations so they can hire more employees to get the job done and return positive net worth to investors?\" \"Yes, I know of several viable options that have been proposed. I will need some time to do the analysisis of probabilities of success. May I have a week or so to do this?\" \"Yes, Watson, that's just fine with us.\" There is also the fact that three \"social learning\" robots (kid-sized and look like kids) have learned that people communicate by sound through air, which is a free and common medium. So, they developed their own language that only they can understand. They expected them to learn how to recognize objects and to learn to play and emote. The ability to speak was totally unexpected and is the hot research topic today. What are they saying? And why? They have WiFi connections among each other. Apparently human language was too difficult for them to learn easily. It takes years to learn proper English even in a country where everyone speaks the same language. But what they say does not sound like baby talk. These are clearly very specific and clear words. Nor is this speech recognition nor text to speech. They do not have the hardware or software to do either. It is a language at this time that only the robots understand and they even correct each other about use of those words. ",

            "answer_text": "Visible Light Communication a.k.a Li-Fi  What if I told you that you can download 15 movies per second using a simple LED light bulb? What if I told you that the study lamp on your table has the potential to provide you with super-fast wireless internet connection? Seems far-fetched, eh? Well, its going to be a reality soon!  To understand how this technology works, let us see the simplified journey of a typical text message . User enters a message which comprises of characters . Each character is represented by a value between 0-128 also known as the ASCII value. These ASCII values are converted to a binary number (eg. A -> 65 -> 01000001) Each '1' is represented by a pulse of electromagnetic wave (radio waves in case of mobiles) and each '0' by an absence of pulse. This pattern of electromagnetic wave is sensed by other user's mobile, which decodes it in reverse order and displays the message on the screen. Similarly, all pictures and videos can also be converted into binary and transmitted wirelessly using electromagnetic waves.  Now let us see the spectrum of electromagnetic wave  We already use radio waves for wireless communication . What about visible light which forms a significant portion the spectrum? Can we not use visible light to represent 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s ? Yes, by merely changing the brightness of light we can seamlessly transmit and receive data.  Here are a few reasons why we should consider using visible light waves instead radio waves: Speed: Speed of Li-Fi is approximately 100x more than current Wi-Fi speeds. According to a test conducted in Oxford University, we have achieved a speed of 224 Gbps using Li-Fi. To put things in perspective this means, we can download 18 movies each of 1.5 GB in a second. We can browse through websites in the blink of an eye.Bandwidth : The bandwidth of visible light waves is 10,000 times more than that of radio waves. Thus we can fulfil the ever increasing requirement of data.Security : A Wi - Fi signal can be intercepted, as radio waves can penetrate through walls. But Li - Fi requires of line of sight communication which keeps the communication confidential.Infrastructure : The ubiquitous presence of light bulbs provides the infrastructure for implementing such a technology. It merely requires us to replace incandescent bulbs with inexpensive LED bulbs.Eco Friendly : The base stations consumes a lot of energy while generating radio waves. The efficiency of such a base station is only around 5%. On the other hand, we have light bulbs acting as base station which consumes far less energy. Still not convinced? Watch the inventor of Li - Fi , Prof. Harald Hass demonstrating this new technology.   Here is a project developed by me and my friends which uses Li - Fi to communicate wirelessly between two computers.

Some examples of it are Nest thermostat, Amazon Echo and many other home automation devices Self Driving Cars Many technology companies like Google are already working on the concept of self driving cars since long and have been testing them since quite some time. Tesla is one of the company that has this feature in a limited form in its mainstream cars model s and model x cars. Now more and more companies are working on this and even Apple is rumoured to be working on Apple car. Though these are some of the technologies that are currently attracting a lot of attention time will tell if they will be widely adopted or not  ",

Mechanical autonomy engineers must have four year college educations in a relevant field and state to fit the bill for passage level work. As indicated by The Princeton Review, progression to increasingly focused employments in apply autonomy plan and research more often than not involves an advanced education. The audit additionally noticed that apply autonomy engineers with foundations in both building and PC sciences may see more prominent progression openings. Contrasted with specialists, the instruction prerequisites for apply autonomy engineers are less stringent. As per the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics, an apply autonomy expert partner's degree is ordinarily adequate for work as a professional. Further instruction, for example, a 4-year degree in apply autonomy innovation, may open potential outcomes for a profession as a connected architect or technologist. A few colleges offer degrees explicitly in apply autonomy advancements, however a degree in software engineering or mechanical or electrical designing can be similarly as alluring to managers.

Now a days i have observed a technology name written on the bikes of hero motocorp(hero motocorp patented technology). that is the \u201ci3s technology\"  You would have started thinking that what kind of technology is this so let me clear this and also explain it in brief. The term \u201ci3s\" stands for (IDLE Start - Stop - System) giving it the name i3s which is quite good name. So according to the name the technology has some relation with starting and stoping of the vehicle. Technology explanation - The i3s technology is equipped with the variuos electronics and various types of sensors \u201c Its main function is to switch off your vehicle when your vehicle is in NEUTRAL and standing IDLE for more than 5 - 10 seconds. For eg. When your Stuck in traffic and your vehicle has to stand still for long period then you can switch on this technology switch mounted on the right handside of your vehicle.  When you switch on this button then the technology starts functioning and it works only when your vehicle is in neutral. Afterthat you can start your vehicle whenever required by just applying the clutch. This technology helps in saving fuel of the vehicle, increasing its mileage and reduces load on the engine. As this is hero patented technology it can be only found in thier vehicle Pic credit - motor octane Thank You ",

They want wearable gadgets which will harm their health. They want to go to space, so that they can pollute it as well. I am not a communist, but I believe our focus needs sorting out (presumable by artificial intelligence, since we don\u2019t have it) The biggest technology trend which I believe will change the world as a whole would be electricity storage technology. Imagine what all will it change! Major (means MAJOR) reduction in global warming due to nearly 75% reduction in usage of fossil fuels. Cars, homes, plants could run on electricity stored from solar plants. This will bring down electricity consumption itself (less ACs, air purifiers, fans etc).Electricity in every home. Africa, south asia, south america (80% of world\u2019s population with access to electricity could become educated and understand what exactly can Artificial intelligence do?This education could help bring down the world population, easing pressure on resources, which would reduce conflicts all over the world.The reduced pollution would bring improved health, reducing pressure on the health care facilities.90% of my friends have a fifth generation phone with snapdragon 835. 99% of them don\u2019t use more than 10% of the capability (Call, sms, whatsapp, twitter, google search, video and games). Some intelligent ones use the dictaphone, calculator, health monitoring etc. I did an audit for a company, which uses 60TB on cloud. During a perfunctionary audit over 3 days, I told them (and they agreed) 80% of this data was useless. Data analytics has brought the Human Resources (as per my opinion, one of the most important departments in an organisation) to become a log book which most people can fool. A guy first avoids work by ordering food online and then curses cholesterol. An office manager, avoids a 1 hour travel to have 10 of his executives sit and make 1 hour reports which he spends next 4 hours analysing, reaches late home and has tension in his family. We buy a mineral water bottle to save from water borne disease but to pollute the earth beyond repair and kill ourself. And then we want to go to outer space to destroy that also. When will we ever, understand that technology is supposed to simplify life not complicate it. My aim of writing this here was to tickle your brains to identify technology trends which help the world not take it beyond economical repair. ",

The analysis finds that almost all businesses have closely invested in digital transformations over the last few years, which means that what used to be as soon as the supply of aggressive benefits is now the brand new norm. Therefore, to stick ahead of the pack, firms should keep on the lookout for the next aggressive advantages.  To lend a hand companies perceive the technological developments which are more likely to turn out disruptive over the next three years, it has simply revealed their newest annual Technology Vision file. I spoke to Michael Biltz, MD of Accenture Technology Vision, who informed me that the majority of world businesses have now followed data-driven, smart and transformative technology into their core methods. As a result, they are now looking to further expand their aggressive edge by way of looking beyond headline-grabbing buzzwords(latest technology). Biltz informed me \u201cAs we\u2019ve been talking to industry executives\u2026 our clients \u2026 what we\u2019ve found for the first time is that there\u2019s been a shift \u2013 people are starting to ask, \u2018what\u2019s next?\u2019\u201d With over $1.1 trillion invested through trade-in virtual transformation all over 2019, there\u2019s a feeling amongst business leaders, in keeping with Accenture\u2019s findings, that many are neatly on their solution to attaining what they set out to reach. For most, this comes to moving to data-driven industry fashions the place selections are made according to the massive volumes of up-to-date, fast-moving data generated through organizations in as of late\u2019s virtual international. \u201cWhat we\u2019re realizing is that the world looks fundamentally different when you\u2019re talking about every single company using technology to execute their strategies \u2026 to optimize their business and also as a catalyst for new things,\u201d Biltz says. This is what he way by a \u201cpost-digital\u201d age \u2013 corporations are not able to distinguish themselves through the fact that they're fully engaged with social, cellular, analytics and cloud (SMAC). Instead, they should create tales around how they are using them extra efficiently, or innovatively, than their competition. Accenture\u2019s Technology Vision 2020 has identified the next 5 tech traits that may underpin aggressive advantages in a post-digital technology: DARQ Power: Understanding the DNA of DARQ  The file identifies four technologies, abbreviated to DARQ, that will be the catalysts for exchange within the post-digital technology. These are allotted ledger generation (similar to the blockchain), synthetic intelligence (AI), prolonged fact (including digital and augmented fact), and quantum computing. Businesses that are going to thrive over the approaching years must master those applied sciences and identify how they can best possible leverage them to spice up their efficiency. The imaginative and prescient is that as these technologies broaden further and more and more converge, they'll allow companies to construct on their digital investments to be able to offer more clever experiences that can be highly customized for particular consumers in particular moments(latest technology). Get to understand me: Unlock distinctive shoppers and unique alternatives  Accenture\u2019s imaginative and prescient is that within the post-digital era, firms will transfer against a better granularity of their figuring out of shoppers. Based on folks\u2019 digital identities, companies are in a position to expand ongoing, customized relationships as a way to ship wealthy, individualized services and products. Companies that may understand customers in accordance with their distinctive electronic identities can cater for an ongoing, experience-based relationship with every individual customer. Of route, this raises one glaring query \u2013 how will customers react to ever-more in-depth and private profiling and customization of products and services in accordance with what may well be very non-public and valuable knowledge \u2013 our daily actions and knowledge at the products and services we engage with. The key right here, in line with Biltz, might be construction consider, and whether or not a company manages this will be make-or-break on the earth of the near future. Businesses will try to seek out the socially applicable line \u2013 how much information they can accumulate and what they are able to get away with doing with it. And it\u2019s true that this line won\u2019t be set in stone, and it won\u2019t be the same for all of us. As Biltz puts it, \u201cIt becomes a negotiation \u2013 it\u2019s not really about what is or isn\u2019t ok, it\u2019s about what\u2019s ok within a particular relationship \u2013 and that relationship will evolve over time(latest technology).\u201d Human + Worker: Change the workplace or impede the body of workers  People at the moment are the use of generation of their everyday lives to make stronger their talents and stories. In the place of work, this gives corporations alternatives to reimagine paintings and augment working environments with technology in a way to spice up human performance. Biltz states: \"Today's workers are empowered not just by skills and information, but in addition tech-driven functions. We name this the \"human+\" group of workers.\" The document calls for businesses to empower workers to transform human+, where a new set of technological features are integrated along folks's personal skills and expertise, and where corporations foster a continual studying tradition. The factor is that more than two-thirds of the 6,000 respondents to the Accenture survey believe that their staff are more \u201cdigitally mature\u201d than their organizations. This results in situations the place workers transform annoyed as they look forward to the infrastructure they rely on to do their activity to meet up with their very own technical skill ability. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to create a new workforce that\u2019s dependent on technology, and constantly learning technology, but it\u2019s created a new digital divide that says most companies while creating these new jobs, haven\u2019t changed the way they find, train and support workers, and even how they manage the knowledge and info these new workers are creating,\u201d Biltz says. \u201cRight now, in the USA, the average stay at a company is three years \u2026 which doesn\u2019t even count the selection of roles you will have within a company, which is closer to a year \u2026 which says, \u2018how do I constantly train workers if they\u2019re constantly converting roles?\u2019 \u201cJust as vital, if anyone\u2019s in a task for a yr, who\u2019s keeping up all the wisdom that they realized in the 12 months \u2026 how are they capturing easiest practices, connections, networks \u2026 the entire items fundamental to getting issues accomplished? \"Our workers have long gone through their own electronic transformation, and it is not simply the services and products of an organization that are transforming, it is the staff and the structure and group of the company that helps them(latest technology).\" Secure us to secure me: Enterprises aren't victims, they\u2019re vectors  The rising digitization of businesses, mixed with the truth that they function in evermore hooked up ecosystems, cause them to susceptible to cyber attaches at extraordinary scales. Instead of focusing best on interior possibility management, companies must look at their whole ecosystem and unfold and share responsibilities, creating safety partnerships. The analysis confirms this, with 87% of industrial and IT executives agreeing that in the event that they need to be really resilient, organizations will have to reconsider their approaches to security in order that it no longer simplest defends their own industry however their whole ecosystem. Blitz states that \"Cybersecurity is now not an individual company effort. It wishes cooperation with ecosystem partners(latest technology).\" My Markets: Meet customers\u2019 needs at the pace of now  In the post-digital generation, each second will grow to be a marketplace alternative. We are already used to businesses like Amazon or Netflix that supply us with personalized recommendations. But ever-increasing levels of customer insights mean business will grow to be more adept at reconfiguring products and services in close to real-time to capture \"short-term markets.\" The opportunity for companies is to offer their customers highly custom designed and on-demand reports to satisfy customer needs as they get up in a second. For this, companies must combine real-time analytics features with subtle back-end techniques to capture and deliver to consumers precisely what they need, when they need it. \u201cWhether we\u2019re trying to get across town, get to our jobs, pick up our children, exercise and make ourselves more healthy \u2026 all those things represent small moments in our lives,\u201d Biltz explains. Understanding our behavior in enough depth to capitalize on these short-term markets will be the subsequent objective in personalization and individualization of products and services, in step with the Vision 2020 report. This is supported through two explicit findings \u2013 with 83% of executives surveyed pointing out that digital demographics give their organizations new techniques to spot unmet buyer wishes and 85% agreeing that bringing in combination customization era and real-time analytics will represent the \"subsequent large wave\" in competitive advantage(latest technology).  \"If you start to take into account your marketplace on this means \u2013 it flips industry on its head. It's not about \u2018how do I maximize an individual transaction when somebody's connected with me?' \u201cInstead, it\u2019s having a look over people\u2019s lives as a complete and asking \u2018where should I insert my products and services into these lives in order to make them better?(latest technology)\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "Here are the top five technology trends you need to know to work in any industry. 1. Internet of Things (IOT) One of the biggest tech trends to emerge in recent years is the Internet of Things. Simply put, the Internet of Things (abbreviated IOT) is the idea that all technological devices can be connected to the internet and to each other in an attempt to create the perfect marriage between the physical and digital worlds. How will this impact you? It depends on your industry. For example, for those who work in marketing, advertising, media or business management, IOT could provide a wealth of information on how consumers engage with products by tracking their interactions with digital devices. In turn, this data could be used to optimize marketing campaigns and user experiences. How it\u2019s affecting industries: The really cool thing about IOT is that it\u2019s not only changing the way we do business but also the business models we use to do it. For example, according to Deloitte, flexible consumption models (also known as pay-per-use models) are going to become increasingly more popular across all industries as new customer data becomes available.  2. Machine learning Another exciting emerging technology is machine learning, which is essentially a computer\u2019s ability to learn on its own by analyzing data and tracking repeating patterns. For example, social media platforms use machine learning to get a better understanding of how you\u2019re connected with those in your social network. They do this by analyzing your likes, shares, and comments and then prioritizing content from your closest connections, serving you that content first. How it\u2019s affecting industries: In addition to shaping your day-to-day interactions with friends on social media, machine learning is also changing the way companies do business with customers. According to Deloitte, companies like Google are using machine learning on mobile devices which can continue learning even when offline. The result? Machine learning is reshaping the way businesses interact with their customers in a big way by helping them anticipate and meet customer needs more easily.  3. Virtual reality (VR) Remember watching movies about virtual reality and thinking how cool it would be if it was actually like that in real life? Well, it\u2019s about to be. Although VR has been around since the 1950s until recently the technology wasn\u2019t able to deliver the fully immersive digital experience users have been craving. That\u2019s about to change with recent improvements to both hardware and programming, and the effects are going to be felt across almost every industry from retail to education. How it\u2019s affecting industries: Virtual reality has been a popular component of video games for several years and this trend is continuing to expand. In addition to video games, VR is likely to affect companies across the board as they adopt the technology to help them engage customers more effectively and optimize their sales and marketing efforts. It\u2019s also a potentially useful tool for learning and is increasingly being adopted by educational organizations.  4. Touch commerce Being able to buy anything you want with the touch of a finger may have seemed like a fantasy a few years ago, but it\u2019s now a reality. Merging touchscreen technology with one-click shopping, touch commerce allows consumers to buy products easily from their phones. After linking their payment information to a general account and enabling the feature, customers are able to buy everything from clothes to furniture with just a fingerprint. How it\u2019s affecting industries: According to Deloitte, this is one of the biggest things to hit eCommerce in recent years with purchases of this type expected to increase by 150% this year alone and retailers in almost every industry anticipating an increase in sales directly related to this new technology.  5. Cognitive Technology Cognitive technology is in the same vein as machine learning and virtual reality except that it\u2019s a broader concept. For example, the cognitive technology umbrella includes things like natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition. Combined, these different technologies are able to automate and optimize a lot of tasks that were previously done by people, including certain aspects of accounting and analytics. How it\u2019s affecting industries: Although cognitive technologies have a broad range of applications, Deloitte predicts that the industry sector most affected by this trend initially will be the software sector with 95% of enterprise software companies projected to adopt these technologies by 2020. With emerging technologies changing professional industries including banking, eCommerce, healthcare, and education, staying up to date on the latest trends will give you a better understanding of your chosen industry and make you a more competitive candidate. Best of all, this knowledge might open up new doors within your field and others.  ",

            "answer_text": "Image:  Computational photography When I say computational photography, I\u2019m using it to refer to the broad range of ways that engineers are working with software to improve digital cameras. Big high-end sensors and fine glass lenses aren\u2019t in any danger of being replaced when it comes to getting the best shot possible, but software solutions are making new techniques possible, and constantly improving small affordable cameras. Smartphones are getting thinner, but the images they can capture only get better. Software is one of the biggest reasons for that. Apple and Samsung are using software (and dual lenses) to create excellent depth of field effects on their phones, and even big deal directors like Steven Soderbergh and Michel Gondry decided to start shooting with the iPhone this year. Meanwhile, Google\u2019s Pixel 2 camera got our recommendationfor its superior HDR processing, and it also is integrating a ton of AI features into its camera software that will only get more useful. And Andy Rubin\u2019s Essential Phone took a lot of heat for its lackluster camera, but software updates have helped it improve over the past few months. Newcomer Rylo took a shot at GoPro with its first device that combines an action cam and a 360 camera into a pocket-sized gadget with some serious software at an affordable price. It has some of the best image stabilization I\u2019ve seen. And its intuitive editing software allows you to just shoot everything around you to make shot choices and choreograph smooth camera movements later. Don\u2019t get too excited: Software still has a long way to go before it can approximate the look of the highest-end cameras, and it might be a bit unfortunate to see professionals settling for something that\u2019s just good enough. GIF Source:  Self-driving cars Talk about self-driving cars has been around so long that it\u2019s almost mundane. No one seemed to care that Waymo officially abandoned test drivers behind the wheels of its self-driving cars in Arizona back in November. That\u2019s a huge deal. Waymo is launching a self-driving taxi service in the suburbs of Phoenix. For real! The promise of self-driving cars means more efficient commutes, more free time, fewer traffic accidents, big leaps in AI, and all sorts of other game-changing advancements. As far as getting these things out to the public goes, Tesla insists that its auto-pilot feature that offers limited self-driving capabilities will be ready to drive itself from California to New York very soon. That means Tesla owners would already have a self-driving car because the company just to push out a software update. Don\u2019t get too excited: This is a scary economic shift. A lot of people are going to lose their jobs. That\u2019s a big factor in the dampened excitement. Also, with all that extra free time in the commute, demanding bosses are just going to expect more productivity. Image:  Augmented Reality/Mixed Reality Virtual reality hasn\u2019t really taken off in 2017 the way some had hoped. It\u2019s far from dead, and Oculus is hoping to turn more people on to VR with a standalone headset that costs $200 next year. Still, its isolation, lack of eye-tracking, and tendency to induce nausea, are big hurdles to clear. Mixed reality is so much more interesting in that it wants to incorporate virtual objects and experiences with the real world, solving a lot of VR\u2019s problems and offering different possibilities. 2017 brought us further progress in the field. In the most modest development, Apple went all in on augmented reality with its new iPhones and ARkit for developers. The iPhone\u2019s capabilities with AR aren\u2019t going to go much further than Pokemon Go-style overlays on real-world environments for a while, but Apple\u2019s slowly adding sensors that will improve the phones capabilities and the most important part is that developers are putting together applications. For now, we can only expect to see some rudimentary redecorating apps and small but useful tools like the AR measuring tape. But remember, the first million or so iPhone apps were just fart simulators. There are also those reports that Apple is planning to drop its AR headset in 2019. Microsoft has continued to quietly plug away with work on HoloLens, its mixed reality headset. Developers have had their hands on the early prototypes for quite some time, and they sporadically showed off cool demos that were inspired by Super Mario, Lemmings, and Portal. Microsoft also made some baby steps with a line of inexpensive but impressive VR headsets in partnership with other companies that simulate how mixed reality might work. And finally, Magic Leap showed off its long-delayed mixed-reality headset and promised its coming to developers in 2018. It\u2019s not as bulky as we feared and based on reports it appears that virtual objects will have a sense of permanence and presence we\u2019ve never encountered before. Mixed reality wants you to blow holes in the walls of your living room with a laser gun, have a pet cartoon dog that permanently roams around your house, build virtual sculptures on the coffee table, fill your surroundings with as many monitors as you can ask for, and allow you to walk down the street in the real world alongside avatars of people who are sitting in their living rooms. Don\u2019t get too excited: Mixed reality has a long way to go, so don\u2019t expect to be walking down the street with the Iron Giant anytime soon. And let\u2019s face it, the world promised in Ready Player One sounds pretty awful, so the longer we have to think about this the better. Image:  Smartwatches as medical devices The Apple Watch might be the most boring thing that Apple has ever made, but the grand plan for it, and smartwatches, in general, isn\u2019t boring at all. More than anything, these glorified messaging machines might save our lives one day. 2017 was the year that the Apple Watch got good, and it was also the year that the FDA approved the first medical device accessory. The Kardiabandis an add-on that can detect an abnormal heart rate. What\u2019s more, a UCSF study found that Apple\u2019s built-in heart monitor could detect an abnormal heart rate with 97 percent accuracy when an AI-based algorithm called DeepHeart was used in conjunction with the device. The same team behind that study later found that the Apple Watch-DeepHeart combo could detect sleep apnea with 90 percent accuracy, and hypertension with 82 percent accuracy. Both of those conditions are quite a chore to detect with the current methods. It\u2019s still early in the quest to make a smartwatch a magical medical wizard that brings a silver bullet to preventative medicine, but we\u2019re getting there. Don\u2019t get too excited: Privacy issues abound, and we\u2019re going to have to work them out before this technology matures, not after. Image:  Yes, 2017's biggest tech story was probably about the ways in which social media forced us to rehash old culture wars and question who was guiding our political discourse. Rather than seeing technology facilitate greater communication, economic opportunity, and leisure, it seemed that it was exacerbating our differences, concentrating wealth, and threatening all livelihoods. But there was some good stuff too! For anyone who loves technology, it was kind of a downer. While we shouldn\u2019t turn away from the challenges that the information age keeps springing on us, it\u2019s understandable to long for a few things that just make you say, \u201cthat\u2019s neat!\u201d It\u2019s easy to hope to see something that dazzles you or is so ambitious that in a decade it might just be incredible. For me, there were a lot of things I saw this year that I thought fit that bill. Some of them, like the sudden mainstream fascination with blockchain, caused me to feel more dread than hope. But others either made me smile, grabbed my imagination, or just showed a ton of promise. ",

            "answer_text": "Some of latest technology trend in recent years are as below. Device form Factors(some latest innovations) electronic devices and their form factor has always been the most important aspect of these devices. the way we have used our devices Has always been changing. initially, we had phones with no screens on them. Then we had the phones with big and colorful displays but still, they had keys. After these key-pads were replaced by full touch displays. even now the companies are in innovating and finding the new ways in which we can use our devices. some great changes are happening in the form factor of our devices. Let us have a look at a few of these latest innovations in device form factors. Mixed Reality While the virtual reality has been around for a few years now but the mixed reality is still a bit new. unlike virtual reality where we wear some device over our eyes and get into a different 3-D world, The mixed reality mixes virtual and real. it draws the virtual things into our real world and we can see and interact with these things using the Halo lens. This technology has some great utility in fields like education, Surgery, design, art, etc. Holo Lens is just one device. On the same lines, google and apple are coming up with their own mixed reality devices. For instance, Google is working on google glass which is their take on mixed reality. Foldable and dual displays Another big change that may be seen in phones very soon is a foldable display. Motorola already has a phone with foldable displays in the market and very soon Samsung may also launch phones with a screen that can bend. Right now this technology is a bit costly. But as more people adopt it, it can soon be within the reach of everyone. Check the demo below. Blockchains and latest innovations it brings Another latest innovations with a great future are blockchains. Middlemen manage many aspects of our lives in today's world. For example, banks manage our money. You depend on service provided by courier service or online retailer to find where your parcel may be. This central control of the third party is not always good. Just thinks what happens to your money if your bank is closed suddenly forever. If you are thinking that there is no chance of this happening then read about PMC bank and yes bank in India. Remember Lehmann brothers and what happened to one of the biggest banks in the US. There are many cases of lost parcels. And in such cases you have no option but to spend a lot of time with an annoying call center person. Block chain has introduced the concept of shared ledger. And this concept has a huge potential to change the way many things are carried out today. So first lets understand what it is. A blockchain is a series of immutable records of data. cryptography is used to secure each block of data. Each record has a timestamp. Using this we can find the exact time of the creation of these records. We can only add records and there is no way to change the records that are already in the chain. A common ledger is shared among all stakeholders. This ledger holds all the transactions that have taken place in the blockchain. And so everybody can see any transaction at any time. This idea of shared Ledger is far-reaching and it holds a great promise for future Applications built on the blockchain. Let us have a look at some use cases of this concept. Supply chain A good produced in one country are sold all over the world. To facilitate this, supply chains play a huge role. But any product passes through many places and people before it can reach in the hand of the consumer. For example, just think how food grown in farms reaches your table? Now if there is a ledger which creates a record as soon as food changes the hand how easy it will be to track the food from farm to your table. All stake holders will have a copy of this ledger and they can see the complete history of any product through out the supply chain. Healthcare In the field of healthcare we have some very good use cases for blockchain. Your full medical history can be recorded in a blockchain. Whenever you go to a doctor he updates your details. If you get some test done it will be recorded in the blockchain. This will make it very easy for any doctor you see your medical history. If you need any detail you can just check your records in blockchain. Real Estate We can update all land and property records in a block chain. We can add a new block whenever a new deal happens. In this way we can track any property right back to the first owner starting from its current owner. Just think how much clarity and ease it will bring into the world of real estate. These are just some use cases and there are many possible uses of a shared ledger and the new blockchain technology. Crypto Currencies The concept of decentralized money which is free from the control of any government is getting popular day by day. Many coins like Bitcoin and Ether have already gained huge popularity. Bitcoin which had no value a few years back is valued more than 11000 dollars at the time of writing. If you want to be a part of this latest innovations just check this post on our website. latest innovations in AI and machine learning AI is the ability of a machine to perform the roles that we associate with human minds, such as reasoning, learning, etc. Examples of technologies that enable AI to solve problems are robotics, self-driving cars, language, and machine learning. IBM Watson (the AI platform) can help specialists in solving problems faster and solve the bigger issues by creating insights out of more data. Let us have a look at some of the latest innovations in the field of AI. Machine Learning overview computers can iteratively learn from data using machine learning algorithms. They allow computers to find hidden insights without being told exactly where to look. Machine Learning is teaching the computer to solve problems by using algorithms that learn by looking at hundreds or thousands of cases and then use that knowledge to solve the problem in new conditions. Self driving cars Many companies have already built their models for self-driving cars. This is a hot new are where many big players like Google and Tesla are working actively. Though they have shown some working models still the biggest hurdle is the legal one. But some time in the future we may see self-driving cars running around our cities. Personal Assistants You may have already seen Alexa, Siri, Google-Now and Cortana in action on your smartphone devices. Right now you can use them for having some fun. For example, you can ask them to sing or tell you a joke or play any song of your liking. They can also help you in setting reminders alarms. using google home you can control your home appliances. But soon what these assistants will be able to do much more. just think what if they can reply to some regular mails or do some of your office work as per schedule. As the capability of AI behind these assistants will increase so will increase their power. ",

I have listed down 10 technology trends for 2018 that I am sure will make a mark in everyone\u2019s life \u2013 some will take off, some will go mainstream, while innovation will be the center stage for all these activities. Artificial Intelligence and Automation If you are a tech-buff, you must have heard about it a number of times in 2017 when AI was implemented in some apps, games, etc. However by the end of this year, AI is going to be the mainstay in most forms of technology, if not all. Will jobs be lost? This is the major question that I hear around automation. Yes, certain manual jobs will obviously be automated. However if engineers can re-skill and learn advanced technologies, expect more job creation on the anvil. Blockchain Ah! 2018 technology trends without blockchain will be a blunder as it will continue to be the focus whether bitcoin dies or it is priced at $100,000 for one. Blockchain has numerous advantages and has potential to change the face of internet and the way businesses work. It is being hailed as the internet of the 21st century as it allows verification of records and data without the need of a middleman. 2018 will see many major changes happening on the technology side of blockchain including minimizing of transaction cost and time, more and better development frameworks, death of many cryptocurrencies, and consolidation by major and innovative startups.

This included like clicking photos, accessing the internet, browsing social networking sites, shopping online, etc. Our phones in 2018 will be more like digital assistants that knows what we need and would help us even before we ask. Phones with in-built AI technology are round the corner and location-aware devices will start playing a significant role in 2018. Touchless Interfaces Years back when I was in school, mobile phones were an awesome piece of device where you could play the Snake game apart from making calls. It had buttons on the keypad. Then the disruption began with touchscreens and it took the mobile experience to another level. We have already seen part of what the future would be like in 2017 and 2018 will be a continuation of that journey \u2013 touchless interfaces. Why would I need a touch screen when my voice can do the same job. A voice-based interface or conversational interface gets the job done faster and takes lesser effort. Alexa and Siri are already giving us a glimpse of the future and 2018 will be a continuation of the journey that takes us farther away from the tap and swipe game. Centralization of Devices will Drive Technology We are surrounded by devices. Our lives are more or less dependent on apps for basic day to day activities be it for navigation or shopping, among other things. Consumers are thus looking for a one-stop destination to manage all their devices \u2013 from mobiles, to ACs to TVs, room heaters, etc. Smart speakers like Amazon Echo are a good start to this process and we might notice more consolidation and better products this year. Read more on Amazon Alexa Amazon Alexa \u2013 Every Beginner\u2019s Basics Guide Amazon Alexa and Echo in India \u2013 Everything you Ever Wanted to Know Alexa Skills \u2013 The Best and the Worst Alexa Tips and Tricks 5G Technology If you are in India, you would know how 4G has been a revolution in this part of the world. It has changed the way we compute, transact, surf the internet. Now imagine a service that is almost 10 times faster. Yes, I am talking about 5G technology. This year will see 5G being discussed and 5G handsets being developed for a probable launch in and around 2019. Data Overload Developing economies are matching their developed counterparts when it comes to data consumption. 24\u00d77 availability on the internet is a normal thing, and so is using the internet to do every day tasks. As a result, we are providing more and more data to companies and companies have a huge task at their hand to manage the data, ensure its security, avoid abuse of information and keep personal data of the users safe. This also has implications that include reduced privacy, more personalized ads and offers, and more positive outcomes. Chatbots and Redefined UI will be a Major Technology Trend this Year I have already discussed this above. Talking of conversational user interfaces, one of the 2018 technology trends would be mass adoption of smart speakers like Amazon Alexa and Echo devices in developed countries. Developing economies like India will have a significant population that would be interested in smart speakers but that depends on integration of regional language support like that of Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali. Is Amazon up the game? Or will Google\u2019s Home steal the limelight. 2018 will be an action filled year when it comes to smart speakers. Also apps and websites will have to be enhanced to ensure that users talk to their websites or apps instead of having to rigorously type on the keyboard. Services like Google Assistant will be more popular. However local services might throw in their weight to compete. Read more on conversational interfaces Conversational User Interface (CUI) \u2013 An Introduction Conversational User Interface \u2013 Examples Edge Computing For the past couple of years we have heard the term \u201ccloud computing\u201d a number of times. Billions of connected devices are generating tons of data every single day. This pace will be faster in 2018 than every before. This is putting more stress on modern data centers and service providers are looking at ways to reduce this stress. Cloud computing can transfer large amount of data but heavy usage can potentially lead to a bottleneck effect which hinders the speed and user experience. Welcome Edge computing \u2013 a concept where the data center would be located close to the consumers resulting in faster processing of data without the need of sending it back to the centralized servers. This results in faster response time and better performance. Wireless Charging 2.0 Powering devices wirelessly over the airwaves \u2013 that\u2019s what I would call the second generation of wireless charging. Now imagine this \u2013 you are using a device and there is a transmitter within some acceptable range of distance that is powering your device through air, without the need to connect it with a power source. Two companies have already got approval for this from the FCC \u2013 Energous and PowerCast. You may read more on my blog TechieSamrat.com ",

Increasing data from financial organizations such as banks, investment agencies, and insurance companies due to the increased awareness about stock exchange, investment banking, and the concept of Bitcoin among common people. New trend of technology has come as Artificial Intelligence and RegTech. Regulatory technology (RegTech) is a group of companies that help businesses to comply with regulatory challenges in the financial services sector by using innovative techniques. RegTech companies, financial institutions, and regulatory bodies work in collaboration with each other to meet the regulatory needs of financial authorities. Click Here to Get PDF Brochure with Research Insight of this Report: AI and RegTech RegTech utilizes advance technologies such as cloud computing and Big Data for sharing of regulatory information so as to identify, reduce, and avoid the risks of regulatory failure. For a long time, before the emergence of RegTech, financial and regulatory bodies used to work manually to process the data from financial organizations to confirm adherence to regulations mandated by the authorities. However, with the tremendous increase in financial data, the manual process became expensive and time consuming. This has led to the integration of artificial intelligence to automate the process of predicting potential risks to a business. Moreover, integration of artificial intelligence into RegTech has made the compliance process much easier by means of automation as compared to the manual process. This has increased the adoption of artificial intelligence and RegTech and is expected to drive the growth of the artificial intelligence and RegTech market during the forecast period 2018 \u2013 2026.

            "answer_text": "Top 5 Technology Trends for 2020  Technology is now evolving at such a rapid pace that annual predictions of trends can seem out-of-date before they even go live as a published blog post or article. As technology evolves, it enables even faster change and progress, causing an acceleration of the rate of change, until eventually, it will become exponential. Technology-based careers don\u2019t change at the same speed, but they do evolve, and the savvy IT professional recognizes that his or her role will not stay the same. And an IT worker of the 21st century will constantly be learning (out of necessity if not desire). What does this mean for you? It means staying current with technology trends. And it means keeping your eyes on the future, to know which skills you\u2019ll need to know and what types of jobs you want to be qualified to do. Here are eight technology trends you should watch for in 2020, and some of the jobs that will be created by these trends. 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in recent years, but it continues to be a trend to watch because its effects on how we live, work and play are only in the early stages. In addition, other branches of AI have developed, including Machine Learning, which we will go into below. AI refers to computer systems built to mimic human intelligence and perform tasks such as recognition of images, speech or patterns, and decision making. AI can do these tasks faster and more accurately than humans. Five out of six Americans use AI services in one form or another every day, including navigation apps, streaming services, smartphone personal assistants, ride-sharing apps, home personal assistants, and smart home devices. In addition to consumer use, AI is used to schedule trains, assess business risk, predict maintenance, and improve energy efficiency, among many other money-saving tasks. AI is one part of what we refer to broadly as automation, and automation is a hot topic because of potential job loss. Experts say automation will eliminate 73 million more jobs by 2030. However, automation is creating jobs as well as eliminating them, especially in the field of AI: Pundits predict that jobs in AI will number 23 million by 2020. Jobs will be created in development, programming, testing, support, and maintenance, to name a few. Artificial Intelligence architect is one such job. Some say it will soon rival data scientists in need for skilled professionals. To learn more about potential jobs in AI, read about building a career in AI or why you should earn an AI certification.

With Machine Learning, computers are programmed to learn to do something they are not programmed to do: they learn by discovering patterns and insights from data. In general, we have two types of learning, supervised and unsupervised. While Machine Learning is a subset of AI, we also have subsets within the domain of Machine Learning, including neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning. Each of these subsets offers an opportunity for specializing in a career field that will only grow. Machine Learning is rapidly being deployed in all kinds of industries, creating a huge demand for skilled professionals. The Machine Learning market is expected to grow to $8.81 billion by 2022. Machine Learning applications are used for data analytics, data mining and pattern recognition. On the consumer end, Machine Learning powers web search results, real-time ads, and network intrusion detection, to name only a few of the many tasks it can do. In addition to completing countless tasks on our behalf, it is generating jobs. Machine Learning jobs rank among the top emerging jobs on LinkedIn, with almost 2,000 job listings posted. And these jobs pay well: In 2017, the median salary for a machine learning engineer was $106,225. Machine Learning jobs include engineers, developers, researchers, and data scientists. 3. Robotic Process Automation or RPA Like AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology that is automating jobs. RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as interpreting applications, processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails. RPA automates repetitive tasks that people used to do. These are not just the menial tasks of a low-paid worker: up to 45 percent of the activities we do can be automated, including the work of financial managers, doctors, and CEOs. Although Forrester Research estimates RPA automation will threaten the livelihood of 230 million or more knowledge workers or approximately 9 percent of the global workforce, RPA is also creating new jobs while altering existing jobs. McKinsey finds that less than 5 percent of occupations can be totally automated, but about 60 percent can be partially automated. For you as an IT professional looking to the future and trying to understand technology trends, RPA offers plenty of career opportunities, including developer, project manager, business analyst, solution architect, and consultant. And these jobs pay well. Job Search Engine | SimplyHired says the average RPA salary is $73,861, but that is the average compiled from salaries for junior-level developers up to senior solution architects, with the top 10 percent earning over $141,000 annually. So, if you\u2019re keen on learning and pursuing a career in RPA, the Introduction to Robotic Process Automation (RPA) course should be the next step you take to kickstart an RPA career. 4. Edge Computing Formerly a technology trend to watch, cloud computing has become mainstream, with major players AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud dominating the market. The adoption of cloud computing is still growing, as more and more businesses migrate to a cloud solution. But it\u2019s no longer the emerging technology. As the quantity of data we\u2019re dealing with continues to increase, we\u2019ve realized the shortcomings of cloud computing in some situations. Edge computing is designed to help solve some of those problems as a way to bypass the latency caused by cloud computing and getting data to a data center for processing. It can exist \u201con the edge,\u201d if you will, closer to where computing needs to happen. For this reason, edge computing can be used to process time-sensitive data in remote locations with limited or no connectivity to a centralized location. In those situations, edge computing can act like mini datacenters. Edge computing will increase as the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices increases. By 2022, the global edge computing market is expected to reach $6.72 billion. As with any growing market, this will create various jobs, primarily for software engineers. If you wish to get a thorough understanding of edges means, and how is it different from cloud computing, give it a read here!

Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Virtual Reality (VR) immerses the user in an environment while Augment Reality (AR) enhances their environment. Although VR has primarily been used for gaming thus far, it has also been used for training, as with VirtualShip, a simulation software used to train U.S. Navy, Army and Coast Guard ship captains. The popular Pokemon Go is an example of AR. Both VR and AR have enormous potential in training, entertainment, education, marketing, and even rehabilitation after an injury. Either could be used to train doctors to do surgery, offer museum-goers a deeper experience, enhance theme parks, or even enhance marketing, as with this Pepsi Max bus shelter. There are major players in the VR market, like Google, Samsung, and Oculus, but plenty of startups are forming and they will be hiring, and the demand for professionals with VR and AR skills will only increase. Getting started in VR doesn\u2019t require a lot of specialized knowledge. Basic programming skills and a forward-thinking mindset can land a job, although other employers will be looking for optics as a skill-set and hardware engineers as well. ",

This includes overlapping with electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, mechatronics, nanotechnology and bioengineering. 3. Machine Learning Machine learning is a technique for information investigation that mechanizes systematic model structure. It is a part of man-made consciousness dependent on the possibility that frameworks can gain from information, distinguish examples and settle on choices with negligible human mediation. 4. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Augmented reality and virtual reality are backwards impressions of one in another with what every innovation tries to achieve and convey for the client. Virtual reality offers an advanced amusement of a genuine setting, while augmented reality conveys virtual components as an overlay to this present reality 5. Internet of Things (IoT) The internet of things, or IoT, is an arrangement of interrelated registering gadgets, mechanical and advanced machines, articles, creatures or individuals that are given remarkable identifiers (UIDs) and the capacity to move information over a system without expecting human-to-human or human-to-PC cooperation.

Gene editing  Before talking about CRISPR let\u2019s talk about DNA. DNA aka Deoxyribonucleic acid is a material that every human and almost all other organisms contain in their bodies.DNA are stored as code in human\u2019s bodies for example A means adenine etc.And the most important part is that everything you are your eye color,hair color,skin color,height and even charisma is written in your DNA. So if baby will have green eyes then it\u2019s written in it\u2019s DNA before he is even born. So what happens when we will be able to edit DNA codes? 1.People will be able to design their own babies As mentioned before when people will be able to edit DNA they will be able to choose their child\u2019s eye color,hair color,intelligence etc. 2.We will get rid of all diseases Recently CRISPR scientists have fixed a hear mutation in embryos and it\u2019s just the beginning.CRISPR is probably one of the fastest growing technological advancement.Nobody can imagine what they\u2019ll be doing by 2020s. A lot of other things that i can\u2019t think of. Another great and fascinating new technology(also related to health) is Artificial Wombs  A lot of children are born prematurely around 15 million every year.Artificial Wombs will help babies grow outside the womb thus number of children born will be able to live a normal life after 9 months in real or artificial womb.

Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators, and financial services. Google and Facebook know you more than you know yourself. If optimal decisions are those that act in your best interest, isn\u2019t it obvious to think that these companies will one day make decisions for you? You won\u2019t need to make decisions anymore: AI will make every decision for you, like which job to take, which person to date, what to eat for lunch. I predict that we will learn to surrender our decision-making ability very soon. We are already doing it. We don\u2019t decide which series to watch, Netflix does. We don't decide which music to listen to, Spotify does. We don\u2019t decide which book to read, Amazon does. They make you feel in control of your decisions, because ultimately you are the one who clicks on the play button of the first episode of Stranger Things. But how could I know that you actually watched that series, if it was really your decision? We don\u2019t realize it, but corporations already drive our decision-making process with recommender systems. Yet we are often satisfied, because it works. AI is better than us at deciding what we like. Not making a decision directly doesn\u2019t deprive us of the satisfaction that it brings us. If anything, we will enjoy it more, because we can\u2019t regret decisions we never made.

All of these using very standard communication protocols, every device will be able to enter the environment without interoperability problems The fact is that, when you use a device (a phone, a PC, a television etc...) you always have a rupture in your experience (on websites, music, watching VOD movies, looking at photos, having a call etc...). This rupture is the next new frontier to be abolished : your computer won't be a device but an environment.  The devices won't be important anymore : they will become invisible to you. You only will see functionalities. This technology is what MeeGo tends to be, followed by Android... I guess most technology will tend to this : being a part of your environment AND being invisible.

            "answer_text": "Upcoming Technology Trends You Need to KnowThe following trends will be major disturbances, which will continue to shape the future of New Year in the era of digital transformation. Here we discuss the technology trends 2019.  2019 is almost here and there is a flood of lists describing trends that will define different areas in the new year. Between these predictions, people related to new technical standards are first and foremost, given that they will revolutionize every industry, at an age when digital changes play a major role. After evaluating various consulting firm reports, we conclude that these are nine major trends which will define the technological disruption in the next 365 days. 1. 5G NetworksSpain's national 5G plan for 2018-2020 determines that in 2019, 5G-based pilot projects will be developed, resulting in the release of another digital dividend. Hence, the groundwork is being laid so that in 2020 we will be able to browse the Internet on a smartphone at a speed that will reach 10 gigabytes per second. Data from Statista, a provider of market and consumer data, indicates that by 2024, 5G mobile network technology will have reached more than 40 per cent of the global population, with close to 1.5 billion users.2. Artificial Intelligence (AI)This trend has appeared in all the lineups for a few years now, but everything indicates that this year will be the year it takes off definitively. This is the year we\u2019ll see its democratization, while it is even included in the political agenda. In early December, the European Commission issued a directive on AI in which member states were instructed to define the national strategy to address this topic by the middle of 2019.3. Autonomous DevicesIn relation to the last point robot, there are some innovations in the drone and autonomous vehicle category, the consulting firm Gartner label \"Autonomous Things\" is defined as the use of artificial intelligence that was previously used to automate the tasks performed by people. This trend goes further than mere automation using rigid programming models because AI is now being implemented to develop advanced behaviour, interacting in a more natural way with the environment and its users.4. BlockchainBlockchain technology is another topic that frequently appears on these end of year lists. It is now freed from a special relationship with the world of cryptococcal;Its utility has been proved in other areas. In 2019 we will look at many blockchain projects because they try to face the challenges that still face technology in various areas such as banking and insurance. It will also be a decisive year for the roll-out of decentralized organizations that work with intelligent contracts. 5. Augmented AnalyticsThis tendency represents another progression for large data, by combining it with artificial intelligence. Using machine learning (automated learning), it will transform the development, sharing, and consumption of data analysis. It is anticipated that the capabilities of augmented analytics will soon be commonly adopted not only to work with data, but also to implement in-house business applications related to Human resources, finance, sales, marketing and customer support - all aimed at optimizing decisions using intensive data analysis. 6. Digital TwinsDigital Twin is a virtual reproduction of a real-world system or entity. Gartner predicts that there will be more than 20 billion sensors connected to endpoints by 2020, but the consulting firm goes on to point out that there will also be digital twins for thousands upon thousands of these solutions, with the express purpose of monitoring their behaviour. Initially, organizations will implement these replicas, which will continue to evolve over time, improve their ability to compile and visualize accurate data, improve and respond effectively for business purposes7. Enhanced Edge ComputingEdge computing is a trend that is specifically related to the Internet of Things. It consists of placing intermediate points between connected objects.Data can be processed at these intermediate points, thus facilitating the tasks where the data has been received, thus, when the responses are sent to reduce traffic and latency. With this approach, the processing is kept closer to the endpoint rather than having the data sent to a centralized server in the cloud. Still, instead of creating a totally new architecture, cloud computing and edge computing will be developed as complementary models with solutions in the cloud, administered as a centralized service that runs not only on centralized servers but also on distributed servers and in edge devices.8. Immersive Experiences in Smart SpacesChatbots integrated into different chat and voice assistance platforms are changing the way people interact with the digital world, just like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). The combination of these technologies will dramatically change our perception of the world that surrounds us by creating smart spaces where more immersive, interactive, and automated experiences can occur for a specific group of people or for defined industry cases.9. Digital Ethics and PrivacyDigital ethics and privacy are topics that are receiving more and more attention from both private individuals as well as associations and government organizations. For good reason, people are increasingly concerned about how their personal data is being used by public and private sector organizations. Therefore, we conclude that the winning organizations will be those that proactively address these concerns and are able to earn their customers\u2019 trust. Conclusion:Technology is now at the centre of meditation for all industries. We hope 2019 will be the year of new use cases and possibilities. We will look at new changes and realize the benefits of machine learning and AI development.We have prepared a list of Technology Trends that are most likely in the opinion of our experts. ",

            "answer_text": "Smart Jacket Yep, that's a thing now. Google and Levi's are teaming up to release their first co-designed product \u2013 the world's first 'smart' trucker jacket. It looks for the most part like a regular Levi's Commuter jacket, but with a conductive fabric called \"interactive denim\" and a Bluetooth device that attaches to the sleeve. It was in 2015 that Google first announced its plan to make connected clothing like this \u2013 dubbed Project Jacquard \u2013 and the Levi's jacket will be the first garment incorporating the technology. What makes the jacket possible are tiny electronic circuits woven into the fabric, enabling a small area on the side of the sleeve \u2013 composed of 15 conductive threads \u2013 to be touch-sensitive.  Levi's\u00ae Commuter\u2122 x Jacquard by Google Trucker Jacket When paired with a small cuff link-style Bluetooth insert that slides into a hole next to this on the sleeve, touches and gestures that are detected by the interactive denim can then be transmitted to a smartphone or other connected device. So, let's say you're listening to music on your phone and want to skip to the next track. Rather than having to dig it out of your pocket, a quick slide or tap on the sleeve of your jacket is all you'd need to do. Similar gestures could also be used to adjust the volume, answer or decline incoming calls, or interact with navigation features in a GPS app. When it's released later in the year, the jacket will come with an app so that you can customize the specific functions you want the five kinds of gestures to control: slide forward, slide back, double tap, full palm press, and a circular movement. The jacket can also provide subtle vibrations so you can be alerted to incoming calls or messages. The best part is, once you take the Bluetooth dongle out of its cuff link pouch, the entirety of the jacket can be washed like regular clothing without damaging the circuitry woven into the fabric.  Project Jacquard: Making the Jacket It also means that \u2013 aside from when the fairly small Bluetooth adapter is inserted \u2013 the whole jacket is totally inconspicuous and largely indistinguishable from any other trucker jacket. Google and Levi's say the embedded conductive fibres can be weaved into garments using standard industrial looms and mills \u2013 meaning if the smart trucker jacket is a hit, we might soon start to see this kind of technology rolled out in lots of other garments. It's due for release in the US fall, and will retail for US$350. Source: Google and Levi's Are Releasing the World's First 'Smart Jacket' This Year ",

            "answer_text": "Artificial intelligence. Even a small app to giants are trying to develop AI to reduce manpower and efficient ways of handling things like data, queries, developing software etc. You may see some bots replying to your queries with some customer cares . They are actually AI units with less efficiency. You can expect a lot of bigger ones in future. Like \u201cSophia\u201d there are upcoming projects from different firms as well. You must have heard that FB introduced bots to there field which started to communicate with each other in their own language. It was exactly an year ago when they were in experimental stage, they started speaking with each other sharing what they are experiencing in the self constructive language which is indeed horrific and seeing a terminator coming in real. You can say Umbrella corporation as well. :) There are some other big things like renewable rocket propulsion source to visit other planets with high propulsive rate, automated driving(reaching destination without a driver or manual touch) which is available but manual touch is needed at some point. These are under testing stages and are expected to be the next big things in technology. Oh Yes! the augmented reality. It should be extended to the next point for education, experiments which reduces sources and neglects errors while practically implementing it. My wish is want to see a mirror like mobile phone with a bottom notch alone(keeping the essential parts at bottom). If you want to read about the FB bots, look over Facebook robots shut down after they talk to each other in language only they understand Happy reading! ",

Most public chargers charge at a rate of 22 miles per hour.\u2022 Tesla\u2019s Nevada \u201cGigafactory\u201d will be the largest building in the world, by footprint, when the final phase is completed. This is where batteries and motors for Tesla\u2019s vehicles are made, along with Tesla\u2019s energy storage products.  The Tesla Semi truck will likely be made there as well. This factory will be 100% self-powered by solar and wind generation once the building is completed. (see illustration)\u2022 In mid-January of 2019, Tesla broke ground on another Gigafactory in Shanghai, China. Eleven months later, the factory began producing Tesla Model 3s for the Chinese market. There has never been an auto factory built so quickly before.\u2022 The upcoming Tesla Roadster can go zero to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds and has a top speed over 250 mph. Tesla has announced a SpaceX option package for the Roadster which will include cold-gas thrusters that will raise acceleration, braking and cornering to levels never before seen in a road car. ",

Water stress is a truly global issue affecting over one billion people today, and an estimated 3 billion in 2020. It is a problem we need to do something about. This is our small contribution to this huge issue.  The old solution for saving water has been to restrict the flow of water. But that only works up to a point. When you're left with only a drizzle, you need a shift in technology. We looked at the problem from another perspective. Instead of restricting water, we wanted to use as much of the water coming out of the tap as possible. The issue with regular taps is that you only use a fraction of the water coming out of your faucet. It bounces of the surface of your hands or plates. Or even worse, it just passes right by and straight down the drain. See how it works Altered nozzle ",

Quantum Computing (Supercomputing)  Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. It has the potential to revolutionise how we use data and power machines. Quantum Computing operates on the quantum state of subatomic particles (for example, electrons and ions) that represent information as elements denoted as quantum bits (qubits). Considering the quantum mechanical phenomena and nowadays computer, conventional digital computers manipulate individual bits, which store information as binary 0 and 1 states. On the other hand, Quantum computers leverage quantum mechanical phenomena to manipulate information, use quantum bits, or qubits, to encode information as 0s, 1s, or both at the same time. In other ways, we can say that the Quantum computing has the ability to store a much greater amount of information in one unit, means has the potential to be faster and more energy efficient than computers we use today. 6. Internet of Things (IoT)  Considering the Best 10 technology trends, the IoT is growing rapidly, it is responsible for multi-trillion Dollar Market Growth in tech sectors. Nowadays, technology is deriving people crazy enough to crave for home automation. However, the products of IoT are expensive but people do not think twice before purchasing it in order to get smart connectivity. It is expected that the number of IoT devices that are active will grow to 10 billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025. In terms of things, IoT can be a person with a heart monitor implant, an automobile that has built-in sensors a farm animal with a biochip transponder, or man-made object that can be assigned an IP address and is able to transfer data over a network. As far as the potential of the Internet of Thing\u2019s (IoT) is concerned, it reduces the costs, saves time and opens the door for new business models needs to start with a platform perspective that includes app development and integration.

            "answer_text": "Internet of Things (IOT) One of the biggest tech trends to emerge in recent years is the Internet of Things. Simply put, the Internet of Things (abbreviated IOT) is the idea that all technological devices can be connected to the internet and to each other in an attempt to create the perfect marriage between the physical and digital worlds. How will this impact you? It depends on your industry. For example, for those who work in marketing, advertising, media or business management, IOT could provide a wealth of information on how consumers engage with products by tracking their interactions with digital devices. In turn, this data could be used to optimize marketing campaigns and user experiences. How it\u2019s affecting industries: The really cool thing about IOT is that it\u2019s not only changing the way we do business but also the business models we use to do it. For example, according to Deloitte, flexible consumption models (also known as pay-per-use models) are going become increasingly more popular across all industries as new customer data becomes available.

            "answer_text": "Here are six technology trends you should watch for in 2019, and some of the jobs that will be created by these trends. Because the time to train yourself for one of these emerging jobs is now. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Machine Learning Robotic Process Automation or RPA Internet of Things CLOUD COMPUTING/AWS SEO/SEM MARKETING  Artificial Intelligence (AI) Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in recent years, but it continues to be a trend to watch because its effects on how we live, work and play are only in the early stages. In addition, other branches of AI have developed, including Machine Learning, which we will go into below.AI refers to computers systems built to mimic human intelligence and perform tasks such as recognition of images, speech or patterns, and decision making. AI can do these tasks faster and more accurately than humans.AI is one part of what we refer to generally as automation, and automation is a hot topic because of potential job loss. Experts say automation will eliminate 73 million more jobs by 2030. However, automation is creating jobs as well as eliminating them, especially in the field of AI: Experts predict that jobs in AI will number 23 million by 2020.Jobs will be created in development, programming, testing, support, and maintenance, to name a few. Artificial Intelligence architect is one such job. Some say it will soon rival data scientist in need for skilled professionals.To learn more about potential jobs in AI, read about building a career in AI or why you should earn an AI certification. Machine Learning Machine Learning is a subset of AI. With Machine Learning, computers are programmed to learn to do something they are not programmed to do: They literally learn by discovering patterns and insights from data. In general, we have two types of learning, supervised and unsupervised.While Machine Learning is a subset of AI, we also have subsets within the domain of Machine Learning, including neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning. Each of these subsets offers an opportunity for specializing in a career field that will only grow.In addition to completing countless tasks on our behalf, it is generating jobs. Machine Learning jobs rank among the top emerging jobs on LinkedIn, with almost 2,000 job listings posted. And these jobs pay well:In 2017, the median salary for a machine learning engineer was $106,225. Machine Learning jobs include engineers, developers, researchers, and data scientists. Robotic Process Automation or RPA Like AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology that is automating jobs. RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as understanding applications, processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails.RPA automates repetitive tasks that people used to do. These are not just the menial tasks of a low-paid worker: up to 45 percent of the activities we do can be automated, including the work of financial managers, doctors, and CEOs.Like AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology that is automating jobs. RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as reading applications, processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails.RPA automates repetitive tasks that people used to do. These are not just the menial tasks of a low-paid worker: up to 45 percent of the activities we do can be automated, including the work of financial managers, doctors, and CEOs.If you\u2019re interested in pursuing a career in RPA, the Introduction to Robotic Process Automation (RPA) course is the place to start. Internet of Things Although it sounds like a game you\u2019d play on your smartphone, the Internet of Things (IoT) is the future. Many \u201cthings\u201d are now being built with WiFi connectivity, meaning they can be connected to the Internet\u2014and to each other. Hence, the Internet of Things, or IoT.IoT enables devices, home appliances, cars and much more to be connected to and exchange data over the Internet. And we\u2019re only in the beginning stages of IoT: The number of IoT devices reached 8.4 billion in 2017 is and expected to reach 30 billion devices by 2020.CLOUD COMPUTING/AWS Cloud computing jobs are on the rise because more and more companies are switching from the classical server infrastructure to cloud solutions. According to Gartner, the market for public cloud services is projected to grow by 17.3 3% in 2019.Amazon Web Services is one of these cloud platforms, featuring content delivery, database storage, networking, and more\u2013over 50 services in total. Since it is currently the biggest platform, we\u2019ll highlight some specific facts about AWS in this section.AWS specialists are usually engineers, cloud architects, or system administrators. IT professionals who are AWS-certified earn more than their non-certified counterparts. It's one of the most profitable skills an IT employee can learn to level up their tech career, as AWS specialists earn an average of $113,000.SEO/SEM MARKETING Employers are looking for people with digital marketing skills to improve their company\u2019s web presence and visibility. This is one of the tech skills in demand for obvious reasons: more site visits mean more conversions, customers, and revenue.If you\u2019re data-minded, SEO/SEM may be a great fit, since the role involves constant testing, measuring, and experimenting to see what works and make changes based on observations/metrics/KPIs.Digital marketing is another skill that can benefit you if you decide to start your own business in the future. You can leverage SEO skills to market yourself, find freelancing clients, start a tech/personal blog, and build a brand.Quick facts about SEO/SEM as a career: The top five organic search results get over 75% of the clicks. Only 22% of businesses report being satisfied with their conversion rates.Web developers who learn SEO/SEM can offer bundled services: not only building the websites, but optimizing and marketing them.Although technologies are emerging and evolving all around us, these six domains offer promising career potential now and for the foreseeable future. And all six are suffering from a shortage of skilled workers, meaning the time is right for you to choose one, get trained, and get on board at the early stages of the technology, positioning you for success now and in the future.Read More about the Latest Trending Technologies ",

            "answer_text": "We are admirers of the 4th Industrial Revolution. The time when technology is evolving faster than ever. Today's innovation and technology is going to shape tomorrow's world. As time is changing and the population is growing rapidly, we are facing major issues with climate change, and have to find the solution for sustainability in the future. For that technology plays an important role in finding solutions to all the challenges our world faces today. Here I am going to list the latest breakthrough innovation that is expected to radically impact the global social and economic order. #1 Collaborative Telepresence Have you ever imagined a video conference where you not only feel like you\u2019re in the same room as the other attendees, you can actually feel one another\u2019s touch?  This is now possible with a mix of Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (AR), 5G networks and advanced sensors. Business people, while being in different locations, can physically exchange handshakes, and medical practitioners are able to work remotely with patients as though they are in the same room. #2 Bioplastics for a Circular Economy Plastic has become an environmental concern as less than 15% of the world\u2019s plastic is recycled, with the rest incinerated, abandoned or sent to landfill. Biodegradable plastic offers a solution, but lacks the strength of conventional materials . A breakthrough idea promotes the circular economy by using cellulose or lignin from plant waste, which increases material strength without using crops that could otherwise be used for food. #3 Extended Reality(XR) Extended Reality (XR) is a catch-all term that covers many new and rising technologies being used to create more immersive digital experiences and More specifically, it refers to virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Virtual reality (VR) provides a totally digitally immersive experience where you enter a computer-generated world using headsets that blend out the real world. Augmented reality (AR) overlays digital objects onto the real world via smartphone screens or displays (think Snapchat filters). Mixed reality (MR) is an extension of AR, which means users can interact with digital objects placed in the real world (think to play a holographic piano that you have placed into your room via an AR headset). From 2020 businesses get to grips with the wealth of exciting possibilities offered by both current forms of XR. Virtual and augmented reality will become increasingly prevalent for training and simulation, as well as offering new different ways to interact with customers. See How is aviation using Extended Reality (XR) technologies  #4 5G Data Network 2020 is going to be a great year for internet users as 5G is going to be launched. The 5th generation of mobile internet connectivity is going to give us super-fast download and upload speeds as well as more stable connections.  While 5G mobile data networks became available for the first time in 2019, they were quite expensive and limited to functioning in confined areas or major cities. 2020 is likely to be the year when 5G really starts to fly, with more affordable data plans as well as greatly improved coverage, meaning that everyone can join in the fun #5 Social Robots Today\u2019s robots can recognise voices, faces and emotions, interpret speech patterns and gestures, and even make eye contact. Droid friends and assistants are becoming part of everyday life, and are being used increasingly to care of the elderly, educate children and undertake all sorts of tasks in between.  #6 Metalenses The lenses used by mobile phones, computers and other electronic devices smaller are beyond its capabilities of traditional glass cutting and glass carving techniques. But advances in physics have led to miniaturized, lighter alternatives to established lenses, called metalenses which is easy to fabricate and cost-effective. These tiny, thin, flat lenses could replace existing bulky glass lenses and allow further miniaturization in sensors and medical imaging devices.  #7 Advanced food tracking and packaging Nearly 600 million people eat contaminated food each year and it\u2019s essential to locate the source of an outbreak immediately. What used to take days or even weeks to trace can now be tracked in minutes, using blockchain technology to monitor every step of a food item\u2019s progress through the supply chain. Meanwhile, the sensors in packaging can indicate when food is about to spoil, reducing the need to waste whole batches once an expiry date is reached. See how blockchain will be helpful in tracking food sources.  Image Source Hope you find this useful! ",

            "answer_text": "The world today is screaming over Blockchain. It has spread like a wildfire over the internet. Not only it is replacing the hard currency but has revolutionized the online transaction method. Blockchain is basically a database. Rather, it\u2019s a chain of a database which is distributed all over the globe hosted by various computers which are also known as a peer-to-peer framework. There\u2019s no one server or a person who is controlling this and that\u2019s why we have Distributed Global De-Centralized Database. Blockchain is a way to track the ownership of the digital assets. When the data is recorded in a given block, it cannot be changed without altering all the other blocks. And this requires a consensus of the network majority. We live in a digital age and therefore a variety of digital currencies and means of exchanges in different parts of the world makes a lot of sense. In one way Blockchain is a tampered proof database that stores digital assets without any authority. It has created the backbone of a new type of internet in which the information is distributed but not copied. The running of various collaborated nodes makes the Blockchain system special as there\u2019d be a copy of databases on every node and establishes a consensus about its contents to every node. Due to this, it is extremely difficult to meddle with the data without others finding out. Therefore, this boosts the confidence in the database and its contents and increases the integrity. The sudden boom in Blockchain technology is due to its vast uses in various fields and verticals. The problem of tracking and managing expenditures can be resolved by this technology by reducing data inaccuracies, improving operations of various enterprise application and creating transparency in expenditure. Blockchain is being used extensively in the following vertical: Fund AdministrationInformation ServiceReal EstateBankingLegalNot only this, many entrepreneurs are already adopting the new Blockchain technology in their work system. In the field of supply chain management, Blockchain not only offers benefits of traceability and cost-effectiveness but also brings a new level of transparency in B2B ecosystem. Russia has already taken the initiative to test the effectiveness of Blockchain in local elections which if becomes success will significantly diminish the electoral fraud. Although Blockchain technology revolution is underway and many sectors have adopted it, but, there are still few challenges to it. Most of the entrepreneur will not just buy into the idea and there will be resistance from peers and other gatekeepers too. Poor education is also one of the challenges. People are still unaware of this technology. Blockchain technology is still evolving and every knowledge about it is very important. Although it has huge benefits we should not look over the limitations and drawbacks. If the technology goes around really well then soon the Blockchain technology is going to transform the global internet infrastructure and will change everyone\u2019s perception about the use of technology.

OK it may have to park while it waits but it need not park near a pickup or drop-off point.

After a pilot in Rotterdam, the smog free project is coming to China. The project consists of two parts. First, a 7m tall tower sucks up polluted air, and cleans it at a nano-level. Second, the carbon from smog particles is turned into diamonds.  The towers suck up polluted air, and clean it, releasing it back into parks and playgrounds. And according to a study, these areas are 70-75% cleaner than the rest of the city. The other aspect of the project will see the captured smog transformed into diamonds. 32% of Beijing\u2019s smog is carbon, which under 30 minutes of pressure can be turned into diamonds. The money raised by jewellery made with these diamonds will go towards supporting the development and building more Smog Free towers. For video you can click on this link World Economic Forum ",

            "answer_text": "Lets take into account some of the fossil fuel  Oil Globally, we currently consume the equivalent of over 11 billion tonnes of oil from fossil fuels every year. Crude oil reserves are vanishing at a rate of more than 4 billion tonnes a year \u2013 so if we carry on as we are, our known oil deposits could run out in just over 53 years. Gas If we increase gas production to fill the energy gap left by oil, our known gas reserves only give us just 52 years left. In world where almost all its fuel is being depleted, conservation of natural resources has become a necessity in today\u2019s world, especially in the field of renewable technology. In an automobile, maximum energy is lost during deceleration or braking. This problem has been resolved with the introduction of regenerative braking. It is an approach to recover or restore the energy lost while braking.  The Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) is a type of regenerative braking system which has the capability to store and reuse the lost energy. It (KERS) is a system which first stores the kinetic energy into the form of useful energy and recovers back as per requirement. In other words KERS is a collection of parts which stores some of the kinetic energy of a vehicle under deceleration and then releases this stored energy back into the drive train of the vehicle. Kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS) store energy when the vehicle is braking and return it when accelerating. CLICK ON LINK FOR MORE DETAIL- Kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) ",

            "answer_text": "Undoubtedly, blockchain technology has allowed everyone to talk about cryptocurrencies and their actual use cases. For this reason, the blockchain is the one that makes it possible to be more disruptive than the internet, perhaps, and is the technology with the greatest tendency at the moment where others such as AI, Robotics, Autonomous vehicles and the internet of things have joined, which finally of one or the other way they all come together. Blockchain technology will be for the next two years that everyone will see, 'touch' and know in some direct and indirect way. To this adds the gaming sector that now joins the blockchain and in the next two years has a guaranteed growth of trillions of dollars annually along with the development of decentralized applications that will flood the market to monetize the use of smartphones, apps, games, etc. That is why cases like FLETA, with its payment gateway and interoperability between chains for the friendly development and low cost of DApps, ETHEREUM 2.0 migrating to a less energy-intensive protocol to regain control of the market dominated by TRON in DAPPS will be vital next to the Development of other Layer 2 solutions such as MATIC Network that exploit the capacity of ETH but improve its scalability, even at levels lower than FLETA but much higher than ETH. In conclusion, we talk about 30 blockchain platforms that allow smart contracts today and that in the future many more will be deployed safely to the demand for real use cases that we already begin to see every day worldwide.

It is made with a specific goal in mind \u2013 to entertain people and make them experience virtual reality while on the go. With Gear VR, you can play games, watch movies, and do all sorts of stuff with your phone in 3D, while your head movement is tracked in virtual world. It was released few weeks ago by Samsung and Oculus, and is already considered a best seller by every retailer on the market. It works as a headset that you strap around your head, just like ski goggles. Find a compatible Samsung phone, open the front cover of the Gear VR, push your phone inside till you hear a click, and close the cover. Hoverboards: \u201cSelf-balancing scooters\u201d are much smaller and lighter than Segways. The average weight of hoverboards varies between 20-25 pounds, and they are small enough to stow away in a backpack or locker. If you\u2019re within a short distance between destinations and don\u2019t feel the need to walk or drive, no problem. Your hoverboard can go up to 10 mph and travel between 10-15 miles per charge. Self-balancing boards have a modern or futuristic design, making them more appealing than the traditional skateboard.  ",

Kotlin is a super new programming language built by JetBrains, which also coincidentally develops the JetBrains IDE that Android Studio \u2014 Google's official developer tool \u2014 is based on. Like Java, which is the default language for Android development, Kotlin is a language that runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), and it's already possible to use Kotlin and many other JVM languages for Android development. Android doesn\u2019t use the JVM exactly, but the Java roots are strong, and Kotlin\u2019s interoperability with Java have made it a popular choice for developers. Official Google support will be a huge boost for the nascent language, however, and will presumably make working with Kotlin on Android a lot more natural. ",

The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object. 3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine. 3D printing enables you to produce complex shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods.
