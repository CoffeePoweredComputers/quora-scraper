            "answer_text": " Though this is an old post, this would answer your query.Before I\u2019ve even typed a word of this article, I can guarantee that a cynical someone, somewhere will have read the title and thought \u201cthe shiny Apple logo.\u201d It\u2019s incredible the number of trolls/haters/nerds \u2013 call them what you will \u2013 that think that absolutely everyone who buys an iPhone is doing it because it has Apple\u2019s famous branding on it. And that they should have bought some supercharged Android device instead. Because, obviously, Android is the only choice for someone with a brain. With that logic, 37 million hypnotized Apple fanatics mindlessly purchased iOS powered smartphones last quarter. Let\u2019s conveniently forget the huge portion of those who switched allegiance from Android \u2013 clearly, they didn\u2019t know what to do with their previous phones. Some, more than likely,  ended up staring at it blankly and grunting like primates in confusion. While others attempted using it as a sandwich filling. Yes, those Android phones are just that complicated. You only have to hang around tech blogs for a day to realize the vast number of \u201cgeeks\u201d who genuinely believe that only stupid people buy iPhones. Now, let\u2019s pretend that \u2013 just for a second \u2013 the iPhone has something to offer. There has to be something about it that keeps people coming back for more. There\u2019s a reason that it has more loyal customers than any other manufacturer. So, what is it? 1. CameraThe latest and greatest iPhone yet has the best camera ever seen on a smartphone. The results are incredible. Its backlit sensor ensure that the 8MP snapper captures great quality images. In fact, if you\u2019ve got an iPhone 4S you probably don\u2019t need a regular point-and-shoot. It may have some pretty close rivals in daylight, outdoors. But, indoors and in low light conditions it shines brighter than anything I\u2019ve seen.2. Ease of UseiOS is intuitively easy to use. It\u2019s a software that requires no explaining or tutorials. Since all the programs are right there on the home screen, the only thing that you have to discover is what the physical buttons do. Even my daughter could figure that out before she turned two.3. \u201cIt just works\u201dI know. It\u2019s a lame Apple-ism, but that doesn\u2019t make it untrue. It really does work, pretty much all the time. Think about installing apps for a second. Back in the olden days, installing programs on to a computer usually meant having to reboot. The same can be said of BlackBerry. My Bold 9700 running OS6 still asks me to restart the phone every time I install an update or download a new app. My iPhone? Hit \u201cbuy\u201d and it installs and is ready to work as soon as it\u2019s done downloading.Syncing is also breeze, whether you do it via iCloud backup, or using iTunes on your Mac/PC. It kind of just takes care of everything for you. This great feature is mostly down to Apple\u2019s ecosystem. Having designed all the software and hardware to run together, and tie them together in iCloud, or iTunes, means you can have one harmonious network of iDevices without stress.4. ReliabilityApart from the infrequent and random signal loss, or battery performance issues that occur, the iPhone has a very good success rate. Dropped calls \u2013 even on the antennagate-ridden iPhone 4 were still below 1% on AT&T. Battery lasts a day, and you rarely get major software performance issues. Crashing happens sometimes, but that\u2019s usually down to a third party app. In fact, the last time my iPhone crashed was when I was running a beta version of iOS 5 in the first week after beta 1 was launched.5. App Store/Developer SupportThere are hundreds of thousands of apps in the App Store. All of them have to meet Apple\u2019s guidelines, all of them vetted and checked by Cupertino staff. Granted, the odd slippery eel gets through the net every once in a while, but no where near the number that gets in to any of its competitors\u2019 markets. Most great apps find their way on to iPhone first, and get updates pretty quickly if there are any issues.And then there's Siri.   Images - Google Images Source - What makes the iPhone so special? ",

            "answer_text": "I do not love iPhones at all. Yeah, I know I have offended hundreds of people right now. People who talk that Apple phones have strong case, performance and design have overlooked the ever growing android market. Though am not an ardent fan of Android as well, but it is very good. Few things that I really like of iPhones are:1. The after sale service till costumer satisfaction2. The colors3. Nice performance deliver on low RAM consumption (zero lags, but of what use when you cannot install numerous heavy apps) To say that Apple offers nice strong cases have never used an HTC make. The HTC's are truly strong in metal power. In my initial days, I used to have Sensation XE. The case had a vibrant white look with a metal case rounded off at its edges. Believe me with this one, I was driving my bike at an speed of 70 kmph. Suddenly I came across a pothole and the phone that was in my shirts pocket flew away. The phone dragged the ground for around 25 metres. Although, the screen broke (as gorilla glass was in initial phases those days) but the whole body was intact (damn metal case). Few days back my brother used to hold an iPhone 4s. He always complained to me that he cannot play good graphic games. He really liked playing Real Racing 3, Fifa 14, Mortal Combat 3 and other graphic and RAM hungry apps. So he used to play those games on my Xperia ZL (yeah, I sold the broken HTC). He had severe battery shortage. The battery juice was not worth for a single day. One day I saw him struggling with my laptop, when suddenly he shouted what is so wrong with your laptop. I asked what happened, and he told me he cannot sync songs. I laughed. I told him these shit things are not case with android. He asked how. I simply connected the USB, copied the sung and played to him (bro was like, fuck what the hell is wrong with Apple). He kept complaining of the so small sized screens. Slowly the snappy touch too started fading away. By this time he left for Honk Kong (Remember, my brother, though not a tech geek, but loves iPhone a lot). He heard of new franchisee One Plus. I told him everything as my roommate had bought one. Since then there is no seeing back. He is very much happy with Android. Yeah, he complains that while opening apps why the hell ads pop up (the only most irritating thing in android). He has customized interface, lot of gaming apps in single phone, a nice battery with juice, a decent look (though not a metal case), a decent front and rear camera and lot of cases to choose from. All this at approx 1/3 of the price of an Apple phone. People who say it is a style statement, pity them, they need a psychiatrist. In run to ape others they have stopped making wise decisions. Would soon be buying HTC M9+. I guess nowhere it is short of Apple phone. Few things I dislike a lot:1. Very less ROM (pay too much for more ROM)2. No SD cards3. If you forgot your charger, try POKER face ( it still won't charge your phone)4. No water proofing or rugged5. No multiple SIMs Apple fans please, their phones are too damn overpriced. Their revenue is not because they are best but because one of a kind in their segment and no price fights (and they know people will buy their phones even if they have to sell their kidneys too). ",
