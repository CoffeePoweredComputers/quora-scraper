            "answer_text": " Image : Credit No, the iPhone XR will not support 5G. No existing iPhones will be able to use the 5G network. In fact, it looks like even the 2019 iPhone won't be able to use the 5G network. However, the current iPhone XS and XS Max offer Gigabit LTE. If your carrier supports Gigabit LTE you could take advantage of a faster connection and your phone should be better able to find and maintain the connection when the signal is weak. Nevertheless. The iPhone XR will definitely not have Gigabit speeds. Apple has added 4\u00d74 MIMO to its iPhone XS line of phones. This technology has been available on Android handsets for quite some time, and it\u2019s nice seeing Apple finally joining the club. The outgoing iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, and even the upcoming iPhone XR only include 2\u00d72 MIMO. This means you, unfortunately, won\u2019t see these improvements, even in the upcoming iPhone XR, unless you have the iPhone XS or XS Max. Aside from 4\u00d74 MIMO, the new iPhone XS and XS Max also gain support for QAM and LAA, which are other radio technologies that will help improve speed and range on the new phones.  Hope this explanation helps, OKportal Technology ",

Apple is rumored to be introducing its first 5G phone in the fall of 2020. As this is being written, 5G is just not that big a deal. It is unavailable to about 90% of cell phone users, and even those to whom it is available are finding it eats up their data plan so fast, it is not worth it. The final specification for 5G also has not been determined (although it is very close). No one needs to make buying decisions for a new smart phone based on whether or not it supports 5G for the next 2\u20133 years. ",
