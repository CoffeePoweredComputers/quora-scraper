            "answer_text": "Maui traffic is pretty bad, particularly during the busier tourist seasons (it\u2019s always busy here but Christmas/New Year\u2019s and holidays are even busier), and particularly during morning and evening rush hour, as one would expect. There are also some terrible bottlenecks, such as the area between Paia and Kahului on the Paia side. This road is one lane each way in this spot, and a lot of people are going both ways. Also the road from Kihei/Wailuku to Lahaina can be monstrously congested although they recently completed a bypass highway that allows people to miss some of the traffic that people on the regular highway will encounter as they enter Lahaina heading north. I remember one time last year when there was a monk seal in the middle of the road on the highway heading to Lahaina. It is one lane each way here, so literally hundreds of people had to sit in traffic for (I think) at least an hour until a wildlife official could come and safely relocate the seal. When there is only one road to get somewhere, and something happens on that road, some times you just can\u2019t go to that place right now. This same road has been closed for fire and storm surge at various times in the past. For this reason, I do not recommend people take jobs that are in Lahaina and plan to commute from other areas such as Kihei and Kahului, although I know a lot of people who do make this commute. ",
