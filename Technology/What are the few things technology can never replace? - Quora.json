            "answer_text": "Technology can't replace the clothes we are wearing, the food we eat, etc. The basic things related to life can't be replaced by technology although they can be modified a bit. For example, most of the clothes we wear are machine made whereas earlier (before technological) development they were hand made. Our feelings can't be replaced by technology. No matter how much advancement happens in technology, our moms will always be worried if we ate properly or not. Technology is just a way of making life more luxurious, it can add many things in our life but can't replace much. ",

            "answer_text": "I object to the \"few\" in the question. Technology per se can replace almost nothing! Even simple physical objects cannot be replaced by technology, let alone complex things like my dog, not to mention non-physical things like friendship or respect. In fact, the question, IMHO would be better phrased as  What are the few things technology can replace? Of course, there are unlimited things in this list as well, like newspapers, books, board games, and so on, but pick a random thing and I think the probability that technology can replace it is zero....
