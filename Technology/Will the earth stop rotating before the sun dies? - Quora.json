            "answer_text": "No, the Earth will not stop rotating before the Sun either engulfs the Earth or turns into a white dwarf. The Moon is slowing the Earth's rotation down, but it cannot stop the Earth from rotating entirely as a result of the conservation of angular momentum and the nature of the transfer of angular momentum from the Earth to the Moon. To stop the Earth from spinning or to get it spinning in the opposite direction, the Earth would have to be hit by a separate object going against the spin of the Earth. ",
