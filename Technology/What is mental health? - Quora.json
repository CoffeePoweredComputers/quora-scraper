            "answer_text": "Ooh, cool question! I see some rather thoroughly researched answers already here, so I'm going to go off the cuff, and trust that you can use the previous answers if you want something cite-able. I think mental health has a lot to do with response flexibility\u2014-that is, being able to make intentional decisions about how to engage challenging situations or emotions. That, in turn, requires a reasonable degree of self-awareness\u2014I need to be able to notice when I'm getting overwhelmed, and take steps to manage my own intensity; and I need to be able to recognize when I am in full-on, self-protective survival mode, and it is time to take a break. It also requires me to know, and be able to act in consistency with, my own values. If I'm going to respond intentionally, I need some way of directing that response; and I need a way to assess whether it was what I intended\u2014-did it get the result I wanted? Did it prioritize the things that matter to me? And\u2014-am I able to hold myself accountable, without beating up in myself? Can I give myself credit, where credit is due? I also think mental health requires the ability to relate safely and effectively with others. That doesn't mean I'm responsible for \u201cmaking\u201d others treat me in safe and non-violent ways\u2014-it does mean that I'm responsible for treating others in safe and non-violent ways. It also means that I am able to tune into, and trust, my emotional and embodied responses to people. It means I can understand and voice the boundaries that help me to feel safe, and respect those from others. And it means that I'm able to maintain awareness of, and access to, the people and resources that can help me stay safe. That, of course, requires that I be able to trust people who are trustworthy, be able to connect with them in ways that we both agree to and enjoy/benefit from, and find ways of supporting both of our needs in balanced ways. I would also say that mental wellness requires the effective integration of hurt, harm, trauma, or/and relational injury. I don't think that \u201cintegration\u201d means magical impermeability, never feeling distress over distressing things, or not ever needing to work on something again. I do think it means cultivating a world- and self-view that doesn't blame me for other people\u2019s actions, finding effective ways to respond to and diminish intensity and overwhelm, and being able to engage in my daily life, without being perpetually hijacked by it. And: I think mental health and wellness is a process, not a product, which is why you won't find a whole heck of a lot of people who can do everything on that list with perfect consistency! I feel like those are the aspirational goals that I tend to work from\u2014-with the understanding that we won't get all the way there, because there is no \u201cthere,\u201d there. We and our lives are in constant flux and change, so\u2014-responsiveness to that is also going to have to change over time. Also, I'm not going to go way into it, because it isn't what you asked\u2014-but I do believe there's an extent to which mental health depends on people\u2019s basic needs being met. Harm reduction is a thing; safety planning is a thing; keeping your head down and getting out alive is a thing. Those are important, because survival is important. And: survival is not the same thing as living well. A prerequisite for everyone being mentally healthy emphatically is: everyone having food to eat, everyone having a safe place to sleep, everyone being able to access medical care, everyone being free to exist safely in the world as themself. Mental wellness is a social and familial imperative, as well as an individual one. ",
