            "answer_text": "Q: How can military aircraft shoot down satellites?A: Fly fast. Fly precisely. Turn at the right places. Release missile. Return to base. Feed pilot. It\u2019s about being in an exact place, at an exact time, at an exact speed and heading. Everyday navigation for all pilots, if slightly faster.  In the 1960s I saw a comic in our local paper about exactly that. The launch platform for that Sat-Killer was an F-4. In the strip it was just another weekend day at the Air National Guard with a good story to take home. Wish I could remember the name of the strip, as the topic comes up sometimes and I\u2019d love to find it. It ran Daily & Sunday. I think the protagonist was a semi-retired pilot and his wife, living on an orange tree farm in Florida. He was active as a pilot in the Florida Air National Guard, but most of his conflicts were from the antics of his farm animals and wilder neighbors. Many times he was tormented by relatives visiting from New England who never showed much appreciation for his hospitality. Had the vibe that this was the author\u2019s actual life with small twists to fit the medium. I recall another Daily/Sunday strip about Air Force pilots, but I don\u2019t think that was it. ",

            "answer_text": "A comment to add to John Wayne Jones excellent answer; the author Tom Clancy (RIP) was something of an expert on the weapons of NATO and the (former) Warsaw Pact, and in one of his books - Red Storm Rising (if I recall correctly) - the USAF actually use a couple of anti-satellite missiles. In the book the (female) pilot basically rockets almost straight up then performs the \u201cloft\u201d, pulling max G\u2019 s and pointing her bird straight down to get as far away as possible. Not from fear of the explosion or shrapnel from the satellite, but from the chance that the largely untested A-Sat missile might choose the wrong moment to explode and take her out instead of the satellite. Of course, that's just a novel and we'll never know for sure the A-Sat capabilities because with a moretoreum on satellite killing missiles, the US would have surely ceased testing immediately. Surely. ",
