            "answer_text": "His base and their refusal to accept anything that doesn\u2019t agree with their worldview. While many Americans go through life taking the easy way out of anything, his base has taken this to a new level. Let me give an example. Trump has made statements on dozens of occasions that were televised and seen by people present in the audience. A few days later he will reverse his decision. His base will call that fake news, primarily because they don\u2019t want it to be true. While neither Republicans or Democrats are paragons of virtue, the Trump base takes this to a new level. Any single word in a sentence that the base doesn\u2019t like will be seized upon as an assault on the President. This also occurs on some media sites where if you rebut an obvious lie, they will downvote your answer claiming it violates their policy. Trump will eventually face consequences. Many of his aids, acting on his behalf have committed crimes. Many of them have gone to jail. People like Judge Cavanagh will eventually be investigated, and people who see obvious corruption, in this administration OR ANY FUTURE administration, will hesitate to report it fearing that they too will be targeted and fired in violation of the laws that are often ignored. Our soldiers, who often depend on their military leaders to do the right thing will now question them. Our soldiers will never again be able to trust friendly soldiers from other countries because they will remember how we betrayed the Kurds (and the Montagnards and others). Our Allies will be reluctant to ever enter a deal with us because we can elect a new President, who will toss them out. I\u2019m surprised the Cubans haven\u2019t asked to renegotiate the deal on Gitmo. The next Democratic President will have the same options that the Republicans and Trump\u2019s base have given him. Think about how many things they can reverse if they don\u2019t have to follow the laws. Picture if their base gets control of both houses. What would happen to the 2nd Amendment (which is the usual base trigger). So, he will get away with it briefly. Whether for another nine months or four years. Then it will get interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "It helps enormously that Moscow Mitch is the real power behind the throne. Remember, he held up Merrick Garland's supreme court nomination for 18 months in order to allow for the next president to appoint a conservative. McConnell did not do so because, like the deluded evangelicals believe, Roe v Wade would be rescinded, but to further advance the legal grab of wealth that has been happening. Don't believe me? Look at the 5-4 decisions that have been handed down in the last year. Every single time, the Court has voted against individual rights in favor of its opposite. While the circus that is the trump presidency distracts us all, many laws have been rescinded that were designed to protect people or land from the rape of corporations. By stonewalling every inquiry of corruption, by partaking in that corruption, the majority Senate has managed to deflect any consequences any other politician would have faced. The other huge factor in his continued ability to avoid consequences is the propaganda machine that pumps up his base with false information and makes them disbelieve anything that is reported by the mainstream press. And because his base is so propagandized, the truth is tainted and faces an uphill climb to win out. Every time I think that \u2018finally, this will topple him,\u2019 I am wrong. Even with this present crisis, Covid-19, i see signs that the propaganda machine is changing black into white. So, with these two powerful legs, trump stands upright against all odds. ",
