            "answer_text": "I think it will - and I also think it is a good thing. Competition - as long as it follows basic rules - benefits with customers and in our case - with the technology. Historically when Intel had full control over the PC market without any clear competition it was \u201cfalling asleep\u201d. The rivalry between AMD and Intel that taking place during the last 2 years have huge benefits with the customers - getting more products at lower prices. Within the 2 companies it drivers toward more aggressive executions, better innovation and new concepts. ",

It\u2019s what makes AMD and Nvidia work to improve their respective products. Intel has gotten fat and lazy (think Rocky III before he got a whuppin\u2019 from Clubber Lang). ",
