            "answer_text": "Never, mathematics is over 3,000 years old and will be going strong when the English language, and all other natural languages are but a distant memory. Scientists were replaced by AI a couple of decades ago which is why you have scientists using computer programs that they couldn\u2019t write, written by engineers and now when the AI was severely sublimated for public use which means that it is not an open/public subject at the universities (just like Nuclear Physics). This was due to people in the academy being browbeaten by people in the government that are unable to count to twenty with their shoes off. Today, machine intelligence uses neural nets, which are watered down DAGS (directed acyclic graphs). Mention graph theory and people in the psychology department look nervous. Very nervous. Of course they always look nervous. Sublimation isn\u2019t the same thing as an outright ban, it just means that there are no courses taught on the subject. This has the effect of no one in the academy being able to work in a subject. Something on the order of 98% of the intelligence community thinks that mathematics is some sort of secret and dark cipher which has to be encrypted and decrypted by computer. The leading expert in differential equations in the world was arrested by Sky Marshalls and detained for doing mathematics on an airplane. The power of an AI application is never as great as the same application written by hand by software engineers. The power of any computer application can never be more than about 1/7 that of a mathematician because only about 1/7 of mathematics is embedded in logic. That\u2019s why African refugees living in tent cities can do some things faster than any computer can do. Because, unlike most Americans high school students, they know calculus. ",
