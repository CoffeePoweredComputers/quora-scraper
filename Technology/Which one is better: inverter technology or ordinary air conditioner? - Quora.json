            "answer_text": "In terms of energy consumption - Split > Window > Inverter Split > Inverter Window In terms of cooling efficiency - Inverter Split > Split >= Inverter Window > Window To elucidate further, an inverter air conditioner is better suited for one\u2019s home if the duration for which the air conditioner would be in operation is greater than four hours per day. In this scenario, one would be able to recover the extra initial cost of an inverter air conditioner over a regular, non inverter one in two to three years. For lesser usage times, a regular, non split 3 star or higher rating air conditioner would be a more suitable choice. Okay, I have a confession to make.. (I have mentioned the confession in the comments section of this answer.)  Detailed Answer:- Having purchased an air conditioner for my home just a few hours ago after thorough research and analysis over a period of nine days, I would state that when it comes to a buying an air conditioner, there are particularly two factors one needs to pay utmost attention to. They are:- Capacity of the air conditionerFor a room of area between 120 to 160 square feet, 1 ton air conditioner will sufficiently cool the room.For a room of area between 160 to 200 square feet, one should go for a 1.5 ton air conditioner for adequate cooling.For a room of area between 200 to 260 square feet, a 2 ton air conditioner would meet all your room cooling needs.In context with the above, it is imperative to note that if the air conditioner is set in an environment where direct sunlight falls on it or in the room in which the air conditioner is to be installed, its cooling efficiency reduces. In such scenarios, we have determined that it is best to decide on an air conditioner with slightly higher capacity. For instance, if a room which would have been cooled well by a 1 ton air conditioner, a slightly higher 1.2 ton air conditioner would impart the best service if the air conditioner and room faces direct sunlight. Essential Specifications/QualitiesIs fitted with a fast spinning, high RPM value induction motor is installed in the air conditioner. Faster spin speeds facilitate powerful cooling and achieves lower temperature in lesser time.Is rated 3 stars or higher in the energy efficiency rating. The higher the energy efficiency rating of an air conditioner, the lesser would be its power consumption, thus lesser electricity bills.Is manufactured by a reliable brand, the replacement parts and after-sales service of which is easily available and at a reasonable price. Well, I myself was looking to buy an air conditioner for my home since the past nine days, and as a potential buyer, it was very essential for me to get answers to questions like - What should I look for when buying an air conditioner.Which type of air conditioner among Window and Split should I buy.What capacity of air conditioner should I buy as per my use.Should I go with an inverter air conditioner over a regular split one. What benefits or drawbacks do inverter air conditioners offer. What difference would I see in energy consumption between the two types.Unfortunately, most of the answers here focus primarily on the product and the features that are on offer. (No offence). I had almost lost all hope to find a satisfactory answer. But then\u2026(More about it in the comments section) Good day. Take care. ",

            "answer_text": "Benefits of inverter AC are :- At least 30% - 50% cheaper to run as it consumes less powerFar quicker to achieve desired temperatureMuch quieterNo temperature fluctuations, maximising comfort levelLower starting current compared with non inverter air conditioningIt will be worth investing in an inverter air conditioning if you use your air conditioning almost all year round especially for heating or cooling your room /house. For most of the time / places inverter AC is more efficient and better choice though it is expensive. The payback period for additional cost (about 150 USD or INR 10,000) is between 6 months to 2 years depending on usage. In general, if you\u2019re using your AC less than 2\u20133 hours a day & not more than 3~4 months / year, you should buy normal AC (fixed speed compressor type). Inverter AC are more efficient in longer duration operation (at part load, as in the beginning load is higher). ",
