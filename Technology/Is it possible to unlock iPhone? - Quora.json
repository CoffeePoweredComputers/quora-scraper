            "answer_text": "You haven't specified what country you're in, but I'll assume it's the U.S. Your own? Sure. Someone else's? Mostly no, although what crime you're guilty of depends on the circumstances. Knowingly taking possession of something stolen is a crime. So if you have a stolen iPhone (either that you stole or bought) and you're trying to break into it, you're 100% hosed. Breaking into someone else's phone to spy on them is covered by invasion of privacy, although I believe this is moderated by circumstances and your relation to the person. If you're their parent or guardian and they're still a minor, you have a legal right to monitor their phone without their consent. It's not necessarily good or wise parenting, but you can do it. If you're married to the person, I suspect it's mitigated by the fact that spouses tend to invade each other's privacy just by being married. But I'm not a lawyer, so I'm not sure of the precise demarcation. In any other case, it's most definitely illegal. It's the same as hacking into web site accounts on a computer. ",

            "answer_text": "Is it possible to unlock an Apple iPhone? Not only is it possible, but about a billion people have done it, and most continue to do it on a daily basis. It\u2019s extremely easy. My phone unlocks as soon as I pick it up, because I have Face ID. My previous iPhone unlocked only after I pressed the Touch ID sensor, and my first iPhone unlocked only when I entered my PIN. Some iPhone owners choose to turn off auto-locking, so their phones are never locked. Hope this helps. ",
