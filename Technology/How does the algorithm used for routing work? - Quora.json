            "answer_text": "There are several algorithms in play that you really need to understand. The first of these is the Longest prefix match. This is what is used at forwarding time. If this seems too complicated at first, start with the Radix tree and think about how to extend it for partial results. The next algorithm that's of major import is Dijkstra's algorithm (SPF). After you grok both of these, and you're ready to get weird, then it's time to read Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). ",
