            "answer_text": "Here are a few that I am following. Most of them will have an impact in the next 2-3 years. Nanowire Lithium-ion Batteries: These charge faster and have about 25% greater capacity. It will allow portable devices to get smaller or run for longer. Brain-computer Interfaces: The devices will be able to turn thoughts into electronic signals. Mostly these devices will be used to allow the severely disabled to move things like wheelchairs or computer pointers, but the technology will eventually allow for things like hands free driving, cybernetic implants and improved MMI. Synthetic Biology: This is the creation of custom organisms. Right now most efforts are focused on nano-technology scale organisms designed to do things like detect illnesses, remove cholesterol or improve healing. Other discussions are about things like custom predators to wipe out invasive species. 3D Printing: This is starting to take off beyond standard prototype making. The addition of new materials and less expensive printers are starting to change entire industries. New advances are being made into 3D printing of organs, but that is probably a decade or so out. Doctors are however custom printing hip joints and prosthetics today. ",
