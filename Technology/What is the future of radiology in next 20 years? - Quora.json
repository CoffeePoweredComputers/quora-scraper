            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sorry if this is pedantic, but the question asked for the future of radiology, not radiologists. The future of radiology is potentially huge. Reliance on imaging is increasing for at least these reasons, maybe more: It rapidly and reliably triages a huge range of potential diagnoses.ER and inpatient care providers are under immense pressure to minimize ER and hospital stay times, all while not missing anything that will get them sued or a bad metric like 30-day re-admit or an EMTALA review (which are almost always inappropriately paranoid), all while trying to protect their online ratings. Radiology tests help do all of those things.The technology, software, applications, etc., continue to expand into new areas that providers are always quick to seize upon. Example from the past : pulmonary embolism and DVT. An occasional thought when you needed a nuclear medicine scan and a venogram. Chest CT and ultrasound availability 24 hours a day at all but the smallest hospitals ensures that every doctor can now always think about blood clots, no matter how unlikely, because they can be quickly excluded. I do a lot of PE chest CTs for COPD flares and a lot of leg Doppler\u2019s for CHF.Because no one really cares how much all of this costs when they are the patient, the liable care provider, or the politician seeking re-election. And when you go to the ER (everyone\u2019s preferred path to the CT scanner), you even bypass your insurance company\u2019s stonewallers.Because PAs and NPs are increasingly working in ERs and for hospitalists. They are less confident clinically, and need more tests. This has been demonstrated in at least one radiology journal article, and it is absolutely true in my experience.It\u2019s a techy-nerdy field. Our society loves tech.It has a long way to go in becoming more quantifiable, measurable, accountable, etc. These movements are afoot but there is great opportunity for a generation of radiologists to take up that task in research, practice, and even public policy.Americans want everything done. If one doctor doesn\u2019t order all the tests they just know they need, they wil find someone who will. Just today, we had a patient pay out of pocket for a PET scan for \u201cdiffuse bone pain\u201d. No history of cancer.Interventional radiology has traditionally been looked to as the way to make sure we\u2019re needed; hands on, etc. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll be true in 20 years or not. But someone with medical training will need to oversee development of new technology and applications, and make sure that even \u201cself-learning\u201d AI systems are actually practicing good medicine.Which leads me to acknowledge what others have discussed. I have no idea what the future of radiologists is. But I\u2019m more focused on surviving the next 5\u201310 years, not because of a lack of business, but because of an overwhelming amount of it.Yes, I think radiology\u2019s future is very bright. Radiologists\u2019 future is a different and much more complicated question. ",

            "answer_text": "My own professional career spanned the transition from analogue plain film radiology that Roentgen would have recognised, to multiple digital modalities like NM, US, CT and MRI; which he most certainly would not have recognised! The change, both in degree and kind, has been profound, and has forever altered the way radiology fits into medical practice. Once, an x-ray was used to confirm a clinical diagnosis; now it is the entry point for establishing a diagnosis. This reflects the order of magnitude increase in the amount of information that can be obtained with modern equipment. My best guess is that, as a logical extension of the digital process, all reporting of images will become automated, as have ECG (EKG) results. Technology will provide faster multimodality, but single station, \u2018scanners\u2019 that are fine-tuned to best investigate any selected pathological process. Bottom line - no radiologists. I would give some stay of execution to interventional radiologists, but not much, as nanotechnology has only just left the starting gate. The role of radiographers will become more akin to \u2018receptionists-with-a-degree\u2019 as the automation process spreads back down the diagnostic chain. The role of entrepreneurs is a bit of a wild card, but mall-based \u2018Scanners-r-us\u2019 seems likely to cater for the worried well. Overall, I would think a career in IT might be more useful\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "Although I am not a radiologist, I have a degree in medical physics and have worked on radiology software for 30 years. Nobody knows the future, and the previous responses BOTH present reasonable predictions, but I would like to add one additional point. Viewing the inside of the human body using technology like MRI, CT and even X-ray can still seem almost \u201cmagic\u201d to some observers (including me). If you have caught the bug and love the field of radiology, my advice is to go for it. Working in this field can be incredibly rewarding. But, as others have cautioned, you may need to reinvent yourself several times in your career. If you like the idea of that, as I do, then you will do well. If you don\u2019t like change\u2026 radiology is probably not for you. ",

As now, you will need to be facile with and tolerant of technology. You will not be replaced by 'artificial intelligence' but you will be 'augmented' by it. You will be more accurate and more efficient than the previous generation as we have been compared to ours. In the US, you will continue to earn a good living though there will always be downward pressure that will be offset by technology and volume. ",
