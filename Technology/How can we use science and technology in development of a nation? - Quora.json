            "answer_text": "I think what science and technology does is it allows humans to make progress. For example, before there was science and technology, we used to live in caves or hobble around in the wilderness trying not to get eaten by wolves. And now look at us, we live in large houses and drive cars that can go faster than any animal. I think this shows how science and technology has allowed humans to progress. Also, the way humans have evolved to be able to do science and create technology is also a great thing. If it wasn't for evolution there would be no humans. Also, science and technology allows humans to work together in large groups, which I think is important. It's interesting that if there was no such thing as a group of people working together or the concept of 'teamwork' we would have never been able to do things like build complex houses and cars. Also, I think science and technology has allowed humans to do a lot of good things. For example, before there was science and technology we didn't have hospitals or medicine that could cure people when they were sick. But now there are hospitals and medicine, which is good. So I think that science and technology has done a lot of good for humans. ",

            "answer_text": "Science and technology are the way forward. However, it\u2019s not just the knowledge gained and technology developed that will build the future of nations. To truly move forward, the way all nations think has to change. It\u2019s a tiny planet really. What is needed is the development of secular democracy as the norm. This will only happen when people start to think with their minds, instead of their hearts. Theocracies and autocracies are too controlling, self centered, and conservative for the citizens and society to grow freely. To really grow, the citizens and the governments must learn to think more like scientists \u2026 rationally. I recommend Carl Sagan\u2019s Pale Blue Dot monologue. ",

            "answer_text": "That is somewhat hard to answer. First off, it need not have any role in nation-building. France sprang out of a Gaulish tribe settled by the Romans 2000+ years ago, long before Francis Bacon codified the scientific method. Even our own nation, rich with scientific enquirers, did not depend on science and technology for any major role in nation-building. Most nations are won through warfare, and historically the protagonists are not thinking about refined matters pertaining to science or technology when the shells are flying overhead. That is a modern invention. ",

            "answer_text": "For the growth of a nation, the social structure and mindset is more important, as the two examples of history show us: Hellenistic society and Russian society. Both have impressive results in science and technology, but neither applied and used them properly for the benefit of the society. One used it just for the sake of it (Hellenistic) as a mere curiosity, while the other uses it exclusively for military purposes, and the society stagnates as a result. Of course is good to teach them in school, but is better to apply them in society\u2026 The most interesting result is the advance of India in the 70\u2019s, when after the coming of some Western professors, India (an already book/study oriented culture) took off, and today is advanced especially in IT. The most successful example is of course England of Industrial Revolution and USA today. ",

Can we withdraw the products of science & technology internet, telecommunications gadgets/systems, pharmaceuticals, state-of-the-art diagnostic & surgical equipment, transportation, sewage/garbage treatment and so on. The answer is clearly no. So the only way forward is to use the products of technology to improve the Human Development indices like Education, Health services, and Standard of Living. Such technology is required to solve environmental issues like climate change, plastic pollution, air pollution and to harness renewable energy. However, such technology as already mentioned by one commentator is used or can be used for harmful purposes ",
