            "answer_text": "So I\u2019ve had the iPhone 12 mini for about 6 months now. Camera is still pretty bad. With the 3rd generation smart HDR it still makes people\u2019s faces look cartoon-like. But the larger sensors allow for higher quality photos, technically. You can crop in more. And it\u2019s a noticeable difference from iPhone 11. But color accuracy isn\u2019t Apple\u2019s thing anymore. So because of their color profile, I don\u2019t think Apple will ever be great at cameras anymore. Still no astrophotography mode, no night portrait mode like you have on the Pixel 5 and 5a. No Telephoto lens on the phone so that\u2019s kind of a bummer. Other phones at this price will offer a telephoto lens. No 120HZ so same ol same ol. Display is nice though. Apple OLED meaning a more reliable OLED than Samsung OLED. Face ID now works even if the phone is in landscape orientation. So it\u2019s very convenient when using Face ID in a landscape app. The notch is the same size but the phone is almost like holding the original iPhone SE. Very small but very comfortable. Graphics on this little phone is amazing. COD mobile looks console quality at a solid 60 frames per second. No frame rate drops. Wifi speed is a little faster but not too noticeable. It\u2019s a small phone but offers a great battery life. Pretty much the exact same as I had on iPhone 11, which is a large phone with a larger battery. This is because iPhone 12 Mini has a more efficient display and a more battery efficient processor. So it\u2019s almost like using an iPhone 11 Pro except with no telephoto, a faster processor and graphics performance, a slightly upgraded camera if you\u2019re just comparing the standard 26mm lens, better Face ID, more colors to choose from, and only $699 instead of $999. So it\u2019s a better option than buying a used iPhone 11 Pro. Unless you absolutely need the telephoto lens. Which in that case I\u2019d still go for an iPhone 8 Plus because that one had a superb camera with great color accuracy. Overall, iPhone 12 mini is just kind of playing it safe. An upgrade if you\u2019re coming from iPhone XS or from iPhone SE 2. lol oh wait what year are you in? I\u2019m from 2021. Oh darn you caught me. I\u2019m from the future. ",

            "answer_text": "That really depends on your needs as a consumer. The 12 mini has barely a 2300mAh battery. It is completely understandable given the small form factor of the device, but also completely unacceptable in 2020. Especially when there are other devices like the OnePlus 8, Poco F2 Pro and more in the same price range with >4000mAh batteries. Brand new, a 12 mini might JUST get through a day of heavy use, but one year, or two years down the track, you will be struggling to get through a day of light usage without charging. The small battery alone should be enough to discount the 12 Mini from your prospective smartphones list. If you want to buy a 12 series iPhone, get a 12, 12 Pro, or a 12 Pro Max. On the other hand, if you like the small form factor and screen, and are willing to sacrifice on battery life, OR can't afford the extra money for the standard 12, then the 12 Mini will be a good phone for you. Hope that answers your question. ",
