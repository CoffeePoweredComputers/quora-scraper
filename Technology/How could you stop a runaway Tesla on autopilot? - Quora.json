            "answer_text": "I am not sure what you mean by runaway Tesla. If you mean Tesla on autopilot without a driver. That is not currently a possibility. Tesla can move without a driver when somebody is using Summon feature but the speed is limited at 3mph and currently can only work within 200 feet of the person operating the Tesla app. The car stops immediately if the person with the app releases the summon or Come To Me button. If you are talking about a Tesla on a highway with the driver asleep or incapacitated then it is also not a possibility. On autopilot Tesla requires the driver to keep hands on a wheel and periodically apply pressure to the steering wheel. If the driver does not respond the car starts issuing warnings in escalating manner going from simple visuals message to audible warning and flashing red messages. Eventually if the driver does not respond the car will try to pull over and stop. I have not heard of that happening, however. ",
