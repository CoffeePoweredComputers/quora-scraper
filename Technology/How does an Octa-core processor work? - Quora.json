            "answer_text": "First of all we see the meaning of the \"core\". core means it is the processing unit that is fetch and executes data from memory. The octa-core processor is the example of the multi-core  processor. why multicore processor is faster than the single core processor? In a single core processor there is no extra address lines or we can say any core available for the perform fetch and execute operation perticularly. and in multi-core processor that is the advantage there is extra lines available for the executing operation perticularly that's why the multicore processor is faster than the single core processor. octa-core processor: In octa-core processor there is two parts available of 4-4 cores.  The processing is divided between multiple cores thereby reducing heat  emissions and consequently reducing power consumption. It is common to  see dual-core or even quad-core processors in computers today. In short the work is divided to the both parts so it can increase the execution speed. ",

            "answer_text": "In very simple terms just imagine a single wood cutter cutting 5 trees into small blocks. then putting them in stack and then building a house out of it. This is an example of a single core processor. In 8/ multi core processor, imagine that instead of one person this is done by 8 people. Each person doing different task than other. To avoid complexity, each person will cut a separate tree. ",
