            "answer_text": "This is definitely different for every person out there depending on their lifestyle. The two products that I always highly recommend to people: Kindle Paperwhite: as an avid reader, this is a product that I make use of every single day. It\u2019s light, portable and easily syncs across all devices. The proliferation of ebooks and availability of it via the local library has made it much simpler for me to borrow, return and read any book I could ever want. Lastly, the Paperwhite makes it much easier to read right before bed, especially if you have a partner sleeping next to you.XGIMI Smart Projector: this is actually a product that I worked to launch on crowdfunding that has gone to do quite well globally. This smart projector combines all you need for a home theater in one light and portable cube. The images are crisp, you can project up to 30 feet wide and the Harmon Kardon sound system beats a lot of soundbars on the market. As a film buff, my partner vouches for the product and we make use of it every single night after dinner.",
