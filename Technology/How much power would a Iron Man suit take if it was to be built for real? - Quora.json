            "answer_text": "First of all, many things the Ironman suit does are quite impossible to achieve with any possible technology. For e.g. Stark falls from a great height onto a hard floor - the suit slams and bounces with extreme impact as would a 500 pound hunk of metal. There is no way a human being would survive that sort of deceleration without dying, no matter how much padding was used. One could theoretically use a \"soggy\" force field to make this happen, but it will not result in the same metallic thunking bouncing effect as seen on camera. So coming back to the real stuff : 1) Operating a powerful exoskeleton that can run, jump and crush - A few dozen kilowatts is enough for that - about as much as a decent motorcycle engine. 2) Flying into the sky - He seems to reach a few kilometers height in a few seconds, assume 1 kilometer/second against gravity - So suppose he flew 10KM high in 10 seconds, and the suit weighs 500 pounds inclusive of Stark himself.E = mgh = 227 KG * 9.8 m/s^2 * 10000 meters = 22246000 joules consumed in 10 seconds.This is 2224 kilowatts - about as much as a small jet plane, or 5 Formula 1 cars.
