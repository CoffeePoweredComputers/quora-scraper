            "answer_text": "Realme X2 got launched almost a year ago and later, it also saw an increase in its cost when the GST got hiked on the smartphones. However, despite having all the features, it was never truly a gaming smartphone and this is why I would prefer Realme 6i more than Realme X2 and consider it better. Realme 6i is one of the latest gaming smartphones which is a part of the budget segment. Though it does not have lots of extravagant features like Realme X2, but Realme X2 surely comes at a much higher price than Realme 6i and this is one of the major disadvantages of Realme 2. Talking about the features, one thing that Realme 6i has pulled off very nicely is the processor section. It contains MediaTek Helio G90T gaming processor which is octa-core in nature and clocked at 2GHz. This processor has actually proved its worth in the past and has delivered some really good gaming performance in various smartphones.  However, despite having a higher price, Realme X2 has Snapdragon 730G which was supposed to be a good gaming chipset but it is actually not. This Snapdragon chipset seems to be only saving the battery in the smartphone and not offering any good gaming performance. This is why, I would never recommend Snapdragon 730G at such a high price. In fact, MediaTek Helio G90T has a much better gaming performance than it at a much lesser cost, even if it consumes a little bit of extra battery. The display section and the camera is surely better in Realme X2. However, this is what they take as much as 5k extra for this smartphone in India and I suppose Realme 6i is actually better at its price. In fact, Realme 6i has a better battery power and it is 4300mAh against just 4000mAh in Realme X2. So personally, I would prefer Realme 6i all due to its gaming performance and this certainly has great features for its price. Realme X2 is surely an old option, not much in purchases, these days. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes..ofcourse Realme 6i much better than Realme X2 because realme 6i is a new launched phone with some fixed problems that are faced by previous consumers of realme..I am also using realme 6 so go for realme 6i and realme X2 is with higher price and this model is too old\u2026if you want to buy realme than go for Realme 6 pro/6i/6/X3.
