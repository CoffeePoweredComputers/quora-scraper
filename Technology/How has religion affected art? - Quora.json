            "answer_text": "How has religion affected art? The person should not automatically inherit fathers\u2019 religions. We do not accept the recommendations of parents about our marriage, business, investment, education, or anything we feel important to us, so why should we automatically inherit religion? If we do, that means we do not really care about religion. As a truth seeker, I have analyzed the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; the findings of the analysis helped me to adjust belief. The religion I have chosen is the common ground teachings of Judaism which were confirmed by the consistent teachings of Jesus and by the consistent teachings of Islam. The same message revealed to the prophets by the same God must be consistent, clear and easy for all people regardless of their level of education or experience Muslims have been asked to believe in what has been revealed to Moses, Jesus and other Prophets as taught in Qur\u2019an verses 3:84 and 42:13 It is wrong to say Judaism is the right religion because there are many additions and changes to what God has revealed to Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, etc. It is wrong to say that the current teachings of Christianity are the true religion because most of the current teachings are the attractive teachings which are not consistent with the strict teachings of Jesus. It is wrong to accept all the current teachings of Islam because there are many teachings which contradict the core verses of Qur\u2019an. Although the core religion teachings guide us to believe in God and to do good deeds to help others, scholars of each religion have distorted some teachings in order to claim that their religion is the only true religion and that they have the only way for salvation. Prophets did not teach that God has preserved the holy book; they have advised that there will be changes and have been warned of such additions and deletions. Amos 8:11-12 teach that People will be thirsty for the true word of God but they will not find it anywhere Psalm 56:5 teaches All day long they twist my words Jeremiah 8:8 teaches the lying pen of the scribes has distorted the word of God Jeremiah 5:30-31 teach that the priests have distorted the religion teachings and that the people love those distorted teachings Jewish scholars teach that Jews are the chosen people of God Christian Scholars teach that they are the predestined, the glorified, and the chosen before the creation of the world Muslim Scholars teach that Jews are cursed, Christians are misguided, and that Muslims are the truly guided people All those scholars are mistaken People are confused by the contradicting teachings, they try to search the internet for the true word of God, but they find many distorted teachings Instead of the consistent and logical teachings like \u2018Do not have two differing measures\u2019, \u2018The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner\u2019, \u2018The foreigner must be treated as your native-born\u2019, \u2018You are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born\u2019 in Deuteronomy 25:13-16, Exodus 12:49, Leviticus 19:33-35 , Leviticus 24:22, Numbers 15:15-16, Deuteronomy 24:14-15 The biased scribes have ignored those true teachings and inserted some additions to restrict justice to the \u2018fellow Israelite\u2019, \u2018my people among you\u2019, or \u2018Hebrew men or women\u2019 They do not teach the original teachings anymore; instead, they teach the manipulated teachings like \u201cYou may charge a foreigner interest, but not a fellow Israelite\u201d In Deuteronomy 23:19-20, Exodus 22:25, Deuteronomy 15:1-2, Deuteronomy 15:12 Instead of the true teaching \u2018You shall not murder \u2018in Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17 The scribes who glorify defeating their enemies ignored the true teaching and added some verses to justify the killing like Exodus 23:23, Numbers 31:16-18, Joshua 6:20-21, Judges 15:14-16 and Judges 16:30 Instead of \u2018Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more\u2019 in Isaiah 2:4, they have justified atrocities. Instead of the true and most consistent teachings of \u2018blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 in Leviticus 26, Deuteronomy 28, Deuteronomy 11:26-28, Deuteronomy 4:40, Deuteronomy 6:24-25, Deuteronomy 7:12-15, and Deuteronomy 8, they teach that God has chosen them regardless of their obedience as in the distorted teachings of Deuteronomy 9:5-6 and Deuteronomy 7:6-8 Instead of the true and strict teachings of Jesus in Matthew 7:21-27, Luke 13:25-27, Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Matthew 25:35-45, Mark 12:28-34, Mark 10:17-19, Matthew 19:16-19, Luke 18:18-20, Luke 6:46-48, John 14:15 and John 14:21 most Christian scholars teach the distorted and attractive teachings like Romans 8:30, 1 Thessalonians 5:9, Ephesians 2:5, Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28, Galatians 2:16, Colossians 2:14 and Ephesians 1:4 Most churches do not teach the true teachings like Matthew 10:8 \u2018Freely you have received; freely give\u2019; they teach that it is o.k. to reap the financial gifts in exchange of the spiritual gifts and teach the attractive ones \u2018And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified\u2019 Romans 8:30 They try to make people feel happy with such attractive teachings in order to receive more donations. \u201cIf we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?\u201d 1 Corinthians 9:11. most churches do not follow the strict teachings which urge us to obey God as taught by Jesus in Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Mark 12:28-34, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like \u2018We are saved by grace through faith apart from works\u2019 - Ephesians 2:8-9 \u2018Even when we were dead in sins, we are saved by grace\u2019 - Ephesians 2:5 \u2018A man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law\u2019 - Romans 3:28 \u2018A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith\u2019 - Galatians 2:16 \u2018For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse\u2019 - Galatians 3:10 Most churches do not follow the strict teachings like If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away which is taught by Jesus in Matthew 18:9, Matthew 5:29 and Mark 9:47, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018God has chosen us before the foundations of the world\u2019 - Ephesians 1:4 \u2018God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation\u2019 - 2 Thessalonians 2:13 \u2018For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation\u2019 - 1 Thessalonians 5:9 \u2018But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed!\u2019 1 Corinthians 15:51 \u2018God has saved us and called us\u2019 - 2 Timothy 1:9 \u2018We have been justified through faith\u2019 - Romans 5:1, Romans 5:9 Most churches believe that Jesus\u2019 death was necessary for the forgiveness of sins. But Jesus, like all other prophets, taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help other No human sacrifice is necessary for salvation. No human bloodshed is necessary for salvation. No savior should die for the salvation of others; everyone is responsible for his own salvation. Jesus has also confirmed the same in Matthew 18:21-35, 6:14-15, Mark 11:25-26, Luke 6:35-38, Matthew 19:16\u201319, Matthew 21:43, and Matthew 25:41\u201346 When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of atonement, they have added verses like Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost The bible footnotes explain that verse Matthew 18:11 was not in the original old scriptures Hebrews 9:22 \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d is a misunderstanding of verse Leviticus 17:10-14 which is not about atonement but is about dietary laws. God has clarified that blood in meat is not good for health; that clarification was necessary to the people who did not have advanced medical tools to know that eating the meat with the blood still in it is bad for health The true word of God is not what is written by the unknown writer of Hebrews; it is what has been taught by Moses, Jesus and the Prophets who taught the forgiveness is possible by obedience, repentance, and prayers Proverbs 16:6 teaches that \u201cIn mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity.\u201d Psalm 69:30-31 teaches that praise worship is better than sacrifice 2 Chronicles 7:14 teaches that forgiveness is obtainable without a blood sacrifice \u2018If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin\u2019 Jonah 3 teaches that people are forgiven when they repented and fasted, without offering any sacrifice and without shedding any blood Proverbs 17:15 states: \u2018He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, both of them alike are an abomination unto God\u2019 That should be considered as a warning to the teachers who promise free salvation to the sinners and who teach that the innocent has been punished on behalf of the sinners Jesus taught the parable of The Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-32 to highlight the importance of obedience and repentance as the main prerequisites for salvation That is the core Christianity teaching as taught in Matthew 7:21 Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven Jesus has confirmed the teachings of the Old Testimony \u2018in repentance and obedience is your salvation\u2019 as taught in Isaiah 30:15 In Matthew 25:31-45 Jesus described the final judgment as being based on good works; he clarified that those who obey the law will be saved Salvation is not based solely on belief and nothing else; salvation is not granted to those who merely profess acceptance of Jesus without performing kind or compassionate deeds In Luke 13:3 and 13:5, Jesus taught that repentance is necessary for salvation But unless you repent, you too will all perish Mark 12:33 teaches: And to love one\u2019s neighbor as himself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices What Jesus taught here is not different from the wisdom taught by the old testimony Hosea 6:6 \u2018For I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings\u2019 That verse teaches us that forgiveness is possible by repentance and obedience; no sacrifice is necessary Matthew 9:13 teaches that Jesus came to call the sinner to repentance \u2018I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance\u2019 The wrong teachings about original sin, atonement, and salvation by grace without obedience to God\u2019s law were taught by Paul who was not educated by Jesus. When the scribes and scholars wanted to gain more authority, they added verses like Mark 16:15 and Matthew 28:18 Bible footnotes confirm that [The earliest manuscripts and some other ancient witnesses do not have verses Mark 16:9\u201320] Just search the bible footnotes or search the internet about the verses Mark 16:9\u201320 - you will also find that Matthew gospel includes many verses of Mark gospel which was written earlier The Muslim scholars who justify killing of innocent people are not true Muslims because they do not obey the Qur\u2019an verses like 5:32, 4:90, 2:190, 8:61, 17:33, 25:68 and 6:151 which teach \u2018You shall not kill - God has made life sacred\u2019 The Muslim scholars who teach to kill the unbelievers are mistaken; verse 9:6 is enough proof for their mistakes, because Muslims are supposed to protect the unbelievers and they cannot protect them after killing them The Muslims who justify killing of those who leave Islam are mistaken because they do not obey the Islamic teachings like Qur\u2019an verses 2:256, 16:125 and 18:29 which teach Freedom of Religion The Muslim scholars who justify the killing of the hostages are mistaken; verse 8:70 proves that the hostage is not to be killed, because Muslims are supposed to comfort the hostages and they cannot comfort them after killing them The Muslim scholars who teach that Islam is the only true religion are mistaken; they have been ordered to believe in what has been revealed to Moses, Jesus and other Prophets as taught in Qur\u2019an verses 3:84, 4:136, 4:152 and 42:13 The Muslim scholars who teach that the fate of people had been determined before they were born and before they had any chance to do good or bad are mistaken; they ignore the basic Qur\u2019an verses like 4:147, 4:152, 6:48, 6:54, 17:15, 45:15,43:72, 16:35, 19:63, 19:76, 20:112, 34:50, 37:39, 39:41, 39:70, 40:17, 47:17, 55:60, 56:24, and 18:107 - 39:7 The verses teach that God does not predestine people\u2019s fate but gives them the choice either to obey and do good deeds or to rebel and do evil deeds; there is no punishment for those who choose to obey and to thank God. Brahmins teach that God created them from his mouth to glorify them and created some other castes from his feet to let them serve the Brahmins - \u2013 Laws of Manu Chapter 1 They wanted to indoctrinate people that the bad caste discrimination is ordained by God; that is how Hindu priests manipulate the Hindu scripture to their benefits. Brahmins urge simple people to donate and offer generous gifts to the Brahmins claiming that people will get hundred-thousand-fold rewards \u2013 Laws of Manu Chapter 7 An offering to Brahmins saves from misfortune and from great guilt. \u2013 Laws of Manu Chapter 3 Brahmin sanctifies any company (which he may enter), seven ancestors and seven descendants, and he alone deserves (to possess) this whole earth \u2013 Laws of Manu Chapter 1 Chapter 7 teaches that Kings should honor Brahmins, should be lenient towards Brahmins, and should consult them in important decisions and should always obey them Hindu priests teach that money given to Brahmins is declared to be an imperishable treasure for kings Chapter 8 teaches that Brahmins are the masters of everything and authorizes Brahmins to decide in justice and law matters Chapter 9 provides exceptional inheritance rights to Brahmins Chapter 11 entitles Brahmins to take the law into their own hands and settle the disputes without referring to law and justice system of other castes Brahmin is the image of God and is the master of all castes \u2013 Laws of Manu Chapter 2 and 10 Bhagavad Gita indoctrinates the military leaders to obey the Brahmins even if the military leaders were asked to kill their family members The clear message to the military leaders is not to attach to a family or anything other than being a disciple to obey the orders of Brahmins as an honor and duty Of course there are considerable improvements, but that is not because of better revelations or new scripture, it is because the educated people have rejected the wrong teachings Priests are getting weaker; they cannot torture their opponents like before But the evaluation should be based on what they have done when they had the power Moses warned of the expected turning from the way he has commanded Jews, in Deuteronomy 31:27-29 he used strong words like \u201cFor I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against God while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die!\u201d And \u201cFor I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall on you because you will do evil in the sight of God and arouse his anger by what your hands have made\u201d Jesus has warned the priests who spend more time in the houses of widows. In Matthew 23:14 he said \u201cWoe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation\u201d In Matthew 7:15-20, Jesus warned of the false teachers who mislead people Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves The same teaching is also written in Luke 6:43-44 As Moses and Jesus warned of the false teachers who explain religion to their benefits, the prophet of Islam has also warned of those who ignore the true teachings and teach different teachings \u201cI will say those people are from me. It will be said, 'You do not know what changes and new things they did after you.' Then I will say, 'Far removed (from mercy), far removed (from mercy), those who changed (the religion) after me!\u201d That is recorded in Bukhari 7051 Book 92, Hadith 4 and in Volume 9, Book 88, Hadith 174 The best advice is to follow the common ground of the clear teachings as taught by the prophets. The same message revealed to the prophets by the same God must be consistent, clear and easy for all people regardless of their level of education or experience The common ground of religion teachings includes: In obedience and repentance is your salvation, if you obey and do good deeds, you will be blessed, if you disobey you will be lost; that is the clear message. That message is the most consistent message by Moses, confirmed by Jesus and by Islamic teachings Instead of the true religion teachings which should unite all people under the same guidelines of obedience, repentance, forgiveness, good deeds and compassion; we find the distorted teachings which agitate hatred and the unnecessary endless wars and sectarian conflicts. We have the choice to be like the son who says that if the word of God includes so much cruelty and so many contradictions, then I do not need the word of such God We also have the choice to be like the son who says we cannot teach the strict teachings like \u2018pluck out your eye\u2019 or \u2018woe to you\u2019 or \u2018freely you have received; freely give\u2019, we should continue to teach attractive teachings because we need an income to survive We also have choice to be like the son who says maybe the father is testing us; maybe some of my brothers have changed the message of the father to explain it to their benefits We also have the choice to be like the son who says that he knows the true words of the wise father as he knows his own children, he will continue to identify the truth that hurts and he would happily accept any persecution from the majority which hate the truth; that is what the prophets did and that is what the prophets ordered us to do. How can you validate my claims? The best advice is to ask God to guide us to the truth. The door is open for everyone to experience divine intervention The wise and merciful father keeps his door open for his children God has more wisdom and mercy than any wise merciful father People can communicate with God at any time Prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have urged us to ask God and taught that God answers the prayers of the obedient believer. Example verses are: Psalm 107:28-30, Psalm 18:6, Psalm 145:18, 2 Chronicles 7:14, Isaiah 58:9 Matthew 7:7, Mark 11:24, Luke 6:27-28, James 4:2, Qur\u2019an 2:186, Qur\u2019an 40:60 Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. I have spent years wondering about what the purpose of life is. I have analyzed the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and prayed to God to guide me to the truth. I had some doubts about the teachings of a certain teacher, I have prayed to God to guide me to the truth I saw in a very clear dream that teacher in a form of a criminal prisoner, has committed evil, waiting for his trial. In another dream I saw a wolf hiding after attacking sheep; I understood that message as the bad teacher who try to mislead people by the bad teachings as Jesus explained in Matthew 7:15-20 \u201cBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves\u201d. I also remembered the Parable of the Weeds in which Jesus warned us about the enemy who insert false teachings into the scripture in Matthew 13:24-43 \u2018an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat\u2019 Pray and ask God to guide you about the teacher who claims that God does not exist; you will see him in a bad image Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who teaches that Jesus is God Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who claims that God tests us in this life and will reward us according to our obedience and good deeds Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who taught original sin, atonement, salvation not based on obedience but taught free salvation by a savior to die for our sins You do not have to accept my views; you may check and analyze the mentioned verses You do not have to accept my claims about communication with God; try to establish your own communication You do not have to accept my personal experience; you know how to communicate with God and it will be your own personal experience Even if you are agnostic, you should not have a problem accepting a creator for that marvelous universe, pray to that God. Do not call any name like the God of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, or Hinduism, just pray to the only true God who has created everything. Again, do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. Isaiah 58:9 \u2018Then you will call, and God will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I\u2019.

            "answer_text": "Marxism believes that religion and art belong to the same superstructure of society, and they all belong to social ideology. There is a close relationship between the two. Art originates from the social life of human beings. Religious activities belong to the content of social life. Religion has a close relationship with the origin of art. In the primitive society, religion and art are integrated. Primitives believe that the gods dominate everything, and the major events in their production and life often begin or end with religious activities or rituals, and various forms of religious activities such as natural worship, totem worship, ancestor worship, and witchcraft. It is an important part of human primitive social life. The original art reflects these activities with a strong religious color. Primitive art is not for purely aesthetic purposes, but for practical or utilitarian purposes. This practical or utilitarian purpose is often embodied in totem worship or witchcraft activities. The integration of primitive religion with primitive art does not mean that art is created by religion. This is because art is produced in production practice and social life, and primitive religion does not equal all social life. Primitive art serves not only primitive religions, but also primitive politics, ethics, education, etc. Moreover, the original religion itself is also determined by the economic base. The influence of religion on art, in the final analysis, also reflects the indirect, but decisive role of the economic base. Among the various non-fundamental factors that play a role in the origin of art, the role of religion is prominent. Human production practice and social life are the foundation of art production and the motivation of art development. The development of production practice and social life provides an evolving ideological content for art. As an integral part of social life, religion has a wide and profound influence on the development of art. This is not only manifested in the long history of Chinese and foreign art history, but also dominated by religious art, and it is represented in the rare treasures of human art treasures. Religious. The reason why religion has so deeply and extensively influenced art is that religion is a social ideology with a world view and a sense of life. Historically, religious ideology once occupied a dominant position. At the same time, many activities of religion are inseparable from art and need Using art as a form of expression, many forms of art are also developed in religious activities; in addition, the spread of various religions will inevitably lead to the exchange of art between different ethnic groups in various regions, thus promoting the development of art. On the other hand, religion has also played a role in hindering the development of art in history. For example, Islam prohibits the expression of animals in sculptures and paintings, resulting in the backwardness of plastic arts. The invasion of the Crusaders has devastated the art of Arab countries. While religion influences art, art also has a reaction to religion. In history, art, as a means of propaganda for religion, has played a huge role in the widespread dissemination of religion and the development of religion. The role of art in religion also has two sides. The development of secular art, especially the development and dissemination of atheistic or anti-religious art, plays a role in restraining religious development. Religious art is a very significant phenomenon in the history of art. Religious art is a combination of religion and art, and an artistic expression of religious thought and emotion. Although the subject of religious art is religion, its roots are real life. Religious art and secular art coexist, and they infiltrate and influence each other. In modern society, due to the strong influence of secular art, religious art has also shown a trend of diversification and modernization. ",
