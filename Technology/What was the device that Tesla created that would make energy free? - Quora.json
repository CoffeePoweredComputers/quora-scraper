            "answer_text": "The Mystical Nikola Tesla was building a tower to transmit free energy to all the people of the world. The Real Nikola Tesla wouldn\u2019t have given you the time of day for free. He was seriously into getting rich - he\u2019d made and lost three fortunes and was trying for his fourth when he ran out of money and had to resort to skipping out on his hotel bills. The Wardenclyffe site (where his tower was) would have had several factories where thousands of people would have been employed making his inventions, including receivers for the power coming from the Wardenclyffe site.
