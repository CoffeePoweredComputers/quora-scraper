            "answer_text": "Physics are the rules by which technology plays a game. Physics gives us electronics. Electronics gives us manipulation of information. Technology as defined today is the culture that has grown up around the manipulation of that information. It has only been about 10 years that smart phones have come to dominate the world. Technology is the term that is used to describe the new behavior, but technology is only the enabling gadget that has yielded one of the most incredible changes in culture to hit humans ever. There are millions of teenage girls who are addicted to \u201ctechnology\u201d but have no idea what electronics or physics is. And so technology is a new word. It describes the girl in seat 25c on the airplane frantically texting her ex-boyfriend that he just changed his status on Facebook. \u201cDo you still love me?\u201d Plane takes off and girl suffers for 2 hours until plane lands and the phone comes out again\u2026.. Well, this young gal is living technology, but that technology is all about her feelings, not Mawell\u2019s Equations. And so technology is a new human culture, enabled by electronics that was developed by physicists. ",

            "answer_text": "Broadly speaking, physics and technology both constitute science. Physics is the heart and technology is the body of science. The application of the principles of physics for practiced purposes becomes technology, e.g.,(i) Aeroplanes fly on the basis of Bernoulli\u2019s theorem. (ii)\tRocket propulsion is based on Newton\u2019s secondand third laws of motion.\t(iii)\tGeneration of power from nuclear reactor is based on the phenomena of controlled nuclear fission.(iv)\tLasers are based on the population inversion ofelectrons and so on.\tThus, we can say that to some extent science and technology is applied physics.
