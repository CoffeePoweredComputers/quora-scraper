            "answer_text": "Although there are many benefits of face-to-face communication, several that stand out are based upon \u201cphysiognomy\u201d which allows a person to gather visual information from another. Visual feedback isn\u2019t possible by phone. A definition indicates some benefits: \u201cPHYSIOGNOMY is the art of discovering temperament and character from outward appearance.\u201d In other words, \u201cPHYSIOGNOMY is the composite revealed by facial features which show the qualities of mind or character by their configuration or expression.\u201d With that in mind, suppose you\u2019re the leader of a strong nation speaking with the leader of a weak nation in trouble. It might be military, industrial, economic, high tech, education, communication, political, whatever. Suppose also that the troubled nation has an abundance of SILVER, a critical natural resource which you, as your nation's leader, recently learned is now in DANGEROUSLY SHORT SUPPLY in your home country. The troubled nation\u2019s leader\u2014call him \u201cTony\u201d\u2014 doesn\u2019t know that. And Tony's been warming up to another nation\u2019s leader\u2014a real badass dictator, Lucifer, who\u2019s hated by the world community. YOU NEED SILVER. Tony\u2019s got it. Lots of it! Lucifer needs silver, too (which you learned just yesterday from your Intel team). You want to buy a MASSIVE amount (Tony\u2019s ENTIRE available supply), at a price that\u2019s fair to both nations. And all this is coming to a head, right now at his office, face-to-face. You\u2019re watching Tony. You see he's nervous. You\u2019re not sure why. But he\u2019s really upset about something. You think it\u2019s Lucifer who\u2019s been talking to Tony. Lucifer lies a lot. You\u2019ve got to know what\u2019s going on (without Tony\u2019s usual confusing bullshit). You like him. But he\u2019s like a soup sandwich: all over the place! In your mind, five things are certain: 1. Tony absolutely hates pressure which he never gets from you. It's your patience. He likes that. You\u2019re always kind with him. 2. His nation needs a lot of money \u2014 badly! 3. Your nation needs a lot of silver \u2014 badly! 4. Lucifer will outbid you in a heartbeat by buying at a high price from Tony because of the collateral crap he\u2019ll create which exacts a vicious price down the road. (He\u2019ll pay big today and suck Tony's blood dry tomorrow!) 5. Tony's nation has other natural resources of tremendous value to engineering, high tech and aviation. Tony doesn\u2019t know that. And you don\u2019t want his allegiance to shift to Lucifer. Right now you want to do business with Tony for the silver you need now \u2014 badly. You don\u2019t want Tony to do business with badass Lucifer. In just a few minutes you\u2019re going to see what Tony\u2019s thinking about doing business with you \u2014 or selling his entire supply to Lucifer. Yes, you know you can buy from other silver mining nations. But Tony's a good guy \u2014 dumbern\u2019 a brick \u2014 but you like him! And because of his nation\u2019s other resources, its important to preserve his allegiance to you (and not lose it to Lucifer). [The 1st question you ask implies that your nation owns a very large supply of silver] [You ask and watch. Then you hit him with a second question, and a third] \u201cTony, I plan to call Lucifer tomorrow. My people tell me he wants to buy silver \u2014 by that I mean a lot of it. Why should I sell to him?\u201d [Tony's reaction is an unmistakeable double-take; his eyebrows go up; and his face sweats] [Because you could act as a re-seller for other silver supplying nations, you\u2019ve not lied. But you ARE shaping Tony's thoughts] \u201cTony, if Lucifer offered to pay fifty percent more than I\u2019d pay\u2014and you sold to him\u2014how could he afford to do that? The world's spot price is the world's spot price. I\u2019m asking because what he might want from you down the road could hurt. It could hurt a lot! Having done business with him in the past, did he ever hurt you and/or your nation? By the way, for reasons of confidentiality, you don\u2019t have to answer that.\u201d [Tony fidgets; looks down at the floor; then looks up with a guilty look on his face and says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d] \u201cTony, what I\u2019m going to tell you now is worth considering. You should know that my nation is among the world\u2019s leaders in high tech, engineering, wind energy generation and aviation. My Intel people tell me that we need resources that we just don\u2019t have. Your nation has them in amounts you might find shocking. I\u2019m referring to vast amounts of Copper, Gallium, Phosphorus, Indium, Dysprosium, Terbium and Neodymium. Are you aware that your nation has the world's largest supplies of those seven, some of which are classified as \u201crare earth elements; and that a long-term strategic partnership of your nation and mine can benefit both? Before you answer, as my nation\u2019s leader I\u2019m empowered to enter into an agreement with you today to buy the seven elements as a package with your ENTIRE available supply of silver. Here's the agreement reduced to a three-paragraph executive summary. You\u2019ll note that we\u2019re prepared to pay one hundred billion dollars now as a down payment and more over the next ten years.\u201d \u201cI know your recent re-election wasn\u2019t easy. What we\u2019re talking about now are resources based on economics. But we both also know it can very favorably impact politics. By that I mean if an agreement into which we enter\u2014an agreement governing natural resources\u2014helps both of our countries, then it certainly can impact the opinions of our respective citizens. Please take a moment to read it and tell me what you think. What I think is that both our nations will be most grateful if we use our respective resources well and wisely. But go ahead and read what it says.\u201d [Tony reads the executive summary; looks up with great surprise; opens his mouth (no words come out) but finally (quietly) says] \u201cAm I correct in saying that you\u2019ll buy our silver and the other seven for half a billion dollars now \u2014 and more as we mine?\u201d [To which I warmly smile and say] \u201cYup!\u201d [At which point Tony stands up and walks over indicating he\u2019s eager to shake hands. I stand up, we shake hands and Tony does something amazing: he shows tears of gratitude] [That\u2019s physiognomy!] [And so much for Lucifer!] ",

            "answer_text": "In a way this is increasingly an old technology question as the increasing use of video for personal and business calls means that face to face and telephone interactions are moving closer. They still aren\u2019t the same, as one highly surprising fact shows: we are more able to tell if someone is lying or not telling the truth - and they are different - if we use voice over the telephone rather than meeting someone face to face. (I think it\u2019s something to do with our ability to control our body language face to face, as we\u2019re all pretty good at acting, and over the phone our guard goes down.) Even against video phone calls, face to face is a highly different experience still partly, I\u2019ve come to think, because we\u2019re still phased a little by the technology. So face to face is still an important element in understanding someone else because your entire focus face to face is on the other person. Through a video screen, you are not so engaged - I mean you can\u2019t do your emails as you do on those interminable transatlantic telephone conference calls, but you do have other distractions that you don\u2019t have face to face. I still recommend that any serious initial meeting is held face to face because the richness of information is so much higher - both for you and the person you are meeting. That\u2019s the point. ",
