            "answer_text": "Definition of 4G and 4G LTE 4G is the fourth Generation Mobile Network Technology. 4G will replace 3G in the future, 4G provides a more reliable connection and higher speeds to people. 4G LTE means fourth generation long term evolution. LTE is a kind of 4G that provides fastest connection to mobile Internet experience-10 times faster than 3G. The terms 4G and 4G LTE are often used by people interchangeably, but they are not the same. 4G is a great substitute for 3G, 4G provides a faster speed for users who view website and download data. Fast speed of 4G means reduction buffer, some might say that 4g opened a new era of mobile internet. When 4G first used in the market, many networks can\u2019t reach 4G speed. However, some operators sale mobiles with 4g service, in fact customers can not enjoy real 4G service unless they are in area where 4g network covered. Characters of 4G LTE 4G LTE is a kind of 4G technology, which provides the best performance and fastest speed at present. 4G LTE will be your best choice when you use smart phone or tablet PC surf the internet and using a lot of data every month. 4G LTE is 10 times faster than older 3G technology, so when users switch from 3G to 4G LTE, the speed difference is obviously. Speed is determined by signal intensity and server load Challenges in using 4G and 4G LTE if you are using 3G mobile, then you may need to buy a new smartphone with 4G capabilities. 3G devices simply cannot provide 4G experience. You must also be in the area where 4G networks are available. If you want to use 4G LTE, your mobile device must support it, and you must be in the service zone that provides 4G LTE services. Another challenge is to choose mobile operator of which can provide 4G or 4G LTE services. Most regions can only provide 4G service, but 4G LTE may not be available. Simply said, 5G is widely believed to be smarter, faster and more efficient than 4G. It promises mobile data speeds that far outstrip the fastest home broadband network currently available to consumers. With speeds of up to 100 gigabits per second, 5G is set to be as much as 100 times faster than 4G. Low latency is a key differentiator between 4G and 5G. Latency is the time that passes from the moment information is sent from a device until it can be used by the receiver. Reduced latency means that you\u2019d be able to use your mobile device connection as a replacement for your cable modem and Wi-Fi. Additionally, you\u2019d be able to download and upload files quickly and easily, without having to worry about the network or phone suddenly crashing. You\u2019d also be able to watch a 4K video almost straight away without having to experience any buffering time. 5G will be able to fix bandwidth issues. Currently, there are so many different devices connected to 3G and 4G networks, that they don\u2019t have the infrastructure to cope effectively. 5G will be able to handle current devices and emerging technologies such as driverless cars and connected home products.[1] Footnotes[1] http://www.usriot.com (http://www.usriot.com) ",
