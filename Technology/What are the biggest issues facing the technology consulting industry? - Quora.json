            "answer_text": "A couple of other answers have talked about the challenge of staying current on new technology - and this is tough - but I'd suggest that the biggest threat to consulting in general is the democratization of information. Consider the fact that what a consulting firm does is rent brainpower and/or experience to clients to solve specific problems. This means that what a consultant brings to a client is knowledge (acquired in school or from experience) that the client doesn't have access to otherwise. There is basically no barrier to entry for someone to start a new consulting firm in terms of licensing or other professional qualifications. Add to this the continuing value and availability of high quality information on the internet (at sites like Quora) and consultants are feeling very pinched. Clients who know how to formulate the right questions to address their problems can often get a good first order approximation of the right course of action by using google effectively, and this tends to eliminate the need for consultation with experts. But, don't take it from me. No less an authority than Clayton Christensen(http://www.claytonchristensen.com/) recently wrote an article for the Harvard Business Review discussing this very problem (Consulting on the Cusp of Disruption). Christensen literally wrote the book on disruption and sees the same trends that have overturned industries like publishing gaining momentum in accounting, law, and other professional service firms - which are essentially consultants in specialized fields.

            "answer_text": "I am not a technology consultant, nor do I own or manage a technology consultancy. My employers have used technology consultants. Quite simply, consultants A single bad consultation could lose you a client and / harm or even lose your reputation. Consultants must constantly refresh their skills. In principal, they know and accept this ; in practice, attending 5 days training away from home gets harder as consultants personal lives mature with spouses and families technology the pace of change is so intense; technologies are deprecated approximately every 4-6 years. A client expects consultants with at least 1-3 years experience, but the technology might only be 6 months old. Vendors and literature sells the dream; consultants must deliver reality.competition you are selling skills and experience ; not easy to demonstrate and differentiate until the customer has engaged you.skilled consultants become your competitors After you have trained them and provided them with experience and engagements where they make your clients into their contacts and a future social and business network, they leave and set themselves up as independent consultants competing against you. Many [most?] are not llimited to technology consultancy, but apply to advanced knowledge professions in general ; lawyers accountants medical professionals, such as doctors and dentists Hope this helps.
