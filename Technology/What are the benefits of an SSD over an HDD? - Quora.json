            "answer_text": "Not A Chance In A Million Years SSD is faster, more predictable in it\u2019s decay it\u2019s very nature does not make it reliable at all. SSD was never made as a backup source. It was conceived with the purpose of bypassing our biggest limitation in computer speed\u2026. The God Darn Platters! Something that been making us need more and more ram so that the slower platters can load everything in memory because access is too slow on the HDD. In case of a failure, a SSD will be in a complete failures for 99% of users. Of course, there is a work around\u2026 But unless you disable the TRIM beforehand. Your data extraction would be a complete mess and if you pay a lot for it. You will pay several hundreds of dollars for a very small SSD\u2026 Worst of all.. Would you really want to disable TRIM ??? No! TRIM allow for faster writing AND give your SSD longevity. This mean that disabling TRIM simply make the SSD even less reliable. On the other hand, the HDD data is physically written! This mean that the only way to lose the data is to physically destroy the platters. This result in a HDD being much more reliable for DATA than a SSD as any issues on the HDD can simply be fixed by replacing the broken part. Just remember that the FBI in the US made the point very often.. The only real way to 100% destroy the data on a HDD is to open it and hammer it into pieces\u2026 Now That Is Reliable! SSD VS HDD Breakage mean dead(Cry!) VS Breakage mean repair (Love It!) SSD Silent(Love It!) VS HDD Noisy(Cry!) SSD Data Recovery is complicated/ultra expensive and using a HDD alongside is the only real safety which would cost 10\u201320 times less than technicians extraction SSD data (Cry!) VS Data Safety(Love It!) SSD Fast Vs HDD Slow SSD is vulnerable to electrical discharge/overload regardless of protections claimed to \u201cminimize\u201d damage.(Yes, they dont say prevent damage!) vs HDD that might simply have it\u2019s board fried and need replacement while keeping the data 100% safe. You be the judge. Is SSD more reliable ? Conclusion SSD is great for going fast like you would on a Ferrari, but you would probably prefer to be more padded like a tank with a HDD for security and the fun extra space it provide. It may be faster to write in sand vs a rock.. But once you write on a rock, it can stay there for thousands of years. P.S. As a funny extreme scenario! Just imagine a solar flare happening burning all the electrical components\u2026 SSD = Dead/Data is loss, HDD data = HDD board is dead and only need a new one constructed\u2026 The data IS SAFE! ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Speed, ignorance of degrading like fragmentation, robustness, physical size, power requirements, heat creation, sound generation. To elaborate: You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a SSD slower than around 4 times the speed of even the fastest HDD. Most (these days) are 10s of times faster.SSDs just don\u2019t get affected by fragmentation at all, while it\u2019s the bane of HDDs - so the more you use the drive the less speedy it becomes (while with SSD it doesn\u2019t matter how fragmented - it\u2019s still the same speed). Of course using some file systems like EXT4 / BTRFS / etc. alleviates fragmentation, let\u2019s face it most still use fragmentation prone file systems like FAT / NTFS - say thanks to Microsoft for that.Drop a SSD on the floor and it will still work. Do so to a HDD and all your data is lost as will the drive be completely useless.A SSD can easily be much smaller in physical size than a HDD, especially if you consider same capacities. The only reason some older SSDs are the same size as the HDD they\u2019re replacing is because they need to get mounted into the same slot - most of the space inside is just air. But with things like M2 mounts you can see all they need to be is a card (around the size of a credit card).The SSDs tend to use less than a 1/10 th of the power that a HDD does, so stuff like battery life gets extended. If you go with an economical HDD like a WD Green, you then loose even more speed, and usually also compromise on robustness, longevity and / or sound generation.Due to less moving parts and no mechanical whatsoever, there is no friction - i.e. one less source of heat.SSDs are completely silent, while HDDs always generate vibrations, motors spinning up and even scraping sounds.The usual \u201cfear\u201d against SSDs is write-life-cycle, though in all cases HDDs tend to actually perform worse. That\u2019s due to them constantly breaking because of their mechanical movement. Causing things like wear on their moving parts. At present SSDs tend to last about the same to slightly longer than similar HDDs - do some web searching on life expectancies of SSD vs HDD, you\u2019ll be surprised to see the empirical test data. The only benefit HDD has over SSD is cost - if you compare similar capacities. I.e. a 1TB HDD tends to be cheaper than a 1TB SSD. If you compare against things like life expectancies then the pricing is much closer - e.g. a server grade HDD is about the same cost as a SSD of the same capacity (while their expected life - measured in how many times they\u2019re overwritten - is about the same).
