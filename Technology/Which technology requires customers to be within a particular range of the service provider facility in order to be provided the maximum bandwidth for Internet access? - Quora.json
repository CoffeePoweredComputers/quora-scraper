            "answer_text": "All. A high-speed financial trader is almost always located within 100 meters from the marketplace. The key reason is that copper Ethernet is so much faster than optical fiber\u2026. In this case, it is not the bandwidth that is the key it is latency. Latency is basically the chosen technology added to the distance multiplied with the inverse of speed of light then multiplied with a speed factor that is about 0.6 for optical fiber and higher for copper connections. The next example is ADSL, VDSL, and all other xDSL technology, the closer between endpoints the higher bandwidth. All radio-based technology, the closer the endpoints are, the higher bandwidth is archived at any given technology. Even when it comes to optical fibers, the closer the endpoints are the higher speeds can be reached with a given amount of energy. And we should be as energy-efficient as possible. ",

            "answer_text": "xDSL, this technology has a maximum distance of about 18000 feet. The closer you are to the carrier\u2019s central office the more bandwidth you will see. WiFi technology and Cellular are also affected by distance. WiFi is more noticeable because of the relatively short distance that the signal carries. ",
