You need to change motherboard or repair if possible. CPU may also need to re install again.If there is no movement of fan and nothing happened than power supply may need to replace.",

            "answer_text": "\u201cCan't boot\u201d is a woefully inadequate description lacking any useable detail. What exactly happens? Are all the components known good/working? Does it boot into the BIOS? Then it's a peripheral issue, SSD/HDD, GPU are forcing it. Do you get any PBIT beeps? They tell you the issue. Is the PSU fully functional? Not just voltage but also check it's not crowbarring. Go back to basics, disconnect everything and reboot. Repeat the checks. Still no joy then reset the BIOS, if the settings have corrupted then it that can prevent everything from working. ",
