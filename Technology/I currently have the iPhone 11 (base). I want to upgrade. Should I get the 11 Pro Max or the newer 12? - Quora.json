And then you\u2019ll probably find some good deals on the 11 Pro Max and you\u2019ll know whether to get the old or the new phone. The 11 Pro Max will still be an incredible piece of mobile hardware in a month or even a year. It\u2019s just basically up to you to decide if it\u2019s enough for you or if the \u201ciPhone 12\u201d lineup, if it\u2019s called that, has something to offer that you\u2019d be really missing. ",
