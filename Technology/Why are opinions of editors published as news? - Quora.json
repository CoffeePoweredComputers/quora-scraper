            "answer_text": "In America, opinions are published as opinions. News(papers) are simply the vehicle for dissemination and delivery. The other part of the equation is reception and processing. A reader has the onus of discerning and determining news worthiness, not the newspaper publisher. Last time I checked my news(paper) literally led with news. It\u2018s not until I arrive several pages in to a section clearly labeled \u201copinion/editorial\u201d that the publisher announces and alerts the reader to the transition. Yes, I have a high school education and then some. It prepared me to recognize and understand the distinction between news and opinion, no matter where or how they are published. I admit to helping abandoned and neglected animals more than I help humans. I hope this response will balance the scales for a moment. ",
