            "answer_text": "The somewhat frightening part of this is that no one really knows. As with mobile phones, smart watches use microwaves to send and receive signals (so that it can get through the thickness of the atmosphere where radio waves cannot). However, use of mobile phones and by extension smart watches is very recent, so it isn't long enough to know the long term effects of using microwaves. However, it is unlikely that they do cause cancer, since it tends to be gamma radiation and UV light that cause cancer, and those are on the opposite end of the electromagnetic spectrum - so their wavelength is shorter and they carry more energy and thus more dangerous radiation. Since it is this ionising radiation that causes cancer (one of the causes anyway) it is unlikely that smart watches cause cancer or can cause cancer. Microwaves have a long wavelength and do not carry much energy, so they don't really have enough to ionise DNA to cause rapid mutations and thus cancer. You are more than likely to be fine if you use one. There have been no incidents of cancer from prolonged use of smart watches, but as I said before, it could take a long time before we see any evidence - but it may still occur nonetheless. ",

            "answer_text": "Electromagnetic field exposure, particularly, non-ionizing radiation has been shown to create hydroxyl and peroxynitrite free radicals in humans, which are very dangerous. Since EMF exposure is cumulative, it is difficult to pin point if one single factor is the cause of a cancer diagnosis, but things like smart watches do expose their user to non-ionizing radiation 24/7, or as long as the user is wearing it. This is one source of exposure, so it could contribute to inflammation, free radical creation and oxidative stress, all of which can lead to chronic health issues like cancer. ",
