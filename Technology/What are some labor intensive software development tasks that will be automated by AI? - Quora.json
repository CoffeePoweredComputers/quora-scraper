AI will be useful for automating control and monitoring, and then presenting the state of affairs in some human-understandable ways while essentially regulating itself. There are many examples of this in human society, so AI will be widely applied. ",

I think it wouldn\u2019t be too much harder for it to offer to hoist out duplicated code into a common function that can be used in multiple places. There are a lot refactoring chores that could be improved on. ",
