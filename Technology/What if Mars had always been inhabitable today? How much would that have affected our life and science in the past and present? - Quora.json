            "answer_text": "What if Mars had always been inhabitable today? Making Mars habitable would change its appearance. Rather than being a red moving dot in the night sky, it would be blue-white. That might sound trivial, but\u2026  How much would that have affected our life and science in the past and present? \u2026how many cultures decided Mars had something to do with fire, war, or blood because it was red? How many religions made decisions based on that red star? How many armies marched and how many decisions were made by astrologers based on the red dot? Now change it. Make it blue or blue-white. Before you can figure out what we - the modern world of the last 150 years - might do about a habitable Mars, you need to figure out how the first 250,000 years of human history would react. I can\u2019t guess exactly what that would do, but I can estimate one thing: the modern world as we know it wouldn\u2019t exist. History would be utterly different. This other timeline with a habitable Mars might never have left the paleolithic era. It might\u2019ve industrialized 100,000 years ago. If the other timeline did develop spaceflight then I\u2019m sure it\u2019d be quite interested in Mars. ",

            "answer_text": "Being inhabitable is one thing. Having enough resources to support a large number of colonists is another story altogether. The ISS is \u201cinhabitable\u201d, but we must constantly replenish consumables at the price of about $10,000 per pound. Imagine how much more it would cost to resupply a Mars colony. We would quickly use up our GDP, and require huge tax increases just for that small project. And even if, by some miracle, there were bountiful resources, it would take a long time to get ahead of the power curve to the point where anything mo9re than a small colony could support itself. It would not be a matter of resources at that point, but a lack of labor. Each new person you sent up there would be a huge burden until such time as he/she produced enough to justify their existence. The time may come when we can colonize other worlds. BUT, I fear we have to figure out how to economically defeat gravity to make it plausible. ",
