My Lenovo Vibe K5+ (3+16 Gb FHD Screen SD616 CPU) of 2016 is almost new with original battery still holding a day's charge but it doesn't have VoLte, support for Jio SIM. But with Vi\u2122 Airtel SIM it works fine on 4G & H+. I plan to continue with it as it is my first smartphone with full aluminium metal body. Always best, to keep a backup mobile in case your main one fails or is lost. So don't sell it is my advice. Swami Aniruddha ",
