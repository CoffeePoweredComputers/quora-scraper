            "answer_text": "First method that i know of, is traditonally there was a mud wash. This mud was one that must belong to some clay variety like kaolin or bentonite type im jot sure, with dirt attracting qualities. But the clothes came out clean. No chemicals Secondly you could use soap nut, which creates lather and helps wash the clothes. Third method i know of is to use a ultrasonic cleaning tank and clean the clothes without soap or detergent but it needs electrical energy. Godrej makes a machine i think. ",
