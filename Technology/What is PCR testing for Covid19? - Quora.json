            "answer_text": "COVID-19 is a disease caused by infection of a virus called SARS-CoV-2. PCR is an initialization standing for polymerase chain reaction. PCR is a technique in molecular biology used to make many copies of genetic material (amplification) so that you can start with a very small sample of material and produce a theoretically unlimited amount of it. A COVID-19 PCR test uses a variation on PCR called RT-PCR. PCR works with DNA, but the virus that causes COVID-19 uses RNA as its genetic material. RNA and DNA are very similar, both molecules are a string of bases (represented by the letters A, C, G, and T in DNA and A, C, G, and U in RNA), but the enzymes that PCR can only make copies of DNA. So, the first step of the process is to add an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which will make a DNA copy of an RNA molecule. Once the RNA is converted to DNA, regular PCR is done. Every \u201ccycle\u201d of the reaction doubles the number of copies of the DNA molecule: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16 -> 32 -> 64 -> 128 -> 256 -> 1024 \u2026 After a certain number of cycles a \u201cprobe\u201d is added to the solution - a chemical that is attached to DNA sequences that are specific to the viral genome (this is the important part of the test kit, SARS-CoV-2-specific probes). These probes will stick to the viral sequence, if present, and glow when hit with UV light. An instrument can measure the brightness of the glow, and tell how much of the virus was present in the sample \u2014 if none, there\u2019s no detectable glow at all. Further, since the brightness of the glow is proportional to the amount of the genetic material present, and you know how many times you cycled the DNA (doubling each time), you can calculate how much viral genetic material there was in the original sample.

            "answer_text": "There are three different kinds of Covid-19 tests. The following is based on Wikipedia and: Diagnostic testing and screening for SARS-CoV-2 Viral tests: They show a current infection by detecting the genetic material of the virus. They are based on the method of \u201creverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\u201d (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction - Wikipedia). This is the kind of test you are asking about.Antigen tests: They show a current infection by detecting the presence of a viral antigen, typically part of a surface protein.Antibody tests: They show a prior infection (or ongoing infection but not in the initial phase) by detecting the antibodies which the immune system continues to produce even after the viral infection has ended. Two important things: a) Detecting antibodies in a person is not the same as showing that that person is immune to COVID-19 (while this is most likely the case). b) People who are still in the recovery phase after an infection, people who are asymptomatic, and those who only had mild symptoms might be antibody negative (or their antibodies are below the threshold of detection). \u2192 Antibody tests are not for detecting current infection or current infectivity. Antibody tests are based on different methods: lateral flow tests (Lateral flow test - Wikipedia), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA - Wikipedia), or neutralization assays.",
