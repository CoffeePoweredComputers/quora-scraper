            "answer_text": "\"Digital traffic channels: The most notable difference between the two generations is that first generation systems are almost purely analog, where as second generation systems are digital. In particular, the first generation systems are designed to support voice channels using FM; digital traffic is supported only by the use of a modem that converts the digital data into analog form. Second generation systems provide digital traffic channels. These readily support digital data; voice traffic is first encoded in digital form before transmitting. Of course, for second generation systems, the user traffic (data or digitized voice) must be converted to an analog signal for transmission between the mobile unit and the base station. Encryption: Because all of the user traffic, as well as control traffic, is digitized in second generation systems, it is a relatively simple matter to encrypt all of the traffic to prevent eavesdropping. All second generation systems provide this capability, whereas first generation systems send user traffic in the clear, providing no security. Error detection and correction: The digital traffic stream of second generation systems also lends itself to the use of error detection and correction techniques. The result can be very clear voice reception. Channel access: In first generation systems, each cell supports a number of channels. At any given time a channel is allocated to only one user. Second generation systems also provide multiple channels per cell, but each channel is dynamically shared by a number of users using time division multiple access (TDMA) or code division multiple access (CDMA).\" ",

Examples are ENIAC, UNIVAC I, IBM 650, IBM 701 etc. The early relay computers could also be included here (Z3, Harvard Mark 1). The second generation (1956-1963) used discrete transistors (but not integrated circuits). Examples are the IBM 7090 and 7094, UNIVAC 1107, PDP-1 and 8, etc. Both the first and second generation used punched cards for input and output, and magnetic tape drives for mass storage. First generation used electrostatic memory, mercury delay lines and core memory for local storage; second generation used just core memory. ",
