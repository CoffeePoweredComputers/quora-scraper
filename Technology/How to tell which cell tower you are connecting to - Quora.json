            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t. Many moons ago, you could punch in a code and put the phone in \u201ctest mode\u201d it would give you signal strength in dbm (though not very accurately, we used to calibrate ours and build a table. If the phone says XXdbm, it\u2019s really YYdbm). It also told you what channel you were on, and with a map, that told you what channels were used where, you could figure it out. But the certain manufacturers started refusing to do it because of the added cost I writing the code to change how the phone tracked things, to somethings human\u2019s could read. By cutting that cost (they said) they could reduce phone cost to the consumer. I have my doubts. But they also said that the testing required to make sure that everytime they pushed out a software update, the test function could get buggy, or worse, the test software could make the other phone software buggy. And regression testing this \u201ctest\u201d functionality with every software change became a burden, so the stopped building in a consumer accessible way to do it. They can still plug in a test set and read it, but not in convenient English. ",

            "answer_text": "If you happen to have an iPhone that has not had an upgrade to iOS11, then type *3001#12345#* (call button) on your telephone keypad, and a screen entitled \u201cfield service\u201d opens up. You can read a lot of data from there, including the cell ID, and the IDs of neighbor cells. There are registers of cell IDs and towers available from regulatory bodies (FCC). Feel free to ask, and if they hesitate, tell them that you are annoyed, and want to complain to the owner. In Android there are field services apps available (google for them) which do the same thing. For up to date iPhone, I don\u2019t know a solution, unfortunately. Apple has removed that function with iOS11. ",
