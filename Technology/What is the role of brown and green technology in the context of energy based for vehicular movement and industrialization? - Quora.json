            "answer_text": "Somewhere along the way Green and brown flipped positions in the transportation industry. Green electric cars are less efficient than gasoline and diesel powered cars. It makes very little sense to pour more coal into a car for energy, than gasoline . Using 4 gallons of crude oil to make 3 gallons of ethanol that drives as far as 2 gallons of gasoline is insane. So there ya go. The role/purpose of green technology in the automotive industry's is to use more brown technology. It is pretty much the same idea as wind turbines. It seems as though the green crowd want to stop using carbon energy faster, by running out sooner. I am OK with it. I hate winters in the North East. ",
