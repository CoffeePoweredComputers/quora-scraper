            "answer_text": "Easy. First borrow a few billion dollars from your uncle. You will need that much cash to build ultra-clean factories equipped with very expensive photo lithography machines. Then you need about 100 very trained IC designers. Direct them to design a better op-amp or comparator or A/D or D/A or microprocessor or whatever. If they succeed and you still have money left, sell them at barely over your cost until they become popular. ",

I suggest you look at tasks that network operators, datacenters and other big service and social media providers do at a very deep level and get to putting some ideas together. The idea is important, the implementation process is very well understood. ",
