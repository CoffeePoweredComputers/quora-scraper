If you have an iPhone and want to purchase an Apple watch then you can simply go for it because it will be one of your best investments. But if you don't own an iPhone but still want a smart watch you can buy samsung gear 3. If you just interested in buying a good looking watch and have 350$ to spend then you have many options from one of the best watch manufacturers. Ps: You will need an iPhone to start your Apple watch, it won't work otherwise. ",
