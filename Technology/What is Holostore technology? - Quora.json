            "answer_text": "Holostore technology (Holographic data storage) is a mass storage technology that uses three-dimensional holographic images to enable more information to be stored in a much smaller space. The technology uses holograms which are created when a light from a single laser beam is split into two beams; the signal beam (which carries the data) and the reference beam. In holographic storage, at the point where the reference beam and the data carrying signal beam intersect, the hologram is recorded in the light sensitive storage medium. When you create a variance in the reference beam angle or media position then hundreds of unique holograms can be recorded in the same volume of material. To read the stored holographic data, the reference beam is deflected off the hologram reconstructing the stored information. This hologram is then projected onto a detector that reads the entire data page of over one million bits at once. ",

            "answer_text": "Holostore technology is a data storing technology which is different from our conventional data storage which work on linear systems, holostore work just as an 3d system. It is used for storing large data in a small space, it works on light, which splits into two parts, and it is in coherent form thus after that it makes again an single beam on an illuminating metal\u2026.. There is an process of excitation takes place in which the hole formation and free electrons are created\u2026. Thus at a single volume more than thousands of holograms can be created these are of two types (WORM) write once read many and rewritable also\u2026. Holograms can be accessed by using the same parent beam of light on photosensitive material and an interference pattern is created which is then detected by an detectors\u2026.. This is an new technology used for storage of data and much efficient than optical and magnetic data storage technology's ",
