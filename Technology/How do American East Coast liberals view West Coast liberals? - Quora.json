            "answer_text": "I've spent years as an East Coast Liberal (if you count Florida, anyway, and most people don't if they can avoid it), a Midwest Liberal, and now a West Coast Liberal. To the best of my recollection, my fundamental beliefs didn't change from one region to the next, although there was a definite difference in the prevailing political issues that faced each region. I talked more about the environment on the east coast (and now on the west coast too), for example, than I ever did growing up in the midwest. I talk more about marijuana legalization on the west coast. I talked a lot more about NASA support when I was in Florida. Each region had topics that just naturally came up more often in conversation and public policy discussions. I had the same views no matter where I lived, but you might not have known it if you only spoke to me in one particular geographic region. From what I've seen, that's true across the country. When I bring up \"liberal\" topics in California, I get the same answers and opinions I do when I mention them in Florida. You have people on all ends of the liberal spectrum in both areas; if I bring up drug testing for welfare recipients, for example, by and large most liberals are against it. People are probably more vehement in their opinions in Florida, where welfare drug testing was legally implemented, but the fundamental percentages of pro- and anti-testing liberals is roughly the same. When I visit Boston, or Cleveland, or New York, or Seattle, I see the same thing. So based on my experiences, I don't think there really is a difference among liberal groups as a whole. Liberals take up different issues depending on where they live, but basic liberal philosophy doesn't change much from one region to the next. (That's not to say there aren't some entrenched historical divisions in the liberal movement, though. For many years, \"liberal\" meant something very different in the South than it did elsewhere. That seems to be changing as travel and communication become easier. There are fewer people who call themselves \"liberal,\" but those who do seem to align more or less with the core ideals of the movement.) What it really comes down to, then, is the perception of liberals in various regions by other liberals (which means not even counting the perceptions forced on regional liberals by conservatives and other non-liberal groups). That definitely IS an issue. I notice it both here on the west coast and when I lived on the east coast. Although both groups seem to acknowledge they're in fundamental agreement on the problems facing the country, each group thinks the other isn't emphasizing the right things. If I had to characterize it, the divide would come down to one basic question: what's the right way to fix the societal issues plaguing our country? To use your example, I didn't encounter many liberals on the east coast who considered west coast liberals to be people looking for a handout (or, more accurately, west coast liberals to be people looking to give others a handout). Rather, they thought west coast liberals weren't attacking the problem of income inequality the right way. You don't hear many liberals accuse other liberals of anything even close to \"handout,\" since that's such a conservatively-charged term. Instead they argue about what's the best way to fix the system. East coast liberals tend to be a little more cerebral in their thinking, trying to find big picture solutions that will be more permanent. West coast liberals tend to be more practical, trying to find more immediate solutions that fix some problems right away. That might feed into a perception of west coast liberals as the handout-providers and the east coast liberals as the solid believers (or, if you're on the west coast, west coast liberals as the great equalizers and east coast liberals as the Ivy League elitists). Most of the time, though, meeting a liberal from the opposite coast is a happy time to reflect on how liberal issues transcend geographical boundaries. And maybe a time to make some jokes about a few key GOPers, if you think you're lacking enough common ground. ",
