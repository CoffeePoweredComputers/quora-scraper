            "answer_text": "Americans should most definitely be cautious about government-sponsored hacking groups (called Advanced Persistent Threats\u2014APTs) from all over the world. The US infrastructure is poorly prepared for deliberate attacks, especially from groups that are well-funded and well-motivated. And the worst part of the current situation is the continued blindness to the danger by some of the Americans who are responsible for protecting that infrastructure, and think that their half-measures in place now are adequate. Russia, from all legitimate attribution assessments, likely controls several of the APTs. And Russian-connected APTs have shown their willingness to attack a country\u2019s infrastructure by hacking Ukraine\u2019s power grid, energy suppliers, railroads, and mining companies. But Russia is only one of the APT origin countries to be cautious about. If the US power grid were taken down, it will do the same amount of damage no matter what group is responsible. ",
