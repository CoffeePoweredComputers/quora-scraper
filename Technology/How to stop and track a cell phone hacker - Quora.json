            "answer_text": "You really need to elaborate on this. Who did they hack? How did they hack? Or is this just a hypothetical? Generally \u201chacking\" is either someone knowing your passwords, or you installing a virus by accident. Both are easily avoidable by not installing apps from outside the app store, or apps with negative reviews. As to passwords, don't use the same password for everything and use unique, long passwords. A password manager might be usefull to keep track of them all. ",
