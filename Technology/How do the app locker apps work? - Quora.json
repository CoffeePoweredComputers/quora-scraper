            "answer_text": "The one issue at the top of most mobile users' minds should be security. We carry around so much precious data, and when it's lost, trouble often ensues. To that end, Android developers are always searching for new and improved methods to help give your ever-growing mobile world even more ways to secure that data. There are instances when security can come in the simplest forms, such as keeping prying eyes out of certain apps. You might hand your phone over to someone so they can make a call or look at a picture. If you turn your back, that user could always dig into your data. Fortunately, there are ways to keep certain applications readily available while others are locked down. One such method is a third-party app called AppLock. With AppLock, you can create a specific PIN (or an app-specific PIN) that can then be used to lock down whatever applications you wish to secure. It's incredibly simple to use. Here are some AppLock features: Lock any appRe-lock policyMulti-lock feature (Pro version only): Add different locks to different appsAuto-lock base on Time or Wi-Fi (Pro version only)Disguise feature (Pro version only)Theme supportWidget for quick lock and unlockQuick lock switcher on status barLock Android installerLock incoming or outgoing callsLock access to phonePrevent AppLock uninstallationAuto restart (to prevent app from being killed by task killers)",
