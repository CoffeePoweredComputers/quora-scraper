            "answer_text": "Biggest problem for IT: Teaching people that Information is only a carrier of Knowledge and there is nothing in Information Technology that necessarily conveys Truth. Data is encoded with a Language to create Information that can be conveyed to the User which then needs to Understand the Language to decode Knowledge of the Data. This encoding and decoding of Information is error prone and can result in the User receiving False Knowledge. If multiple Users receive the same Information there is no way to prove that all Users decoded the Information correctly. Misunderstanding even one word can result in False Knowledge. ",

Innovations in technology, along with completely new business models, are part of the rapid change that is forcing corporate and management professionals to learn, deploy, and adopt IT for survival and competitive advantage. IT is no longer just a back-office function, but a strategic business function as well. The success of IT hinges largely on the ability of all the stakeholders to understand,apply, and adopt it. There are numerous examples of large IT investments proving to be wasted, due to lack of understanding, incorrect application, or faltering during its adoption. Same is narrated in a video on Youtube.[refer below]  Have shared few more specific observations on Skill-Gap in my most recent blog \u2192 Shreekant Shiralkar (\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0915\u093e\u0902\u0924 \u0936\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0933\u0915\u0930)'s post in Game based Approach ",
