            "answer_text": "Kind-of. What you\u2019re referring to is more technically called unsupervised learning. Essentially the algorithm finds patterns in the data that it\u2019s presented on the input. The most architecture case I\u2019ve seen involves it copying the input to the output but being deliberately designed to have insufficient internal memory to reconstruct the input fully. It therefore has to recreate the input by essentially compressing it. Where it gets interesting is when you look at the compression algorithm it develops. It can do some interesting things, but often what it thinks is interested is less interesting to people. It\u2019s also hard to fine-tune what it\u2019s doing in situations where it is only somewhat interesting. I personally prefer reinforcement learning, in which you tell the algorithm that it has passed or failed but nothing else. There are a great many problems which cannot be solved by conventional algorithms but can be evaluated as passing. The extra input makes it much easier to guide this sort of algorithm into interesting behaviours. ",
