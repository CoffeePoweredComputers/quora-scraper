You can strengthen them with exercise, just like any other muscle. tighten, hold, relaxtighten, hold, relaxRepeat. You can vary the number of repetitions and the length of time you hold the muscles tense. ps: probably what your boyfriend(s) is experiencing is that your anus is relaxed, not loose. If stuff was coming out of your anus when you didn\u2019t want it to come out, that would be loose. They complain about this? Really? ",

            "answer_text": "If you are engaging in frequent anal sex you cannot make it tighter as the muscles have been stretched to the point where they do not contract fully with stretch marks around the perimeter of the anus. This will make anal sex easier for you so not necessarily a bad thing unless you overdo it. If you want it tighter restrict anal play to small things like a finger. ",
