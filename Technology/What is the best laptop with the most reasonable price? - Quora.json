            "answer_text": "tl;dr: consider the Dell XPS 13, Dell Latitude 7490, or any of the Lenovo T-series machines. \u201cBest laptop\u201d depends entirely on your needs (/wants.) Anyone who says there is a single one-size fits all best laptop doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. At the extremes, there are machines that are VERY highly optimized for portability (e.g. the Macbook 12\u2033 and similar PC ultraportables) and there are machines optimized for gaming/coding/etc which are much heavier (and usually have large screens.) Someone for whom one or the other of those would be \u201cbest\u201d would likely be extremely unhappy with the other \u2014 and there definitely are people for whom \u201cbest\u201d qualifies as one or the other. \u201cReasonably priced\u201d is also relative to what you needs/want, and how much you can afford. Even if we ask the more \u201cthe best inexpensive laptop for general use,\u201d we\u2019re still going to get into very different definitions of \u201cinexpensive,\u201d some different definitions of \u201cgeneral use,\u201d and different preferences in things like screen size, keyboard style, and the religious war over Mac vs. PC (and whether a Chromebook counts as a laptop, or for that matter whether something like an Android tablet or iPad Pro with a keyboard counts as a laptop.) Moreover, laptop models change over relatively quickly (typically a major new version of ongoing model lines about once a year when Intel updates its processors, and often a mid-year refresh, and on the PC side consumer models sometimes come and go quicker than that) so any specific laptop recommendation is going to get old fast. That said, at a very high level, a couple of short recommendations:* The sweet spot for price/readability/portability is pretty much 13\u2033 size machines these days, whether you\u2019re looking at a PC, a Mac, or a Chromebook. Going to a 14\u2033 or 15\u2033 machine on a consumer PC (not Mac) will generally save you a little money, at the expense of a bigger, heavier machine. 14\u2033 business machines tend to also be a bit of a happy medium \u2014 the Dell Latitude 14\u2033 and the Lenovo T480 for example. * How powerful a machine qualifies as \u201cgood enough\u201d is very dependent on your use, but in general except for Chromebooks I\u2019d recommend looking for a quad-core (8th generation) i5 if you can afford it \u2014 on the Mac side, that basically means you\u2019re looking at the Macbook Pro 13\u2033, which is pricey, and you\u2019re going to have a lot more affordable options on the PC side. * In terms of quality, a lot will depend on whether you want to optimize for appearance (in which case a slimmer ultrabook is better) or for durability (in which case a thicker business machine like a Dell Latitude or Lenovo Thinkpad T-series will be better) \u2026 or you can get a lower-end consumer machine to save money, which will be neither particularly thin NOR particularly durable.
