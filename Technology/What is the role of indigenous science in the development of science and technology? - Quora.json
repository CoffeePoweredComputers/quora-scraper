            "answer_text": "Indigenous as in science and technology developed by aboriginal people is the basis for many things we have today. The Mayans and Aztec people studied the stars and moon cycles to develop a calendar the basis of our present day calendar. The Chinese broke down a day into hours and minutes to create a water clock. South American aboriginals domesticated corn from a three grain grass to a cob of many kernels then traded that to other aboriginals right up into what is now Canada. Corn has since become the most used grain crop in the world feeding people, animals and fuel for transportation. . Aboriginals of northern areas discovered aspirin, in the form of red willow bark. People in the southern areas discovered curare from frogs, used today in hospitals around the world. Aboriginal or indigenous science and technology is the basis for many things we take for granted today. It is the origination of science and technology we have been able to build on. Even the idea of computers started in China with the creation of the abacus as a means to calculate and record large sums for weights, measures and finance. Indigenous Science and technology, I would say, is in some way or other the start of all the science and technology we have today. I suppose you could say that the bow and arrow lead to missiles in a way. We just use a different means of propulsion. ",

            "answer_text": "On my point of view there isn\u2019t a big role of indigenous science in the development of science and technology because indigenous science is to science and technology of today like is natural science of yesterday and once natural science is yet active and is studied by many people and these ones don\u2019t look for indigenous science as they look for natural science I believe that indigenous science had its importance on the days of the indigenous community whose community is already integrated on the community of today and so science and technology and most of all this last one has to do very little with indigenous science.
