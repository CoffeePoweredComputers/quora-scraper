            "answer_text": "Let me share with you my own experience. From the point of view of someone with no computer sciences background, the best way to access the IT field and get a job in the sector is via low code techonologies. But let me explain it you\u2026 4 years ago my programming skills were too low comparing to some freshman guy, so in order overcome my handicap and to accelerate my way in the IT field, instead of learning JAVA/.NET/Python/Angular from the scratch I decided to focus all my time and energy in learning low code technologies like Mulesoft, Tibco, WSO2 or Outsystems and I\u2019m so happy that I did it. But why I decided to invest my time learning low code technologies? Currently, there is a high demand in the market for low code developers so by learning the fundamentals about one specific technology you will have an open door to get your first interviews;It is a reality that the number of these specialized developers is low and therefore companies are willing to fight for each person that shows some knowledge about these technologies;Finally, low code technologies are easier to learn comparing to programming languages since they are more intuitive to understand and to learn thanks to the graphical interface used to design flows and implement some logic.Based on that, my advice is take one of the above low code technologies like Mulesoft, sign up for some courses in Udemy like \u201cLearn Mulesoft: 12 steps to master the development of APIs\u201d, get the fundamentals about the technology and start sending out your application to software consulting companies. Wish you all the best for your future. ",

            "answer_text": "That is really an irrelevant question because the simple answer is it depends. To someone with serious dev skills, engineering a complex program can be a walk in the park, to a less skilled person it\u2019s to convoluted so it\u2019s really up to the people involved. There are a variety of IT job that can fit into you own personal skill, it could be development\u2192coding, Network or System Engineering, Database, etc. So again the most honest answer is it depends.
