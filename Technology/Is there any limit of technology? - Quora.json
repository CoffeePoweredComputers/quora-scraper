            "answer_text": "For specific technologies, it is limited by physics and economics. The \"Animal Power System\" occupied the mainstream of our \"motive power usage mode\" until the end of the 18th century. In the thousands of years of development of carriage: the compartments have become larger, the seats have become more comfortable, the decoration has become more flowery. However, the core of the Carriage system, its motive power, has not continued to improve. In the long-term evolution of the carriage, whether it is military or commercial, whether it is the Eastern or Western carriage, there are carriages pulled by single, pair, four horses... eight horses. However, the \"number of horses\" cannot growing continuously. After at a specific limit, you cannot rely on \"increasing the number of horses\" to bring the \"growth of power.\" Why? Due to physical limitations:You can't guarantee that the output power of a complex multi-way system can be perfectly superimposed.After the number of horses increases, the complexity increases. The control system cannot guarantee that \"all horses' power\" will be in the same direction simultaneously;Therefore, after it reached \"a certain scale,\" \"the force that cancels each other\" is getting more.From the economic constraints:When the number of horses has increased, the horse's maintenance and forage burden have also increased.After the increase of the horse, if the \"power of the horse farm system increased\" can not offset the increase in spending, then \"adding horses\" is economically a loss-making business.Therefore, the final evolution of many civilizations in the \"Carriage System\" is the same: After reaching a particular scale, the horses will not be added. This model has been maintained for thousands of years. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are asking whether there's an end to new inventions, it's like asking if there's a limit to human creativity. Mankind will always and forever develop new technologies to overcome challenges\u200b to our security, existence, comfort, etc. The short answer there's no limits to human ingenuity for developing new technology. For specific technologies, there are limits imposed by science and nature. For example, it is theoretically and practically impossible to develop an engine that has 100% efficiency. In semiconductor technology, there's a limit to scaling - transistor density on a given chip size. Einstein's theory of relativity sets the ultimate speed limit to be the speed of light. It is also impossible to invent a machine to travel back in time nor a closed-loop perpetual motion machine. I\u2019ll bet no technology can ever be developed that can bring a dead person back to life. Many existing technology limits can be overcome by substituting new technologies, eg, graphene to replace steel for some applications. ",
