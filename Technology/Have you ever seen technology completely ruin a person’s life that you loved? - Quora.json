A very good former friend of mine used to snap pictures any time she ran into someone she knew to receive \u201clikes\" and approval from other friends on her social media account. I even heard her tell her close friend in an incredulous tone the amount of likes she got on one picture. It's just crazy to think that we as human beings crave another's validation that much. It's not even in person nor is it from growing from a hard situation or doing something positive with their life. Their self worth is contingent on posting a selfie. ",
