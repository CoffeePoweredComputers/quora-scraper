            "answer_text": "So. You probably saw some YouTube video, they built this really cool little thing and it is all done on a tiny little computer. Looks something like this-  Pretty sick huh? Tell me about it. But you are actually really interested in it and want to get started! How, and what do you need? Good question. A Raspberry Pi. So, obviously you\u2019ll need he actual board. If you don\u2019t have it, you cant really do what you want. So find a website or store and buy one. Depending on the type and model you get, they can range from as low as 10$ to 50$. Pretty affordable.A monitor. So, you don\u2019t actually NEED a monitor. But it is going to be SO MUCH EASIER. You can actually buy displays the Pi company has made specifically made for the Pi. These however are a little more expensive.You could also use your TV as a monitor, providing both the TV and the Pi can be hooked up via HDMI. VGA to HDMI would work too. Many different solutions can be used when it comes to the cable you use for a monitor, or all around screen. Adapters come in all shapes, sizes and forms. (Thanks sent to Michael Lush for recommending this)A power source. You\u2019ll need to power the Pi to use it. Most of the time, you will get a little charger to use with the Pi. Using this specific charger will probably be the best, as it will always pull enough power from the wall into your Pi.A mouse, and keyboard. You will need a mouse and keyboard. This is pretty much mandatory. Well, only for the actual screen portion of the Pi. Models 3 B+ and up have built in Bluetooth, so you can have cordless mouse and keyboard if you would like! That\u2019s pretty cool.Depending on the model, you will need an Ethernet cable to have internet. Models 3 B+ and up have a built in WiFi chip. So you can have a wireless internet connection if you so please.A microSD card with the image you want to use. When you buy the Pi, you will need to have an SD card. The newer models use microSD cards. Putting the SD card into the Pi without anything on it wont do anything though, you'll need an image. Images for the Pi can be found along the internet for downloads. The standard image used for the Pi right now is NOOBS Debian.Time, patience and dedication. These are VERY important when working with the Pi. Why? Because the Pi is powerful, yet it can be confusing at times. Especially for a \u201cnoob\u201d.Those things should get you started. The power a single Pi can hold is incredible. If you would like a few ideas on what you can DO with the Pi, take a look at my other answer here- Tom Rannd's answer to What kind of use can a non-computer tech person get out of a Raspberry Pi? ",

            "answer_text": "Just start with what you know. The Operating System you choose to use with your Raspberry Pi will determine how you interact with your Raspberry Pi. Besides Raspbian OS which is Linux based there are a variety of other 3rd party Operating Systems you could choose to use for your Raspberry Pi. Circa 2019, you have a variety of options to choose from; Ubuntu MATEUbuntu CoreUbuntu ServerWindows 10 IoT CoreOpen Source Media Center (OSMC)and many more others including Fedora and those others which will come. See below screenshot from Raspberry Pi Downloads - Software for the Raspberry Pi  If you do not want to digress further away from Windows, use Windows 10 IoT Core. Otherwise if you are comfortable using a Linux based Operating System most of the images for booting Raspberry Pi modules are Linux based. You will be all set. A Raspberry Pi is just another computer just like all the computers you have used before only that it is portable and may not have some of the other features you find in a full scaled computer system but those are negligible with the current modern Raspberry Pi Modules. So where do you start? You already started if you are using Windows or a Linux based Computer. Maybe what you should be struggling with is, what is it that you want to solve using a logic processing unit that is equivalent to that of a computer but where a computer would not be ideal for that scenario. When you have a business problem let me just say a technical problem that you want to solve, a Raspberry Pi will automatically fit the bill and you will soon find yourself replicating what you would have done with a computer in your Raspberry Pi. As long as you can figure out how to power your Raspberry Pi module, there is no where you cannot use it. It is just another computer with most of the essential capabilities you will find in an ordinary computer. To summarize my answer, grab a Raspberry Pi module, find a Raspberry Pi OS image that you are comfortable using or have experience using and boot your Raspberry Pi module with it. There is nothing else that is out of the ordinary from what you have encountered on other computing platforms you have used previously. Your Raspberry Pi module is just a portable computer more minuscule in size that you can plant it anywhere you need a computer to solve a problem for you whether in a farm, in an equipment, at a research lab or any other place where you need it even plugging it on your drone to perform other multiple activities while your drone is airborne. Hope this answer helps. ",
