            "answer_text": "I'm 100% eligible to answer this question because I'm using Railwire broadband for more than a year. I'm from Tamil Nadu. Plans for Tamil Nadu is bit better than other states because they provide 600 GB of data with 100 Mbps(Edit: It\u2019s pure unlimited now for the same price and speed) speed for 999 RS. Whereas in other states they only give 350 GB or 400. You can check that at this link https://railwire.co.in/tarrifs-and-plans.php Now, let's talk about speed and stability. Like I said I subscribed for 100 Mbps plan but I always get more than that. When I download large files it usually goes around 100\u2013160 Mbps (12.5 to 17 MBps). The stability of the connection is very good (this maybe depends on your local Operator, if you have a good and technical person then the connection will be good also you'll get quick support). Usually, cable TV operators will be tied up with the Railwire to provide Fiber connection in your area. *Oof I forget to mention that in some locations cable operator will give you connection with Coaxial cables but most of them are providing in Fiber as far as I know. For me, the connection stability was very very good. I play fortnite and pubg with this connection. I usually get ping around 18\u201320ms in fortnite and around 17\u201320ms in PUBG. Make sure to buy a good quality WiFi router by the way. For gaming, I would recommend connecting with Ethernet cable as it provides better stability over a WiFi connection. Overall my experience is very great with the RailWire connection. Edit: Currently I have opted to 200 Mbps plan. Don\u2019t know why I always get ridiculous speed like the below image. Anyways if you\u2019re planning to get one just go for it.  ",

            "answer_text": "The best suitable answer is \" It depends\" ... In some places, especially those close to railway lines have good fault clearance and less downtime... But in some other areas, the situation is just the opposite... But, since you're in trivandrum, it'll be good I suppose... Railwire is based on distributor model... It works like Arasu Cable in TN, where govt provides the content and bandwidth and operators distribute it to the customers... If your operator is good and customer friendly, then you can expect a good service from Railwire... I'm using Railwire in Chennai ( Suburban area) and it works like magic for me... I hardly have faced any downtime in the past 8 months... But beware, it's like BSNL, if a fault occurs on Saturday, then you've to wait till Monday morning sometimes, to get the service back to normal... Edit 1: I\u2019m no longer using RailWire as the local cable operator shifted to Limras Eronet to provide Internet services. RailWire is only providing speeds upto 10Mbps here. Others are providing speeds upto 150Mbps. I guess that\u2019s the reason, the local cable operator changed the service provider. ",
