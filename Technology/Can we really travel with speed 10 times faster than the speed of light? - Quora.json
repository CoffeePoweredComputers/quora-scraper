            "answer_text": "No, but also Yes. \u2026\u2026. First, why No: The speed of light is always constant no matter how you approach it - if you run towards a beam of light, its speed will not increase relative to you. It remains 300 000 km/s. If you run with a beam of light, it will not decrease relative to your speed. It remain 300 000 km/s. Unlike speeds for anything else, the speed of light is invariant and not a relative phenomenon. The highest-energy photon and the lowest-energy photon ever observed, travel at precisely the same speed. Always. It means that if something seems to indicate the speed of light varies under certain conditions, the explanation is likely found elsewhere. It is hard just to accept that there is an upper limit by principle. I mean, why not?? To understand this, we have to realize that space is a geometric form bound by dimensions, and so by definition, also bound by limitations. The reason why a circle, for example, has only 360 degrees, no more and no less, is geometry. There is no such thing as a 361-degree circle. Some rules cannot be broken, no matter the level of creativity or power. We can, of course, mathematically add more degrees, but it does not change the fact. We cannot make a circle more circular. And so it is for the cosmic speed limit; we cannot make it speedier. Geometry is the real answer to this question. Our universe is composed of a 3-dimensional space and a 1-dimensional time, through which all interactions happen. This relationship (in a geometric coordinate system we call the universe) between a moving particle and space-time - in which one is producing an effect on the other - necessitates a finite end-result. Simply said; there must be limits for the reality to work. When we speed up, time relatively slows down and space relatively contracts \u2014 101 in Special and General Relativity. At the speed of light, time completely stops, and space completely flattens in the direction of motion. You cannot stop time more than completely, and you cannot flatten space more than flat. Sounds banal, and it is\u2026 but this is the answer. We have the same issue as with the circle example above. We cannot add more degrees to a circle\u2019s circumference, either. It is both impossible and nonsensical. Thus, it is a limit.  The illustrated coordinate system is a representation on how time flattens space. Y becomes X the faster you move. A different way to say this: When the cosmic speed limit is reached, time essentially ceases to exist and mass/energy become infinite. Therefore, it is not \u201cspeed\u201d or amount of mass that is limited per se, but the effect speed has on our space-time geometry, when it reaches 300 000 km/s.  \u2026\u2026. Now, why Yes: Since time is a function of speed, it means the internal referenced time is slowed down the faster one moves. Move at the speed of light and your time has slowed so much down that it stops. To the rest of the universe, you are still moving, but to you; your time is not ticking at all. And so, to you, you can move from point A to point B instantly. Be it 100 km in distance or a trillion light years. Instantly, is a hell of a lot faster than 10 times the speed if light. It sounds paradoxical. Because were you to move at the speed of light, from your perspective, you can move instantly to any point in the universe. However, to the rest of the universe, you are still \u201donly\u201d whooshing at mere 300 000 km/s. So who is right? You or the universe? Well, as Einstein has taught us; you both are. And thus, the answer must be No, but also Yes.  Thank you for the question, Lawson ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. In our imagination. In reality, no, C is the speed limit of the universe, and even light cannot exceed this speed, not even in a vacuum. (Calling C the speed of light is putting the cart before the horse, there\u2019s nothing about light that creates a speed limit, it\u2019s just that light is one of the few things that CAN go all the way to the speed limit) Imagine, instead of sitting there in your chair, that you are downstairs in the kitchen. How long did it take you to do that, a second? Now get up, walk down there, note how long it took, and then walk back up here. Took you thirty seconds you say? What if you ran? What if you jumped down the stairs, bounced off the walls, think you could do it in ten seconds? How come in your imagination you could do it in one? Because your imagination isn\u2019t bounded by reality. Imagine you\u2019re on the moon, jumping around in the low gravity, hopping in one of the cars to see if the battery still works. Took you just a second to get there, right? Well it took the Apollo crews three days, and it takes light 1.3 seconds, so you just exceeded \u201cthe speed of light\u201d (C). Imagine you\u2019re orbiting Alpha Centauri, secure in a bubble, free to zoom around and check out the planets, note how little the three stars of the Centauri system resemble the shots in SF posters. Took a second to get there? At C it would have taken 4.3 years. That\u2019s much much faster than 10 times C. In your imagination. ",
