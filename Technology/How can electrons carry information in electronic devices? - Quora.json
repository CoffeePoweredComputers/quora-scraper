            "answer_text": "In digital form, the presence or absence of a current ( a flow of electrons) or a voltage ( results in a flow of current or not)can represent a binary digit 1 or 0. Sequences of binary digits, currents being turned on or off, can represent binary numbers which are easily converted to more familiar decimal numbers. Analogue information is already covered in other answers. ",

            "answer_text": "Electrons themselves don\u2019t carry information. The voltage or current is modulated in some way to convey information by the changes generated in one part of the circuit and sensed by some other part. Those circuits could be very close to each other, or separated by thousands of miles or more. ",
