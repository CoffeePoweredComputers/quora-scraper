            "answer_text": "All the time, especially after surgeries or for PTSD. After my second shoulder surgery, s from a botched airborne landing they had me on Ativan for PTSd related panic attacks, valium formuscle spasms, and Oxycodone. After one day after the surgery,I told the orthopedic surgeon that I preferred hydrocodone and was immediately written a script for it along with Tramadol to take in between the Hydrocodone (didn\u2019t even ask for it). So they had me on 2 benzos and 3 different opiates at the same time. Once they caught this in their monitoring system 2 days post operation they asked me to come in so they could count my pills (the physicians assistants request, not the surgeon). I replied no, my wife is at work and I\u2019m in too much pain to give a shit about whether you think I\u2019m taking my medicine properly or not. The same physicians assistant had me on Ativan and Klonopin at the same time too. I wound up physically dependent on these meds, especially the benzos that need to be tapered down and not stopped abruptly after long term use seeing as they\u2019re one of the few drugs that can actually kill you via seizure during withdrawal. The PA cut me off entirely at once. I was forced to self refer myself to a detox center to safely get off the medicine which took an month because of the doses prescribed and then immediately taken. I was treated like a common drug addict, especially when I returned to my unit. There\u2019s an example of multiple mistakes that most physicians would determine to be gross negligence in multiple ways. All doctors I saw in the Army were connected to a prescription monitoring system and knew exactly what medications and doses I was prescribed by any and all physicians. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know how often this happens, but fortunately there are enough checks to prevent a wrong prescription. Nurses are aware of medicines being prescribed and may take the doctor aside and ask her/him if they meant to prescribe that particular medication because, and then list the possible reasons why it might not be the best medication for that patient. If that doesn\u2019t happen, then there is always the pharmacist. a pharmacist will take in the patient\u2019s health history and be aware of medications the patient is already taking. She/he may call the physician to ask if this is the best medication for this patient because\u2026listing the reasons why another one might be better. But these checks aren\u2019t always successful. I once had a Peace Corps volunteer patient who had taken a break from her pharmacy profession to join PC. This was before medical records were computerized. I asked her if she would be returning to it once her PC duty had ended. Surprisingly, she responded that she wasn\u2019t sure and then told me what happened to her. A pregnant woman had come in to fill a prescription. The medication that was prescribed was known to cause serious birth defects. There were alternative medications that were just as effective but without this side effect. So the pharmacist called the doctor about the medication due to its side effect. The doctor became quite upset that his expertise was being questioned by a lowly female pharmacist and insisted that she provide this medication, she argued with him about how dangerous this could be to the fetus. He still insisted. She refused to fill the prescription explaining to the pregnant woman why she was refusing to fill it. The manager of the pharmacy fired her. A few months later she was given notice that she was being sued by the patient whose baby was born with serious birth defects. The lawsuit was also against the prescribing physician and the pharmacist who did fill the prescription. I asked her why she was included in this suit. It was on the grounds that she hadn\u2019t tried hard enough to prevent this woman from taking the prescription. Easily understandable why she was reluctant to return to her profession. ",
