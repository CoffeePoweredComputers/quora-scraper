            "answer_text": "People always say that I have quite a unique approach to onboarding new employees as a remote hiring manager. At first, I thought it was probably just because I hire remotely, but it's actually not. I've always been an uber-organized person, and I've integrated such mild neurosis into my onboarding process. Here are some of them that have proven to be game-changing, not just for me but for some other colleagues as well: Checklist systemFor many hiring managers, onboarding is just as simple as assisting the new hire to get used to the system, then leaving them to figure out the other things. Of course, we all know that's not as simple as that. There are steps to that or major parts that you need to monitor and lead them too. That's what my checklist system is for. Apparently, not many people use a checklist system to plan out there entire onboarding process. I get it though. Making a list of things to do which you already know by memory or by heart sounds like a waste of time anyway, but it isn't. Having a checklist helps in proper pacing and making sure you cover all essential sections of the process. Onboarding toolsMany hiring managers still refuse to integrate automation into their onboarding process. I know it's not that unique, but there are some tools that could give you the unique features that will definitely optimize your process. Planning the new hire's acquaintance with the teamI know I shouldn't be planning how the new hire is going to be socializing, but it helps to set a time where everyone could get to know each other. It's a very crucial onboarding step. I think it's just important to make sure the new employee gets along well with everyone, that they could have enough connection with the team for a better work atmosphere. ",

            "answer_text": "Take a look at the following 5 Tips to Reduce Turnover and Boost New Hire Onboarding. These points are implemented at the startup I work for all the time! 1. Communicate Early and Often Many hiring managers wrongly believe new employees need only a few days or weeks to acclimate to their new role. In reality, it can take months or even a year for an employee to fully understand their responsibilities and how they contribute to the \u201cbig picture.\u201d The key here is communication. Don\u2019t wait until the employee\u2019s first day to start. Before he or she even steps foot in the office, send a warm welcome and provide them with an itinerary for their first few days. Effective new hire onboarding should include check-ins throughout the initial months. These meetings should consist of more than training and directions from the manager. They should also create opportunities for the new employee to ask questions and express concerns. Remember that communication styles vary from person to person, so be flexible in your approach. Encourage candid feedback to establish trust and promote engagement. 2. Establish Expectations and Set Clear Goals Employees often feel overwhelmed with information during their first chapter at a new company. Effective new hire onboarding should create clarity around the employee\u2019s role. Think of the organization as a big machine. Every team is like an arm, so it\u2019s important to understand how each part operates. One of the first onboarding process steps should be ensuring the new hire understands what the company does, as well as its long- and short-term goals. It\u2019s also important for him or her to align with the organization\u2019s mission and values. Next, describe how the new hire\u2019s team functions as part of the machine. Finally, explain the employee\u2019s individual responsibilities. Once he or she gets the big picture, work together to set specific goals. By doing so, your new hire can more easily position themselves to be a meaningful contributor to the company. Demonstrate that accountability is a core value by providing direct feedback and showing appreciation for success.  3. Focus on Cultural Integration The ability to adjust to the company culture is one of the most significant predictors of success at a new job. Yet it is often left off of the onboarding process checklist. Unfortunately, not helping a new hire successfully integrate into the company\u2019s culture is setting them up for failure. Assessing candidates for cultural fit should have occurred during the interview process, but it\u2019s critical to continue to discuss culture and office priorities with new employees throughout the new hire onboarding process. Positive interpersonal interactions and the ability to cohere with others are essential factors of individual and team success. 4. Foster Professional and Social Networking New hires will immediately feel more comfortable and excited about their roles if they receive opportunities to network with others within and outside of their team. Companies that cater to employees\u2019 social and professional needs by helping them forge relationships will fare best. For example, new hires will be grateful for a \u201cbuddy,\u201d or informal mentor on the team, who can explain the ins and outs of daily life on the job. Additionally, a mentor in a more senior role on a similar career trajectory can help a newly minted employee understand what it takes to move up in the company and provide basic tips to succeed. 5. Simplify Processes Wherever Possible Sophisticated technology has become ubiquitous in virtually every workplace. But tools that intend to make processes more efficient often make things more complicated and stressful for employees. The main reason? They are not implemented with the human user in mind.  Traditional methods of training employees to use enterprise systems are onerous and time-consuming. For new hires, gaining proficiency in multiple technology systems during the onboarding process flow can seem daunting, if not impossible. This approach to training is not only frustrating, it\u2019s directly at odds with the goal of getting new employees up to speed quickly. You can find the full article here. ",
