            "answer_text": "Everything has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, so is the case of mobile, and whether it is good or bad for school students to have a phone vary person to person. Everyone is different, and the way they use mobile will decide if it is good or bad. Mobile helps them to stay in contact with their parents when they go to coaching classes. There are many useful apps and websites they can use for their studies. It also provides them the chance to learn new skills, create and share their content with the world. It also acts as a source of entertainment and relaxation. But the same mobile turns into a devil and is bad for the students when they focus only on the entertainment part. It distracts them and this acts as an addiction. They get distracted from studies and with access to the internet they can get affected and influenced by it, they may also get access to many anti-social things and for this parental supervision is a must when they give a phone to there child. So, in my opinion, mobile is useful for school students but at the same time, proper parental supervision is very important to keep them in check. ",

            "answer_text": "Giving my 13 year old kid a mobile phone for Christmas was the best thing I could have done for myself. Because now I could reach him, and I knew he could reach me. He could call me if there was some problem. He could call me when he needed picked up. I could call him and ask how he was. It was amazing. Now, a couple things: it was the simplest phone on a prepaid plan. He could not use it inappropriately - and he did not. He was very responsible with his phone. He was a good kid and I could and did trust him. Smaller kids really do not need mobile devices, especially with cameras. ",
