            "answer_text": "ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR EVER LOVING MIND?????? The so called \u201crenewable energy sources\u201d (which are anything but \u201crenewable\u201d since they are manufactured from new materials, have a short life, and then go to a landfill) are the REASON for the whole concept of modern energy poverty. It is very very hard to get a solid definition of \u201crenewable energy\u201d. \u201cEveryone knows what it means\u201d seems to be the standard approach. Every environmentalist has a definition that they use in their own minds and based on their actions that definition seems to be \u201cAn energy source that does not require post-installation fuel\u201d. That definition on its face is stupid\u2014it totally disregards pre-installation energy input which is huge, it totally disregards the future costs of mine reclamation for the strip mines where the exotic materials are extracted, and it totally disregards disposable costs of the toxic and bulky materials. But using my working definition, you have to think about what these \u201crenewable sources\u201d need for ongoing operations since it is occasionally dark, sometimes cloudy, and sometimes the wind does not blow. Our 2020 lifestyle requires a power supply that is much more stable and consistent than sunlight or wind. To achieve that stability with grid-scale wind farms and solar arrays (since we do not have a viable grid-scale energy storage solution\u2014and the huge battery array in Australia will only power its grid for about 45 minutes), we install conventional power plants that are approximately the capacity that would be required if the wind farm or solar array did not exist. Most of these \u201cbackup\u201d power sources are natural gas fired co-gen facilities. Co-gen is amazing technology. When it is running above about 75% capacity, the efficiency (i.e., the power output divided by the chemical energy in the fuel) is over 70% (your vehicle is likely around 22%) with the lowest emissions of real pollutants (i.e., CO, NOx, SOx, BETEX) of any fired energy source. But in standby, generating less than 10% of rated capacity their emissions are terrible. At the end of the day, we are putting more real pollutants into the air because of these so-called renewables than we would be emitting without them. How about residential solar panels? A solar-panel installation with battery backup has no noticeable impact on the grid and is not a horrible thing, often this type of installation has better homeowner-economics than the cost of bringing grid power to a remote home. The other model is just plain evil. This is called \u201cnet metering\u201d where the homeowner does not have any on-site storage and when the panels are generating more power than the home is using the electric meter runs backwards forcing the electric utility to pay retail prices for energy that it must then (usually) sell at wholesale. \u201cBuy high, sell low\u201d is not an economic model for long-term viability so the electric utilities have to raise rates on everyone to stay in business\u2014your friends and neighbors are paying through the nose for your decision not to install batteries. In places where this \u201crenewable\u201d bug has bitten the hardest (e.g., Germany, the state of Victoria in Australia, Poland, the state of California in the U.S.), the residential price of electricity has increased upwards of 10 fold, and many people have to choose between buying food and having heat for their homes (or even being able to cook the food). That is \u201cenergy poverty\u201d and the cause is 100% politicians falling in love with Renewable Energy. So No, a special focus on renewable energy technologies cannot eradicate energy poverty it can only exacerbate it. ",

            "answer_text": "For a country like India, where we are blessed with so much of sun shine practically round the year, your point is valid, and that is why we as a country are taking special interest in propagating one sun, one grid framework as a means of attaining energy security and improving our standard of living. You will hear lot about progress in this direction in years to come. ",
