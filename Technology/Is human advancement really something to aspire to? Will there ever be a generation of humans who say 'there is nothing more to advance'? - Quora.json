            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sure there are many right now who think there is nothing more to advance toward, and see certain widespread trends as totally negative, often accelerating, and causing even more stress and negativity. We don\u2019t have to wait for these disillusioned generations to come, many years in the future. They are us. Advancement. An advancing army leaves destruction in it\u2019s wake. An advancing civilization also, it appears. Not good for the several victims caught under the wheels. So, the whole process needs attention and re-imagining. The efforts of imagination, efforts convincing the complacent, efforts and responsibility of planning, the effort needed toward mobilization and commitment and renewal is daunting, but it\u2019s going to have to happen. I picture some who will imagine their escape to a remote forest somewhere. Wait until someone needs advanced surgery for some medical problem. Wait until the chainsaw runs out of gas. How are you going to keep them down on the farm? It\u2019s difficult enough just to go camping for a weekend once a year. So, people need to come to understand more, somehow. And without understanding and co-operation up and down the line, even though there may be advancement very possible, it just won\u2019t happen - as it needs to. One technical, industrial advancement that is needed is fusion energy. Also, photo-synthesis has now been understood at the quantum-level. These advances will be seriously powerful contributors. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t just run away to the forest and hide out until some magic happens to create a world-wonderland. Consider the incredible lack of social co-operation right now, up and down the line, with this death-dealing virus, Covid one-nine. I wouldn\u2019t have believed it if I hadn\u2019t witnessed it. The shock will hopefully, have some lasting impression regarding social cohesiveness and co-operation. Experiencing the benefits of social co-operation must be a vital part of a child\u2019s education, and an adult\u2019s re-education. After some little while more, we should more clearly see a better picture, and gain a better comprehension, and get to know what needs to be coordinated and happen on a larger scale. Meanwhile, I\u2019m doing what is possible where I am - it\u2019s all I can do. Will the neighbors, community, society, nation, world, whatever - advance? I don\u2019t know. Maybe the individual can.

            "answer_text": "Even if there is such a final, perfect state, we are very far from it right now. In truth we haven't even started our true Human development! So far we have developed in a completely blind, instinctive way, automatically following, executing our inherently egocentric, self-serving, self-justifying desires. As a result we have been helplessly stumbling from one vicious historic cycles to another until we reached the dead-end of our own civilization. In our generation the inherent egotistic development reached its end, exhausted itself, as Natural evolution now obligates us to start a completely new, this time conscious path of development. Through this path we will learn who we are, what system we exist in and how we can align ourselves with Natural development so we could reach our unique, evolutionary Human degree, purpose. The pandemic and similar \u201cNatural blows\u201d coupled with the inevitable, deepening socioeconomic crisis - as our system built on excessive overconsumption, ruthless competition, success and survival at each other's expense is unsustainable - will prevent any attempt to return to our lives from before. All unnecessary, non-essential activities, production will be wiped out (which process is already underway). Thus while we will inevitably scale down to the optimal parameters of natural necessities, we will need to open a completely new, scientific and highly practical (offering true, immediate emotional impressions) educational method, which will guide us towards this conscious Human development above and independent of our original egotistic, subjective existence. We are starting an unprecedented, beautiful and very exciting journey through which we will learn what it means to be Human, how we can learn and integrate into Nature's perfect system, becoming its only fully aware, all-knowing observers, witnesses.
