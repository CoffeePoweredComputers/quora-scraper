            "answer_text": "Generally the South of England is richer than the North. When people talk about the South they mean South East England centred around London. London itself is one of the richest places on the planet with a generally high standard of living with many millionaires and billionaires calling it home. The city\u2019s general wealth, easily on display in the parts of the city frequented by tourists, hides the fact that some of England\u2019s most deprived communities are found in London. The North (roughly everywhere north of the Trent to the Scottish border) is regarded as generally poorer than the south. And there are deprived communities in the older industrial towns and cities that have lost their industry. Having said that Manchester, which has deprived areas, is also a wealthy city with the second largest number of millionaires after London. Manchester has obvious wealth in the areas that attract visitors. Leeds is another city that is doing well. Away from the big cities, smaller places like Chester, York and Harrogate are wealthy. And, because of the relative cheaper cost of living in the area compared to similar areas in South East England, the county of Cheshire, south of Manchester is regarded as having one of the highest standards of living in Europe.

            "answer_text": "Windsor (Berkshire, UK) is the richest town in England. It has over 250 multi-millionaires, a lot of which is helped by Queen Elizabeth II having a significant residence there. Rich people also live in posh areas basically everywhere. Some good examples of this are Kensignton, Belgravia, and Nightsbridge in London. One of my hobbies, when I travel internationally, is to go around the different neighborhoods and look at the architecture, so that is how some American knows any of that. ",
