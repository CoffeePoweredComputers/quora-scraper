            "answer_text": "A2A What is the history of technology? The question is so broad, the best I can do to answer it is to give you some context to my personal perspective. The implementation of technology has been my profession for more than four decades. Building websites telling the stories about the history of technology has been my passion for more than two decades. As a passionate geek who loves technology, who is also a cranky cynic that hates buzzwords, as I sort through the various stages of the evolution of technology in my writing, I am trying to give context to the jargon. In my stories of the history of technology I start with looking at various machines powered by animals. In the very basic definition, beasts of burden refers to animals used by humans to perform various tasks, such as pack animals used to carry heavy loads. In the context of studying the evolution of humans and machines, I look at working animals such as horses that were domesticated to power the machines of humans. In the next stage of technology I look at the evolution from living horse power to machines with the invention of steam powered machines. One of my favorite times in the history of technology I call \u201cthe age of railroads and robber barons,\u201d roughly the period academic scholars call the Second Industrial Revolution. George Westinghouse, one of great American inventors of the era, started out inventing various products for the railroad industry and moved on to defeating Thomas Edison in the War of Currents. As you can see by my history here at Quora, that's where I have spent a lot of time answering question. My next major wave of ideas is the birth of Silicon Valley, the semiconductor stories of the 1950s and 1960s, the internet pioneers of the 1960s and 1970s. I already have much of the content edited, just doing some final editing to spin it to the web. That's a quick brain dump of my ideas as I sort through the history of technology. One of the few television shows I watch on a regular basis is \"Mysteries at the Museum\" on the Travel Channel, and yes, I do visit as many museums as I can every year on my annual road trips. Studying the history of technology is my passion. The topic is so vast, to summarize the history of technology in a few hundred words for this question does not do the topic justice. ",

            "answer_text": "Its way simple to understand. The word Technology doesn\u2019t mean only to the things which are not visible to our naked eyes ( Radio waves and computer programs, etc.,) . The history of technology started right from the first human being evolved on this planet. When they learned to drink water (which was the foremost life source) using a bowl or deep shaped stone, instead of drinking by bending over the water body to drink directly using their lips. And the evolution of Technology started right from the moment when they made bags out of animal skins to store water and food and carry then wherever they moved. THE POINT TO BE NOTED HERE IS THAT, TECHNOLOGY IS THE COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE TO LESSEN THEIR BURDEN AND GET THE WORK DONE MORE EFFICIENTLY i.e., WORKING SMART INSTEAD OF WORKING HARD. So, the history of technology started right from the first humans itself. ",

He is a pioneer in the wireless communications industry, especially in radio spectrum management, with eleven patents in the field. While at Motorola in the 1970s, Cooper invented the first handheld cellular mobile phone (distinct from the car phone) in 1973 and led the team that developed it and brought it to market in 1983. He is considered the \"father of the (handheld) cell phone\" and is also cited as the first person in history to make a handheld cellular phone call in public. Cooper is co-founder of numerous communications companies with his wife and business partner Arlene Harris; He is co-founder and current Chairman of Dyna LLC, in Del Mar, California. Cooper also sits on committees supporting the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the United States Department of Commerce. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology unneeded for survival began with a religion/form of government/organization/culture creating an artificial need for unneeded technology. In the Middle Paleolithic times there was really no religion or form of government that existed so humans just went by survival instincts like other animals. They had some survival tools and that\u2019s it. Prior to fire making humans were pretty similar to gorillas and chimpanzees. Fire-making and other things probably also came out because of a religion/tradition/organization/culture since our natural survival instincts do not have knowledge of it automatically like how we automatically understand oral language or avoid physical pain\u2026you don\u2019t actually need a fire for survival it\u2019s pretty easy to survive without it. In the Neolithic times humans were more religious and started building temples and religious artifacts that\u2019s really when technology unneeded for survival began. Humans because of religion started studying things like astronomy and philosophy which was really just pseudoscience and speculations. Around the Middle Ages the scientific method came out but it still wasn\u2019t used that much. The scientific method is really a form of logical empiricism that came from studying philosophy used to determine if something is true or false. Then around the 17th Century Newtonian physics and higher mathematics came out which changed engineering dramatically. Newtonian physics is actually an advanced astronomical model. Calculus was invented to solve astronomical problems. The real reason why people were studying astronomy was because of religion (for astrology, clocks). Now in modern times it seems like all modern day technology unneeded for survival came out because of capitalism (form of government), or government-sponsored projects for national defense and other purposes (form of government), or religion (temples, clocks, architecture). The life expectancy if you control for the infant mortality rate is still nearly the same as Paleolithic times. Humans are not naturally inquisitive as the media portrays they naturally go by survival instincts and only become inquisitive if a religion/form of government/organization/culture creates an artificial need to be. If humans are naturally inquisitive like many seem to think then when in history did humans ever come up with technology unneeded for survival without a religion/tradition/culture/organization/form of government creating an artificial need for unneeded technology? The answer is never, it never happened before. Conclusion: If there is no religion/form of government/organization/culture creating an artificial need for unneeded technology then technology unneeded for survival won\u2019t exist\u2026humans would automatically become the same as Paleolithic humans. Humans are still the same as other animals going by survival instincts naturally but most humans in developed countries have been heavily conditioned out of their natural survival instincts through punishment/reward and other methods of conditioning at early ages. By age 5 humans reach 90% of their adult brain size so a lot of human behavior becomes fixed then. We can also condition other non-human animals to perform tricks when conditioned at early ages just the same but they won\u2019t naturally act that way\u2026the same with humans. The natural human with no religion/form of government/organization/culture conditioning them to act differently is the Paleolithic human. That\u2019s how humans acted for most of history. ",

The Wheel Someone said, \u201cHey, that\u2019s cool and all, but I need to move things on land.\u201d They noticed that boulders and rocks rolled down hill, and with a little creative engineering they created the wheel. They attached it chariots, and platforms that became wagons. Airplanes Ok, so what if a place was really far away, and a wagon and boat would take too long?
