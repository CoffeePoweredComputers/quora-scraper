            "answer_text": " WATER IS AS BEAUTIFUL FLOWER As I woke up and saw this question which I found very sticky because last night,when I was going to sleep just thought about quality of water. As water is devinie itself ,so obviously full of qualities. One more quality,is used to flow continuous irrespective of all hurdles,same we should follow in our daily life and this is my favourite. And water is transparent and clear,which should be our final aim to make our soul very transparent. Water can be easily mixed with anyone,is very flexible and so we should follow that we could be very flexible with everyone we meet. When we want to write any thing on water (impression of yourself in water),we can't write it in normal way,because it will used to float.If you have to write,you must find such a way that letters could go in deep and would be visible from out. Let us take an example let us have a glass full of water,when you put pebbles (for writing) into it ,would be seen stable from upper side. Similarly in our daily life,if you want to have deep connection with any one(even with God himself),for making your stable impression in their heart,you must be like pebbles ,which can go deep inside water,then your relationship with that person would be clear and transparent as water.   WATER HAS SUCH INTERESTING FORM It is like naughty child who can change their shape accordingly that obviously be unique and beautiful every time. There is a lot more to learn but I only could summerize some of these. P.S.- Please add more,if any one does have other recognition. Image source: - Google Thanks Anish Mohapatra for this question.

This inspire me and bring out my inner nature so that i, too may be like water. In many ways, our lives can resemble the sometimes turbulent, sometimes calm and always flowing nature of water. \u2192 Tranquility of water: If the water is calm, then the dirt inside it is visible. In the same way, I should have the same peace so that I can see my mistakes. \u201cIf you are driven by fear, anger or pride nature will force you to compete. If you are guided by courage, awareness, tranquility and peace nature will serve you.\u201d \u2192 Continuous flowing: Water that you gathered in one place and left to forget. this water becomes dirty, stink and disease. I should always flowing in my way, so that I could not forget the purpose of my being born. Keep your thoughts positive and flow with life. Thank you :-) *Anish Mohapatra ",
