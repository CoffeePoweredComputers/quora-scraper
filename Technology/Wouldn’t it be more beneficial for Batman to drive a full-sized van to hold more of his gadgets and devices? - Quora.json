            "answer_text": "Honestly, it makes a lot of sense.  Off the top of my head, there are a few different ways he could leverage this: He could have a pretty extensive arsenal of weapons, gadgets, and devices in there if he wanted. He would no longer be limited to what he can carry on his suit or in the much smaller batmobile.He could have something like a mobile command center. Robin could control unmanned devices like drones and such from there.He could use it like a police van and have it be a temporary holding cell to transport criminals to the police station. Batman could make life even easier on the cops if he delivered the criminals right to their doorstep.Honestly, if full-sized vans didn\u2019t have such a weird stigma these days, Batman would probably have a van. Back in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s vans were actually cool. I say we lobby DC comics for a Batvan. Who\u2019s with me? ",

            "answer_text": "no, he is a genius in terms of what he has in terms of the utility belt, he also has a series of mini-batcaves safehouses in abandon subway tunnels below gotham, and in a number of floors in Waynetech, remember he hide them in plain sight, let\u2019s say he builds a 60 story building for Waynetech, but his employees only work on 55 of them, what are the 5 stories used for, no one knows except for Wayne and his team that he trusts, no one needs to know about the 5 floors, the workers only focus on the floor they\u2019re working on, the elevators won\u2019t tell them skipped a floor unless they go outside and count every single one without getting dizzy, Batman is also friends with Ray Palmer aka the Atom, who like Marvel\u2019s Hank Pym is a genius with miniaturization, he\u2019s also friends with the Flash who uses compression and miniature tech to make his suit pop out of his ring, and share how to make items small enough to fit into the utility belt get big enough, but a van, not intimidating, and he only wears what he needs in the cave before tackling a certain villain, no point carrying two extra different batsuits in a van.
