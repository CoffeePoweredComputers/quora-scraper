            "answer_text": "Staying away from electronic devices makes your life calm, peaceful, healthy and natural. You can have more fun in your life without using these gadgets. You can do the followings. Reading is the best way of having fun, since you already have this habbit its really cool, keep it. You can go on walks alone. This will help you knowing more about yourself and will also refresh your mind. You can perform random active kindness, like going out helping someone, be someone\u2019s hero. Spread love. This will give you self satisfaction and joy. Go to some random places. Talk to the people over there, make some friends and try to grab their positive thoughts. Make a list of those. If you like sports you can also play outdoor games like cricket, football, badminton etc. Spend time with your families. Go out with them. Spend time with your grandparents. They can tell you more secrets on enjoying life without gadgets. :) Well now a funny one. Lock yourself in a room, or you can do it openly also, and start singing all your favourite songs. This will surely entertain you. Last but not the least, have a habbit of writting. Try to pen down each and everything you experience whole day daily. This will probably put a smile on your face each night. Hope these ideas will help you. Enjoy life to the fullest, coz you have only one. Be happy and keep smiling. :) ",
