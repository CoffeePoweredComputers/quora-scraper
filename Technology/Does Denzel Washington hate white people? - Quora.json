            "answer_text": "No, I don't believe Denzel Washington hates white people or anyone else. He is very devout in his Christian beliefs, so much so that he seriously considered becoming a preacher, and I don't see him as a hateful person at all. He grew up in Mount Vernon, NY where there is a majority black population, but he had white friends. After his parents divorced he was sent to a boarding school called the Oakland Academy, which he still credits with setting him in the right direction. Oakland was a prep school for boys, and the vast majority were white. I remember seeing his name in the local sports page a lot (I grew up nearby) because he was a star on both the baseball and basketball teams. He was also a very popular student. He was equally popular at Fordham University. The point is that he always socialized with people of different races, and got on well with everyone. Coincidentally I met his mother a few times in Mount Vernon, and she was a very sweet Christian woman. Denzel will call out racism when he sees it, and he has strong beliefs about the ways he'd like to improve things for the black community, including putting God first and the importance of raising children with a father and a mother. Expressing such beliefs can make one unpopular with certain political and/or Hollywood types but I've seen no reason at all to believe that Denzel hates people of any color. ",
