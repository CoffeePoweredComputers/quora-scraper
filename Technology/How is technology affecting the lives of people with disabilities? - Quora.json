            "answer_text": "When I found out two years ago that the baby my wife and I were expecting would have Down's Syndrome, most of the experts we were working with and information we read used two terms over and over to describe the future we should expect for her: at-risk and dependency.  At 18 months old she's as healthy as any other kid and taking her first steps, transitioning from babysign to talking, and learning to feed herself. She seems far too stubborn to be happy with something like dependency, but who knows. As I think about the challenges she might have outside of our home and away from us, I've been thinking about how technology that's making our lives easier could potentially give Avery and others with special needs a better shot at living life with less dependency.  Mobility - the cost of getting from A to B is dropping like a stone One of the challenges Avery might have is getting her driver's license. When 26 year old William Loughnane made history by becoming the first person with Down's Syndrome to get a driver's license in Ireland, he said: \"It makes a big difference. I'm more independent now.\" Avery, who'll exhibit a rare mean streak when she's forced to give something up, is likely to be insufferable if forced to depend on others for mobility to work or school or social events.  Fortunately, the world is coming her way. If she were 16 today she'd find that fewer of her friends are getting their license and fewer people are likely to have their license in general[1]. Mostly that's because Uber and competitors are making it easier to get a ride than ever before and it's only going to get easier. A key blocker to Avery's quest for independence, lack of mobility, is being systematically blown apart by the success of ride-sharing as an industry, the near future of automated vehicles, robots delivering pizza[2], and on-demand everything. Computing is still only accessible with fine motor skills - but not for long The only thing worse than using a keyboard and mouse (invented almost 40 years ago) to communicate with everybody I know in the world and consume every conceivable flavor of media is trying to use my phone's keyboard to do the same things. This is especially tricky for some people with Down's Syndrome because fine motor skills typically lag behind neurotypical children of the same age, in some cases way behind. While this can be an inhibitor in many ways, it's particularly damning in the information age if manipulating a keyboard and mouse is the key to unlocking valuable training materials like learning apps and games. Fortunately, Avery won't need to learn on the same, muddled together interfaces I've learned to cope with. She'll have voice-based and virtual reality interfaces.  It may be the case that she wants to learn how to type on a qwerty keyboard, but it's likely she won't have to. A voice interface with a solid recognition system is many times more healthy and efficient than sitting or standing with arms extended over such primitive tools as they keyboard and mouse. Siri, Google Voice, Cortana, and Amazon's Echo are great examples of this working most of the time in the real world now; but we're still at the beginning. Avery's going to have faster and easier access to tools, information and messaging channels to everybody she cares about without ever pushing a button.  Internet of Things and wearables - connected everything One of the most exciting and welcome changes for Avery and everybody else is the prospect of environmental control that's automated, self-adjusting, and connected so that it can be monitored remotely. While being able to set, adjust, and monitor a security or heating and cooling system remotely might mean convenience and peace of mind for most people, it could mean the difference of independence for those who are almost there.  Using a combination of Internet of Things products like the Nest thermostat[3], August Smart door locks[4], or the Belkin WeMo suite of sensors and switches[5], many day to day risk areas can be managed through a smartphone using apps like IFTTT. But even this is kludged together sorcery compared to what's coming down the pipe. In a few years we're going to see interconnected environmental and access controls through easy to access interfaces like Siri or Google Voice. Where a home-dweller now needs to access several different proprietary interfaces to manage their home, such as a thermostat, lighting controls, locks, and potentially irrigation systems - most of these things can be preset, rule-based, and automated and alert-based going forward. Someone can walk up to their door, have it unlock automatically, walk in, have it lock behind them, and have the temperature and lighting systems sense presence and adjust.  Wearables such as a smartwatch or even smartphone can now allow two-way, real-time, constant communication about location and medical wellness. Although fitness trackers like the Fitbit and health trackers like the Apple Watch were primarily intended to give a person access to their own health information, they can also be used to enable more independence for people who normally rely on caregivers for day to day activities. New research and learnings are easier to find and share In 2013, scientists at the University of Massachusetts Medical School were able to \u201csilence\u201d the extra chromosome in a laboratory focused on Down's syndrome and research have now moved to mice models[6]. One organization in particular,  LuMind RDS, is dedicated to accelerating the development of treatments to significantly improve cognition including memory, learning and speech, for individuals with Down's Syndrome. There are four clinical trials underway that could yield treatment options Avery could benefit from in her lifetime.[7] Organizations like Lumind and research from UMass are now easier to find, more accessible to donors, and more transparent to scientists who are also working on things like Alzheimer's and other cognitive impairments. Stories like Avery's are now easier to share and friends who are overcoming these challenges in their own unique ways are easier to find and network with.  The world is still going to be a more challenging place for Avery than it is for me, but it's getting a little better.

            "answer_text": "I suffer many psychological problems. anxiety and paranoia and technology makes it worse. I read about Edward Snowden and how America spies on us thru our cells, computers, cars, gps, alexas, washer machines, anything smart. It scares me, we have no privacy. Then my paranoia takes over. Ive thrown away so many iPhones burned them, etc. just the thought of people listening to everything we say. Watching us on our cells, taking video and audio of ALL of us is creepy. Why don\u2019t they concentrate on America\u2019s most wanted, and terror cells? My jaguar is all technology. And has been broken into by hacking 3 times now. It costs me and arm and a leg for 2 $900 keys not covered by their \"bumper to bumper warranty\" 6 years \u2026 I have to pay the mechanics to take apart the entire tech brain remove hacking devices implanted in the cd player \" not covered $600 a pop. My insurance tripled. They installed a spy cam. Then a new dealer took over denied everything I went thru including ID theft the first time. And destroyed all records. I had to pay full price for all work because my deductible was US$1500. I paid over 80g cash for it. I had it for 2 years. Police said I can get hijacked so I only have 2567 miles on it. If it wasn\u2019t all tech I would never have this hacking problem. I have good credit. I\u2019d stolen twice. Stopped by TSA because they sold my documents on the black market. Got Lifelock. Didn't help. Technology can do harm! ",
