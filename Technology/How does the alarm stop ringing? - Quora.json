            "answer_text": "That is a very broad question. I\u2019ll assume you are referring to a clock mechanism of some sort. If it is a mechanical clock which needs winding, then it will sound until the alarm spring has unwound. However, it it is a electronic type which needs a mains feed or battery to operate, then it will be programmed to sound for a specific time - which is usually around five to ten minutes. It does that because otherwise, it would continue sounding until is ran out of power which could be a matter of hours with a battery, or never if powered by mains electricity. Generally, very undesirable. ",
