            "answer_text": "I have mixed feelings about them. As the one answer says, regarding their ease of deception from dishonest customers, it is really bad for Loss Preventions stats and retail shrink. The Walmart self-checkouts have much more \u201cself-registers\u201d than any other retailer I have seen. What I mean is that when I was working in Home Depot, the self-checkout had 6 registers. When I was working on the self-cashier area, I could see what everyone was scanning and putting in their bag or their cart \u2014 mostly at least. If someone had a little problem, I had to look at their screen to void something, perhaps someone did put something expensive in the bag, instead of what he scanned. But that would still be difficult, because the only way to really do that is if the more expensive item weighs the same as the one he scanned. I\u2019m hoping you do understand that the places for your items in the bag or otherwise is a scale, to check if the thing you put in the bag was something else than one that you scanned. That\u2019s why sometimes it just says something about wait for the cashier, like if I scan a chocolate bar and then put expensive headphones in the bag. So anyhow, that thing is easier to help the shrink level if you only have 4 or 6 or maybe 8 of the self-register stations. But in all the Walmart stores I\u2019ve gone to, they have 16 or 18 or 20 registers, and maybe some places have even more. That\u2019s again pretty hard to see everything when you can only stand in about a 4 - 8 group area, and the other ones are perhaps 30\u2032 away when you are helping another customer. I don\u2019t know why the other answer from the LP associate says they can just put anything in the bag that they want, and nobody would ever know it. The cashiers working the self-area are walking around looking at what everyone was doing. If they stopped to help me or someone else, they only stop for less than 30 seconds, and they know why the register had the problem it did. And the registers at Walmart do have the scale which knows if you put in something that weights differently \u2014 like scan a pair of socks, but put a pair of shoes in there either instead of the socks, or with the socks. Of course, it\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s still helping more than doing absolutely nothing, which kind of sounds what the other answer says. Yes some people can figure it out, and cashiers will miss something, but that\u2019s definitely NOT the case with EVERY dishonest person. And as always, anyone in Loss Prevention knows that there are those professional thieves that can do it more better because of the expertise, and we don\u2019t see or find all of them, no matter what we do. Now, for the other answer in my mind, it comes as a customer. As a customer, I LOVE them. I use them every time I can, unless I have something that can\u2019t be scanned or weighed or whatever. But even stuff that you can\u2019t easily take out of the cart, the cashier can scan in the cashier\u2019s register for you. I use them every time because they are so much faster. I ALWAYS have a line to wait in if I go to a regular register. Even if I have to wait behind 5+ people on the busiest of days, they move so much faster in the self-cashier area. And that still hardly ever happens. Maybe it happened in 4 or 5 out of the last hundred or more times I\u2019ve shopped there and used them. They\u2019re faster and easier for me to get in and get out. Lastly, though, the self-cashier makes me feel angry about Walmart at the very last moment. At that time, when I am collecting the receipt and my bag, the system says to me: \u201cHow did we do today?\u201d And EVERY TIME I hear that, I think to the machine, and sometimes I whisper it: \u201cWhat the EFF are you talking about. You didn\u2019t do one thing for me today! Not even helping me to GIVE YOU MY MONEY! You stupid machine!\u201d I REALLY wish they\u2019d turn that part off! And that\u2019s how I feel! Thanks for asking! \ud83d\udc4d ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, self-scans are great at any high-grossing store for two reasons. They are a clever way to keep customers happy. When I ran self-scan at my store (not Walmart but the point still stands), we had customers telling us about other dishonest patrons. For instance, Brian can look over at Kevin at the next till and see that he\u2019s entering a code for peanuts, then putting pecans in the bag. The customer feels like they are doing their part to help the store and they also help us lose less. We may lose Kevin as a customer, but Brian will get a warm fuzzy feeling and keep coming back.Of course, this doesn\u2019t always occur, and people will try to walk out with unpaid merchandise quite often.They expedite the checkout process. Express lanes at my store are rarely open, and when they are, the cashiers are not quick. They essentially function as an extra regular till. However, self-scan is always open. If you came into the store to get bread and eggs, you can literally walk right up to the till, without even having to line up, scan your two items, then breeze right out, all within 30 seconds. No interaction with chatty Cathy on the express lane. Also, you are not contributing to a lineup. That makes it faster for people who use the human service.Unlike the common public misconception, they don\u2019t take away jobs. Notice that I wrote \u201chigh-grossing stores\u201d at the beginning. Self-scans are almost always installed in stores that need the extra scanning capacity. At my store, we had hit the x dollar mark for several weeks in a row, at which point corporate decided that we could bring in the extra tills. Previously, we had 11 lanes, and most weekends, 8 of them would be open. Now, we have 8 lanes and 8 self-scans, and 6 cashiers will be open on weekends. Of the extra two, one goes to the service desk and the other runs self-scan. No jobs are lost, but scanning capacity is increased by 75%.For these reasons, self-scans are great. As a retail worker, I\u2019ve seen the difference they make on the front end firsthand. While I realise that my store does not represent all stores, especially since I don\u2019t work for Walmart, I think that the decision to implement self-scans is never taken lightly. A lot of planning and thought is done behind the scenes by management, which customers don\u2019t see. But, when the self-scans are rolled out, everyone benefits. ",
