            "answer_text": "This question has multiple parts, and I will briefly address each unless prompted to go deeper in any one dimension. I am also assuming you are referring to corrosion of metals. I will specify an odd property that iron has, but the rest of the answer will be generalizable to all metals. For nonmetals or other compounds, the answer will be chemically similar but practically different. Corrosion is an umbrella term for many different chemical reactions, and when we talk about \u201ccontrolling\u201d corrosion, typically this has two parts that are similar in practice but chemically distinct: controlling whether a reaction prefers to happen at all (thermodynamics), and controlling the rate of a reaction that prefers to occur (kinetics). From a thermodynamic perspective, reactions prefer to occur when a system that is in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state. Substances that we typically call \u201creactive\u201d can chemically rearrange under the given conditions to a system with lower energy state. In the case of metal corrosion, the most common reaction we see is the loss of electrons from metal atoms to nonmetal atoms that are floating around nearby. These nonmetals rip electrons off of the metals (a process called \u201coxidation\u201d for the metal losing electrons and \u201creduction\u201d for the nonmetal gaining electrons) and form ionic compounds. Ionic compounds are often called salts, some of which are water soluble, but some of which are not. Unfortunately, unless your sample is hanging out among completely unreactive substances, there\u2019s not a ton you can do to reverse a metal\u2019s innate preference for losing electrons. Forming ionic compounds happens readily when there\u2019s a nonmetal or set of nonmetals that are itching to steal electrons hanging out near the metal atoms. In our world, the most common reactive nonmetal is oxygen gas - elemental oxygen is an electron hog, and the molecule itself is a fairly unhappy diradical, so it will steal electrons wherever possible. Some metals are better than others at resisting oxygen\u2019s clutches, though. Stainless steels are called stainless because they are either plated or mixed with a metal that resists corrosion better. This is the alloy game that so many scientists (and comic books) are obsessed with - mix metals together and they can develop new properties. Most of these are just a mix of the two (or more) components, but sometimes elements work together in a synergistic way, creating an effect that isn\u2019t observed in the components separately. This is where most metallurgical research gets done, and it\u2019s kind of a crapshoot, because most of it is trial-and-error despite our best efforts. The second angle of \u201ccontrolling\u201d corrosion is about kinetics - if you can\u2019t prevent a reaction from preferring to happen, slowing it down is your next best option. However, the rules for most reactions is the same- reaction rates typically depend on the reaction mechanism (which steps happen to which atoms when). Although some reactions can\u2019t be stopped (see zero-order reactions), for most reactions, the best way to decrease the rate is to prevent the reactants from coming into contact with each other under conditions where the reaction is likely to occur. As we saw above, for corrosion reactions, typically we are talking about metals reacting with elemental nonmetals or covalent compounds. Therefore, minimizing exposure of metals to highly reactive nonmetals is useful. Oxygen is the most common of these in daily life on earth (though not the only one - there\u2019s plenty of weird stuff that can happen depending on where you live). Keeping metals away from oxygen has always been one of the best ways to resist corrosion. This can be done, for example, by putting a thin coat of oil or grease over the metal surface - the oxygen hits the oil well before it can get to the metal, and the oil resists reacting with oxygen better than the metal will. Even if the oil does react, most of the products will still prevent the oxygen getting in - they\u2019ll just smell bad (oil going rancid is largely due to reactions with oxygen). Water can accelerate the process of corrosion in a lot of cases, as it dissolves oxygen relatively well and is perfectly happy interacting with the charged ions that form in the ionic compound that is produced from the reaction. Oil keeps water off of the metal as well, so that is a bonus from the metal\u2019s perspective. Salt water is better than regular water at this process as well, so that can complicate things for marine applications. I can write more on that another time if you\u2019re interested. Finally, the weird think kinetically about iron rusting (a specific type of corrosion where iron forms red iron oxide salts with oxygen) is that the reaction is auto-catalytic. This means that once iron oxide is formed, it helps the reaction go faster, rather than getting in the way like most other oxides. It does this by changing the mechanism on the atomic scale so that the reaction becomes easier to start for iron atoms that haven\u2019t reacted yet. This is why iron rusts so much more quickly than other metals - you\u2019ll notice that the Statue of Liberty is green (because of the copper oxide layer on the outside of the bronze), but it\u2019s not rotting away very quickly. If she had been made of iron, she\u2019d have been gone very quickly after the first spot of rust was found. The quickest way to deal with this in iron-containing products (other than by remaking them as an alloy or plating them with another metal) is to literally remove the iron oxide by scraping it off with a harder metal. Once that\u2019s gone, the rusting won\u2019t accelerate over time, and coating the now-rust-free object with grease will prevent the oxide from forming again. ",

            "answer_text": "Corrosion or Rusting is the destruction or degradation of metal due to the reaction between metal surface and the environment. It is an oxidation process. To understand how to prevent corrosion, it is important to know the difference between the different types of corrosion. Knowing which type of corrosion we are dealing with will help to best determine how it can be prevented. Uniform Corrosion: The most common type of corrosion, uniform corrosion is identified by its reddish color distributed uniformly throughout the exposed part of the metal surface. Prevention: To prevent uniform corrosion it is important to allow for water run-off and good ventilation when designing. Also, prevent continuous condensation by keeping surfaces clean and protect fasteners from the beginning with platings or coatings. Crevice Corrosion: Crevice corrosion occurs because small gaps and recesses tend to draw in moisture and do not have good ventilation. When crevice corrosion occurs, the risk for crevice corrosion multiplies with the number of joint faces. Prevention: Crevice corrosion can be avoided by minimizing the use of washers and making joint interfaces as smooth as possible. Another strategy which helps is adding a gasket or sealer between the clamped materials. Galvanic Corrosion: Galvanic corrosion is a result of two dissimilar metals in the presence of moisture. Prevention: This type of corrosion can be prevented by Select metals, close together, as far as possible, in the galvanic series.Do not have the area of the more active metal smaller than the area of the less active metal.If dissimilar metals are to be used, insulate them.Use inhibitors in aqueous systems whenever applicable and eliminate cathodic depolarizers.Apply coatings with judgment. Do not coat the anodic member of the couple as it would reduce the anodic area and severe attack would occur at the inevitable defect points in the coating. Therefore, if coating is to be done, coat the more noble of the two metals in the couple which prevents electrons being consumed in a cathodic reaction such as 2H + + 2e ? H 2, which is likely to be corrosion rate controlling.Avoid joining materials by threaded joints.Use a third metal active to both the metals in the couple.Sacrificial material, such as zinc or magnesium, may be introduced into this assembly. For instance, zinc anodes are used in cast iron water boxes of copper alloy water-cooled heat exchangers.In designing the components, use replaceable parts so that only the corroded parts could be replaced instead of the whole assembly.Pitting Corrosion: Pitting corrosion occurs on a metal surface that is coated by a very noble finish like nickel or chromium. The exposed area becomes less noble than the much larger area around it that is less affected by environmental factors. This creates a current density allowing for galvanic corrosion in the pits. Prevention: To prevent Pitting Corrosion always keep surfaces clean and smooth. Avoid solid or liquid residues, especially chlorides and use A4 or 316 stainless steel when there can be chlorides present. Also, work with your nickel plater to use subsequent treatments that can fill pores. Intergranular Corrosion: Austenitic stainless steels can develop intergranular corrosions when they are heated to a high temperature for hot forming or welding. Prevention: For intergranular corrosion prevention, use stainless steel with carbon content below 0.05% and quench parts in water immediately after heating. If using stainless steel containing over 0.05% carbon it can be stabilized by adding titanium, niobium or tantalum. Stress Corrosion Cracking: Stress corrosion cracking may result when corrosion occurs onfasteners subjected to tension. This type of failure often starts with pitting corrosion. Prevention: Stress corrosion prevention can start with following the guidelines for pitting corrosion prevention. In addition to those guidelines, periodically inspect safety critical parts, hot dip galvanizing if necessary, to check for corrosion. Always ensure that these safety critical fasteners are accessible for inspection and replacement. Hydrogen Embrittlement: While not a form of corrosion Hydrogen embrittlement in a fastener can be a result of corrosion in a joint. If high strength fasteners are stressed, small surface defects like scratches may turn into a small crack. If hydrogen is present in the steel atoms, they are attracted by the tensile stresses around the tip of the crack and form a \u201chydrogen atom cloud\u201d there. The hydrogen weakens the microstructure of the metal and the crack may continue to grow until the part fails. Prevention: To prevent Hydrogen embrittlement, avoid electroplating or the use of acid cleaning for high strength fasteners. If Hydrogen is introduced in large quantities to a high strength fastener the possibility of embrittlement is very prominent. Above all, make fastener choice a priority during the initial stages of the design processes to avoid chance of corrosion from the start. ",
