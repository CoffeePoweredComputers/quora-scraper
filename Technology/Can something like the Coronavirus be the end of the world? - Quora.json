Certainly, the human race will still survive in the foreseeable future. Something in the medical field will happen that will halt the spread of the virus and life will continue. All that\u2019s required is a scientific breakthrough in the medical field. This has happened before and I can assure you it will happen again. History keeps repeating itself. All that\u2019s needed right now is for the human population to maintain isolation and wait patiently for the scientific breakthrough to happen. The waiting and the patience are all that is necessary for now. However isolation and maintaining distance are not the nature of human beings as you have witnessed in some instances where there have been cases of riots in some parts of the world, due to mental breakdowns caused by loneliness, hunger and lack of socialization. Humans are social animals so they can\u2019t maintain lockdowns, quarantines, curfews and isolations for long. Something they will break. Then things will begin to happen unless a scientific breakthrough is found soon. It should be noted that there have been worse pandemics in history than the Coronavirus (COVID-19). Let\u2019s look at 20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in history: 1. Circa 3000 B.C. - An epidemic wipes out a prehistoric village in China. The village was later burned down and isolated for good. 2. 430 B.C. - An epidemic of pandemic proportions ravages the entire city of Athens for five years leaving a death toll as high as 100,000 people. 3. A.D. 165-180 - The Antonine Plague laid waste the Roman Empire killing more than 5 million people. It is thought that the plague (which may have been smallpox), was brought by the Roman soldiers returning from a war against Parthia. 4. A.D. 250-271 - The Plague of Cyprian is estimated to have killed 5,000 people a day in Rome alone. COVID-19 has not reached near that level in any city of the world. 5. A.D. 541-542 - The Justinian Plague wiped out an estimated 10% of the world population during the Byzantine Empire. 6. 1346-1353 - The Black Death traveled from Asia to Europe, leaving devastation in its wake. Some estimates suggest that it wiped out over half of Europe's population. 7. 1545-1548 - The Cocoliztli epidemic was a form of viral hemorrhagic fever that killed 15 million inhabitants of Mexico and Central America. 8. 16th century - The American Plagues are a cluster of Eurasian diseases brought to the Americas by European explorers. These illnesses, including smallpox, contributed to the collapse of the Inca and Aztec civilizations. Some estimates suggest that 90% of the indigenous population in the Western Hemisphere was killed off. 9. 1665-1666 - The Great Plague of London, also known as the Black Death or the bubonic plague ravaged the city of London and caused a mass exodus from London starting from 1665. By the time the plague ended, about 100,000 people in 18 months, including 15% of the population of London, had died. 10. 1720-1723 - The Great Plague of Marseille was likely caused by rat fleas. It spread quickly despite quarantine, killing as many as 100,000 people in Marseille and surrounding areas. It's estimated that up to 30% of the population of Marseille may have perished. 11. 1770-1772 - The Russian plague ravaged Moscow leaving as many as 100,000 people dead. Driven by terror, quarantined citizens erupted into a massive violence and riots that spread through the city culminating in the murder of Archbishop Ambrosius, who was encouraging crowds not to gather for worship. 12. 1793 - The Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic devastated the city of Philadelphia (the United States' capital at the time), when officials wrongly believed that slaves, predominantly of African origin were immune to the fever. 5,000 people died as a result. 13. 1889-1890 - The Flu pandemic reportedly broke out in Russia and spread rapidly throughout Europe and the rest of the world killing an estimated 1 million people, despite the fact that air travel didn't exist yet. 14. 1916 - The American polio epidemic started in New York City and caused 27,000 cases and 6,000 deaths in the United States. The disease mainly affects children and sometimes leaves survivors with permanent disabilities. 15. 1918-1920 - The Spanish influenza killed an estimated 500 million people from the South Seas to the North Pole. One-fifth of those died, with some indigenous communities pushed to the brink of extinction. 16. 1957-1958 - The Asian influenza pandemic reportedly broke out in China (coincidence?). The disease claimed more than 1 million lives. The virus that caused the pandemic was a strain of avian flu viruses. 17. 1981-present day - The AIDS pandemic and epidemic has claimed an estimated 35 million lives since it was first identified in 1981. 18. 2009-2010 - H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic was caused by a new strain of H1N1 that originated in Mexico in the spring of 2009 before spreading to the rest of the world. In one year, the virus infected as many as 1.4 billion people across the globe and killed between 151,700 and 575,400 people, according to the CDC. 19. 2014-2016 - The deadly Ebola epidemic that causes severe haemorrhage (bleeding) leading to painful death, ravaged West Africa and Congo, between 2014 and 2016, with 28,600 reported cases and 11,325 deaths. There is currently no cure for Ebola. 20. 2015-present day - The impact of the recent Zika epidemic in South America and Central America won't be known for several years. In the meantime, scientists face a race against time to bring the virus under control.[1] 21. 2019-present day - Named after the date when it was first identified on 31 December, 2019 in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 is a type of Coronavirus that has rapidly spread to over 210 countries and territories around the world, infecting more than 1.7 million people across the globe and killing more than 108,000 people in just 100 days with no signs of relenting and no cure. Apart from epidemics and pandemics, the world has faced many other catastrophes in history including World War I and World War II that devastated the globe, destroyed world economies and claimed the lives of an estimated 125 million people. In conclusion, I think the COVID-19 will be stopped and life will continue, albeit not without adverse economic effects. Definitely, world economies will be affected severely and may not recover from the shock any time soon. One thing is for sure \u2014 Life will never be the same again.

            "answer_text": "During WWI in the spring of 1918, people in port cities started dying in massive numbers due to a mysterious ailment they labeled \u201cthe blue death.\u201d I\u2019m referring of course to the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, the most deadly of modern times. Even with the virus being imported and exported via soldiers entering various ports throughout the world, and working their way into the countrysides across much of the populated lands, only 1/3 of the population contracted the virus, and far less actually died from it. Almost nothing was know about virology or immunology, there were no preventative or cautionary measures in place, and still the Spanish Flu came nowhere close to wiping out humanity. The CDC has now confirmed that the actual mortality rate for those who have contracted COVID-19 is ~0.2%. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) That makes COVID-19 about as deadly as the seasonal flu. On a number of NAVY vessels, such as the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71), over 90% of the crew tested positive for the virus and yet virtually none had any symptoms. I had COVID-19, along with almost all of my coworkers, and only two of them showed any symptoms, and only one older man with preexisting health issues actually got sick and took a few days off. The difference between the Spanish Flu pandemic and COVID-19 is that the Spanish Flu affected people in the prime of their lives, killing mostly those between 20\u201340 years of age. This pandemic affects mostly the elderly and those with preexisting health conditions or compromised immune systems. That said, there have been countless doctors who have come out stated that they are being pressured to list any death as a COVID death if that person had tested positive for the virus, regardless of what the actual cause of death was. For example, the only person I know who has died of COVID-19 had terminal brain cancer and a horrible case of pneumonia when they contracted the virus, and it was still listed as a COVID death. The idea that a virus could wipe out humanity is nonsensical. Even the plague aka \u201cBlack Death\u201d only killed 1/3 of Europe\u2019s population, and when even experts of the time were entirely ignorant of disease control and spread. There were no precautionary measures in place and modern medicine did not exist, for the most part. There\u2019s simply no evidence to support that a virus could be an extinction event. The Spanish Flu and the Black Death didn\u2019t exceed 1/3 of the population, in terms of infection and deaths, respectively. The greatest impact of this pandemic is the tangential aspects of the shutdown. Non-industrialized nations are experiencing famines of Biblical proportions. People are literally starving to death in greater numbers than are dying from the virus in many nations: \u2018Instead of Coronavirus, the Hunger Will Kill Us.\u2019 A Global Food Crisis Looms. And if you don\u2019t trust the NYT: Covid-19\u2019s Third Shock Wave: The Global Food Crisis Mental health issues like anxiety and depression have gone up 2000%. Suicide and drug overdoses have skyrocketed. The shutdown has caused a worldwide mental health crisis which no one is talking about: https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/05/04/mental-health-coronavirus/ People have lost everything, and are being kept shut in a perpetual state of despair while the media keeps pumping out more and more fear\u2014it\u2019s what they do. A healthy person below the age of 65 has a better chance of being stuck by lightening than of dying from COVID-19. Businesses are supposed to be shutdown, unless you\u2019re a corporation with lobbyists such as Walmart or Target, and people are supposed to be social distancing, unless it\u2019s a protest. We were told that we don\u2019t have the individual right to not practice social distancing because it\u2019s not only about us, we could be killing other people\u2019s grandparents. So either these protesters are killing a lot of grandparents and need to be stopped, or people know that the narrative is false. There is no evidence that a viral pandemic such as COVID-19 could be the end of the world, and there\u2019s a tremendous amount of evidence to support this actually being impossible. If the Black Death nor Spanish Flu were able to take out humanity, the idea that something as deadly as the seasonal flu might is obviously nonsensical. \u201cWhat It\u2019s Like to Believe Everything the Media Tells You:\u201d  ",

NOTHING can reduce human population in a meaningful way, not plagues, pandemics, nuclear war, zombie apocalypses, world wars, even asteroid impacts. All that would happen is a ___% reduction in our global numbers. Say this virus infects 70% of everyone on Earth and it carries the same deadly 10% mortality rate that the Spanish Flu of 1918 had (the worst Pandemic in history). That is 10% of 70% of 7.5 billion = 525 million people dead. That is just 7% of the total world population. At our current breeding rate, we add that many babies to Earth every 5 years. By 2025, all of those dead will have been replaced and we will have set back our global population growth by just 5 years. Since humanity is the most destructive, most callous, stupidly devastating species on Earth, unable to control itself and responsible for an ongoing 6th mass extinction of other life on this beautiful planet, Earth is really doomed! As proof, in the U.S. for example, some \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d are claiming they intend to make Covid-19 into a bioterror weapon, to release onto the minority population. Ah, so sweet is Homo sapiens! Trump recently ordered that smokestack industries in the U.S. could relax their air pollution standards \u201cdue to the covid-19 crisis\u201d. What the hell does this virus have to do with easing EPA regulations, other than a scam excuse to target EPA regulations that GOP supplicants want gone? With people like this in the world, and 40 million idiot Trump supporters believing wacko conspiracy theories and approving of this mentally ill psychopath, it is high time the human race really did go extinct. Unfortunately, that is not ever going to happen. ",

They were someone\u2019s mother, father, brother, sister, friend, etc. That\u2019s tragic, no doubt. This is a dangerous illness.

It has killed more people than 9\u201311, the Israeli-Gaza conflict, and the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant disaster combined. It\u2019s deadlier than the flu for sure. But, just remember that I didn\u2019t say that the coronavirus is a minor issue. It\u2019s something that should be taken seriously as a genuine threat to your health. There\u2019s a reason why self-quarantining, social distancing, and avoiding large crowds are the new normal for now.

            "answer_text": "This article is written for the World \ud83c\udf0d What is a coronavirus?  Don\u2019t be Panic of this Virus. It\u2019s life span on surface is only 7 Days. This virus may not be survive direct Sunlight (die with in 2 hours on direct Sunlight) This virus can infect only 2% of human population at present status. So don\u2019t Panic and fear of this Virus. It is not so Dangerous as you think. Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, resembling a crown or the sun\u2019s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract. At least four types of coronaviruses cause very mild infections every year, like the common cold. Most people get infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lives. How dangerous is it? It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus. It appears to be less often fatal than the coronaviruses that caused SARS or MERS, but significantly more so than the seasonal flu. The fatality rate was over 2 percent, in one study. But government scientists have estimated that the real figure could be below 1 percent, roughly the rate occurring in a severe flu season. About 5 percent of the patients who were hospitalized in China had critical illnesses. Children seem less likely to be infected with the new coronavirus, while middle-aged and older adults are disproportionately infected. Men are more likely to die from an infection compared to women, possibly because they produce weaker immune responses and have higher rates of tobacco consumption, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, which may increase the risk of complications following an infection. \u201cThis is a pattern we\u2019ve seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract \u2014 men can have worse outcomes,\u201d said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. How is the new coronavirus transmitted? Experts believe that an infected animal may have first transmitted the virus to humans at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds in Wuhan. The market was later shut down and disinfected, making it nearly impossible to investigate which animal may have been the exact origin. Bats are considered a possible source, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, and they were found to be the starting point for SARS. It is also possible that bats transmitted the virus to an intermediate animal, such as pangolins, which are consumed as a delicacy in parts of China, and may have then passed on the virus to humans. The outbreak grew because of human-to-human transmission. People infected with the virus produce tiny respiratory droplets when they breathe, talk, cough or sneeze, allowing the virus to travel through the air. Most respiratory droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. People who are in close contact with those infected, particularly family members and health care workers, may catch the virus this way. Infected people may be able to pass on the new coronavirus even if they have few obvious symptoms, a study in Germany has found. That\u2019s \u201cbad news,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. What symptoms should I look out for? Symptoms of this infection include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. But milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult. Patients may exhibit other symptoms, too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhea. Current estimates suggest that symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after being exposed to the virus. If you have a fever or a cough and recently visited China, South Korea, Italy or another place with a known coronavirus outbreak, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider. Call first, so the office can prepare for your visit and take steps to protect other patients and staff from potential exposure. Is there a test for the virus? What is the treatment? There is a diagnostic test that can determine if you are infected. It was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on genetic information about the virus provided by the Chinese authorities. In early February, the C.D.C. sent diagnostic test kits to 200 state laboratories, but some of the kits were flawed and recalled. Now other laboratories are making their own tests. Other countries are using test kits manufactured locally or sent out by the W.H.O. The C.D.C. announced that anyone who wanted to be tested could if a doctor approves the request. But state and local health departments, already overwhelmed with requests, must conduct the tests, not the individual doctors. Many patients complain that they still cannot get tested. How can I protect myself? The best thing you can do to avoid getting infected is to follow the same general guidelines that experts recommend during flu season, because the coronavirus spreads in much the same way. Wash your hands frequentlythroughout the day. Avoid touching your face, and maintain a distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. At the moment, the risk of infection with the new coronavirus in the United States \u201cis way too low for the general public to start wearing a face mask,\u201d said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security. But, he added, \u201cif you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, wearing a mask reduces the risk of infecting others.\u201d Should I cancel my international travel plans? The C.D.C. has warned Americans not to travel to China or South Korea unless it is absolutely essential. The State Department on Sunday warned Americans not to travel on cruise ships at all. Older adults and people with chronic medical conditions should also consider postponing travel anywhere, particularly by air, federal officials warned. Many countries have also enacted travel restrictions and bans, closing their doors to people from countries with sustained transmission of the virus. Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers for signs of illness. Thailand and Malaysia have turned away yet another cruise ship, this one carrying a large number of Italians. Airlines and cruise lines have canceled service to destinations affected by the outbreak, with others, including United Airlines, cutting back on domestic service and international service. Is it too late to contain the virus? W.H.O. officials have credited lockdown measures China imposed in late January for averting the spread of more cases from Wuhan. China sealed off cities, shut down businesses and schools, and ordered residents to remain in their homes. Officials use cellphone data to track and intercept those who have been to Hubei Province. In recent weeks, government workers have gone door-to-door to round up people who are infected, placing them in stadiums and other buildings that have been converted to makeshift hospitals. Now, official reports suggest that new cases in China are waning. But there is growing fear that containment may no longer be possible. Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said the surge of cases in multiple countries was \u201cconcerning because we know the transmissions are spreading at a fast rate.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve learned some things of this new virus for the past couple of weeks that make it seem unlikely that containment will be a strategy that will completely stop this virus,\u201d he added. There is benefit to delaying its spread as long as possible. Containing the virus may buy health officials more time to stock hospitals with test kits and respirators, and develop drugs for treatment and a vaccine. But the ability of nations to prepare for the arrival of coronavirus cases will depend largely on the strength of their health systems, capacity to conduct tests and effectiveness in communicating updates to the public. \u201cWe have been dealing with flu for decades, and even now it seems some countries don\u2019t even have a policy for influenza preparedness,\u201d said Leo Poon, head of the University of Hong Kong\u2019s public health laboratory sciences division. \u201cNot to mention something which is new to them. That\u2019s a problem.\u201d ",

COVID 19 is not a flu, it\u2019s a Coronavirus, the 2 Coronavirus outbreaks in the last 20 years were the SAR\u2019s CoV, and the MER\u2019s CoV, they had the nasty habit of killing, respectively, 14% of those infected and 34% infected. RACGP - How does coronavirus compare with previous global outbreaks? Luckily, COVID - 19 is pretty anaemic compared to that. It\u2019s still worse than flu. People keep quoting a 2% death rate and saying \u201cyeah, but the flu kills more\u201d. No, the flu kills about 0.1%, but more people have had it - So more have died, simple as that. At COVID-19\u2019s 2% or the sometimes mentioned 2.3% thats 20 or 23 times worse than the flu. 20 times more fatal is deadly (excuse the pun) serious. Even worse, if it can be worse, is that around 20% - not 2%, 20% are ending up with pneumonia or in ICU. That is awful with a capital \u2018A\u2019. Awful in my country, with free medical care, ruinous in the US, unless your insurance covers it. I note stats currently show 78,994 cases, 2,470 dead and 23,419 recovered. That leaves over 50,000 still to get well, but they hopefully end up in the recovered category. If these stats are true this one has \u201cahh, f##k\u2026\u201d written all over it -. They may not be true however\u2026 It is possible we are only seeing the fin of the shark and there are large numbers of people catching this who are not showing up in the statistics. Someone catches a sniffle, spreads it to mum, dad, and the lady at the pie shop, who also catch a sniffle. We only notice it later when a couple of people down the road get really sick and they only get counted in the statistics. That could skew the death rate back towards the \u2018bad flu\u2019 rate. Currently however, we don\u2019t have enough evidence to prove that. It would also make it very hard to stop, as almost symptomless people can still spread it. As strange as it seems we really have no idea how bad this is going to get or how far it is going to spread. This illness is only 2 months old. We still have a lot to learn. ",

            "answer_text": "I have done battle with this virus before. Despite the talk and the fact that virus may be mutated etc I would like to explain how to fight it. It can be easily defeated. Wash your hands a lotClean up your toilet facilitiesIf a significant level of infection is happening around your area, get your building plumbing inspected and repaired.I know that seems to simple but the last time this virus stuck it\u2019s head up that killed it. You don\u2019t have that much of a problem as you might think. We can defeat this by simple measures. Yes I was the one who wrote the report to the US-CIA on how to defeat this disease the last time and it worked. Now unless you think this is funny, this is standard medical stuff and standard epidemiology. If you want to live and do well get everyone doing this stuff. No virus will kill out everyone. People will survive. The sci fi terror of a lethal germ that kills everyone isn\u2019t what happens. Actually the morality and morbidity and incubation times for this virus are close to as bad as it gets. More than likely this disease going to be coldcocked about as fast as it appears. We know how to fight it. Just everyone get with the program and it will go away. This disease has a definite racial variant and it attacks Chinese people more than others. That doesn\u2019t mean it will not bother others. The last time it appeared it was associated with failed plumbing systems of large high rise buildings in about 12 buildings. The location and conditions of this emergence look the same. There may be variations we do not know at this time. The trigger for this outbreak is most probably some major event or condition that has developed in the past year where a lot of people moved in or out of the area of Wuhan China. I would suggest it is likely to be related to Chinese Military movements as such diseases typically associate so. But I do not know for sure. It could be some civilian movements or event. Is the Chinese Communist Party being on the up and up on this? Probably not but this will sort itself out in time. The measures to control the epidemic are not different regardless. China has much issues with public health and safety that are not resolved and with it\u2019s high population that makes thes much worse for the world and much more dangerous. ",

            "answer_text": "Simple answer; probably not. If you are worried about global recession, here are some basic principals; there will probably be a large reduction in output in the developed world because we have such a large service/leisure based economy. In the developing world, manufacturing is the main basis of it\u2019s output, and they supply us with many of the \u201cthings\u201d we buy. This means as long as we buy electronics, plastic products, coffee, sugar, fuel etc. the developing nations will export things to us, and they will keep going, financially, just as before. when the infection levels fall away in the developed nations we will go back to traveling the world, enjoying leisure activities, going to bars/restaurants/hotels/clubs/cinema\u2019s etc. and the world will be \u201cnormal\u201d again. As far as the G20 nations, there will be short term declines in living standards, but fiscal protection packages and consumer markets are strong in these regions. Government policies will inherently protect most major employers, and once the virus runs through it\u2019s growth phase, these employers and industries will re-ignite the economy. We will probably see a boom in the service sector and employment rates will jump. Don\u2019t forget, most food retail, agricultural/farming, manufacturing, supply chain/logistics/freight, financial, and state agencies are all still in operation. This means that many people who have/will lose work( specifically those in the service industry, like bars, leisure, hotels and restaurants, or the gig economy((not food delivery!)) will have jobs to go back to after the infection rates fall and the service industry starts up again. National governments in the G20 are also introducing packages intended to sustain those businesses while they are forced into closure, and the G7 nations are all looking at personal relief packages(short term universal income!). Maybe we can learn from it, hygiene for one! Washing hands is very effective at slowing/stopping almost all disease spread. so that would be a good behavioural change. I don\u2019t think Covid-19 will ruin the world, it has and will ruin a lot of lives, it will change it in many ways. Short term changes and impacts through restrictions aimed at limiting the virus\u2019s effects will affect us. But long term? Things will be back to how they were, sorrow for the dead, maybe a few memorials will be built, and our leaders will say some words and make promises as usual. In one year\u2019s time, we probably won\u2019t see much change from how it was in 2019, 2020 will be looked back on like 2016, bad stuff and changes happened and we moved on. ",

            "answer_text": "Not even remotely close. Even in the absolute worst-case scenario where the disease is maliciously killing its hosts on purpose (which isn\u2019t a thing), there\u2019s no such thing as a plague that kills 100% of the people it infects. The reason for this is genetic diversity. Or more accurately, sexual reproduction (as opposed to asexual reproduction like cloning of plants or cell division among bacteria) creates such diversity that no one cause can wipe out a species, which has enabled such species to flourish and produce as many different variations as we see today. This is a feature of human beings going back so far in our genetic history, that it was a feature from back before when we were fish. As a result, by default, some percentage of us are naturally immune to Coronavirus and any other virus that might kill us as well. That percentage is quite high, as is demonstrated by this statistic: 80 people are dead and more than 2,700 cases have been confirmed in mainland China Ref: Coronavirus outbreak: Latest news and live updates - CNN This means that so far (with modern medicine helping us out), only 2.9% of the people with enough symptoms to not just shrug it off as a case of the sniffles, have died, leaving 97.1% of those able to survive so far. Even if the death toll were to triple as the disease runs its course, that would still mean only 8.9% would die, leaving behind 91.1% of the population, in the absolute worst case scenario. I\u2019m not even counting the number of people who have been exposed to the virus and absolutely nothing has happened at all. I\u2019m making a big, fat assumption that 100% of the population is going to be infected. Just think about how Wuhan has a population of 11 million people, and only 2700 of them have gotten sick so far. Don\u2019t fall for the hype and the psychotic intentions of politicians who would like to say there\u2019s a boogeyman over yonder hill coming to gobble us all up if we don\u2019t kill them all now (or whatever they intend to do with that kind of fear). It\u2019s a story as old as the first politician. ",

            "answer_text": "No. If it does become a full-blown pandemic - at ~25% global infection (1918 level) and <5% mortality (which is more aggressive than what we\u2019ve seen so far, and final numbers tend towards the less aggressive), tens of millions will be dead. Perhaps even a hundred million. And while this may sound heartless, it isn\u2019t an extinction, it\u2019s a culling. Even if it targeted the reproductive-age population (like 1918), it still couldn\u2019t cause extinction. Humanity will be fine. The biggest challenge will be dealing with the economic effects of population loss (like reduced demand), although again not to sound heartless, many countries could end up \u201cin the black\u201d on that point by saving spending on their retirement systems. [Ed: An explanation on the economics\u2026] Those most affected by COVID are elderly, thus most likely to be retired and non-working. On the federal balance sheet, they represent a large liability in the form of SS and Medicare spending. On state balance sheets, they represent a lot of public pensioners and consume a lot of public services. Macroeconomically, they don\u2019t produce much supply, and where they do, they mostly undercut youth wages by competing for employment with them (like the seniors working at McDonalds). They DO produce a lot of demand, however, in the form of health care. Home care, hospice, all the various ailments of old age, etc. They also have a lot of savings. A massive die-off of 2.3 million Americans, probably at least 2 million of whom will be seniors, would (1) relieve the government of their entitlement liabilities, (2) negligibly reduce supply, (3) temporarily spike demand for elderly health services, then settle into a permanent reduction of demand, and (4) transfer a lot of wealth to younger generations. Again, this is not intended to paint a cheerful picture. My own grandmother definitely falls into this at-risk category, and I\u2019d hate to lose her to this crisis - I thought we had at least a FEW more years left. I\u2019m just trying to present some cold hard facts about how it would impact the global economy. We\u2019ve already seen the negative effects just from the containment effort and the stock- and oil-market fallouts. I\u2019m just pointing out that there are some inherent aspects to the way the disease might kill people and who it kills and what they mean to the economy, which would spur the eventual recovery. ",

It\u2019s called the Bradykinin hypothesis. Added 4 July 2020: Evidence for immunity has emerged in infected Chinese monkeys. China announced a vaccine on June 25 and is inoculating members of their military. China agreed on July 2 to partner with Brazil to test another version of a coronavirus vaccine they have in their arsenal. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Until there is evidence for acquired immunity, the emergence of this virus in humans has to be treated as a species-extinction event. Why? It\u2019s high transmissibility and lethality makes a population collapse inevitable absent an effective vaccine. If humans prove unable to acquire immunity, a vaccine cannot be made even in principle. The apparent ease with which this virus jumps species is worrisome. Passing the virus back and forth between humans and their animals makes contact tracing difficult to impossible. It adds a level of complexity to the problem that we don\u2019t need right now. Animal transmission means that a reduction in the target population of humans will not necessarily reduce their exposure to the virus, because virus transmission to humans from asymptomatic animal populations can drive the virus into remote concentrations of human survivors. Animal transmission can render \u201csocial distancing\u201d strategies ineffective. The inability of humans to understand their predicament is truly tragic. Most people don\u2019t understand how exponential growth works. They are unable to grasp that a single lily pad on a lake takes 26 doublings to cover 6% of the surface. People living on the lake don\u2019t know they have a problem. During the next 4 doublings the covering goes to 100%. The lake chokes before the neighbors, many of them, notice that the lake is dead. The other problem is optimism. Humans seem to be hard-wired to believe that everything turns out good in the end. This belief flies in the face of history and experience. Every person, every civilization, every species dies. No exceptions. Humans are at risk as never before because of overpopulation and the development of technologies that can turn against them when mishandled. Handling elevated risk successfully is critical to human survival. Some of our leaders who should know better seem oblivious. RISK NO WAY OUT ",

Trump said he wants to keep Grand Princess cruise passengers on the ship so that US coronavirus numbers don't 'double.' That strategy failed in Japan.  They will remember that Trump was only concerned about PR or his own reelection campaign. The Trumpers inside that Cruise (chances are that 48% of them are Trumpers) will remember that Trump couldn\u2019t care less if they die or not, as long as they die outside the ledge..:) So, the USA had a great CDC (Center for Disease Control) team in charge of saving the USA from emerging new viruses. TRUMP ELIMINATED THAT TEAM!!!! The CDC Team is the one that protected us from the MERS, H1N1, EBOLA\u2026. that is why you can\u2019t remember the millions of people who died from those diseases. The CDC didn\u2019t allowed that to happen - UNSANG HEROES, THOSE SCIENTISTS!!! So, Civilization will survive. If we reach say 70% of the World Population infected and we keep that 3.4% mortality rate, then some 7 billion * 70% * 3.4%= 167 million people. That is how dangerous this virus is. Just in the USA, we could get some 8.5 million people dead and that included a large fraction of our parents, grandparent. In future mutations of this virus, it might attack our kids, so this is a shifting problem that can come back to bite us again. The only danger to Civilization is Religion. As far as I can tell, Religious Leaders are staying alway from claiming this virus to be the evidence of the next coming of Jesus..:) Just a few are profiteering from their sheeple:  If you are really stupid, please send the $300 dollars and get your Silver Bullet..:) Unsurprisingly, This Scammer is a Supporter of the other Scammer (Joao Trump) ",

            "answer_text": "Is the coronavirus going to end the world? It is impossible to predict the future effects of the coronavirus on this planet of 7.7 billion humans. The virus, called SARS-CoV-2, made its first public appearance in a seafood-and-live-animal market in Wuhan, China in January 2020. Since then, as the number of COVID-19 cases confirmed overseas daily have surpassed those within China, the draconian measures that appear to have quelled the outbreak domestically are gradually being relaxed. Experts say one possibility is that cases of the disease will start decreasing when enough people develop immunity, either through infection or vaccination. Another possible scenario is that the virus will continue to circulate and establish itself as a common respiratory virus. Pandemics end when the virus doesn't have enough susceptible people to infect. The catastrophic 1918 Spanish flu pandemic is thought to have infected 500 million people worldwide, many of them soldiers living in close quarters fighting in World War I. Once the war ended and people dispersed, the spread slowed as people had less contact. But the flu was ultimately halted in part because those who survived it had immunity and the virus didn't hop as easily as it did at the beginning. If the virus comes into contact with another person but that person isn't susceptible to the disease, then that chain of transmission is snuffed out. If one person infects two, those people together infect four and so on, and eventually, the virus runs out of susceptible people to infect. Another possibility is that SARS-CoV-2 will mutate in a potentially beneficial way, making it more difficult for the virus to infect people. Back in 2002, a similar coronavirus in the Guangdong province of southern China first hopped to humans from animals and caused an outbreak of an infection that became known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The virus that caused SARS had a relatively low mutation rate, so it didn't reoccur. In the end, it is impossible to predict how the virus will behave. With the massive population and continual contact with animal reservoirs, new viruses will keep emerging. ",

            "answer_text": "No, we\u2019ve had pandemics many times in history, one of them killing off an estimated 75 million to 125 million deaths in medieval Europe (Bubonic Plague). But life went on. The Coronavirus is serious, of course, and we now know the US is completely unprepared to handle it, thanks to three people who don\u2019t see it as a problem at all; Our dishonest and incompetent President, his mindless Vice President (who is being put in charge of something he knows nothing about) and our so-called Health and Human Services administrator who is also openly in denial. There are many medical experts working on this, but they clearly don\u2019t have the support of US leadership to accomplish what they need to. Aside from the many killed around the world (only 20% of the infected have the most dangerous version of this virus, the other 80% have milder cases that normally lead to recovery, like a bad flu), we do not have a cure or vaccine yet for this mutated Virus. It\u2019s being worked on, of course. On a different note, the Virus is considered by the financial press to be responsible for the worldwide economic turndown. In the last week, we have the greatest losses in the Stock Market since 2008, when the Great Recession hit the Western World. Contrary to popular ignorance, the stock market is a bellwether for the Economy, as it tells us what\u2019s happening to all our corporations and companies, where most jobs come from. Here\u2019s one line I read on the news today; \u201cCorporations continue to warn that they won't meet their first-quarter earnings targets. Microsoft (MSFT) announced that late Wednesday. Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a report Thursday that it now thinks US companies will generate zero earnings in 2020.\u201d Other reports tell us Americans companies may not make any profit this year. I know of a Conservative Republican Governor who, around the time of the last election, made a very large rainy day fund for his state, to prepare specifically for the next Recession. Perhaps he knows what the government in Washington doesn\u2019t know. Looks like donald will, before the next election, face an economy like that of President Bush Jr in his second term, and lose most of his electoral support. I suppose that\u2019s something good for the country but at a great price. And for those of you who wonder why one could care about stocks and the economy in a time of Pandemic; the obvious answer is, if many millions of jobs once again disappear, many millions of families will suffer and maybe end up homeless. What if this happened to those of you reading this? So yes, it does matter very much. ",

            "answer_text": "Coronavirus Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Things to keep in mind Ground 0 for the virus meaning where it started from Wuhan/Population   11.08 million 2018 The rate of infection=84,000 since December last year 2019 good amount of people infected in such as short timeThe countrys infected=56 countries so farDeaths=2,900Random mutations possible because its a virusOutside interface (Will a country or a terrorist organization weaponized virus)If the rate of infection stays higher then the death ratio that will be problematic the virus gonna spread far possible the hole world at some point everyone would be infected then then deathIf the death ratio was higher then the rate of infection there a good chance it would end quickly without spreading to far unless 8 happenedIf people could get infected by dead bodys could also be a problemThats why having sex with animals is a big no no I think its called Bestiality(Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.)other possible vectors fleas, ticks, mosquitoes,bats, pets such as cats and dogs ecdMost people wont see a doctor becouse think its a common cold or somthing until they die then its to late people only go to hospital when is bad becouse it exspensive so by then it might be to lateThe fact it started in China is also problematic 1 high population 2 lots of big urban areas 3 virus like this should spread vary fast in that environment 4 a lot is exported from china so infecting other countries would be easy 5 could this be man made and done on purposeVast majority of the infected have mild to no symptom.

A few weeks back, Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, and Donald Trump conjured up a stimulus package to bailout billion dollar companies during this crisis and a $1200 one-time check to qualified Americans. At most, we should understand small-business are struggling and NOT being bailed out \u2014 but being offered to apply for a small business loans with stipulations through the CARES Act. I live in downtown Richmond and on every corner we have breweries, and mom and pop restaurants. Chain restaurants are not a thing here, but if small businesses do not recover from this, we will see MORE Outback Steakhouses, Ruth Chris\u2019, PF Changs, and other restaurants we see on TV. The way small businesses are failing because of this pandemic I can almost guarantee you a Monopoly will develop. I am having a hard time imagining people who worked for their local artistry store or their own e-commerce store won't end up working for a Wal-Mart or Wells Fargo. It sucks, but I feel like this an opportunity for the corporations who can ask for billions without any strings attached will be fine. They have always been fine, but Democrats and Republicans feel like the trillion dollar airline industry won't recover, or the banks, or box-retail stores won't survive a 2\u20133 month shutdown (which we\u2019re still buying from them). Small businesses are being screwed over, and our world is going to shape and turn into a black mirror episode with 5\u20136 companies running every industry. I hope it doesn't happen, but all you have to do is pay politicians a good amount of change and they will do anything for you. ",

Doomsayers, prophets, fortune tellers, money makers and markets, shares and dividends, unscrupulous businesses will all jump on the bandwagon to proclaim the end of the world. There is an incentive to say so. Very often the profit motive supersedes humanity and greed takes top priority. Creating fear, designing the end of the world, profiting on the next life, expecting to be venerated for false profiteering are all negative sides of the human psyche. One has to remember that life started from an unknown minuscule combination of proteins and molecules and took a billion years or more to become life as we know it. Life is not easy to extinguish with such a close finish. No virus or bacteria has ever won the battle against life. Life has always won. And it will continue to win-no matter what unfolds in our smallness. Life is meant to be. If it survived for millions or billions of years-it was meant to be. You can create your own understanding of what life really is. We are beginning to understand that life exists outside of our bubble. We are not alone. We can never be alone. Life is not a candle that can be so easily extinguished by any virus or any life from anywhere in the great universe. It has its own journey, a clear pathway to reach beyond the simplicity we only now understand. We have not yet gained the magnitude of the stars, We do not understand how life began. And because we do not understand how to snuff life when we don't yet understand how life started, is an imbalance of philosophy and respect. We are conquerors, not defeatists. There is so much ahead of us. The cycle of life will continue to develop until we come to the beginning. There is no end to this search. This alone is the beginning of philosophy. The Coronavirus is just one small dot on the continuity of life. It will be history in a few more months. It is not granted the power of life to persist. It has only a half-life and the mere sight of the sun will break its bones. No virus can survive in Light. It is only in darkness that it can open its workshop. Table salt is much better. Life is sacred. Today is the day you call your grandma and grandpa and thank them. Today is the day you don\u2019t hug your children and say goodnight. Today is the day you look at each other on the great technologies and say: I love you. Finally, today is the day to say the words: We are alive. You and I. We will not give up. The end of the world is not in our time. Don't believe the doomsayers. Their foresight is poor and riddled with silly agendas. They cannot see beyond tomorrow and how short is this vision.? This is only the beginning of a new life where we care for each other. Through the bubble, we can still see our neighbour and friend and still reach out. Keep the flame going. Do your part. Stay alive. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it is fatal. It can kill within a week. It is better to understand about it and follow right conduct. Novel corona virus pneumonia is a dry cough without runny nose. the Wuhan virus (called COVID 19) will be killed at a temperature of 30-35 degrees. Drink more hot water. Go under the Sun for a long time. Avoid taking non-veg food and avoid very cold food including icecream etc. 1. This virus is pretty large in size (cell is about 400-500nm diameter), so any normal mask (not just the N95 feature) should be able to filter it out. However, when someone who's infected sneezes in front of you, it will take a great 3 meters (about 10 feet) before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. 2. When the virus drops on metal surface, it will live for at least 12 hours. So remember if you come in contact with any metal surface, wash your hands with soap thoroughly. Don't depend on the sanitizers. 3. The virus can remain active on fabric for 6-12 hours. Normal laundry detergent should kill the virus. For winter clothing that does not require daily washing, you can put it out under the sun for 4 hours to kill the virus. symptoms of the pneumonia caused by Coronavirus: 1. It will first infect the throat, so the throat will have the dry sore throat feeling which will last for 3 to 4 days 2. Then the virus will blend into the nasal fluid and drips into the trachea and enter the lungs, causing pneumonia. This process will take 5 to 6 days. 3. With pneumonia, comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You will feel like you are drowning in water. It's important to seek immediate medical attention if you feel like this. prevention: 1. The most common way of getting infected is by touching things in public, so you must wash your hands frequently. The virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but a lot of damage can happen in those 5-10 mins (you may rub your eyes or pick your nose unwittingly). 2. Aside from washing your hands frequently, you can gargle with Betadine Sore Throat Gargle to eliminate or minimize the germs while they are still in your throat (before dripping down to your lungs). 3. Follow traditional Indian lifestyle and lead a life of ethics and values. Traditional Indian values and lifestyle is the best to fight against such deadly diseases. 4. This virus is only an early warning. The nature may have many more such diseases in future. This is a reaction of nature against over-exploitation of nature by human beings. A recent article in Malayasia mentioned Jain Philosophy as the best solution at the present moment. Jain Saints don\u2019t eat after Sunset, they are vegetarians, they always take boiled water. They eat freshly cooked food and are very scientific about what to eat and what not to eat. They use Muhbatti (a type of Mask). These practices they have been following for thousands of years. They are in news now. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not even close. Coronavirus (Covid-19) will kill some (it already has), though it's nowhere near fatal enough to kill the \u201centire world\u201d. Data from Germany suggests the fatality rate is around 0.4%, and the UK government is reporting 1 death per 1,000 infected (i.e. - a fatality rate of just 0.1%). And note that the vast majority of deaths are coming from those age 65+, and those with certain pre-existing health conditions (often an overlap of both categories). Note that the official/confirmed fatality rates you are seeing, on say Worldometers, or official government sites, are coming out far higher than these fatality rates - simply because every fatality is being accounted for, but only a small proportion of cases are (i.e. - making it look more fatal than it is, and at the same time significantly undercounting the true number of infected). This is because, in the UK for example, the only people being tested for Covid-19, are a portion of those being hospitalised with suspected symptoms (i.e. - only the most severe cases are being tested for). Meanwhile, there are many people out there with Covid-19, who are either asymptomatic, or have mild symptoms, and therefore aren't being tested, so aren't forming part of this data. It's important to note, the world's population is higher than its ever been before (estimated @ 7.8 billion people), so that could have the effect of making Covid-19 look worse than it really is (when comparing to historic pandemics), since there's now a bigger pool of people to infect & kill then there ever has been. Hence why it's better to look at the proportion of people alive that died, rather than just the absolute number. ",

She was worried about how I am arranging for my food and coping up with being alone. After I assured her that everything is normal with me, she was normal again as if nothing big is going on this world which is too serious. I asked her how does she not panic about this situation. Her voice became deeper. She said: \u201cYou know son. I have lived here twice the number of years than you. This might be the first crisis that you are facing as an adult, this reminder of doomsday is not new for us. In 1990: There was news that a Comet will strike the earth and we will all die. Nothing happened and the same year you were born. In 2012: There was sort of a scientific proof that the doomsday has been calculated with precise date and timing. In 2020: Now there is CoronaVirus.\u201d I asked: \u201cSo should we not be worried about this?\u201d She said: \u201cOf course you should be\u201d \u201cThese times of uncertainty expose the voids created in our lives. These times make us mature. We learn to help each other and we also learn the most important lesson that if humanity stands together, we will always win\u201d \u201cBut, not even for a second, buy this propaganda of doomsday\u201d \u201cWe all are going to die someday but NOT TODAY\u201d That entire day I chose not to listen to the news and went on to finish that book I was reading.

            "answer_text": "Q: Will the Coronavirus cause a major population decline? A: Almost certainly not. Worst case mortality seems to be around 15%, and only occurs when medical care is VERY sub-par. Also, the mortality in children and teens is close to 0%. In fact, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the kids would infect parents and teachers, the schools probably could stay open. What you may see are Significant \u2018population declines\u2019 among 80+ year old individuals, where mortality is over 10% with full medical care, and much higher without it..Very high mortality in 3rd world countries..High mortality, at least initially, in Western countries unwilling to sacrifice political and social goals to medical necessity. China imposed a draconian quarantine that has been effective, but it\u2019s not clear that the US, the UK, or the EU are currently willing to do so..But probably, when enough people die, the West will face up to reality and impose China-style quarantines..Something to keep in mind: only a TINY minority of Chinese have been infected. Even in Wuhan, where perhaps the actual number of infections is double the public figures, that would be only 150,000 people infected out of maybe 15,000,000 people in the area! Unfortunately, infection rates are likely to be higher in the West, because of weaker quarantines. Even so, it\u2019s unlikely that a majority of people will be infected over the next 12 months. BTW, here\u2019s what effective quarantining in the West would look like: Closure of mass tourist attractions, like amusement parks, theaters, etc at the first sign of local infectionTV-only major league sportsRestrictions on non-essential travel, both in and out of the country. Airplane, train and bus cabins are too confined to control risk.Closure of schools as soon as local infection appears.Ending political rallies (making Trump unhappy) in areas with local infections.Relaxing FDA and CDC rules that slow vaccine and treatment development. Legislation to allow patients to make informed consent to be treated in ways that may still have some risk.Restrictions on spacing in companies, churches, etc. with all persons maintaining at least a 3\u2032 separation.War powers related emergency production of medical supplies previously sourced from China.Private and government encouragement of work-at-home, study-at-home methods.Shelter-in-place quarantines for areas with substantial infections.Triage in medical facilities, essentially writing-off infected patients who are over-80, immunocompromised, have COPD, have diabetes, etc. Deprioritizing older patients (60+ years like me!) who have lower survival rates.Rates of infection spread will drop, once such steps are taken. BUT . . . obviously, these steps are ones Westerners will find hard to accept . . . but since World War II, the West has increasingly lived in a fantasy world, divorced from historical reality, by transient prosperity and relative political tranquility. My guess is the BIGGEST CASUALTY of the coronavirus will be what might be called the \u201cWestern optimistic humanist fantasy\u2019.  The moment in the drafty church at smokerise ",

            "answer_text": "There are two ways we can look at what impact the new coronavirus has on the world 1. Mortality rate: Latest WHO estimates put the mortality rate at 3.4%. Now while this might seem like a lot, compared to other viruses like SARS (9.6%) or MERS (34%), it is quite low. The main problem is the high rate at which it spreads, which is also the reason why it managed to kill more people than SARS in such a short time. It is also important to consider what kind of people contribute the most to the death toll: if you contract the virus and are under 50, the chance of dying is under 0.4%. The numbers increase drastically the higher we look at the age. People between 70\u201379 have an 8% chance of dying, while people over 80 have a 14.8% chance of dying. Pre-existing medical conditions also play a huge role, changing the mortality rate by 5 to 10% depending on the disease. COVID-19 might not destory the world by killing off all it\u2019s inhabitants, but there is another way it can affect society\u2026 2. Economy: And I am not only talking about hand sanitizers and face masks. While fearmongering and panic caused virus protection products to spike in sales (and also skyrocket in price), other areas of the economy are suffering right now: in Europe, among other sectors, oil and gas stocks fell by over 16%. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell by 11%, Germany\u2019s DAX by 8% and France\u2019s CAC 40 by 8.4%. For those unfamiliar with the stock market (like myself a couple of moments ago), these changes are quite the contrary of good. And it does not only affect the stock market; new prevention laws in Italy and Germany are prohibiting gatherings of over 1,000 people (including festivals, concerts, conventions, and other events), while Italy went a step further and also closed down schools, museums, cinemas, theatres, night clubs, sport events\u2026 the list goes on. While it is only for a short time, this means huge losses for the economy. Having families under quarantine also means that those people can not be productive, which further increases economic strain. So could the coronavirus destroy the world by ruining the economy? Probably not. While it does certainly slow it down, people do recover from the virus. In fact, people have already recovered from over half of the coronavirus cases recorded to this date. On the bright side though, the virus did have a positive impact on the environment, quite contrary to destroying the world.

Respiratory physician John Wilson explains the range of Covid-19 impacts, from no symptoms to severe illness featuring pneumonia Follow our Australian coronavirus live blog the latest local updatesFollow the global coronavirus blog for live news and latest updatesGraham Readfearn @readfearn Email Thu 12 Mar 2020 16.30 GMT Last modified on Sat 14 Mar 2020 05.07 GMT  What became known as Covid-19, or the coronavirus, started in late 2019 and early 2020 in the Chinese city of Wuhan as a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause. The cause of the pneumonia was found to be a new virus \u2013 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19. Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms. \u2018He\u2019s gonna get us all killed\u2019: sense of unease after Trump coronavirus speech Read more WHO says about 80% of people with Covid-19 recover without needing any specialist treatment. Only about one person in six becomes seriously ill \u201cand develops difficulty breathing\u201d. So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body? How is the virus affecting people? Guardian Australia spoke with Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician. He says almost all serious consequences of Covid-19 feature pneumonia.  The coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan as a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause. Photograph: Barcroft Media via Getty Images Wilson says people who catch Covid-19 can be placed into four broad categories. The least serious are those people who are \u201csub-clinical\u201d and who have the virus but have no symptoms. Next are those who get an infection in the upper respiratory tract, which, Wilson says, \u201cmeans a person has a fever and a cough and maybe milder symptoms like headache or conjunctivitis\u201d. He says: \u201cThose people with minor symptoms are still able to transmit the virus but may not be aware of it.\u201d Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson's travels: selfies, shows and beachside strolls before coronavirus diagnosis Read more The largest group of those who would be positive for Covid-19, and the people most likely to present to hospitals and surgeries, are those who develop the same flu-like symptoms that would usually keep them off work. A fourth group, Wilson says, will develop severe illness that features pneumonia. He says: \u201cIn Wuhan, it worked out that from those who had tested positive and had sought medical help, roughly 6% had a severe illness.\u201d The WHO says the elderly and people with underlying problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. Professor Robert Booy from the University of Sydney, Head of Clinical Research at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, answers questions about what Covid-19 does to the body. How does the pneumonia develop? When people with Covid-19 develop a cough and fever, Wilson says this is a result of the infection reaching the respiratory tree \u2013 the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside. He says: \u201cThe lining of the respiratory tree becomes injured, causing inflammation. This in turn irritates the nerves in the lining of the airway. Just a speck of dust can stimulate a cough. \u201cBut if this gets worse, it goes past just the lining of the airway and goes to the gas exchange units, which are at the end of the air passages. \u201cIf they become infected they respond by pouring out inflammatory material into the air sacs that are at the bottom of our lungs.\u201d If the air sacs then become inflamed, Wilson says this causes an \u201coutpouring of inflammatory material [fluid and inflammatory cells] into the lungs and we end up with pneumonia.\u201d He says lungs that become filled with inflammatory material are unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, reducing the body\u2019s ability to take on oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. \u201cThat\u2019s the usual cause of death with severe pneumonia,\u201d he says. How can the pneumonia be treated? Prof Christine Jenkins, chair of Lung Foundation Australia and a leading respiratory physician, told Guardian Australia: \u201cUnfortunately, so far we don\u2019t have anything that can stop people getting Covid-19 pneumonia. \u201cPeople are already trialling all sorts of medications and we\u2019re hopeful that we might discover that there are various combinations of viral and anti-viral medications that could be effective. At the moment there isn\u2019t any established treatment apart from supportive treatment, which is what we give people in intensive care. \u201cWe ventilate them and maintain high oxygen levels until their lungs are able to function in a normal way again as they recover.\u201d Coronavirus Australia: Labor calls for mass events to be cancelled and schools closed Read more Wilson says patients with viral pneumonia are also at risk of developing secondary infections, so they would also be treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics. \u201cIn some situations that isn\u2019t enough,\u201d he says of the current outbreak. \u201cThe pneumonia went unabated and the patients did not survive.\u201d Is Covid-19 pneumonia different? Jenkins says Covid-19 pneumonia is different from the most common cases that people are admitted to hospitals for. \u201cMost types of pneumonia that we know of and that we admit people to hospital for are bacterial and they respond to an antibiotic. Wilson says there is evidence that pneumonia caused by Covid-19 may be particularly severe. Wilson says cases of coronavirus pneumonia tend to affect all of the lungs, instead of just small parts. He says: \u201cOnce we have an infection in the lung and, if it involves the air sacs, then the body\u2019s response is first to try and destroy [the virus] and limit its replication.\u201d But Wilson says this \u201cfirst responder mechanism\u201d can be impaired in some groups, including people with underlying heart and lung conditions, diabetes and the elderly. Jenkins says that, generally, people aged 65 and over are at risk of getting pneumonia, as well as people with medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or a chronic disease affecting the lungs, heart, kidney or liver, smokers, Indigenous Australians, and infants aged 12 months and under. \u201cAge is the major predictor of risk of death from pneumonia. Pneumonia is always serious for an older person and in fact it used to be one of the main causes of death in the elderly. Now we have very good treatments for pneumonia. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that no matter how healthy and active you are, your risk for getting pneumonia increases with age. This is because our immune system naturally weakens with age, making it harder for our bodies to fight off infections and diseases.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The current increase in number of cases in the US actually tracks with the increase in cases in China several months ago during the initial outbreak. Most importantly, the current number of reported cases in China is in decline. So there\u2019s no reason to suspect the same won\u2019t happen in the US, even more quickly, and that it won\u2019t reach anywhere near the levels in China, where they were initially slow to respond and made no attempt to isolate infected people in the Wuhan and Hubei Provences where it started. Outside those areas (in China) cases are much lower. Comparisons to the Spanish Flu pandemic made by your typically irresponsible reporters and tv hosts (Bill Maher) are poor comparisons, mainly because that was an era before antibiotics. The better comparison apparently (according to the CDC) is with SARS. Quoting from a report: China began clinical trials of a SARS vaccine in November 2003, while in the US, the first human SARS trials began in December 2004, conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\u2026.Harvard professor Wayne Marasco identified a single antibody out of a 27-billion antibody library that blocked the SARS virus from entering human cells. Marasco is actively testing new antibodies in search of one that will have the same effect on SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) There\u2019s no reason to assume the Corona virus won\u2019t be contained and won\u2019t soon be in decline (as it is in China) and I\u2019m sure these are some of the factors behind Trump\u2019s typical glass half full demeanor. Finally, in addition to all the above consider this info from a J P Morgan analysis: During the haze of a pandemic, the best estimates that entities like the World Health Organization often derive are \u2026 complicated by [the affecting of] older individuals with pre-existing conditions. They do not know [the total number of infected individuals, including both asymptomatic people and people that get sick] \u2026 and sometimes it is never known, or only known with the passage of time. Take the Swine Flu (H1N1/2009) as an example. Early estimates in the fall of 2009 from the WHO1 pegged the H1N1 mortality rate at 1.0%-1.3%\u2026. Four years later [their] revised H1N1 mortality rate: just 0.02%. [Regarding the current Corona outbreak:] The vast majority of infected people will likely not become sick, and around 80% of people who get sick develop mild infections rather than severe ones. So yes, I think the world is safe. \u2014 Main source: J P Morgan analyst Michael Cembalest, March 9th, 2020. ",

I\u2019ve seen people say no one is immune but I haven\u2019t seen anything saying that exposure 100% leads to testing positive with or without symptoms. It has the potential to hit everyone in a community at the same time. No country has the resources to deal with that. It leads to pneumonia in 20% of the cases. Apparently it takes a while for some people to get over it as in weeks and well potentially months. The REALLY scary part is it mutated to this brand new strain and it could mutate into even more deadly strains. We don\u2019t know how to treat it (except treat the symptoms), we don\u2019t know how many people will get it. For every person with the illness you have to have others to support and care for them. The wartime analogy is for every wounded soldier you take 3 out of service. For every dead soldier you only took out 1. Our infrastructure (any country) isn\u2019t set up for that with already dealing with an aging population. I am still personally more concerned about the flu (not this years strain) in general than this new corona virus but I could see where this could easily change as we learn more. In the USA even Fast Tracked an FDA approved vaccine would take 6 months once they have developed it to be available. ",

            "answer_text": "No. There are those that are immune to the virus. Here is what has recently been published concerning COV-id 19 What is the Coronavirus: There are many different strains of the coronavirus. Most are not deadly and only cause illnesses like the common cold. Human coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that can cause a variety of illnesses ranging from the common cold to severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). The World Health Organization says Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans until late 2019. How did it originate: A new study published in the peer-reviewed journal Antiviral Research (Vol. 16, April 2020) is entitled, \u201cThe spike glycoprotein of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV contains a furin-like cleavage site absent in CoV of the same clade.\u201d It reveals that the CoVid-19 coronavirus contains unique features that allow it to function as a more efficient weapon system for human-to-human transmission, which helps explain why the virus has been impossible to contain (even under \u201cquarantine\u201d conditions, which have universally failed in China, Japan, Korea and elsewhere). As the science authors of the paper explain in the full text, \u201cThis furin-like cleavage site\u2026 may provide a gain-of-function to the 2019-nCoV for efficient spreading in the human population.\u201d (Emphasis added) Further, the science paper finds that there is no known viral ancestry to the CoVid-19 coronavirus, meaning it did not evolve from nature. It was engineered, and the science paper authors also state that the virus contains elements from MERS, stating, \u201cBefore the emergence of the 2019-nCoV, this important feature was not observed in the lineage b of beta coronaviruses.\u201d The abstract and full PDF (paid) of the study is available through this link at Science, health and medical journals, full text articles and books.: The spike glycoprotein of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV contains a furin-like cleavage site absent in CoV of the same clade ",

            "answer_text": "The head of the World Health Organization warned the threat of a global coronavirus pandemic was \"very real\" as the contagion continued its rapid spread around the world. In Italy - where some 16 million people are now under quarantine - there were 97 deaths reported, bringing its total on Monday to 463. Iran temporarily released about 70,000 prisoners because of the coronavirus epidemic, as the death toll rose by 43 new fatalities to 237. More than 3,800 people have died worldwide from coronavirus and over 110,000 infections have been recorded, according to WHO. Here are the latest updates: Monday, March 9 20:56 GMT - Italy imposes nationwide restrictions to contain new virus Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte says he is extending restrictions on travel from the north to the entire country to try to stop the spread of coronavirus. Conte said a new government decree will require all people in Italy to demonstrate a need to work, health conditions or other limited reasons to travel outside the areas where they live. \"There won't be just a red zone,'' Conte told reporters referring to a lockdown of areas in northern Italy instituted over the weekend. \"There will be Italy\" as a protected area, he said. 20:45 GMT - French culture minister tests positive for coronavirus French Culture Minister Franck Riester has contracted the novel coronavirus and is staying in his Paris home but is \"doing fine\", his office said \"The minister tested positive today,\" after displaying symptoms, the ministry said. It noted that Riester spent several days last week at the country's lower house National Assembly, where five virus cases were confirmed earlier. 20:30 GMT - Cruise ship struck by coronavirus docks a California port A cruise ship that had been barred from docking in San Francisco after a Coronavirus outbreak on board has docked in Oakland, California. The ship had 21 confirmed cases among the 3,500 passengers and crew on board and had been idling off the coast of California for four days as authorities worked out how to get passengers safely ashore. 20:26 GMT - Marine being treated for coronavirus worked at defence agency near Pentagon, officials say A United States Marine who tested positive for the coronavirus worked for a defence agency whose headquarters are located near the Pentagon and returned to the Washington, DC area from a trip to Ethiopia last month, three US officials told Reuters. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Marine had been working for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), which is based in Crystal City, Virginia, near the Pentagon. 20:15 GMT - Why experts say Trump is wrong to compare coronavirus to the flu From contradicting his own public health officials on the coronavirus to dismissing the World Health Organization's global fatality rate of COVID-19 as \"false\", United States President trump has been accused of attempting to downplay the seriousness of the disease since the virus reached the US. Those accusations continued when Trump apparently suggested that the response to the novel coronavirus has been overblown. 20:10 GMT - Portugal's president in 'exemplary' self-isolation, tests negative for coronavirus Shouting down to reporters from his first-floor balcony, Portugal's president declared that he would remain in voluntary quarantine for two weeks despite testing negative for coronavirus, as an \"example\" to Portuguese people. \"The test was negative. I'm going to keep working from home, even though it was negative, until the fifteen days are up,\" broadcaster SIC showed Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa as hollering. \"I want to be an example.\" The head of state, who is known for rarely missing a social gathering where he eagerly poses with people for selfies, was tested earlier on Monday after his office announced the previous day that he had suspended all engagements and trips abroad for a fortnight and would work from home. The 'Wuhan Shake' 19:25 GMT - Iraq orders closure of holy city of Najaf: state news agency Iraqi authorities have ordered the closure of Najaf province, home to holy Muslim Shia sites, for non-residents starting on Wednesday for a week to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the state news agency said. Najaf is a major destination for Shia pilgrims. 18:56 GMT - Canada records first death from new virus Canadian health officials say a man has died of the new virus at a home for the elderly in North Vancouver in what is believed to be the country's first COVID-19 death. British Columbia Provincial Health Officer Dr Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced at the weekend that two residents of the Lynn Valley Care Centre had been diagnosed with the virus. Henry says the diagnoses followed an earlier diagnosis of a worker at the care home, making the cases especially concerning as examples of community transmission. 18:13 GMT - Fifth UK death confirmed A fifth person in the United Kingdom has died after contracting coronavirus, the health service said. \"We can confirm that sadly, a patient in their seventies who was very unwell with a number of significant and long term health conditions has passed away at St Helier Hospital,\" said Daniel Elkeles, chief executive for Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust in a statement. 18:07 GMT - Iraq calls on citizens to avoid visiting sacred cities and sites Iraq banned all public gatherings and called on citizens to avoid visiting sacred cities and sites to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Authorities also called on Iraqis arriving from Iran, China, South Korea, Italy, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Kuwait and Bahrain to stay at home for self-quarantine for 14 days, a government statement said.

            "answer_text": "Good grief, no! COVID-19\u2019s ability as an infective agent is still the subject of some debate, with some giving the virus a reproductive rate lower than influenza, others considering it more able to reproduce than mumps, and most giving it a reproductive rate roughly equivalent to HIV. In crude terms, everyone with COVID-19 has the potential to pass it on to somewhere between two and three people before the host either quarantines themselves or becomes too ill to viably continue spreading the virus. However, even at that alarming rate the chances of it infecting a significant proportion of society is low. Only the measles (which has a reproductive rate of around 18) managed to infect most people before vaccination stopped its horrors. If we think it like other respiratory diseases spread by droplet infection, it could infect anything between a quarter and a half of the population of the planet. It\u2019s fatality rate is also the subject of some debate, but presently stands between 0.7% and 4% of the infected population. That figure could rise slightly if it overstretches health services around the world, but possibly not as much as you might think. Absolute worst case scenario: it kills 120m people. While that would make it seem worse than the 1919 flu (which killed as much as 100m worldwide), as a percentage of the population, the 1919 flu was more devastating (there are 7.7bn alive today, there was about 1.9bn alive then). We survived the 1919 flu, we\u2019ll survive this. It might change society, especially as it seems to be particularly damaging to the older parts of society. But not destroy it. And the likelihood is the disease will kill far fewer people, because as its impact begins to hit, people naturally isolate themselves as much as possible, limiting transmission. Eventually it either burns out or mutates and returns in greater or weaker strength every few years. ",

            "answer_text": "The world itself is not vulnerable to disease, so no to that.  Could disease end the human race? Technically, yes, though it would need very different properties than coronaviruses have. Anthrax spores live essentially indefinitely in the environment, while coronavirus dies in hours, days at most. So, a virus or bacterium that survives a very long time would be good.Being very infectious (not merely contagious) would be ideal. Coronavirus is pretty good at this, but being able to also be spread by wind like the dust from the Sahara would be better.Having a long \u201casymptomatic carrier\u201d period would also help, where people are walking around and spreading it without knowing.And then being rapidly and absolutely fatal to humans would be necessary, to wipe out humanity. If someone caught it, they might be walking around for a month, but after that incubation time, a quick death. Coronavirus is only maybe 5% fatal in humans, maybe a little more.Mutating rapidly.So you\u2019d end up with a disease as omnipresent as mold spores, which all humans and animals can spread to other humans, and which kills them dead. Even if people shelter in place for years, they eventually must come out, and will die. A single breach of any shelter would be all it\u2019d take. So, yes, humanity could be wiped out by a pandemic. Unless we first make it to another planet. In that case, the incubation period would need to be longer than the travel time to the other planet. HOWEVER. If push came to shove, we could genetically engineer humanity to be immune to any (or even all) viruses. It would be a monumental engineering task, but people have already started this task in animals, editing their genes to simply not use certain sequences that all viruses require, and instead replacing them with \u201csynonymous\u201d ones. So, we might all die, but if we had time, we might just be able to raise a new generation of children who would live. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember the 2012 End-of-the-world panic, when people actually believed that this could be it for the planet. Hoarding up supplies, spreading misinformation, preparing for doomsday were some of the many outright insane things that humanity resorted to. WHO has declared the COVID-19 a global pandemic, and has asserted the need for rigorous actions in 100+ affected countries. The concerns and gloom surrounding the pandemic are valid, but misinformation coupled with panic is travelling faster than a supersonic jet. Is there a silver lining though? Most people infected with the virus recover. The infection could be fatal in people of the older age group, with comorbidities or pre-existing health conditions. Every viral outbreak takes a course of 8-10 weeks before the peak dies down. China is already on its road to recovery. Moreover, researchers are working hard to develop medicines and vaccines to alleviate the setback. Vaccine trials are already underway for testing and it may take 6 more weeks until it is put to use for the general public.The environment is cleaner and the air is getting less toxic with the reduction of traffic and public gatherings amidst the lockdown. That is something to look forward to- and we must allow nature to have its break, especially in this era of rapid climate change.What can you do to help? It is important that you avoid or reschedule your travel plans, as you are not only doing yourself a favour by steering clear from potential risks, but you are also being an impactful helping hand in containing the virus. Although a younger person can survive the infection, it is important to make sure it is not passed on to vulnerable individuals who may not survive it.Practice hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene adequately. Avoid smoking, wash hands regularly and always wear a mask if you have a cough or are feeling sick. Be mindful of your surroundings, avoid shaking hands and keep one metre\u2019s distance from anybody who has cough, fever or breathing difficulty, but politely.Protect yourself and your near and dear ones first, and in case you suspect that you may have the infection, please make sure you postpone any social interactions and gatherings. Impose a self-quarantine for the safety of others, and contact the helpline number that has been set up for various states across the country (Central line for more information in India: +91-11-23978046).",

We will understand that if Lombardy and Veneto had been autonomous regions alone they would not have been able to deal with the emergency. We will understand how great the generosity of the other countries can be, that often our friend could be farther than those we believe to be close and that could be just what we had discriminated against until recently. We will understand that Brexit could have condemned the United Kingdom to face an unprecedented crisis with its own strength and that perhaps, in the not too distant future, it will be necessary to ask for help precisely to those of whom it took at all costs get rid of it. We will understand that a nation or region cannot do anything alone. We will understand that only through the cooperation of all political forces can important decisions be made and we will understand how much we must \u201cremain united\u201d in such difficult moments, beyond our ideals. We will discover that the mayors of different parties and with conflicting ideas will have to apply the same measures and that they will have to cooperate, that alone this battle cannot be won. A few days ago, when we learned of the \u201cexplosion\u201d of the virus in Italy, a baby girl named Giulia was born. The world in which Giulia was born, however, will be profoundly different from that of children born before her, because after this emergency that the world is called to face, nothing will be as before, because every trauma changes individual people in-depth and with them also the whole people. 4. Fear  The idea of \u200b\u200bfear will surely change. We will realize how much more fearful what we do not see instead of what we see can do. We will really realize what people feel free of freedom, those who run away, who do not have a destination, who do not know where to go and who would only like to find refuge. We will realize how much nonsense we are afraid of and how terrifying certain real problems can be. Now that we have tried it on our skin and we know what it means to not have a place to feel protected, our idea of \u200b\u200bfear will also change. 1 \u2026  Among the 10 things that will never return as before, there is another that we cannot know. It is something that moves within each of us, but above all, it is a different thing for each of us. It is something that will change our lives a little forever: that decision that we would never have had the courage to take, that kiss that we would never have given, that word that, before all this happened, we would not have been able to say For them, for us, please don\u2019t leave the house.

            "answer_text": "No. There is no end of the world. Matter continually changes and upgrades, never dying. The coronavirus, as well as other epidemics, natural disasters, and literally any form that appears negative toward us from nature, surfaces in order to ultimately bring us closer to nature. We might think that it is absurd, because how could a problem that kills and makes so many people sick bring us closer to nature?  Photo by \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udded Claudio Schwarz | @purzlbaum on Unsplash Nature is an interconnected and interdependent system that relates to all of its parts\u2014the still, vegetative, animate and human\u2014as a single whole. It does not relate to our physical bodies, but to what makes us human: our attitudes to each other. Letting our attitudes to each other remain egoistic and self-centered, focused only on benefiting ourselves at the expense of other people and nature, awakens a negative response from nature. Blows from nature come ultimately in order to wake us up to the need to change our egoistic attitude to an attitude that is balanced with nature. If we relate to nature\u2019s feedback\u2014seemingly negative phenomena as the coronavirus and myriad other blows that we endure\u2014as a complete interconnected and interdependent system wanting and trying to bring us into balance with itself, then our correct response would be to merge our attitudes to each other in order to match nature\u2019s integrality. In other words, our correct response to blows from nature, especially the coronavirus, is to seek how we can better relate to one another, in order to become more unified and reach balance with nature. Therefore, especially while we are under social distancing conditions brought upon us with the coronavirus, we would use these conditions ideally if we undertook a self-scrutiny, to reach the realization of how the coronavirus crisis came to us as a response to our imbalance with nature, and also to seek how we could use the time when we are isolated from each other in order to become more united and balanced with nature.

            "answer_text": "Question: Will humanity go extinct because of the coronavirus? Given the available evidence, and the current mutation of the disease, the answer is almost certainly \u201cNo\u201d. However: It\u2019s still quite dangerous for the elderly (of which there are more than ever as part of the world\u2019s population), those who have chronic illnesses, and people in areas where health care is difficult to obtain.Viruses mutate, meaning that this version of the coronavirus can easily change into another one.People in many areas seem to have forgotten that there is little that can be done to stop pandemics, especially if the general public doesn\u2019t take them seriously.People seem to be forgetting that the failure to get the problems with a lack of health care and health care costs under control, are actually going to make solving this problem more difficult than it needs to be,More people = More disease. The world\u2019s population is still climbing and even though COVID-19 doesn\u2019t seem to be the one which threatens extinction , doesn\u2019t mean that another one won\u2019t come along soon. The increase in population means that disease will spread farther, faster, than it did even a few decades ago.Soooo\u2026while COVID-19 doesn\u2019t seem to be the beginning of a zombie apocalypse, the people who aren\u2019t treating it seriously, aren\u2019t using critical thinking skills, and they may regret that. Hopefully they\u2019ll live to regret it. ",

Outbreaks of the bubonic plague were carried over much of known world through shipping routes and warfare over the centuries. At the time of the Black Death, a third or more of the European population is believed to have been wiped out. If you go back into prehistoric times, some scholars think evidence supports that homo sapiens only survived in a pocket of 10,000 or so on the coast of Africa after a massive volcanic eruption disrupted the climate. We've survived much worse. If you're coming from a Christian apocalyptic viewpoint, remember that Jesus Christ indicated that there would be a convergence and build up of warfare, natural disasters, famine, and pestilence before we reach the end times. The only things noteworthy about Co-vid 19 is that it is the widest spread of a string of novel viruses of the past few decades, is causing global economic disruptions, is threatening to plunge portions of the developing world into famine, and may spark fresh waves of migration of desperate people. However, people have thought they were surely entering the end times many times in the Christian Era. Regardless of whether one is expecting a religious apocalyptic event, what concerns me most about this virus is the thought of what would happen if the contagiousness of this virus were combined with the deadliness of Ebola in a future novel virus.

These proteases are required to \"chop\" up the long virus proteins that are generated when they hijack a cell's machinery to make copies of themselves.

Some 7 cryptocurrency developers possibly from Europe have developed this new ghoulish cryptocurrency known as the \u2018Coronacoin\u2019. This is how it works. The Number of coronacoin would be equal to world\u2019s current population (7.3 billion). Buyers of the currency will have to bet regarding the spread of the coronavirus. With every reported infected case,one token will be burned resulting in increased value of the currency. More deaths = more value. This news has resulted in criticism from some sections of the society,but according to one of the developers of the currency,Sunny kemp,this is no different than Pandemic bonds issued by the world bank. And to come to think of it,it isn\u2019t. The only difference is,that the people who have invested in pandemic bonds will start to lose if the disease starts spreading rapidly resulting in deaths. This will in turn result in their principal amount invested to be diverted to the countries suffering from the virus outbreak. While for the buyers of coronacoin,The number of deaths and infections is directly proportional to the profit they will make. If you are grossed out by this macabre thought of making money out of a deadly outbreak,I understand it and share the feeling. For those of you who do not share this feeling; the coronacoin is already being bought and sold in some of the online exchanges. To each his own,I suppose.

Later in the year, a Spanish Flu epidemic hits the planet and runs until your 20th birthday. 50 million people die from it in those two years. Yes, 50 million.

Between your 39th and 45th birthday, 75 million people perish in the war. At 50, the Korean War starts. 5 million perish. At 55 the Vietnam War begins and doesn\u2019t end for 20 years. 4 million people perish in that conflict. On your 62nd birthday, you have the Cuban Missile Crisis, a tipping point in the Cold War. Life on our planet, as we know it, should have ended. Great leaders prevented that from happening. When you turn 75, the Vietnam War finally ends. Not counting smaller wars, smaller pandemics (Like the 1957 Influenza Pandemic - 1.1 million died) and all the various famines and genocides, just the events above total more than 156 million dead.

From the data we can be reasonably confident that the virus does not kill much more that 1\u20132 percent of those who it infects. Please understand however that coronavirus is still massive threat to human life and can still kill (and is killing) a huge number of people. However this group of people will always be a minority. 1\u20132% of all people is still a huge number of people, and we should not dismiss the virus just because it is deadly to a low percentage.

However, it\u2019s important to note that Jesus said these signs were an indication that the end was not quite yet. He called them \u201cthe beginning of sorrows\u201d. In the Bible, the end of the world is broken down into two periods covering a total of seven years. The first three and a half years are referred to as the \u201cfalse peace\u201d, and the second three and a half years are called \u201cThe Great Tribulation\u201d. You can read about this period of time in Daniel (chapters 8, 9, and 12 in particular). That time of false peace will most likely be achieved through solving major global issues, such as climate change, world hunger, and quite likely the coronavirus pandemic. The antichrist (a global dictator who is ultimately controlled by Satan) will win the praise and trust of the entire world through his ability to solve these problems. So, is the coronavirus apocalyptic? No, in the sense that the virus itself will not become the apocalypse. But yes, in the sense that, through solving this problem, the antichrist will gain power, and he will use that power to create the worst period of human suffering in the history of the planet.

Of course we have had quite a few (ebola, swine flu, bird flu, SARS, MERS, etc.) and so this could take us into the next stage of Bible prophecy, which paint a much worse picture than covid-19 is likely to be. I started getting some idea about what is happening toward the end of October last year, and made a few videos. A couple of hours ago, I released an update, which includes excerpts from several of the others. It deals with climate change as well as the corona virus, with special emphasis on China.

            "answer_text": "Short answer: No Long answer: Let us start our discussion with a short overview of some deadly diseases in the past. Bubonic plague: killed almost 50 million people.Small pox: yearly death rate in 1800s was around 40,000.SARS and MERS: very similar to corona virus and killed thousands of peole.Dinchak pooja and om prakash: killed emotions and caused hearing aids in 1.2 billion Indians.When these disease were causing thousands of deaths every year then somebody at that time must have imagined the same thing as well that we are going to die but, humans survived to face other challenging diseases . Now the fatality rate in case of above mentioned diseases very very high and in case of Covid 19 it is not that high. So, yes we are going to survive and will either develop a vaccine against the virus or will find some other way to kill the disease. We just need to stay strong and follow all the prescribed practices. ",

The coronavirus is a rather bad virus. It appears to be killing 3% of those infected, but that number does not include those who are not reported as being infected but are. It kills mostly the elderly, probably around 10% of older people who are infected will die from the virus. That is rather awful. Will losing 10% of our senior citizens end civilization? It is truly sad (SAD!) that the Trump administration has been caught with its pants down here, but it is hardly unexpected. The ignoramus in chief prepares for nothing except his own PR. You all will have a golden opportunity to fix this in November. Please think before voting. Do not believe the Internet trolls and fake news (e.g. Faux News). Check out the facts. We are going downhill fast as a nation under this poser. Make America great by showing him the exit. The coronavirus will end civilization for those who die from it. The rest of us will muddle through as we always have. No thinking person should be asking this question sincerely to find out. Such a person will already know the answer. ",

The reason why this is so horrifying to many people is because it is an unknown. There is no treatment or vaccine for it. This is a new illness and with it comes all kinds of theories, ideas, and downright ignorances from many different people. I am looking at this as a setback. Not a life altering event. For some it might be, but I think for a majority of people, life will resume as usual. Yeah, a lot of people will get sick. But they\u2019ll get better and life will go on. ",

Thus far, the people that do have something to worry about are the immunocompromised \u2014 elders, young children, HIV+ people.

Anything that virulent is likely to make you really ill, so you're bedridden and not interacting with others and spreading the disease.

The really big epidemics in history swept through, killed lots of highly susceptible people, and usually vanished as quickly as they'd arrived. Plus, mankind has enough knowledge to create medicines and vaccines to treat or stop the illness. This is a relatively recent phenomenon in our history. And if a 100% fatal epidemic were sweeping the planet, you're guaranteed to have relatively self- sufficient islands in the South Pacific and pockets in rural areas of the major continents that would seal themselves off from the rest of the world. No contact with contaminated people = no epidemic. ",

So if escapes the quarantine and becomes endemic, it is likely to be about as dangerous as current flu epidemics - a regular winter disease that takes its toll of the weak, makes a few stronger people very uncomfortable for a while, but does not in the slightest endanger the race.

Our heart simply became calloused in caring others,the needy ,we justbecome totally selfish,No mercy to the plights of other people.What doyou think God thinks? So many wake up call for us?The earth is already too old.Same is the humankind.Why do you think COVID exists? When We grow plants ,We do everything to make it grow wellapply nutrients,nurture and apply pesticide when it is attacked by insects.That is what God is doing to us as human He provides and protects us.But somehow We became arrogant , we believe in our own capabilities that led to great discoveries and advancement of mankind.We became proudof all those accomplishments and forgotten to seek best wisdom what to do and guidance where to Go from the Almighty.Hence,perdition.Now thetime of Harvest is near.Feeling that overgrown weed surpasses the number of plants with good fruits,what do you think God will do?Its harvest time! CORONA VIRUS emerged so fast,with uncertain cure.Scientists scrambled to find cure.But for How long?The virus is spreadingfast.The prevention/containment is slow,the cure still to be tested. When the appropriate and prompt cure for this is still beyond man\u2019s comprehension,I may sadly say, CORONA VIRUS is one of the signs of Endtimes. sorry i am not proficient in English.just to share my belief.THANKS ",

The first reaction is the decimation of structure and societies, looting, crime, mental health and fear will lead to suicidal thoughts. The obvious next reaction is nuclear warfare as nation's blame each other and more unfounded conspiracy theories go viral. Then the cloud after a nuclear event will result in premature global warming and who is left will be wiped out. I have an answer to these possibility, I would like to share, but I feel if everyone tries this then the mission will not be successful and result in our extinction.

            "answer_text": "Because no one has immunity which pretty much means if you get exposed your body has to figure out what to do. Maybe you\u2019ll get sick, maybe you won\u2019t, but you won\u2019t \u201cbounce it\u201d out. Which means pretty much everyone around you will be sick. For people who are elderly or already sick with something else in particular, they may get complications. Normally, if you get pneumonia with your flu, you go to the hospital, they give you drugs, they put you on a ventilator if it\u2019s really bad, and then you recover, two months out of your life gone. Also because it\u2019s new, your immune system may over-react and you\u2019ll have an auto-immune attack on your lung tissues. But now, because so MANY people are going to get sick, there\u2019s going to be a lot less access to medicine. In some places, the healthcare system just won\u2019t be able to accept anyone. Any of the hospitals. People will just die of pneumonia. That\u2019s what happened in Wuhan, and is what is happening in Italy. People are trying to \u201cnot panic\u201d each other, but it\u2019s important to take this very seriously. If you come in contact with people the odds are you\u2019re going to catch the virus, and pass it along. You may not Italy is on Day 20. That means 20 days ago they had no known cases. That\u2019s how fast it explodes. ",

And from all that I have read on the NE Journal of Medicine and other websites at the moment the chances of the virus turning into a pandemic are extremely low. There are tons of precautions being taken by countries where the virus has spread so that it doesn't spread furthermore and there are also tons of precautions being taken by countries that the virus hasn\u2019t spread to so that it never does. On top of that medically speaking the coronavirus is VERY closely related to the common cold. The only main difference between the two is that the coronavirus can cause pneumonia a lot more quickly if left untreated. The only way that the virus will turn into a pandemic is if the people who are feeling ANY of the symptoms or if they feel even slightly unwell don'tcall the help-lines in their country (111 for the UK) and don't get tested. On top of all of that the only people who will really die from . the virus are people who already have weakened immune systems. So that means old people, young people or people who either recently recovered from sickness or are suffering from one already. ",

The premillennialist position, popular with Evangelicals, is only one of the possibilities. The Hal Lyndsey \u201cLate Great Plant Earth\u201d view is good for supporting climate change denial. If we were given dominion over the earth and we will soon be raptured then who cares. Stewardship, what\u2019s that? In fact the rapture concept itself isn\u2019t scriptural. It is a relatively recent American invention. Most of the rest of Christianity don\u2019t adhere to this belief. Post millennialists think it has already happened. The Revelation was an allegory about the Roman Empire. Amillenialists either think it is irrelevant or hold no opinion. The Black Plague, the Viking raids, Ghengis Khan\u2019s Mongol hordes, Spanish influenza, Hitler\u2019s holocaust, and the Cold War were not the end of times. Why should COVID 19 be a sign of the endtimes? ",

Indirectly, owing to its effect on the access of food to cities, an infection may wipe out a large portion of humanity, as infections had done previously (black death, smallpox, cholera, etc.). Only some people are susceptible to any given infection; only some people become exposed to an infection; only some people who become infected die. Chaos yes, extinction no. We may well annihilate ourselves and become extinct, but any infection would only be one factor in such an event. The real cause would be our own inability or unwillingness to adopt the changes in our behavior and conduct that would ensure our survival rather than push us toward extinction. So yes, some of us will die owing to the current outbreak of Covid-19, and some of us will continue to die every time a new infection occurs and is allowed to spread owing to the incompetence of, and lack of knowledge by governance. But what may well \u201cwipe out humanity\u201d will never be an infection, only that same incompetence of, lack of knowledge by, as well as selfishness and paranoia of governance. ",

The world could and will go on after the coronavirus epidemic, but I am sure everyone will be immensely saddened by the massive death toll, particularly among the elderly. Be comforted by the low mortality rate of the coronavirus in children and young people, who (even if they contract it) recover without any permanent or long-lasting effects. ",

            "answer_text": "As of 6 March 2020 more than 100,000 people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus disease globally. And many thousands of them have unfortunately died. In the last 24 hours alone there have been at least 1,200 new infections of this dread disease in Iran. If this virus keeps spreading as has been, it may soon exceed the devastating effect of the bubonic plague known as \"Black Death,\" which hit Europe in 1347 and was the most deadly disease outbreak in world history killing 1/3 of Europe's population. Unfortunately the world's leaders are ignorant of the cause and the solution for this devastating epidemic. But fortunately those who are enlightened in the science of Krishna consciousness understand these facts perfectly. We are therefore hoping and praying that the world's leaders will now hear and accept the guidance how to bring an end to this powerful, destructive epidemic. What is unknown to the world's population and its leaders is that such calamities are nothing more than the karmic reactions for sinful activities. In the Bhagavad-gita Lord Krishna informs us that by our surrendering to Him we will become liberated from the reactions of our previous sins. And Lord Caitanya, Who is Krishna Himself appearing in the form of His own devotee, has taught us that the way to surrender to Krishna in this age is the congregational chanting of the holy names of God. Thus to stop the spread of this coronavirus the entire global population should now participate regularly in chanting the holy names of God. Everyone may chant according to their own religion. But the names of God must be chanted regularly by everyone along with the giving up of sinful activities such as meat eating, intoxication, illicit sex, and gambling. If this is now introduced all over the world this coronavirus epidemic will be stopped, and we will enter into one of the greatest eras of peace, happiness, and prosperity that the world has ever known. Thus we are now begging all of the world's leaders to heed our advice and thus render the best possible service to all of their citizens by personally engaging in the congregational chanting of the holy names of God and encouraging all of their citizens to do the same. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare ",

Of those, between 2% and 5% (without treatment) would die. Most of those would be elderly and the seriously sick. The childbearing population will be either asymptomatic or recover quickly and free to keep procreating. At that point, the surviving population would have developed antibodies due to exposure.

It looks like the coronavirus pandemic will be the rough equivalent of a moderately bad influenza pandemic. Yes, there are differences between the flu and corona infection, but there appear to be even more similarities. Given the foregoing realities, why are we even asking (and many are asking) if civilization is doomed by this? Could it possibly have anything to do with people being scared shitless by relentless, hyperbolic media reports? The media are having an absolute field day with coronavirus, just as they do with large-scale natural disasters. Their clicks and eyeballs are rising off the scale, and they will continue to do everything they can to milk this cash cow for as long as possible. Certainly this epidemic is nothing to sneeze at, and reasonable precautions should be taken. But do we have to destroy ourselves in the bargain? ",

From the Christian perspective, however, there IS a determinative sign. And that is the point in time when the Gospel \u2014 the \u201cGood News\u201d that despite all appearances there is a Creator God who offers his love and forgiveness to each and every one of us who is willing to acknowledge their sins so as to be forgiven and commits to living God\u2019s values as enunciated by Jesus Christ \u2014 has been proclaimed to every nation on earth. On can make a fair argument that that has indeed happened. So one can further argue that the final \u201ctribulation\u201d has begun with Covid-19, preceded as it has been by the discrediting of virtually every human institution purporting to represent moral values, from the Boy Scouts, the Olympic Committee, the Tour de France, you name it, even the Church itself. Jesus has further described that this time of tribulation will be the occasion of suffering and death the like of which has never been experienced before in human history. Happily, Jesus said that these days will be shortened \u201cfor the sake of the elect\u201d \u2014 those who have accepted God\u2019s sovereign moral authority. But it looks like rough times ahead. \u201cPut us not to the Ultimate Test, and protect us from the Evil One\u201d seems like the best prayer under the circumstances. ",

Let\u2019s think worst case. There are about 350,000,000 people in the US. If 60% of the population gets this disease (not unreasonable), with 2% CFR, as many as 4 million people may die.

It arrived as a war ended, millions of refugees on the move and then soldiers coming home. Depending on the source, it either killed as many people as World War 1 or twice as many. (Do you count people with TB who died of the flu? Do they count any death of respiratory illness as the super flu?) Twenty million people died in World War 1, while 20\u201350 million died of the super-flu. Note that the world population was less than 2 billion at that time. Depending on the estimates you use, this super-flu killed 1\u20132.5% of the world population. And that is the WORST flu pandemic we have record of. No, it isn\u2019t the end of the world. It is a public health concern. ",

Because of SARS the Chinese wear masks if they are coughing or sneezing and use hand sanitizer. As the Chinese are keeping them for themselves, our corporations are to greedy to make them here, and we allowed critical infrastructure to to be moved to China we have to die.

But compare medicine and technology back then. When penicillin didn\u2019t even exist and a wound was considered death. Even though there was less people in the world back then, there was scarcity in most places of the world, an ongoing world war, governments cared more about covering the existence of the disease than to save the people, lack of medicine, and less protection from the disease. We\u2019re still here. You shouldn\u2019t be afraid if humanity will not survive the Coronavirus, because there\u2019s plenty of evidence that we have survived worse.

Another coronavirus is the common cold, and the reason we haven\u2019t cured the common cold is that the common cold mutates like crazy. The 1918 Spanish Flu came in two waves. The first was serious, then it mutated into an incredibly lethal virus. That said, the flu is not a coronavirus, and doesn\u2019t mutate like a coronavirus. This novel coronavirus is much likelier to mutate like the common cold, and just be an annual blech. Understand this: mutation is random, and we don\u2019t know what will happen, but so far so good. It doesn\u2019t seem to infect babies, so only geezers like myself are likely to die from the novel coronavirus. Or the common cold. Or the flu.

It has the potential to kill a lot of people, but the human race has survived global viruses before. We survived the Black Plague, we survived the Spanish flu. It killed somewhere between 25million and 100 million people. This was when the population was less. The death toll is so unsure, and high (50million is the best estimate) as global travel was massive at the time but records were not as accurate as today and many people died at home. These diseases are scary. They are scarier when China is involved as we tend to think it is worse than they are saying. But no it won\u2019t destroy the human race. May cause a lot of deaths though and we need to be sensible about it. ",

Everybody of us has a definite role to play in tackling the grim situation in terms of containing the spread of pandemic, which I believe, all are earnestly following the health and safety norms prescribed by the governmental authorities in this regard. Having said that, we need not be extremely pessimistic about the scenario confronted, though no doubt, we are undergoing through tough times at this juncture. If you turn over world history, humanity have had seen and overcame even greater calamities and pandemics in the past. Thus we need to be optimistic about the future, while maintaining patience in the present.

The 1918 bug possibly was a slight mutation from the 1890 Flu, which was pretty virulent as well. It is thought that the 1918 bug was so close genetically that the immune system went into overdrive and killed many who were affected by the 1890 strain. The result was possibly as many as 100 million dead between 1917 (when it possibly first appeared in France) and 1922 (when the last wave struck in Australia). The danger here is that if this one acts like the 1890 bug, the 2040 coronavirus could wipe out whole populations. Or not. There\u2019s no good way to know. ",

Wash your hands often. If you have to cough or sneeze, cover it with the crook of your arm instead of your hand; if you forget and use your hand anyway, just wash it right away with soap and water before touching anything else. The only thing different from the normal precautions is that if you have a fever, persistent cough, and difficulty breathing, call your doctor just in case, and follow their instructions. And if they ask you about any recent travel, be absolutely honest. ",

Babylon the great is the world empire of false religion. The Bible does not tell us on what premise this is done . The honest person who is a thinker realizes that military politician and medical costs are bankrupting governments around the world . The US is now 25 trillion deficit at this time And climbing at an alarming rate . Obviously satanic religion is behind wars . If you read revelation 18 that let you know that when the kings of the Earth close the religions they rob them for the riches . Also once Jehovah falls that He has warned people to His satisfaction then that's the Armageddon party . His website is translated in over 1000 languages.

While this is a giant number when discussing a virus this communicable, 90% will live. It is still dangerous, and 1% of the US population is about 3 million people. That is a really big number.

There is always a portion of the population with inherent immunity and those with immune systems strong enough to fight off the infection. In past epidemics, there have always been isolated populations that never came in contact with the pathogen. International travel has reduced the number of isolated populations, but they still exist.

If they are not preventing it with precaution then we all are done for. But I think we all can overcome this. Not many people are in danger right now in India. And the Indian govt. is thinking about curfew, which should help those who don\u2019t follow lockdown. Technology needs time. To make a vaccine it usually takes about 8 months to 2 years/3 years. It\u2019s racing against time now. So we have to give them as much time as possible to make a vaccine or anything we can fight with.

So if 100% humans i.e. 7.8 billion people are infected then 54% people i.e. 4.2 billion people will inherit the earth. Further it is least effective in hotter climate of Africa, so majority of people in Africa, South India and other such hot, hotter & hottest places the people will not even be affected by this virus. So no end of world. ",
