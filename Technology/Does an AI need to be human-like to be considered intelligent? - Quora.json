            "answer_text": "That's an excellent question, and it goes to the heart of the fact that we haven't truly defined what intelligence is yet. So far all definitions of intelligence have centred around problem solving and intelligent behaviour, but as you pointed out that carries a heavy bias towards human activities. Once we defined intelligence as being able to hold a conversation, presuming that a human could identify intelligence. Eliza proved that wrong, so we redefined it. One we believed that playing chess was a sign of intelligence, but once a machine could do play chess without intelligence we redefined that. After that we talked about inference engines\u2026 but they aren't really Inteligent. Knowledge bases, voice systems, image processing\u2026 we really don't have much of a clue. Then there's non-humans. Octopi have as much neural material in their legs as their heads\u2026 or bodies, I'm a little vague on cephalopod anatomy. Point is that if you watch one it is clear that their legs/arms often have their own ideas about what they should be up to, and there sometimes appear to be disagreements. How can we possibly even begin to understand how a creature like that thinks? However, we are building robots even now for specialised tasks, and those robots make decisions. They are not intelligent, but we are learning slowly how such devices will need to think. We will construct their desires and goals, and they will not be human. Their desire even to talk to us would likely be less than an octopuses desire to play monopoly. So I believe that the future of AI is that we will build intelligences that we will not be able to understand. Since we will be the architects of their consciousness, we will make them to be fulfilled by their roles. In the process will encounter profound now ethical and moral questions, and I have no idea what the answers will look like. ",

            "answer_text": "Some people think that by building artificial intelligence systems, the goal is to build a human-brain clone. They also think that by building such systems we could learn something new about human brain. Then they say that their solution somehow resemble human brain. But I don\u2019t understand how they can build something that resembles human brain since we don\u2019t know how human brain works. However, their decision is justified because if we look for a theory of intelligence; what it means to be intelligent and what behavior is intelligent, then the problem becomes a lot harder. It is safe to assume that human kind of intelligence is not the holy grail, since our brains have developed during evolution to solve very specific kind of problems. And there are probably many shortcuts that are designed solely for those problems. Humans are funny creatures since we can communicate each other and understand. But our understanding is limited only to human kind of subjective feeling about the world: if everyone sees the world through same kind of brains, it creates an illusion that how we see the world is absolute. However, our brains are adapted to certain kind of environment and uses hacks that just works \u2014 this is far from how the world really is. This question becomes important when we think intelligence: we cannot define intelligence by what we feel is intelligent. Instead, we should search for the truth, the truth that removes our subjective understanding of intelligence and allows us to find processes where intelligence emerges. I think this is the whole point of studying AI: find a generalized pieces of intelligence and ultimately combine them to a theory of intelligence. Or we can find that intelligence does not even exist and it is just a part of human illusion. ",
