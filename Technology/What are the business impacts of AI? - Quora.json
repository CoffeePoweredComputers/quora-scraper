            "answer_text": "Well AI is usually use in every field it is helpful in business too!! Businesses that use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technology to reveal new insights \u201cwill steal $1.2 trillion per annum from their less informed peers by 2020.\u201d predicts Forrester Research. Although AI has been around since the 1950s, it is only recently that the technology has begun to find real-world applications (such as Apple\u2019s Siri). The investment in AI by both tech giants as well as start-ups has increased 3 folds to $40 Billion as of 2017. Recent advances in AI have been helped by three factors: Access to big data generated from e-commerce, businesses, governments, science, wearables, and social mediaImprovement in machine learning (ML) algorithms\u2014due to the availability of large amounts of dataGreater computing power and the rise of cloud-based services\u2014which helps run sophisticated machine learning algorithms.Applications of AI AI is important because it can help solve immensely difficult issues in various industries, such as entertainment, education, health, commerce, transport, and utilities. AI applications can be grouped into five categories: Reasoning: The ability to solve problems through logical deduction. e.g. financial asset management, legal assessment, financial application processing, autonomous weapons systems, gamesKnowledge: The ability to present knowledge about the world. e.g. financial market trading, purchase prediction, fraud prevention, drug creation, medical diagnosis, media recommendationPlanning: The ability to set and achieve goals. e.g. inventory management, demand forecasting, predictive maintenance, physical and digital network optimization, navigation, scheduling, logisticsCommunication: The ability to understand spoken and written language. e.g. real-time translation of spoken and written languages, real-time transcription, intelligent assistants, voice controlPerception: The ability to infer things about the world via sounds, images, and other sensory inputs. e.g. medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, surveillanceHere is an infographic by Mckinseythat shows the extent to which AI can be used end-to-end in the retail industry from identifying customers to personalizing promotion to inventory management.

            "answer_text": "Artificial intelligence already impacts many aspects of our daily lives at work, at home and as we move about. Over the next decade, analyst firm Tractica predicts that annual Global AI enterprise software revenue will grow from $644 million in 2016 to nearly $39 billion by 2025. Services-related revenue should reach almost $150 billion. They report that there are 6 artificial intelligence segments which will account for a significant percentage of these revenues: 1. Machine learning 2. Natural Language Processing and Understanding 3. Computer vision 4. Machine reasoning 5. Strong AI 6. Deep learning These functional areas are applicable to many use cases, industries, and generate benefits to both businesses and individuals. Here are the top use cases which will reap financial rewards for AI technology product and service companies, and a broad spectrum of benefits for everyone else. Machine and vehicular object detection, identification and avoidance Self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicles are consistently called the \u201cnext revolution\u201d in transportation, technology and, some say, in civilization in general. Some predict that, along with the growth of the electric vehicle segment, it could bring an end (or the beginning of the end) to car ownership as we know it as soon as 2030. Just as with cloud and computing as a service, it will be interesting to see how consumers and businesses can get the transportation value of a vehicle without the maintenance, storage, upgrades and depreciation costs of vehicle ownership. Would they would be willing to either rent out their vehicle on a site like Turo, or rent someone else\u2019s car for a daily rate? Sharing economy leaders Lyft, Uber and new entrants can easily leverage autonomous cars to facilitate getting a vehicle from one car rental customer to another. Autonomous forklifts, drones and other robot warehouse workers are already retrieving boxes for shipment for thriving e-commerce companies. Vehicles are now equipped with sensors to calculate distance and routes to their destination and spatial room between vehicles, and to identify potential hazards like pedestrians, poor road conditions and other vehicles. AI-enabled machines and vehicles don\u2019t cause accidents while texting, they don\u2019t fall asleep at the wheel, and they don\u2019t need lunch breaks. A vehicle which can prioritize driving into the ditch or a tree instead of a person can save lives and reduce insurance costs. Advances in IoT, geospatial applications and artificial intelligence have aligned to make autonomous vehicles a reality. Autonomous vehicles like Olli aren\u2019t science fiction, they\u2019re reality. Visual recognition, classification and tagging In industries like law enforcement, media and entertainment, AI provides organizations with the ability to process large volumes of photographs and NSO images, and prepare them for discovery and reuse. Algorithmic financial trading strategy performance management Financial services data is fast-moving, is highly regulated and Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) data requires a high level of security. Unlike human traders that rely on intuition, AI-driven algorithms like Watson\u2019s Equbot can analyze a 10-year history of stocks and real estate holdings in fractions of seconds, as opposed to hours or days. Watson can help investors make data-driven decisions on when to buy, hold and sell equities. It can also help regulators identify rogue traders who are making fraudulent securities transactions. Watson Financial Services reduces the risk of misconduct, while addressing the multitude of regulatory requirements trading firms must adhere to on an ongoing basis. Localization and mapping It goes without saying that self-driving cars need up-to-the minute details on the roads and road conditions that it is driving on. It also needs to maintain Simultaneous Localization and Mapping so the autonomous vehicle doesn\u2019t \u201cSLAM\u201d into other cars and trucks on the roadway. AI helps to guide vehicles to their intended destination, relative to other vehicles, buildings and obstructions. For autonomous vehicles, robots, drones and cargo-carrying transportation governed by AI, geospatial applications can play a role in tracking trends in location-related business data. It could track the locations of customers that buy a certain manufacturer\u2019s product, or identifying regions with an ideal demographic for propensity to buy high-end electronics, for example. Companies can use this data to improve their marketing, customer service and product value. Predictive maintenance For manufacturers with high-value machinery, airlines with large fleets of planes or car rental chains with many vehicles, protecting the value of their assets is critical. AI can help these companies (and others) to keep track of when wearable parts were last replaced when servicing needs to be completed next, and how long equipment or vehicles are in service. Predictive maintenance reduces the frequency of equipment failures, as preventative action can be taken to refurbish or tune assets on a scheduled basis. Maintenance can take place relative to manufacturing or service requirements. For example, if certain equipment is required for a specific product run, it can be serviced outside of those parameters. Or, when a ship is scheduled to be in port for a specific time period, it can be serviced such that it won\u2019t impact service level agreements. AI can determine the possible outcome if maintenance doesn\u2019t occur, and make accurate determination when equipment or vehicles should be taken out of a service rotation based on failure patterns or age. Sensors can monitor asset performance and transmit the data back to a cognitive analytics hub through IoT. Prevention against cyber security threats Government organizations, commercial enterprises and freelance white hat security experts try valiantly to keep ahead of the latest spyware, botnets, DDoS attack patterns, and other threats in cyberspace. Yet hackers are constantly seeking new vulnerabilities to exploit and encryption defenses to topple. Cognitive Security systems scour the vast amounts of threat intelligence available on the internet, and help companies and public sector organizations to re-mediate their network and service perimeters before hackers can prey upon them. Human security analysts do their best to keep pace with the latest threats, but in many cases they are overwhelmed by Zero Day viruses and other emerging threats. Cognitive security is a way for companies to gain leverage through deep learning and strong AI. Converting paperwork into digital data Cognitive capture leverages AI and Machine Learning to expedite the process of \u201ctraining\u201d their systems to recognize key metadata (like employee numbers, invoice numbers, or loan numbers) and digitize records more effectively. It also liberates companies from scanning application and service vendor lock-ins. Cognitive capture leverages innovative cloud, machine learning, and open source architecture to convert unstructured data into powerful insights through analytics. It also helps companies meet regulatory requirements without the burden of storing paper records, and increases the speed and accuracy of information discovery. Instead of just extracting the text, images and signatures from documents, cognitive capture learns the context of documents. It can then trigger workflows accordingly, to either file documents away in a repository, or send it to a case management system, accounts receivable or other application for immediate attention. Intelligent recruitment and HR systems Traditional applicant tracking systems can be great at filtering out unqualified online job applications, yet they can sometimes eliminate qualified candidates in the process, should a resume not be optimized based on the right keyword phrases. AI makes finding the right candidate a more intelligent, data-driven process. By going beyond the basic words on a resume to determine job fit, it adds context based on reasoning and human inputs. AI also enhances traditional HR information systems by recommending career paths for certain employees and the best way to coach, motivate and engage employees based on their personality, mindset and other characteristics. Making better hires is a good start: however, retaining employees and ensuring they are mentored and challenged to do their best is part science, part art-form and part algorithm. These are some of the leading market sectors which are generating revenue for developers of AI software, and service providers in this space. There are other segments like public safety, customer service and more which are growing, and other use cases will continue to emerge. If you are looking for ways to create efficiencies, disrupt your industry and innovate by leveraging the power of cognitive computing and AI, discover the Watson products and services that best meet your business needs.
