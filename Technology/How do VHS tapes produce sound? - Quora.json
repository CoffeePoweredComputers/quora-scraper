            "answer_text": "Along one edge of the tape are two channels of audio much like a cassette tape uses (actually, it was initially only one track for mono). The frequency response ranges from poor to dreadful depending on the video recording speed, as this directly affects the speed of those audio tracks passing the playback audio head. If you've ever watched a VHS tape in motion, you realize that it doesn't move very fast. As time went on, the mono audio track split into two narrower stereo tracks to maintain compatibility with the earlier mono heads, and eventually Dolby type B noise reduction was added on higher end VHS recorders, but it was still effectively like a cassette recorder in fidelity. The narrow stereo tracks made the frequency response and noise problems worse, since there was less than half the original track width available for each of the stereo tracks (there was a little gap between them to reduce crosstalk), necessitating workarounds like Dolby until VHS HiFi could be successfully produced, which took a few years. Sony created Beta HiFi as a way to leapfrog this poor audio VHS quality (even at SP, the highest VHS speed, it sounded marginally \"adequate\"). Sony developed a way to embed audio as part of the video signal, where the spinning rotary heads assured a very high linear tape speed compared to the older edge tracks, and offered excellent frequency response and dynamic range as a result. Sony thought that VHS sales would suffer as a result, in this dawn of the \"home theatre\" era, when people were actually connecting good amps and speakers to listen to movies at home. Sony thought the differences in the way VHS was recorded would prohibit them from emulating the Beta HiFi recording method in VHS recorders, and it took a lot of time and money ultimately for the engineers at JVC to get a working VHS HiFi alternative. It involved some very advanced phase recording deeper in the actual magnetic tape to work, and the usual linear stereo tracks were preserved as a fallback for older machines (or when the VHS HiFi tracking failed, as often happened). This is closer to FM radio quality, and is effectively just as good at slower tape speeds, unlike the linear tracks.  Once again, the Beta system was a better engineering solution, but lost out in the marketplace thanks to JVC's liberal licensing policies to many manufacturers, and the inexpensive machines that this competition created. Sony had attempted to keep their Beta (and Beta HiFi) technology restricted to Sony, Sanyo and maybe a few Sharp machines and hoped they'd clean up with their quality difference, which initially kept the Beta machines quite a bit higher in price than VHS. In the end, quantity won out over video and audio quality, and VHS manufacturers proliferated and profited, even with the pricey new optical LaserDiscs and eventually DVDs as their competition in the late 70s to mid-80s. But that's another Quora. ",
