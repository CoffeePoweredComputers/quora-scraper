            "answer_text": "We have achieved light speed\u2026 Turn on a light switch. If the wiring is attached to an incandescent bulb, the filament will quickly heat up due to resistance and start emitting photons in the visible spectrum. Those photons will be traveling at the speed of light.  If the wiring is attached to a fluorescent bulb, the circuit will set a large potential voltage across an amount of gas within a tube. This will cause the electrons in the gas to move to higher orbits as they become excited. The electrons will naturally fall to lower states, and in doing so will emit photons. Those photons will be traveling at the speed of light.  If the wiring is attached to an LED bulb , the circuit will set an electrical potential across a p-n junction in a doped semiconductor. The extra electrons on the \u2019n\u2019 side of the junction are able to tunnel to the \u2018p\u2019 side of the junction where the \u2018holes\u2019 are. When the electrons populate the \u2018holes\u2019, they are falling to a lower valence state and emitting photons. Those photons will be traveling at the speed of light.  So we achieve the speed of light in many ways. Did you mean for objects with non-zero rest mass? ",

            "answer_text": "Tired of your pokey Lamborghini? Try a proton. Or better, something elementary, an electron, or cosmic. The local vacuum speed of light is c = 299,792,458 meters/second. The highest speed on earth may have been a 104.5 GeV electron flying around under Geneva traffic at 299,792,457.9964 m/s (99.999999999% of c). Cosmic radiation outperforms this by a dozen more nines. The champion, however, is the initial brew of 3,000 degree hydrogen/helium/lithium gas imaged 42 million light years away from us, 380,000 years after the big bang. Its speed just getting to that distance (42/.38) was 110c, or 33 billion m/s. It has slowed down with its 13.8 billion year age, however. Barely a billion m/s now. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends what you mean by \u201cacheiving lightspeed\u201d. For isntance, we are all travelling at lightspeed relative to the cosmological horizon. It\u2019s this \u201crelative to\u201d part that is most important here. Relative to the OMG particle, we have been going a fair lick. Of course, we are always stationary with respect to ourselves. Are you thinking perhaps of the fastest we\u2019ve been able to accelerate an object to? LEC accelerates electrons to 99.9999999988% lightspeed\u2026 which is pretty much the record. Do you mean that the object accelerated from rest has to be a manned vehicle? I think that record is held by the Apollo spacecraft \u2026 <checks> yep: at 11.08kmps or 0.004% lightspeed. Somewhere in there is the answer to your question: either \u201cexactly on\u201d, \u201creal close\u201d, or \u201cnowhere near\u201d depending on what you mean. ",

The inhabitant of Jupiter (I seem to forget their names) have us going at one speed, the people two galaxies over, have us going at some other speed. Speed isn\u2019t absolute. It depends entirely on the frame of reference (inertial frame).
