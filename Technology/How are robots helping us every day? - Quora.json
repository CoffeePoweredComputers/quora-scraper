            "answer_text": "Many benefits of robots seem to be most noticeable in productivity, safety, and in saving time and money. Productivity Robots produce more accurate and high quality work.Robots rarely make mistakes and are more precise than human workers.They can produce a greater quantity in a short amount of time.They can work at a constant speed with no breaks, days off, or holiday time.They can perform applications with more repeatability than humans. Safety Robots save workers from performing dangerous tasks.They can work in hazardous conditions, such as poor lighting, toxic chemicals, or tight spaces.They are capable of lifting heavy loads without injury or tiring.Robots increase worker safety by preventing accidents since humans are not performing risky jobs.Workcells provide safety features, separating the worker from harms way. Savings Robots save time by being able to produce a greater magnitude of productsThey also reduce the amount of wasted material used due to their accuracyRobots save companies money in the long run with quick ROIs (return on investment), fewer worker injuries (reducing or eliminating worker\u2019s comp), and with using less materials.

            "answer_text": "We wouldn\u2019t build them if they didn\u2019t help SOMEONE. The problem is that some robots (imagine a robot that assembles parts in a factory) can put people out of work: That helps the owner of the factory because it cuts costs and eliminates down-time due to holidays and sickness, etc.It makes the product cheaper - which helps consumers who buy those products.It very definitely doesn\u2019t help the person who\u2019s job was eliminated.The problem isn\u2019t with the robot - it\u2019s in the people and society in general who use them. It\u2019s like any tool - a knife is very useful for cutting up food and opening boxes - but in the hands of a murderer - it\u2019s a vicious weapon that can kill people. Robots are just tools - we can use them for good or ill - or (in the case above) both at the same time. The general definition of a \u201crobot\u201d is very fuzzy though - and it\u2019s hard to generalize because of that. ",
