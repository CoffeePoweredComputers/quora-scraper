            "answer_text": "Metadata such as date, time, and the recipient number can usually be found on the paper bills or online statements. Text message contents are not tracked, unless done so by a third party application, where a customer would have access. Verizon legal compliance may be able to retrieve limited time frames of text details but it's typically 3-5 calendar days retention time and would require a court order or subpoena. Information can be found on the Verizon Site under Law Enforcement Request Team or LERT. The other option would be retrieving them from the phone itself. ",
