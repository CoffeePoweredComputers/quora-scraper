            "answer_text": "PEGA As automation and efficiency are increasing one of the niche skills gaining traction in India and elsewhere is an ability to work with Pega.  PRPC or PEGA Rules Process Commander is not a language/compiler etc. Its Business Process Management tool. It is developed on Java and uses OOP and java concepts. And the big advantage is we don't have to have to build the system from the scratch like any conventional programming. It is also flexible and extensible. It is used as a work flow processing tool in which you build applications and deploy them as web services or just intranet. Pega platform has seen widespread adoption among several IT developmentintensive industries as it significantly cuts the time required for coding. This tool is used mostly in Finance/Banking/Health care industry where there is a need of streamlined process flow. The process flow may consist of human intervention steps(UI forms - Manual Tasks) or Straight through processing steps(WebServices, MQ, JAVA invocation etc). This tool provides ready made frame work which consists of a process monitoring application in which a user logs in and is able to see tasks that are assigned to him and can also see dashboards/reports and also many administrative tasks. There are also notifications/integration as well as SLA escalations built in the tool. This tool falls in niche category because of the licensing cost and also the expertise and certified developers needed to develop and design an application in PEGA. Big banks and Health care establishments use PEGA for their internal functioning. E.g. Credit Risk analysis of a particular financial entity by a bank. Maintaining life cycle of a Drug undergoing research and development. Pega has other products, but they seem to by and large be known for their technology allowing the creation of an automated business process management tool. Demand for Pega-certified developers is expected to see a 200% incremental  rise. ",

            "answer_text": "A clear explanation on Pega I found is here: \"Pega is a Business Process Management tool. It is developed on Java and uses OOP and java concepts. And the big advantage is we don't have to have to build the system from the scratch like any conventional programming. It is becoming popular because of that, though most conventional programmers would disagree. And also because of it is agile way, Flexibility,and being extensible. We design the Business Process Flow (E.g. Order management System, Call Center Management, Finance, Healthcare anything which has a Business flow) and decide the functionality we need to the Flow. Pega does the rest. But of course we need to think in java and Javascript, JSP in order to fulfill Client's Requirements. Having strong analytical skills, Understanding of Core OO approaches is a must in using this tool. And also there are lot of frameworks built on the Pega Process Commander in order to support various aspects of business requirements.\" Pega has other products, but they seem to by and large be known for their technology allowing the creation of an automated business process management tool. Honestly the purpose of the technology isn't something I want to be digging into for free... but you can watch lots of videos on the subject here: BPM Professor ",
