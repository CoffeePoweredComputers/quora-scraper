            "answer_text": "Fun88 is a company offering mobile casino games since 2017 and has gained tremendous popularity with its innovative features and user-friendly interface. Fun88 has a pretty tempting welcome package with a 28 pounds bonus. Once you\u2019ve registered yourself in the sportsbook and made a series of qualifying deposits and bets, the bonus will float into your gambling wallet. Fun88 has one of the better deals for a welcome offer than many others in the market and is an interesting proposition for players to take. Additional Sportsbook Features Even though a lightweight platform, some sportsbook features are exclusive to Fun88. It is a relatively new platform, and there hasn\u2019t been much research at this end as the site is still restricted to sports betting. The in-play console and the in-play cash out are features that Fun88 has for now, along with scope for improvement. How to Make a Deposit at Fun88? Fun88 is the only platform that allows you to deposit via credit/debit cards. There are also a few other methods by which you can make your deposit. As Fun88 is a new platform, it does not have a fully developed gambling wallet, a target to achieve. Customer Support Fun88 has achieved the trust of a lot of players who have praised them as a sincere bookmaker. Ripping off players and being dishonest about the monetary deals will create a bad image for the company. In that sense, Fun88 is quite reliable and provides efficient customer service to resolve any players' problems. There are various issues that online gamblers face regularly, and being able to contact the site via phone or mail is very important to build good customer relations. Other Details While Fun88 has some fantastic offers, Parimatch India often draws more gamblers due to the varied features and completely secure gambling experience. Naturally, as one of the largest and most respected online gambling sites, it enjoys a certain amount of goodwill. ",
