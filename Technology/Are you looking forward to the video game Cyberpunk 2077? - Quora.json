            "answer_text": "What do you look forward to in Cyberpunk 2077? EVERYTHING. First off, even though I\u2019m an absolute tool when it comes to all sorts of cyber fantasy, I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the likes of Shadowrun (yes, the tabletop and the computer RPGs) and the idea of a sci-fi world that\u2019s bleak yet neon lights gorgeous at the same time. Considering that unlike Shadowrun (which is basically futuristic D&D), Cyberpunk seems to be more like a tech-focused and social-focused RPG that\u2019s got lots of first person combat going on, makes my inner geek quite giddy with excitement. The ability to custom create your own character \u2014 especially appearance-wise \u2014 has always been one of the things that has me going for various games (including if not especially The Sims series). So to have a game that not only lets you customize yourself in so many ways (even to the point of upending current ideas on gender), but rewards you for dressing a certain way (as opposed to having you collect equipment that works everywhere all the time) kinda makes me wonder what my fashion statements and story would be in Cyberpunk. Then there\u2019s the activities. While I\u2019ve been decent with a sniper rifle in CS Beta 1.6, I\u2019ve been far more of a stealth combatant, favoring games like Thief, Dishonored, and Hitman over the more action-oriented run-and-gun games. So the fact that you can go full stealth, or possibly even a pacifist route, makes me very, VERY curious on how to go about it. (And yes, I am tempted to do at least two runs of this game with those play styles in mind.) Additionally, while I\u2019m not a vehicle afficionado, I\u2019ve always enjoyed the idea of utilizing different vehicles ala-Grand Theft Auto, which is why I look forward to how they play out. And finally, there\u2019s the environments and the idea that unlike most games where all buildings are basically painted elevations that you can\u2019t explore 80% of the time, you\u2019ve got fully fleshed out buildings with fully functional floors. And if my reaction to Genshin Impact (and the days I\u2019ve alloted just playing that one game, even if I\u2019m just exploring and grinding) is any indicator, this could easily be something that would suck away a lot of my free time, JUST from exploring. (Makes me wonder if architectural students and even working architects might want to play Cyberpunk just to study (and maybe criticize) the high rise interior and exterior designs found in the game.) So in short, as a Game Master/Dungeon Master, a role-player, a tinkerer, and maybe even an explorer, I\u2019m curious and intrigued. ",

            "answer_text": "At the moment I do have few features in mind. Since they are the creators of the Witcher 3 game, i\u2019m assuming we are going to have similar features like: 1)Upgradeable Weapons and Skill Players will probably have the option to kill AIs, do story mission get materials and upgrade weapons or skills. Weapons are likely to be more futuristic theme. 2)Characters Introduction I enjoy reading lores on characters every game I play. Especially The Witcher 3, it was nicely done. So if cyberpunk2077 gonna be a huge scale of a game, I hope they introduce the characters properly. Some developers don\u2019t really pay attention to lores that much. 3)Combat Mechanics Looking forward to see how they are moving forward with the combat mechanics. Probably something similar to Nier Automata where you could call for help from little drones. If we don\u2019t have little drones to help us out, at least have some advance AI navigator to navigate us throughout the free roaming. That\u2019s pretty much some features that I would love to see on cyberpunk2077. Nevertheless, I\u2019m looking forward to the game. ",

            "answer_text": "Exploration. Would like to see how much of Night City is actually explorable through interior level design. It\u2019s confirmed to be an integral part of the game, but a relatively specific percentage would be great for gauging. Games taking place in metropolitan settings have tons of backdrop, GTA games for example rely so much on backdrop city design that cities don\u2019t even feel like cities, rather just building cubes.According to the devs, the game wil take a new approach to dialogue and interaction, something they call the \u201cDirective Scene System\u201d, a first-person real time interaction system that no longer locks the player in a cutscene during narrative sequences, gives them more control and adapts to where the player is looking during dialogue, opening up new dialogue and interaction options based on it. Definitely looking to see how that\u2019s going to work out and how much of the interaction will it encompass. On that note, attributes like skill levels and origins are also confirmed to affect dialogue, so looking forward to see where they\u2019re going with that as well.Custom playstyles. The developers frequently mentioned their open-ended gameplay scheme where you aren\u2019t locked to a certain set of abilities and perks based on a class, instead you\u2019ll create your own playstyle by picking the abilities and perks and cyberware you see fit.Be cool to see how branching will this thing be, how much can we just go off in one direction without having to supplement with other skills that might not be particularly part of our playstyle from a role-playing point of view.",

They are obviously going in a very different direction with this game what with the first person perspective and science fiction setting but as long as they keep the best parts of the witcher, namely fantastic storytelling, detailed side quests and well written characters the setting and camera perspective shouldn't be a problem. I generally try to dampen my excitement for upcoming video games because i feel that its setting myself up for disappointment but I cant help it in this case. Every successive title CD Projekt Red has made has gotten progressively better. The Witcher 1 was mediocre, The Witcher 2 was really good and The Witcher 3 was fantastic and if the trend continues Cyberpunk will be unbelievable. ",

My girlfriend, not so much. She isn't a FPS fan, and so she isn't as excited as I am for Cyberpunk. She loved the combat in The Witcher, so I think if we can get some combat based around awesome skills and a bit of hand to hand instead of all guns, we'll both be playing this game for a very long time.

My bet is that it\u2019s going to be a cross-generation game. It will release for the PS4 and for the PS5. A game this anticipated would be a great way to show off how much better the PS5 version runs\u2026 thus pushing people into adopting the new hardware. ",

Am I look forward to the game's release? Absolutely. The latest game from the studio who created The Witcher games. The studio who have arguably taken over (if not actually ecliosed) from Bioware as the studio who create great narrative driven games. ",
