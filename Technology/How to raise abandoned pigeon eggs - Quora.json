            "answer_text": "If you found those eggs not in a nest, then just look around for an empty nest or a nest with similar eggs and carefully put them in it. If you do not see a nest, do not go looking for one, and never assume that an egg is abandoned. Birds make their nest under lots of harships and it is less likely they abandon their nests. Pigeon eggs take 17 to 19 days to hatch. The parents of the eggs take turns to keep it warm. From afternoon to midnight, female pigeon sits on the egg and other time male pigeon warms it. They do it because the temperature of the egg should be always around 100 degree Fahrenheit and also eggs need to be turned at least three times a day. To Incubate pigeon eggs you need to maintain this temperature in the nest and turn them half round three times a day for 17 to 19 days. 40 to 50 percent humidity must be maintained for the first 18 days; 65 to 75 percent humidity is needed for the final days before hatching.Or you can get an incubator that can help to hatch the eggs in above conditions.Even after that, there is a very less possibility of their hatching, as they may have very small crack that can damage the embryo in it. Luckily if they hatch, then for about 2 weeks you would have to feed the nestlings every 15 to 20 minutes day and night. Its better you wait for a whole day to see if any bird comes back to the eggs.
