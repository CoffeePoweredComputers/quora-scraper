            "answer_text": "Here is the exact pathophysiology of the coronavirus inside our lungs : 1- Well, as we know the coronavirus is transmitted by air droplets. Let's say someone sneezes in front of you and you inhale the viral particles that came out from his mouth. The viral will travel directly to your respiratory system infecting the lining epithelial cells of your bronchi, bronchiole, and, most important, alveoli. It enters the cells through a protein on its surface that binds on a receptor on our alveolar type 2 cells called ACE 2.  2- Inside the cell, the virus begins to utilize the cell machinery to synthesize its proteins using our cells. It literally transforms the cell into a viral protein factory. Hundreds and maybe thousands of viral proteins are synthesized and assembled, then they rupture and the new viral particles infect new cells and so on...  3- The ruptured cells, as they die, begin to release proteins called damage-associated molecular patterns and cytokines. They start to activate the macrophage (immune cell) that sits in the alveoli.  4- The activated macrophages begin to secrete inflammatory cytokines that start a state of acute inflammation inside the lung. To be specific, they release, IL1, 6, 8, TNF alpha, IFN gamma IL1, 6, TNF alpha migrate to the capillaries that line the alveoli. They start to increase the spaces between endothelial cells that line the capillary making to leakier. It also causes vasodilation  The fluid will begin to leak inside the interstitium and the alveoli. This makes it harder to breathe due to the accumulation of fluid. This makes it harder for oxygen to diffuse inside ---> hypoxemia --> shortness of breathAlso, carbon dioxide will accumulate inside ---> respiratory acidosis  Also, all these cytokines secreted by the macrophage will increase the expression of a very important molecule on the endothelial lining of blood vessels called VCAM. This protein acts like a magnet; it attracts neutrophils circulating in the blood and causes them to migrate to the site of injury (inside the alveoli)  5- Neutrophils migrate to the site of injury and are also activated by the previous cytokines secreted by the macrophage. They begin to secrete proteases and reactive oxygen species to damage the invading pathogen, but, unfortunately, they also damage the lung alveoli lining. So neutrophils are double-edged weapons. They kill the virus but it comes with a price which is the damage of the tissue itself as well. The will repeat the cycle above leading to more inflammation, damage, and fluid accumulation.  7- Result: damage of type 1 alveolar cells as a result of this whole inflammation. These cells are responsible for gas exchange; this will contribute to more hypoxemia. Also, type 2 alveolar cells are damaged; they are responsible for making the alveoli open. If these cells die ---> alveoli will collapse. This also contributes to more hypoxemia!   8- Additionally, the cytokines secreted by the macrophage will stimulate the formation of microthrombi. It is believed that they increase the pro-coagulant proteins activate and inhibit and anti-coagulant protein activity. This will result in an unbalance that leads to the formation of microthrombi inside the lung leading to pulmonary embolism. This will contribute to more hypoxemia and lung damage!  9- The damaged epithelial cells and surrounding normal cells sense inflammation and begin tosynthesize 2 very important substances called leukotrienes and prostaglandins. Leukotrienes will act on smooth muscles that line or bronchioles making them to constrict. This will make it harder for the air to move inside the alveoli to be exchanged!  Prostaglandins will contribute to the sensation of pain. They also will increase the vasodilation of blood capillaries leading to more fluid leakage, inflammatory cells migration, and, thus, inflammation. 10- All of these cytokines mentioned above can be secreted into the system circulation. They will have a very bad effect which is the activation of pro-coagulant substances and inhibition of anti-coagulant substances. This will lead to the formation of microthrombi in the whole body in most of the small blood vessels. This is known as Disseminated intravascular coagulation (a very bad complication)!   11- So as we see, it started with viral pneumonia --> progressed to Acute respiratory distress syndrome (the severe inflammation) ---> pulmonary embolism --> progress to multi-organ failure as a result of the DIC A very bad virus.

            "answer_text": "At one level they die of suffocation. Their lungs become so inflamed that they cannot get enough air into the rest of their body, and vital organs (ultimately their hearts) cease functioning. Breathing pure oxygen, or having oxygen forced down ones windpipe, can delay this. This situation is caused by the battle between the virus and the immune system. A virus invades a cell in your body and converts it into tens of hundreds if copies of itself and some biochemical garbage. The new viruses go on to do the same to other cells. Left unchecked the virus would reduce a victim's lungs to dead red goo. (Ebola, a completely different virus, kills by doing exactly that to blood vessels, whereupon the victim bleeds to death). Ones immune system fights back by destroying viruses and cells that appear to be incubating viruses. The trouble is that to start with it does not specifically recognise the virus, and is reacting to chemicals emitted by destroyed cells and attacking everything in their vicinity. Ultimately it can get to the point known as a cytokine storm, where the patient's own immune system is more likely to cause death in the next few hours, than the virus it is fighting. We have now found a few drugs that can damp down this immune over-response, but we still have to hope that the immune system can defeat the virus by learning to recognise the virus, before the virus destroys the victims lungs beyond any hope of recovery. What we want is a vaccine. A vaccine is administered before one is infected and trains ones immune system to recognise the virus specifically, rather than the local presence of some unknown destructive agent. Once it can do this, such virus particles are mopped up before an infection can take hold. One is immune to that virus. (A passing thought. Does anybody know if a cytokine storm might be an evolved response, to terminate an individual's life in order to protect his close relatives and others from a great risk of infection if he continues to breathe out virus-laden droplets? ) ",
