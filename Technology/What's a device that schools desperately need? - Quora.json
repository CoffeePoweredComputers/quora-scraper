            "answer_text": "To give a bit of background, I work in a software development group for the central IT organization at Purdue University. Our group, Studio by Purdue, builds applications that impact teaching & learning at our institution based on the needs and feedback of our faculty. Some things we've learned is that the needs of our instructional collaborators vary across the entire institution. Technology is strictly a tool, so it's hard to define a universal need for every scenario. At Purdue, we have so many different use cases across the entire institution that we have never mandated a universal device for our students for this exact reason. What works in one part of the institution doesn't work in others (ie. Android devices are in demand for development by our College of Science but iOS rules over in the College of Technology.). Things that I know are \"desperately\" need are the fundamentals. A device that has a web browser (doesn't matter what the device is) and consistent WiFi access. Everything else is just a bonus. I would encourage you to find a specific use case that your software is tailored for and hang your hat on the pedagogical side rather than the technical side. ",

Those are the reasons Chromebooks have been so popular and have passed tablets. While there options like Amplify, they haven't caught on because of the same issues. Tablets are great, but keyboards are essential and bluetooth keyboards don't work well in a crowded environment. Ironically a touch enabled netbook like hardware might be the answer.  But as I mentioned integrated learning software and easy management tools for managing the classroom for teachers and apps, content and device inventory for admins is integral for such a software to work. Having said that, multi platform compatibility is also important. So I am looking at an essentially an Android based system here. ",

            "answer_text": "Interactive smartboards. God, I miss them during my high school years! Our English teacher explained his lessons through an e-book, accompanied by a digital course, and they were both displayed on the smartboard.  The lessons were so much fun when the smartboard was used, and its functionality paid off: many students in my class got satisfactory results in our English final exam by the end of the year. Next, Raspberry Pi is an excellent choice when it comes to teaching young students programming. They are small, budget-friendly, and quite easy to use. Distributing them to a considerable number of schools can actually produce a good revenue, and aid children into developing their logical skills. ",

However, what needs to happen is how the hardware is implemented. Training for the educators on how to integrate and use technology to improve student outcomes is just as critical. Maybe not so much training for the students on how to use the device. They typically can figure that out. :)  Interesting software solution that can help educators understand  the gaps in achievement and apply analytics to student assessments: ignite by Xerox: Paper to Digital for Custom Instruction ",

Yes, surely there are many tools that facilitate and enhance the learning experience.  The pencil was one.  Chrome books, iPads, handheld response devices - the right answer to this question is \"whatever the teacher knows how to use best.\"  Good technology is transparent.  You utilize the function not the tech and get rid of the tech if it doesn't enhance learning, or facilitate an experience that won't happen otherwise. ",
