            "answer_text": "Hi Now I'll admit I don't know a lot about 5G. There will be other answers I expect. Here's what I'm thinking though\u2026 For almost all phone users, you won't notice the difference with 5G. What are you doing on your phone now that needs more bandwidth or lower latency? For most urban users 4G bandwidth is sufficient for viewing video on a mobile. It seems that augmented or virtual reality apps will benefit from lower latency, to allow real time response to user location and movement. But the AR /VR tech and user base is yet to mature. The need for 5G reminds me of the early days of 3G. This was a tech in need of a compelling application. From 2001 to 2005 that compelling application didn't exist. There were poor attempts at sport streaming of highlights, but overall most users didn't want to pay the premium for a patchy service. Then the iPhone came along, enough said. 4G was needed to provide even more bandwidth for all the smart phones in use. The tech was catching up with user demand. Even further back we could argue that 2G was needed because 1G was not keeping up with demand. Again tech catching up. Perhaps we'll see computing power for mobile applications shift to the cloud. So the connection between the remote processing and the local user will have to step up. That's speculation. 5G does more though that you may not notice as a mobile user: Wireless broadband to the home. No need for DSL or fibre. Gigabit speeds from neighbourhood boxes into homes. Autonomous vehicles. The need to locate and control thousands of vehicles continuously and immediately. Smart cities. Monitoring and controlling tens of thousands of sensors. Not necessarily large amounts of data from each individual end point, but the need to have vast numbers of devices online simultaneously. It'll be an interesting time and I hope the applications catch up to use the communication capability that will be around. For some other background have a read of the 5G paper from NZ telco Spark. https://www.sparknz.co.nz/content/dam/SparkNZ/pdf-documents/5G%20Briefing%20document.pdf ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately 4G isn't fast enough in all countries. My country has the slowest 4G LTE speeds in the world. India Found Again to have Slowest 4G LTE Speeds in the World. I've always faced lag and buffering issues on Indian 4G LTE while trying to live stream a channel. Whereas my internet friends in Canada, Netherlands and even Vietnam didn't face any issue streaming the same. I have become so irritated with Indian LTE speeds that the only reason strong enough to compell me to leave this nation is slow internet. I can manage rest all problems. Therefore, I am eagerly waiting for 5G technology to launch and 5G phones to come in the market. My hands are itching to buy a 5G powered smartphone. 5G is definitely gonna solve the lag and buffering problem while streaming anything live. 5G data will also be cheaper so I can use much more data than today. My average data usage LTE+Wifi crosses 100 GB per month usually. 5G would probably increase the data usage threefold. Moreover, it's said that 5G will bring Internet of Things where devices can interact with each other. 5G phones would help us communicate with other electronic devices directly and things would become easier. It's also said that 5G will help develop smart cities. Sounds good. But it seems that I won't be able to use it for the next four years. India aims to roll out 5G network by 2022: Report. ",

There is also a \u201cnarrowband\u201d section of 5G, with applications in digitized industry and things like e-health, critical infrastructure and autonomous driving. What counts here is high reliability, much more than speed. Also 5G provides answers to the ongoing densification of urban life, with many phones and devices in a small area. 5G NR (New Radio) provides massive increase of data density. And also energy efficiency is a big theme. ICT industry today already has a carbon footprint equivalent to the international aviation industry. With a 1000 time increase of data volumes current technology would lead straight into a disaster. So 5G puts a lot of focus on massive increase of energy efficiency (even lower transmission power than 4G and predecessors, higher spectrum efficiency, slicing and service chaining of networks to re-use idle components, support of cloud solutions, and and and).
