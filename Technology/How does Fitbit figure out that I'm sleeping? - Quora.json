            "answer_text": "Older fitbits, and most \u201cpocket\u201d models, you have to press a button. Then it looks for motion patterns to decide when you are asleep and how long it took from button press to sleeping. Modern devices just look for the motion patterns, perhaps supplemented with heart rate. And they simply start tracking your sleep from there. I don\u2019t have the math handy, but it turns out that when you sleep, your heart rate changes, and you lie still for a while, then move/adjust briefly, in highly predictable patterns. All sleep tracking fitness devices look for these patterns. Some even need to be tuned or they will report far too much or far too little sleep. This isn\u2019t unique to Fitbit, btw. All sleep tracking consumer devices do this. A few have used EKG readings in the past. A few have tried to use sound in the room. And CPAP devices either use a simple timer for when you turn them on/off or they track breathing patterns. But most use motion patterns, sometimes with heart rate monitoring data too. ",

            "answer_text": "The Fitbit Tracker doesn't really \"figure out\" that you're sleeping. When you're ready to sleep, you put it into an annotation mode by pressing and holding the button until you see \"Start.\" You put it on your non-dominant arm using the wrist band. In the morning, you press and hold the button again until you see \"Stop.\" This has recorded your sleep. The algorithm knows that annotations of a certain length, at a certain time of day, are likely to be sleep, and treats this data as such on your Dashboard on the website, presenting that data in the sleep section. You can use the same annotation mode to record any activity. So if you wanted to know how your walk to the bus stop or your latest jog affects your calorie burn rate differently than sitting at your desk, annotate it and then log that activity on the website.
