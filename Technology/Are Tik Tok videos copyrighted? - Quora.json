            "answer_text": "Under US law, yes. Anything and everything you create is yours, no questions asked. TikTok is allowed to use your videos for commercials and such because of their EULA, but aside from that, you own any videos you create. Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking: if my video goes viral, I\u2019m going to take down every person that copies me! Don\u2019t. There is nothing you\u2019d gain, aside from a reputation for being a crappy person. You wouldn\u2019t cash in on a bigger reputation because more people visit you directly, and you wouldn\u2019t earn more money for that reason (does TikTok even have ad revenue? Ah, whatever). Let the internet do its thing if you don\u2019t want to be branded the worlds biggest wet blanket. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it would be worth your while to read the TOS on TikTok. The TOS prohibit you from uploading any infringing material, and demand that you make available any other material you upload, offering a free license, in effect, for users to download your material. See the TOS for more details. TikTok itself is protected by the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision of OCILLA under DMCA (Digital Milleniun Copyrught Act). If they get an NOI (notice of inringement) on a video, they take it down to avoid liability. You can decide whether it\u2019s worth trying to restore and fight for it. JA - No legal advice is intended. ",
