            "answer_text": "If you count good solid engineering, much of which still stands today, as technology, then quite obviously no. You could include their development of concrete so far in advance of later technology that it was a very long time before its secrets were reproduced. They don\u2019t seem to have developed \u2018Greek fire\u2019 as a military weapon, which might have been possible, but the Byzantines did but not significantly. Explosives appeared in China some centuries after the fall of the Western Empire. If you consider literacy to be a technology, that was largely lost in the lands after the fall of the Western Roman Empire but was brought back from what remained in Ireland (which was never part of the Roman Empire) and fed into the monastic culture that largely channelled Roman culture through that period now (mistakenly) called The Dark Ages. Ireland also developed technology that originated in Roman times, building tidal mills which the Romans never did. Since literacy involved the use of material for writing, skills associated with that largely also came from Ireland, but certainly developed from Roman technology. Romans used steel, but probably used that they found elsewhere, but didn\u2019t make it themselves, though I could be corrected on that. Glassware they did make, and their quality of production was not repeated, I believe, until the Renaissance period. As for where the Romans held the world back, you can only review the post-Western-Roman-Empire progress made by the Arab people, inspired by Ancient Greek developments, in mathematics, science and medicine, after a huge gulf that the Romans failed to fill. The Romans were not a people to value intellectualism, despite their enthusiasm for public libraries, and that is an absence much to be regretted. However it can scarcely be denied that the solid (it not stolid and unimaginative) basis on which they built their culture was the springboard from which later cultures grew, and it would be wrong not to respect that.

Western civilization did not see a similar level of development for another thousand years. ",
