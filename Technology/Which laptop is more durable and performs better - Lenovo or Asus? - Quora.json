            "answer_text": "Having used a number of machines made by both companies, in a variety of form factors, I can say that neither makes \u2018better\u2019 laptops. As with most things, you get what you pay for. Both Lenovo and Asus sell budget machines, mid range machines, and high end machines. Both make machines designed and marketed for mainstream users, professionals, and gamers. So you can look at things like durability. Lenovo\u2019s budget machines are cheap, and die pretty quickly if mistreated. I\u2019ve bought one of these guys for $200, gave it to a friend, and within two years it was dead from motherboard failure due to a drop or two and some condensation damage. I\u2019ve also bought a $200 7-year-old ThinkPad T-series that is still working fine in the same user\u2019s hands. The difference is the budget laptop was designed for occasional use by someone at home, whereas the T-series is designed for professionals who travel and may have mishaps. When new, a Lenovo ThinkPad T-series is a very expensive machine. Used, you can get them pretty cheap but they\u2019re built to last. Same thing goes for ASUS. I\u2019ve bought, used, and/or given away cheapo ASUS laptops that had similar lifespan. Their more expensive machines, like the ZenBook series and Pro models, are a lot more durable and have better build quality. You don\u2019t get high build quality for nothing, you have to pay for it. One thing to note is that in general, Lenovo makes more business models. ASUS makes more enthusiast/gamer models. So if you lean towards one or the other, you will have more options accordingly. Both make plenty (too many, really) mainstream and mid range models. You could toss in Acer, Dell, and HP into this mix and the answer would be essentially unchanged. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is very broad,it\u2019s simply hard to compare because both companies have different lines of laptops, to list: Asus: VivobookZenbookFX seriesX seriesRepublic of GamersLenovo: IdeapadThinkpadLegionYogaIdeacentre (may not count because it is desktop)To answer this question properly, I\u2019m gonna compare their gaming series, business series (if applicable) and multimedia series Vivobook, vs ideapad 13\u201314 inches Asus and Lenovo are known for their robust laptops with premium quality that does not kill your wallet. But if we are to compare the four, I\u2019d go for the smaller Ideapad for home use, Zenbook for a premium use, Yoga for convenience and ease-of-use and Vivobook for outdoor use. Out of all, however Vivobook tends to be the most expensive, ideapads are the cheapest. Both are close to home when talking about specs, that is only on paper. But to technical support, Asus is much better. I had a lenovo phone with lenovo help pre-installed (basically a tech support and forum for all lenovo products) and all I ever see is complaints, complaints, complaints, yet there is no official response. Vivobook also has a more premium feel than most ideapads at the same price. Zenbook vs Yoga Why did I pick these two? Simple, because both have displays that can rotate 360 degrees. Zenbook flip comes to mind with Asus, and talking about price, Yoga is more expensive, but in turn is also the easiest to carry. Yoga has a not-so-large display that makes it easy to use outdoors, but oftentimes, it is gold to thieves, better be careful. Zenbook flip on the other hand may have inferior specs but is more secure for outdoor use. If you want premium, robust design then Yoga it is. If you want it simple and secure, get a Zenbook flip. Legion vs ROG and FX Legion is Lenovo\u2019s gaming laptop series, while ROG is from Asus, FX series is their budget ROG series that can cost around $600\u20131000 or sometimes lower. If you were to ask me, this is easy to answer, that is of course ROG. I mean come on, the thing is a beast and is the most commonly known gaming laptops today, and I see Legion as a \u201cpoor man\u2019s\u201d version. ROG lags less and has a custom-built UI. and like most razer keyboards, its keyboards are backlit. Legion however, has a more convenient trackpad placing. So if you wanted gaming, I\u2019d say go for ROG, but if you\u2019re short, go for FX X series vs Ideapad 15 inches This is the multimedia series of Asus and Lenovo. I currently am an 11th grade student that plans on getting either, I\u2019ve chosen ideapad 320 15 because it is cheaper (in some stores, the laptop is on par with the price with X540UP, the Asus equivalent). And you can get specs that most budget gaming laptops get, namely: Intel core i5 or i7 at 7th or 8th gen, Nvidia GT950 or MX150 graphics cards or AMD Radeon graphics card. When it comes to features, they are on par imo. Lenovo has a feature that helps you manage the battery, from charging to use, and even stopping the battery from charging when it reaches a certain percentage (e.g. 60%). X series, since I haven\u2019t got a hold of one, I\u2019m not entirely sure In conclusion: Asus has a more premium feel with better customer support, while Lenovo is more feature-packed with lower costs than its competitors. If you wanted a premium-looking laptop, Asus it is. If you wanted bang-for-buck, Lenovo. ",
