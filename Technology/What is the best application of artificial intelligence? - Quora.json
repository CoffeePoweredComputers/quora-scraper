            "answer_text": " As the last seats were taken, he stepped out unto the stage and gave the microphone a quick test. Far too many times the sound system had failed during campus events, much to everybody\u2019s embarrassment and disapproval. It was a smaller crowd, and it only took one cleared throat before it quieted. \u201cGood Afternoon. I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining me today. Especially the undergrad students in the back who are only here to fulfill an academic requirement posted by their professors.\u201d A polite guffaw swept through the crowd, and a few faces blushed and smiled. More than a few members of the audience were too busy copying word-for-word the contents of the first slide to get the joke. Allen took a deep breath in. It stopped the trembling a little bit. The auditorium smelled like a pool hall. Chalk. That\u2019s what it was. \u201cToday, I\u2019d like to present our project\u2019s findings. After a year of trials and experiments, our team\u2019s proud to present to you the world\u2019s very first inorganic, artificial brain: a nearly perfect electronic emulation of what makes the very essence of the man you see presently before you, down to the molecular level.\u201d The crowd maintained its silence as a rather large computer tower was wheeled in from stage left. A minute or two was spent fumbling with the power cords and connectors. Allen elected a nervous, but prepared, stalling via filling in the audience with general information. \u201cResting in a semi-dormant state, deep within this processor, lies a sentient consciousness. One that resembles myself in all ways but physical.\u201d The screen lit up with a program display. Lines of code ran at blindingly fast speed. A few drivers were run, and the sound of a test beep was emitted from the speakers. \u201cHi Allen!\u201d \u201cHi, me!\u201d the computer replied.  A collective rolled over the crowd. Allen couldn\u2019t help but smile a little sheepishly. \u201cEarlier this week, our team made the final scan. Just a few days ago, we completed the finishing interface touches. It was certainly no easy task, even with months of preparation done ahead of time on a gradual scale. Even so much as learning to scan and emulate the brain of a simple Argentine ant required the development of technology unlike that which the world has ever seen before. \u201cPerhaps the most difficult element to this procedure was outfitting our new team member here one the screen with the faculties needed to exist comfortably within its new format. After all, by default, it\u2019s highly unnatural for a biological mind to exist in a realm void of it\u2019s biological body.\u201d On rehearsed cue, the computers voice took the baton. \u201cUltimately, I was chosen for the scan based off of my psychological profile. My mind was considered the most resilient to the sudden shift in format, and the continued existence outside of a human body. Granted, even if I\u2019ve managed to adjust exceedingly well, I do miss the feeling of wiggling my toes.\u201d A wave of laughter fell over the crowd. Allen smiled: their expressions weren\u2019t merely from humor, but of delight and awe. So far, so good. \u201cWe believe that a demonstration of sustained intelligence on an electronic format, where every element of a person\u2019s neurons are emulated to perfection, displayed the irrefutable possibility of intelligence occupying formats beyond what we\u2019ve previously defined\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026That what we consider to be \u2018alive\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily require the composition of cells, a construction based entirely off of organic material, or a metabolism. That perhaps an entity that is indisputably \u201calive\u201d, such as myself, can exist outside of the definitions we\u2019ve held unto for so long\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026We believe that our findings have a number of additional applications and startling implications, that can provide fruitful results with additional research. From redefining the core philosophies of ethics, to medical analysis, to developments in neuroscience\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 It may even be the key that ultimately unlocks the possibility of fabricating entirely unique artificial intelligences. However, we don\u2019t want to be too hasty in our claims, considering that these advancements are only in their infancy. But we are incredibly optimistic, looking into the possibilities that this project provides.\u201d With that, Allen smiled, and a smiling face appeared on the screen. They spoke in perfect unison, as practiced. \u201cDo we have any questions?\u201d  Hands shot up. Allen sat back and let Allen pick hands from the crowd to answer, based off of the video feed provided to him by the camera mounted on the lectern. Most of it was what he was already expecting and had rehearsed before being split. What it felt like to be in the machine. The fear of death. The regret of this new version of himself not being able to return to the normal body. The possibility of determinism. Allen took over most of the conversation, though Allen occasionally interjected with clarifying information. Other colleagues made a remark here or there. After some of the questions started repeating themselves, both Allens declared the second portion of the demonstration: A Turing test. Randomly selected audience members would participate by holding conversations through a text-messaging system with one of either Allens, while the entirely of the conversation was displayed on the screen. To further enhance participation, audience members were encouraged to vote their opinions over their phones. When the event was finally finished, the team took to the stage and bowed. The applause was deafening, and further questions were loudly exclaimed, drowning each other out. Allen reassured them that further questions could be submitted to the team\u2019s site, and that he personally would have access to the page, giving audience members who weren\u2019t selected the opportunity to speak to the intelligence. This seemed to satisfy people enough, and after a second round of applause, Allen requested that he be put back into hibernation, and the team went their separate ways. As Allen managed to escape the lecture hall, a sense of doubt and worry overcame him. It had been bothering him, even on the nights before the final scan took place. From the copy\u2019s perspective, up until the moment of the event, he had been living his normal life. Now, it was residing permanently in its new home; distant from the world from before. He shook the thought from his head. He knew what he was getting into. He had prepared for it. He had told himself that, should he need to, he could die for this cause. And besides: ultimately, it was for the greater good. A benefit to mankind. Right?  The I.E.B. Chronicles Chapter List: by Trevor Farrell ",

            "answer_text": "I think it would have to be self driving cars. Perhaps something is more complex, and something is more artistic, but at the moment in time, self driving cars seem to be world changing, and the most powerful idea. Here is what is in the favor: Self driving cars will increase road safety significantly. We do not know the numbers yet, but if we succeed, probably we might be able to reduce the number of accidents by several orders of magnitude, and that will change the world.We might be able to save significant amount of energy because self driving cars may be able to drive the cars far better than a lot of people meaning a significant amount of saving on fuels, and energy.A lot of people who are not able to work or travel because of disabilities, will be able to transport themselves, thereby helping themselves to do several things for self sustenance. Besides this, there are several things possible, and depending on people\u2019s taste, they might like one or the other innovation better! Here are innovations to follow, that I had written about, and most of them need some or the other artificial intelligence. We would have over ground transport such as high speed trains, and Hyperloop. All this will help transfer humans, but that would not be enough. We would have sophisticated air transport for people, and goods. And we would have automatic delivery services with drones, and ground transport. A lot of our work will happen with virtual reality, and if that is not enough, mixed and augmented reality will come into picture. In mixed reality, you would be able to see things that are real and live, and superimpose them with things that are not. For example, in this image, you can see a woman being able to see the planet earth right in front of her and she can zoom in right there. We will have robots doing a lot of tasks at home and in the offices. Robots can be trained to do precise tasks, but in future it would be possible to train them to learn and adapt from ambiguous inputs. Robots will be able to cook food for you, and basically, all the kitchens will be equipped with them just like they are equipped with refrigerators and microwaves these days. To give you an inspiration, we would have robots cooking a multitude of dishes. Basically you name it and a robot will be able to cook it to the level of top chefs. They will even decorate those dishes. Notice those hearts?We hope that we would have reached Mars with the way the rocket science is progressing.  We would have artificial intelligence learn from 7 billion brains, and it would basically know everything. It would pull up answers, construct its own answers, and give you those answers in as many words as you like. You would be able to tell AI:Stay blessed and stay inspired! ",
