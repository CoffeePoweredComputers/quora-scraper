            "answer_text": "There are many symptoms, but not all symptoms apply to all learning disabilities so compiling a list isn't really helpful. People also have different degrees of symptoms. Also, people with Learning Disability often have enhanced cognitive skills in other areas. So, listing symptoms could be misconstrued as discriminatory. For example, I once had a professional trainer who had Down syndrome. This lady it later transpired, had an MA. So hope you can see the danger of generalising symptoms. Some people experience degrees of \u2018disabilities' without fulfilling the criteria for Learning Disabilities. Live & function the same as everyone else. In respect of Learning Disabilities, I will attempt to give both. People on the autistic spectrum, tend to prefer predictable regimes, sitting in the usual seat on a bus or train. So lots of changes & variety could be challenging. Someone else sitting in their usual seat. It is not uncommon for severely autistic people to stand as close as they can to their preferred seat rather than just sit somewhere else. The strengths of people on the autistic spectrum can be great attention to detail. Einstein (& other great scientists) working on a particularly aduous problem for as long as it took to solve it, sometimes days without sleep, food or rest. People on the autistic spectrum tend to be quite lively as children. People with Down syndrome (about 1 per 600) are generally very happy disposition. Tend to age faster & be shorter than average population. But can be very good at games & puzzles. People with Kleinfelter Syndrome (XXY) tend to have poor working memory. Physiologically inclined to be tall, larger, more likely to gain weight & have an aversion to sport, particularly agressive sports, smaller shoulders & more slender hips than average males. Being very sensitive can be both a strength & a weakness. Prone to being bullied. Don't tend to stand up for themselves. Often accused of day dreaming, if overloaded with lots of information or too much information, tend to switch off, which often appears to mirror a petty mal seizure. But are not usuly any more epileptic than general population. Kleinfelter syndrome often misdiagnosed as epileptic. Strengths can include being very sensitive people, clean tidy & persistent in household chores. Great negotiators. More than one \u2018Y' in the chromosome can manifest in higher levels of aggression. Often people who are XXY Kleinfelter; wrongly labelled because of the double \u2018Y' which is not only wrong but great injustice, as XXY people are generally very gentle. Tend to be infertile. Mosaic Kleinfelter similar to general population but may evidence working memory issues. People with Turner syndrome (female) tend to produce more facial hair growth. Hope this answer helps. Pax ",

            "answer_text": "Learning Disability is how a person receives and processes information. People with learning disabilities may have trouble with any.
