            "answer_text": "I would say that for certain jobs more likely than others. Take Uber for example, the drivers and their involvement with the company is essentially managed by Tech. Office managers in the more traditional sense are going to be harder to replace because they own relationships with people whether it is inside or outside the company. So unless the businesses become largely tech driven in the sense that human relationships are irrelevant, it will be difficult for tech to completely replace managers. Perhaps if society becomes more accustomed with tech ,which doesn\u2019t seems so far off, it would seem more possible and maybe people would even be more compelled to replace manager with tech ",

            "answer_text": "Are you talking about creative managers? Or about those people who normally do nothing and forward emails and other information here and there? Second kinds of manager should be replaced by technology. And immediately. We don\u2019t need them. But, the creative managers. We need more of them. I know it is very hard to manage any project and finish it successfully. The manager needs to manage; ExpectationTeam members including there hard core ego and conflicts.Changes and schedulesAnd worst unknown risks.And one more thing, not everyone can be manager as not everyone can be good teacher.

AI is great and I think that we should definitely use it to analyze data, to automate processes, and to do many other things\u2026 but not making decisions. Managers are often those who take care of teams in terms of transparency and a healthy atmosphere. ",
