            "answer_text": "The greatest loss of life from a disaster in the US could have been avoided with the technology available then. The hurricane of 1900 hit Galveston, Tx without warning and killed six thousand people but it needn\u2019t have. The US weather service had gotten warning of the hurricane from Havana but some racist there decided that brown people couldn\u2019t be trusted to report the weather accurately and quit passing on their warnings. Additionally, a local representative of the National Weather Svc, had told the people that a hurricane would never hit Galveston. His wife and child were lost in the tidal floding that swept across the barrier island, only a few feet above the Gulf of Mexico. Had the warning been passed on, six thousand people could have been saved by evacuating the island population inland. The island did rebuild and they jacked up all the remaining buldings and pumped sand from the floor of the Gulf under them and raised the island 18 feet with a palisade of logs standing on the Gulf side with huge rip rap rock fronting that. The island was saved from distruction by another hurricane a few years later before they were even through finishing the island defenses. Thousands more will die needlessly of natural disasters in the US because the government employees are forbidden to acknowledge climate change and let the public know that the areas that used to be in flood zones that were estimated at once in a hundred years could now be once every five or ten years as happened in Houston, Texas and in the Mississippi Valley. We need to redo all of our flood maps and re-calculate the risks. ",

            "answer_text": "The number one thing that could have saved lives in ancient times is knowledge of antisepsis. I read a collection of chapters on the Civil War, and one doctor said of the times: \u201cOur hands were socially clean, but not surgically clean.\u201d Imagine having served in a long war trying to save lives, and looking back on the myriad more you could have saved if you\u2019d only known.\u201d Close behind would be public sanitation: keeping drinking water clean, proper disposal of wasters, controlling rats and flies. Natural disasters avoided? Every plague in history. ",
