            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to use NFC on your device, if it not NFC enabled. NFC: Near Field Communication. How it works: It's a method of wireless data transfer that detects and then enables technology in close proximity to communicate without the need for an internet connection. It's easy, fast and works automatically. The tech involved is deceptively simple.Evolved from radio frequency identification (RFID) tech, an NFC chip operates as one part of a wireless link. Once it's activated by another chip, small amounts of data between the two devices can be transferred when held a few centimeters from each other. Hence, you need NFC chip on both the devices to enable data transfer. Have a great day! ",

            "answer_text": "As far as I know it is not possible . Because NFC is a very thin strip which has contact points in them . It means they need to connect with the phone using those contact points . Basically a non-NFC phone is not gonna offer you those contact points . So it's quite impossible to enable NFC in a non-NFC phone. Second of all . If we try to do that the OS should support it . I mean android do support NFC . But will a setting for NFC pop up by itself when you do that ? I don't think so . ",
