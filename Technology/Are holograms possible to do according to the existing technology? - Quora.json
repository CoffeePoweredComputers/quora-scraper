            "answer_text": " Assuming you mean the kind of display where Princess Leia implores Obe-Wan Kenobi to help her save the kingdom, I had high hopes when this technology was recently announced. The Spatial Projection Display (SPD) technology consists of a transparent plate in which are embedded tens of thousands of Fresnel lenses via a micro-impression process. Light guides are also micro-patterned through the plate, guiding the light from a single LED to the Fresnel lenses where light is refracted to produce a virtual image at a distance of the plate. The image source appears floating above the transparent panel which could, in some instances be invisibly integrated into the ceiling or into a floor slab.  While crude in this early implementation, the technique appeared to offer open ended potential for improvement. Sadly, the limitation is that each point of a three dimensional object in space must have an element of the image producing screen in the line of sight from the eye. To produce the vision of Princess Leia as simulated in the Star Wars movie, there would need to be an image source as large as the area behind Kenobi\u2019s view of Leia. Three dimensional visions in space with nothing backing them would not work with this technology. Realizing that this is a fundamental constraint on holographic presentations which rely exclusively on optics, the alternative approaches need a fog or mist on which the three D image can be projected. Summarizing: We have the technology but is is not very good and is limited by fundamentals to small close-up displays. PS-I have doubts concerning the picture showing a cube floating in air. It was likely Photoshopped. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes\u2026 and no. Let\u2019s talk about holograms. Real-world holograms are of two types: transmission and reflection. A transmission hologram is a piece of film, through which a diffused laser has to be shone. When this is done, it\u2019s possible to look \u201cthrough\u201d the film, as if it were a window, to see the hologram image. A reflection hologram uses reflected light: where a transmission hologram acts like a \u201cwindow\u201d, a reflection hologram is like a mirror, where you can see what was reflected before. In both cases, the images are three-dimensional: if you move, the perspective you see changes, just as if you were looking at the original object through a window or in a mirror. The kind of holograms you see in science fiction, where a projector creates a hologram standing in thin air, and people all around can see it, does not actually exist, and there is no known way to create such a hologram. So, we can make holograms, but they are not like the \u201cholograms\u201d you see in movies and on TV. Those are still purely in the realm of science fiction, and no one has any idea when they might be possible to create, or even if they are possible to create. ",
