            "answer_text": "#Books, no doubt! I am always amused at the fact that this world has turned so tiny with the evolution of the internet. You have so many things to do, watch, listen and read. Out of all, I really prefer downloading books. They are not only a great way of entertainment but also help you to diversify and extend your horizon on the intellectual level. You can have so many benefits besides the above mentioned. Some i find important are : Mental peace- This is a proven fact. When you read, you forget the world around you. You begin to imagine things that changes your current state and you feel relaxed and at peace.Broadened base: You will realise this after you take a break from your first cycle, you ll feel that you have acquired something. You will be using that knowledge at so many places unconsciously that you might have been amazed if it was voluntary.There is some change which is definite but differs from person to person.Friends: you will always be at ease. You can think of them whatever you like, tell them what you want to and they are never gonna complain. You read them and you feel they want to say something. There is some mysticity associated with this. Believe me or not\u263a!So go on and download as many books as you can. Decide your genre, though i suggest reading non-fiction, and ask google to get it for you. Happy reading \\U0001f609 ",
