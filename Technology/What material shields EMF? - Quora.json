Photons with low energy degree travel as waves while those with higher energy degrees are referred to as \u2018particles\u2019. These photons constitute the electromagnetic radiation which is emitted by lots of devices around us. As the energy level of the photons varies, so does the electromagnetic radiation emitted. High energy photons pose dangers on human lives, thus, the need for shielding materials. ",
