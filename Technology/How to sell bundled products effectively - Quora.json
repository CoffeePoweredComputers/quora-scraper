            "answer_text": "The most important thing about product bundling is that there has to be an incentive for the buyer and the seller to bundle the product in the first place. For the buyer, there has to be a greater purpose to the bundle, so the bundle should be selected based on certain themes or categories. A good example would be making a product bundle of a perfume and a shampoo. For the seller, the product bundle needs to fulfill a purpose as well as for example bundling low sales products with high sales products, clearing stock, and offering promotions, etc.. Further, it is important to consider the form of bundling as there are variations. The product bundle should satisfy the sales goals and business needs. Below I have summarized 5 types of bundling. Pure Bundling: Customers have the choice to purchase the entire bundle of products or nothing at all.Mixed Bundling: Customers are given the choice to either buy the entire pack of products or individual products from the pack.Leader Bundling: Customers can get a discount if they buy a leader item with a non-leader item.Joint Bundling: Two bundled products are offered to customers for the price of one.Mixed Leader Bundling: This is when customers get the option to buy the leader product without having to buy the non-leader products in the bundle.If the seller and the buyer have a purpose for bundling and the type of bundle is selected carefully, chances are high that this strategy will be effective.

            "answer_text": "Bundling products is a marketing tactic used by many ecommerce companies. The reason it works so well: it plays on the customer subconscious. When receiving multiple products for one price, a buyer subconsciously views this purchase as a \u201cdeal\u201d.  The good news for the ecommerce owner: increases average order valuemakes customer decision easierincreases customer loyaltyYou can read a more detailed explanation on why product bundling works here. However, just combining any products together is NOT a good strategy. If you\u2019re looking to try this for your own online store, I\u2019d recommend bundling complementary products or bestselling items.  The convenience of product bundling results in an enhanced customer experience. This means your customer is more likely to become more loyal to your brand because they\u2019ve had a stress-free online shopping experience.  Happy customers = more sales = more revenue. ",
