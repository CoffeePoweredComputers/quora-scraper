            "answer_text": "As one who played around a bit with a \u201cdavid\u2019s sling\u201d and a youth, I was never able to develop pinpoint accuracy, but I could deliver a 6\u20138 ounce stream pebble into a fairly small area at a range of 100\u2013150 yards with some real force. Even in armor, the blow could have been quite dangerous. If using smaller, shaped lead projectiles even more so.  Cast lead Roman sling projectiles. Roman sling bullets had the stopping power of a .44 Magnum I think that the decline in popularity of the sling was its need for spacing between slingers. A single slinger would need s space perhaps eight feet or more on a side. Archers or crossbow men could be formed up practically shoulder to shoulder in rows perhaps three feet apart. The individual archer could also manage more shots per minute. So\u2026. A \u201cbox\u201d 100 ft by 50 ft could contain perhaos fifty slingers and perhaps four or five times the number of archers and produce five or six times as many projectiles as the slingers in the same concentrated \u201cbox\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Basically no. Although in full plate armour you would probably have a better chance of surviving a hit from a staff sling. But I guarantee it would still put a hell of a dent in your day/helmet. But once you had powerful bows, with more chance of actually piercing armour, a sling would probably seem irrelevant to some extent. Mind you, not everyone had a great deal of armour. The sling, like the longbow was a weapon of the poor. And as armies became more professional/mercenary from the twelfth century onwards, you wouldn't bother employing someone so ill armed. ",

            "answer_text": "No. It\u2019s the nature of the weapon itself. It takes essentially a lifetime to become skillful with the sling. It\u2019s impossible to train a good slinger; they have to be recruited from where they live and learn the weapon from childhood on. Eventually, the culture of the sling declined and there were no longer slingers to be recruited into armies. ",
