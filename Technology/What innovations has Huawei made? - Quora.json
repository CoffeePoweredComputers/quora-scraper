            "answer_text": "Huawei is not an innovator. They did not create the first PC, they did not create the first GUI powered PC, they did not create the first tablet, they did not create the modern smartphone, they did not create WiFi, they did not create desktop publishing, they did not create Rendezvous/Bonjour (Apple did all the above and much more) so Huawei did not contribute to our moderne personal electronics industry. Huawei did not create Cell Phones, and it certainly did not create 5G. Huawei simply copies other companies, and the adds what we in the engineering call Parts Bin Engineering. Parts Bin Engineering is when a company simply looks at what is available in other company's parts bin, so Huawei simply goes to other manufacturers and picks out whatever new updates to existing technology they have on hand and shoehorns that into their products. That is not innovation, a child can literally look at the same parts catalog and pick out the latest parts, then call the engineering department to tell them what they have to shoehorn into their products. That is true of every variation of smartphone camera, from low to high megapixels; from one lens cameras to three lens cameras, these are all components that are made by other companies and smartphone manufacturers simply integrate them into the current model. Huawei is exactly this type of integrator, they did not innovate anytime at all, they simply have been picking off the latest trend from the Chinese factories that actually make the components that Huawei is taking credit for. Huawei did not invent cell phone technology, they did not invent smartphones, they did not invent 2G, 3G, 4G or 5G. Huawei simply started working on creating their 5G cell tower radio product a few years ahead of everyone else because the Chinese government gave them a huge amount of taxpayer funded subsidies so that Huawei could attempt to monopolize the 5G market. Huawei\u2019s patents in 5G are not inventions, 5G was invented by a consortium fro the West. Huawei is simply filing patents on every single software component that they can, to try and make it look like they are leading, and to prevent other companies from copying their techniques, but the truth is that 5G cell tech is a Western technology and Huawei is simply adhering to the standards set by the West. Also true is that Nokia, despite having started their 5G development years after Huawei started theirs, already has received 50% more patents than Huawei has received, so if you ount patents (you should\u2019t) then Nokia is the clear leader in 5G by a massive margin.

            "answer_text": "Some recent examples: \u201cSome of these figures could explain why Huawei is expected to become the largest smartphone manufacturer in the world by next year; last year it shipped over 200 million handsets placing it third behind Samsung and Apple. Fueled by its heavy spending on research, the company has had some innovations that other smartphone companies have copied. For example, the Huawei P20 Pro was the first phone to sport a triple camera setup (since surpassed by the five cameras on the back of the Nokia 9 PureView), and the Mate 20 Pro carried a Reverse Wireless Charging feature that allowed the phone to be used like a wireless charging pad. This is something Samsung copied for the new Galaxy S10 line (it's called PowerShare) and the 2019 Apple iPhone models (possibly the OLED units only) are expected to offer the same feature. And perhaps not as important as other smartphone features, when Huawei introduced gradient finishes for its P20 line last year, other manufacturers quickly offered their new models with the same look. \u201c This could be why Huawei has been more innovative than Apple \u201cHuawei\u2019s accumulative investment on R&D of 5G generate more innovation year by year. Huawei 5G RAN is driving fast 5G deployment through unique Innovation and technology breakthrough. Huawei UL&DL Decoupling Technology, improves 5G 3.5GHz coverage and capacity using existing LTE 1.8GHz sites. No new builds required. Huawei Massive MIMO (32TR/64TR) achieves the best performance and most compact size compared to competing units, supports LTE and 5G NR. Improving coverage and performance up to 10x over competing solutions thanks to the leading antenna array architecture, better algorithm and higher-performance in-house chipset. By late Jan, Huawei shipped 25K pcs 5G modules and 30+ 5G commercial contracts. \u201cSeveral benefits originate from this innovation \u2013 it demonstrates a good way of lowering the cost of 5G deployment and increasing capacity and coverage, especially with reuse of existing hardware, and existing along with new spectrum\u201d\u201d Huawei for Huawei 5G RAN Innovation - MWC Barcelona 2019 With time as Huawei gets more world exposure, Huawei\u2019s innovation will like Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm, be better recognized. Ask yourself a question, why is Huawei selling so well with smartphones and 5G? Probably innovation that Huawei creates in its products that make customers think they are getting a bigger bang for their buck has a lots to do with it. ",
