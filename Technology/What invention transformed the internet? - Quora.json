            "answer_text": "The World Wide Web. The client / server model of web pages, web servers, & web browsers was only invented in 1993, by CERN if I have it correct. The internet was already decades old by the time the WWW was invented. The invention of web browsing with a Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) revolutionized the internet. Before the WWW the internet consisted primarily of email, bulletin boards, relay chat, file transfer, various other miscellaneous applications, and consumer services like Prodigy and CompuServe. ",

There have been several others: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) ushered in a routing architecture that scaled. Nothing before that did.Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) changed the Internet architecture so that we had enough address space to get where we are today.The Domain Name System allowed us all to have a hostname system that scaled.IPv4 itself was a transformation from Network Control Protocol (NCP).",
