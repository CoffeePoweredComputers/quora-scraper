            "answer_text": "Nanotechnology is part of the science and technology of matter control at the atomic and molecular levels; means things that are about 100 nanometers in diameter. Nanotechnology includes the manufacturing of products using such small parts, such as electronic devices, catalysts, sensors, etc. Nanotechnology is used in developing countries to help treat illnesses and prevent health problems. The generic term for this type of nanotechnology is nanomedicine. In industry, applications can include building materials, nanomechanical nanowires, and military products, nanowires, certain layers of graphene, etc. It's hard to imagine how small nanotechnologies are. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter or 10 to 9 meters. Here are some illustrative examples: There are 25,400,000 nanometers in an inch The sheet of newsprint is approximately 100,000 nanometers thick. On a comparative scale, if a marble was a nanometer, then a meter would be the size of the Earth Everything on Earth is made up of atoms: the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the buildings and houses in which we live, and our own bodies. Nanotechnology has the enormous potential to transform people's lives for the better. We are starting to use light and inexpensive solar plastics, making solar energy widely available. Nanoparticles can clean up spills of toxic chemicals as well as air pollutants. ",

            "answer_text": "How it Started The ideas and concepts behind nanoscience and nanotechnology started with a talk entitled \u201cThere\u2019s Plenty of Room at the Bottom\u201d by physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) on December 29, 1959, long before the term nanotechnology was used. In his talk, Feynman described a process in which scientists would be able to manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules. Over a decade later, in his explorations of ultraprecision machining, Professor Norio Taniguchi coined the term nanotechnology. It wasn't until 1981, with the development of the scanning tunneling microscope that could \"see\" individual atoms, that modern nanotechnology more  ",
