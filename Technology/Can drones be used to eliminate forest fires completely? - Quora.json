            "answer_text": "The forestry service doesn't WANT to completely eliminate forest fires. Fires were determined to be a necessary part of the ecosystem for a forest. In fact, the longer a forest goes without a burn, the worse that burn will be when it happens. The accumulation of deadfall and the die-back of shubbery as the forest gets more dense makes burns into forest killers, rather than forest cleaners. But to answer the question directly. Yes. A complete fire surveillance network and immediate action can eliminate forest fires completely. Whether using drones to do this instead of manned aircraft is necessary or even cheaper remains to be seen. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it can be . There is a possibility that a Tanker version of the Global Hawk will be developed for Autonomous Aerial Refueling. Therefore , drones can also carry chemicals to put out forest fires.  With a slight tweak in the design of the drone they can be made to carry tanks , bambi buckets and a front mounted foam cannon . Initially they may carry around 1000 - 2000 gallons of the chemical which should be enough to put off small fires before they become large . ",
