            "answer_text": "The basic elements of a sales funnel are always going to be: traffic in > money out. Or, prospect in > customer out, with the middle bit being the process of transformation. This could be a super quick turnaround by attracting someone\u2019s attention on Facebook, getting them to click a link to your sales page, and then selling them your latest widget. Or it could be a multi-stage process that lasts years. Like for example, someone finding your website and downloading a free guide on how to make cheese. Then you emailing them over the space of a few weeks and months with various cheese making tips, tools, and courses to help increase their cheese skills and passions. Then in a year or two, when they\u2019re ready to become the big cheese, they can come onto one your exclusive cheese-maker weekend masterclasses for the low-low price of $5000 per head. Two very different approaches, but the tools and infrastructure is much the same. The tools you need are generally. 1. A platform to where you reach out to people and \u2018get traffic\u2019. (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Etc) These tools are as free or as expensive as you want them to be and can be used to generate organic interest in your products and services, or you can pay to play via ads. 2. A platform where people can find you (website/webpage). This is where the options become endless. But at a basic level, you need a CMS system like WordPress if you want to blog, and have a static website as a place to call home online. There are a ton of other options, but WordPress is free, you control it, and it offers you a lot of creative freedom thanks to plugins - which is why 35% (a third!) of all websites on the internet are powered by it! It can be a bit slow though, and you do have to pay for hosting, which is another tool people often forget about, and which depending on your hosting can also slow you down a lot. And that\u2019s a big problem because page-load speed is becoming more and more critical both to user experience and to how Google is ranking your content \u2014 especially on mobile. To put this in perspective. Google recently confirmed that 53% of people will exit your site and go somewhere else if it takes more than 2 seconds to load. This is mobile users, which make up the vast majority and the reason Google is now prioritising them and changing how they rank mobile pages. So there\u2019s another tool to consider - something that makes sure your mobile-specific pages load lightning fast. And as soon as you start looking at third-party \u201csales funnel builders\u201d you\u2019ll see a lot of people offering the same set of features. So look for a point of differentiation, and future proof your funnels by making sure they\u2019re a) FAST and b) they have a strong focus on mobile pages. At Convertri - The World's Fastest Funnel Builder, we\u2019ve been doing both of those things for the past few years, so we\u2019re well ahead of the game. Plus, you can integrate with WordPress and get the best of both worlds, if that\u2019s what you want. 3. A method of repeat communication (email marketing provider/auto-responder) It\u2019s not essential that you collect email addresses, but I\u2019ve never met a long-term marketing pro that doesn\u2019t prioritise building a list of happy customers. So you\u2019ll want to get set up with an email autoresponder service. There are plenty of good options, but very few great options. And tbh over time, you\u2019ll most likely use a few until you find something that suits your business as some are good for e-com, others for affiliate work, and others for automation junkies! Just make sure whatever you choose can integrate with the platform you are building your funnel pages on. (Convertri has direct one-click integrations with most popular email service providers, and so do most other established funnel builders, but it\u2019s definitely worth checking that before making the commitment to buy). 4. A way to receive money (payment processor). This is simple. You need to get paid, and people need to feel confident about entering their card details into your website. This is another HUGE reason to make sure your website never goes down and always loads lightning fast. Trust is everything at this point of the funnel. So Paypal, Shopify, Google Payments Apple Pay, Stripe\u2026 these are all established trusted brands, and you\u2019d be well advised to pick a few of these and make sure their logos are on your payment page. Most funnel builders will give you templates for a sales cart page, some like Convertri - The World's Fastest Funnel Builder will have a checkout page built in, in so you can just link up a service like PayPal, add the logo, and sell directly to your customer. That\u2019s ideal, as you don\u2019t want people being redirected to 3 different pages just to make a payment. No-one\u2019s got time for that. 5. A way to deliver the product or service (via email, download, in person/manually, on a website, or via fulfilment company) Depending on the product, you\u2019ll need to make sure you\u2019re new customer gets it. If you\u2019re in e-commerce, something like FBA or Oberlo might be able to automate delivery. If you\u2019re selling digital products, you might want people to go to a website to get their product. Or you might want to set up something like Amazon S3 to let them securely download their new toys. Some funnel builders also allow you to deliver the product via their system. That\u2019s super easy. (And yes, at convertri, we do that too ;) ) 6. A way to provide support (personal email address or phone, or a support desk). Again depending on what you\u2019re selling you could deliver this in person, on the phone, or via a support desk like Zendesk. Alternatively, a free option would be to create a facebook group/page and use that as your support channel, not ideal though, probably a bit too public. That\u2019s about it. In my opinion, the most significant outlay should be on the software you use to build your funnel pages. Everything else can be done for free, or for a very low price. And your funnel software/page builder shouldn\u2019t be expensive either, but it should be good, and it should be fast, and it should be reliable. Because if it\u2019s not good, you\u2019ll be disappointed and so will your prospects, because bad websites suck. And if it\u2019s it not reliable, you\u2019ll never have confidence something terrible won\u2019t happen overnight, and sleep is essential :) And if it\u2019s not FAST, you\u2019ll lose traffic before they\u2019ve even had a chance to open your sales funnel and see what you\u2019ve got, and that equates to a massive waste of your time and money. www.Convertri.com is an excellent solution. We\u2019re biased, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re wrong. I hope all that helps. Luke ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some of the most popular options when it comes to putting together both free and paid funnels[1]: Lead Pages-when it comes to building opt-in pages, LeadPages is one of the most powerful tools you have at your disposal. They've tracked and tested a variety of page styles to determine which ones convert best, and they make it easy for you to build similar pages for your marketing funnel. The reason people like LeadPages is because it has a drag and drop feature that makes building your opt-in pages a breeze. It does come with a fee of $25/month if you pay annually before investing, you'll want to be sure you can recoup your investment. I also recommend OptimizePress which is another landing page builder. With OptimizePress you pay a one time fee of $97 and it is yours for the year. No monthly payments. You do have to renew it annually but the renewal fee is only $34. OptimizePress has opt-in pages, webinar pages, thank you pages and is easy to work with just like Lead Pages. It's a choice that you have to make financially and which one works for you the best. Instabuilder-similar to LeadPages, but without the monthly investment. Instabuilder is a plugin for WordPress that allows you to create your own funnels. It includes several funnel templates and a drag-and-drop page builder that makes it easy to get just the look you want. AWeber- When it comes to an email marketing management system, I choose Aweber. It's probably the easiest email manager on the market today, Aweber is the choice for many small business owners, not only because it's simple to use, but because it's also economical. Starting at less than $20 per month for up to 500 subscribers, Aweber offers both autoresponders and broadcast emails, list automation, and segmenting, so you can send emails exactly when-and to whom-you want to add to your sales pipeline. Click Funnels- With a click of a button you can easily build and create different types of sales funnels, opt-in funnels, webinar funnels, membership sites and so much more. Click funnels integrates with your shopping cart, CRM and Email Autoresponder. Click Funnels has a 14 day free trial and after the trial you pay $97 monthly. PayPal-Is the simplest of all payment processors, PayPal allows you to take payments online for a very reasonable fee. You can also use it as a simple shopping cart for your website. Infusionsoft-Probably the top tool for any business model, Infusionsoft is an all-in-one solution for customer management, funnel setup, mailing list, and even membership sites. It's priced at the high end, but if you can (and will) use all its power, then Infusionsoft is well worth the investment. It's a hefty investment though, It's not for someone just starting their business. At $199 a month with a upfront fee of $999 you would use this tool for taking your business to the next level. You can see that you have a lot of options (and even more that I have not mentioned) when it comes to building out your sales funnels, but what are the must-have items? At the most basic level, you must have: A way to create web pages. A simple WordPress website will fill this need, with a little bit of work. LeadPages, Optimize Press, and Instabuilder are nice to have, but not essential, especially if you're just getting started. A way to capture email addresses. Aweber is definitely the top choice here, but others include MailChimp, Constant Contact, and iContact. Take your time and start out small. Build the sales funnel by using tools that don't cost a fortune. Once you have a few marketing funnels up and running, you will be able to see where they can use improvement, and how the tools available to you can help make your sales funnels convert better and work more efficiently. 6 Top Tools for Optimizing All Your Sales Funnels Footnotes[1] Join Funnel Fridays",

            "answer_text": "The tools that people are using for sales funnels will include a CRM and lead generation system. The lead generation will likely involve a few different tools within the sales stack.  You\u2019re definitely going to need a CRM. A CRM is where everything is going to be tracked. You\u2019ll be tracking full pipeline \u2013 where leads are up to in the sales cycle; where leads have come from, all correspondence and so forth. Choosing a good CRM for your needs is very important. There\u2019s a lot of options on the market, from super simple chrome extensions to complete all-guns-blazing platforms. I have experience of utilizing Zoho, Streak, Salesforce.com, and Pipedrive, but best to have a test of a few to see what works best. Take advantage of some of the free trials on offer, give yourself maybe a month with each system (if you need that long) and then report on all benefits and negatives. I utilize email finding tools as well as part of my lead generation strategy to find corporate email addresses. This is an emerging market with a brand yet to dominate as market leader. Understandably, finding corporate email addresses and being 100% accurate, 100% of the time, isn\u2019t 100% possible. Have a search around, perhaps check out G2 Crowd and have a test of all of the free trials. Just make sure your expectations are realistic. As well as email finding tools, check out some email automation tools which will allow you to send bulk emails, and automate all follow ups. Some tools are super simple, and some are bells and whistles. Depending on how advanced and technical you want your outbound lead generation to be, do loads and loads of research. It\u2019s going to take time, so set yourself a good timeframe that you\u2019ll be able to stick to. My team and I use a new productivity tool called Calendr. This system is saving my team and I a bunch of time when it comes to setting meetings and increased our demo calls by 300%! The Calendr tool is a meeting scheduler currently in private beta so you\u2019ll need to request access. We have embedded the calendar into our website and now our web visitors can book themselves directly into a demo meeting with our team. We also use our personalized Calendr link in our cold outbound emails that we send using the above tools which also let\u2019s our cold prospective customers to go right ahead and book themselves a demo, totally ending the back and forth email drama trying to arrange a call. If you have regular meetings, or are looking to get more meetings, then you\u2019ll know what a pain it is trying to book them in. Using a meeting scheduler like this will fix all of your problems.

            "answer_text": "If you need to take care of customers, a sales funnel tool can help you track your sales pipeline through a dashboard that's easy to use and easy to act on. Pipeline management isn't just about seeing what's happening, it's about being able to strategize based on that information. The right tool will make your next steps to increasing sales and enhancing CRM very evident. From a CRM standpoint, a sales funnel tool offers vital data, to-do lists, and the ability to track deals and communications related to that deal. This helps you centralize vital data for reporting, to-do list, and collaborative standpoints as well. If you\u2019ve been looking for marketing ideas and strategies you may have come across the term marketing funnel, or sales funnel. What exactly does that mean? Where is this funnel everyone speaks of and why are my people being thrown into it? A Marketing funnel is a way for you to track the journey your customers take from never hearing about your business before, to becoming a regular returning customer. By understanding where in the funnel, or where in the journey your customers are, you can decide what kind of marketing to send them. The marketing funnel is simply a visual representation of a sometimes difficult subject to visualize. Think of it as a map of your businesses marketing and sales processes, procedures and strategies. In order for you to achieve your marketing goals you need to set a route to get there. Understanding the concept of a marketing funnel and setting one up for your business is one of the first steps to increasing sales and brand equity. The reason why marketing funnels are so effective is because it makes you take a hard look at exactly how your business acquires and retains customers. What steps do consumers take before they become a paying customer? How do consumers first hear about your business and what are the ways you expect for them to react to the discovery? All marketing funnels are unique based on the type of business you are running and the kind of distribution model you employ. For instance, a services provider, like a landscaper, will have a different marketing strategy than a retailer that sells hard goods. No matter your industry, most marketing funnels are based off the same basic principals. Before you begin to break down your businesses marketing funnel, and in turn illustrate the journey your customers take, you need to identify who exactly your customers are. Once you know who your potential customers are, you can begin to create marketing to attract your ideal customer and convert them from potential customers to paying customers. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re one of the few businesses using a sales funnel to convert the leads who weren\u2019t ready for your pitch (If you haven\u2019t started a funnel yet, it\u2019s not too late to start). Don\u2019t celebrate just yet, though, because there\u2019s bad news. You\u2019re still losing sales. 8 in 10 leads never become sales for companies who don\u2019t offer a nurturing campaign, but those who do it well see an average sales increase of 50%.  If you\u2019re not seeing this significant level of revenue growth from your funnel, it may be time to make a more complex sales machine by using segmentation and personalization. The reason these funnels even exist is based on data that the average amount of time for buyers to actually purchase products is increasing. Sending content to potential customers help businesses stay at the top of the lead\u2019s mind until their ready to buy. For better or worse, the public in general have become increasingly aware of how much effort businesses put into maintaining relationships. The need for tailored content and a more personal approach is becoming more prevalent in the digital age. Marketing segmentation is the process of using the data that is known about your leads to deliver a set of custom responses for the purpose of educating and eventually converting them into customers. Whew. Basically it\u2019s delivering the right prompts to people in your funnel depending on their readiness to buy. Chances are Jane needs to be educated on your entire brand and products. She\u2019ll probably want just about any piece of content you have related to training, and will be an excellent candidate for your entry level paid products. If you send Samantha the same content you did Jane, you\u2019ll never convert her. Even though you may have an awesome course on boosting an existing dog training business. Although, a series of content dedicated to helping Samantha get more clients for her dog training business would warm her up to your products. How you segment your leads can go deeper than Alice\u2019s rabbit hole, but every new path you set up for a set of leads should be driven by, you guessed it, Good luck. ",

Sales funnels also help you make buyers keep spending more by continuously purchasing your services. Of course, that's the goal of any business. And that's why they get the help of tools. I've noticed that ClickFunnels is mentioned here multiple times. That's good. But while ClickFunnels is an adequate tool, it lacks some features that can boost your revenue from your sales funnels. That's why I recommend that you combine ClickFunnels with a tool like PayKickstart. PayKickstart is a reinvented payment and affiliate platform. It picks up where ClickFunnels lack. PayKickstart has a subscription management system for recurring billing options. It has advanced affiliate management options to track commissions, share promotional materials, and even tax management. PayKickstart has a mobile app and has optimized checkout experience for any business. One of the best features of PayKickstart is its Visual Point-n-Click Sales Funnel Builder. Using this feature, you can easily see the buying path of your customers depending on their type of purchase. Plus, it is really easy to use. To create a sales funnel in PayKickstart, you need to: Name your funnelChoose the specific campaignChoose the affiliates to apply it (if necessary)After which, the visual sales funnel editor will be launched:  With this visual editor, you can quickly create and modify your prospect's sales path. But what makes PayKickstart standout is its features that you can incorporate in your sales funnel that can increase your conversions. Features such as: 1-click Upsells Allows prospects to enter their payment information only once and then purchase upsells with one click. This feature works for credit card and PayPal purchases.Order bumps Gives customers a choice to add extra products or services on their initial checkout.So if you really want to increase your conversions, better try PayKickstart.

WordPress soon dominated and I built hundreds of websites on the WordPress platform. I build brochure sites, e-commerce sites, sales funnels and B2B websites. Now I build on Clickfunnels. It's one of the best sales funnel applications out there in my opinion. I've used HubSpot as well and that is an excellent tool for this as well but it's a lot more expensive. Clickfunnels simplifies the design process for creating all of the types of sales funnels. When it comes to intention based marketing this tool is designed to quickly get your ideas across and on to the page. Give it a try. They offer a free trial. I help people build sales funnels.

            "answer_text": "Sales funnels convert much higher than a product put on a single page, so it makes sense that you would want one to market your products or services. The problems are two-fold. First, unless you have the technical, design, and written sales skills you\u2019ll probably have to outsource the creation of your funnel to someone. This can be quite expensive, as much as $4000, for a professionally designed, stunning funnel. Second, the costs of websites that offer you unlimited, newbie-friendly funnels are also quite expensive. Some can cost (at the top end) as much as $300 per month. So if you don\u2019t have the knowledge or skills to build them yourself and don\u2019t have the money to either have one made or pay a high monthly fee, what should you do? I recommend a product that allows you to build unlimited funnels, in any niche, with no skills required and a super low one-time price. This product even has the products to put in your funnels that are already made and ready to go. You don\u2019t have to do anything except click the mouse a few times. No hosting fees, no paid traffic, and you build your email list as you\u2019re making money. Here\u2019s a video about it: DigiFunnel Lab PRO Review! The LAST Funnel Program You Will Ever Need ",

It\u2019s in beta development now and adding more capability throughout the year. What caught my eye is the entire product suite will integrate mail and pages and all the functions a good sales funnel needs, but all within the same platform. They\u2019re run by some world class marketers and technical geeks who know software. I jumped onboard the free lifetime offer they currently have running for some of their core modules, and am watching closely as they move ahead (exponentially so far.) When you register (for free) you become an affiliate as well, so your links to the product page could earn you some money. When they\u2019re done in the near future, they\u2019ll have the entire package for one very reasonable lifetime price (not a subscription). Seems like an awfully good combination. Anyway, that\u2019s the way I\u2019m headed for sales funnels. ",

Back then if you couldn't code then you would have to higher a funnel builder to create one for you. Nowadays all you need is a funnel builder software and you will be all set. Most of them come with pre-made funnel templates with are designed to convert well. The only problem is this softwares can be very expensive and you will have to pay monthly for using it. For instance Clickfunnels charges $97 per month for its use and BuilderAll charges $37 per month. There is only one funnel builder software that I recently heard of which only charges a once off fee of $67. It's called MaxFunnels. I wrote about it recently you can find the article here : Maxfunnels Review: About Amit Pareek's New Marketing Funnel ",

            "answer_text": "There are actually a lot of good Funnel Software packages available. It really does depend on three things: 1)Your Budget 2) Are you Good at Learning Software? 3) How Soon do you need your Sales Generating Traffic/Sales? Be careful - more Expensive May Not Mean It\u2019s Your Best Choice\u2026 So, for example I started out with Click Funnels. What i never expected was the Learning Curve that comes with such a capable Software Package. Literally I expected that my first Sales Funnel would be up and operating within a week. Imagine how frustrated I was when I finally got that first funnel working -3 weeks later. So do your research and choose carefully. Also know that their are options available that will not cost anywhere near $300 or even $29 a month. Think Hard about what you need your Sales Funnels to do\u2026 So you know your product and brand. You probably also have a good idea what kind of promotions you want to start with and likely a Goal for the growth you expect. That being said - how long before you actually use the full capability of a powerful funnel software package? What if You Have never Tried Using a Sales Funnel Software? This may be the case and I help people all the time in this situation. What if I don\u2019t like it? What if I make a mistake? Is there an Easier way to Build a Successful Sales Funnel? Most Software Packages do have a refund Policy so be sure to read that carefully before your Purchase. Know that if you are building a Sales Funnel that without experience it is fairly easy to make a mistake. Could be in a link or the email sequence for example. There are actually a lot of moving parts to Sales Funnels. Is there an Easier way? Your options for easier funnels come down to the smaller software companies and less capable funnels. But remember that you may not need that Big Complicated Funnel software at this time. And if your business grows enough to need it later you can always change over at that time. I do have an option with a company I work with all the time and highly recommend to my online customers just getting started with Sales Funnels. They have a free version of there Funnel Software and it is a great option to see exactly what you need. Think of it as a test drive - but in this case it is a Funnel Software and not a Car. Try out a Free trial of the Software before You Spend Too Much\u2026 Free trials really provide a lot of information about how Sales Funnels can help Your business as well as how they work with Your Personal marketing Style. The Free Virtual Office Link for the Software I described earlier is \u201cVIP Member - Affiliate Academics\u201d. Now just a disclaimer - please know that Affiliate Academics Software is a company that I do represent in my Marketing Company. You will have an option to purchase a larger more expensive packages later, but it is not required. I can tell you that I have used their Top Software package for a while now and it really has done a great job capturing leads and making Sales. Sales Funnels are almost a Requirement now\u2026. You obviously do not have to use a Sales Funnel. But, it in the last 5 years Funnels have proven to be the one Tool that helps smaller Web Sites capture more leads and make more sales. If you think that a Funnel Software is in your future please make an educated decision. That is why I like the free trial for my customers. Some will tell me that now they can build their own funnels while others still have me build them instead. Everyone is different and so are your online businesses. I hope that this information helps everyone out. When I first started I really needed a lot of advice. I had two people that helped me more times than I can count. I am just trying to pay that forward. If you need more information just let message me her on Quora. Also, please give a thumbs up and follow. I should have my Blog started right here on Quora soon.
