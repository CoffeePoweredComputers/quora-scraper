            "answer_text": "What is Bayana? Definition:Bayana is an Indian term used to indicate the token money that is usually given to the landlord in order to informally freeze the negotiations on a particular property. This is paid post the formalization of the initial terms and conditions. Bayana is a form of formal agreement written on a stamp paper with related conditions that are agreed upon by both the seller and the buyer. Process:The estimated time to pay the bayana is usually one week after the token money is offered. Token money, in this case, denotes the small amount paid to the home seller as an indication of serious intent to purchase the property from them. Several terms are noted on the agreement for the reference of both parties. Terms include the time frame for the property transfer and the payment of the residual amount, which is often between 10 to 30 days but can vary. The dynamics:The bayana amount is supposed to be one-fourth of the total price to be paid for the property. It\u2019s suggestive that longer the time frame to clear the remaining amount, the higher would be the bayana. This is the period when the seller applies for the No Demand Certificate (NDC). This certificate provided by the concerned housing authority in the midst of both the parties. The property is transferred instantaneously and the seller receives the bank draft. Demerit:In any case, the deal falls through after the payment of bayana due to some problems on the seller\u2019s end, it then becomes obligatory for the seller to pay double the amount of the bayana amount as penalty. This procedure is considered legal in India. However, if the buyer backs out, he loses the complete bayana amount. ",
