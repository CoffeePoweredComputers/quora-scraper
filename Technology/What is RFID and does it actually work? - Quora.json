            "answer_text": "RFID (radio frequency identification) is wireless communication technology that powers the Internet of Things (IoT). RFID tags are attached to or embedded into a physical object, providing a digital identity to the now-connected item. An unpowered RFID tag can provide information when scanned by a powered RFID reader, typically at distances between a few centimeters (high frequency) and a few meters (ultra high frequency), and without the necessity of a direct line of sight. The tags themselves are available as passive (meaning they must be powered by a separate device) or active (meaning they are powered and can transmit data). ",
