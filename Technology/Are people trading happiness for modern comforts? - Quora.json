            "answer_text": "In a way, yes. We don\u2019t know what true happiness is \u2014 we only know how our egoism defines happiness. At any given moment, we have desires that arise in us for food, sleep, family, wealth, respect, power, and knowledge to varying degrees, which are determined by nature and nurture. We chase whatever we think will personally fulfill us and make us happy, and for people in Western cultures, materialism \u2014 so-called modern comforts \u2014 tends to be something we chase. But, at the end of the day, most of us realize that chasing these temporary and fleeting desires doesn\u2019t lead to lasting happiness. It seems that as soon as we fulfill a desire, a new, stronger desire replaces the one we fulfilled. With this new desire, we seek fulfillment again. Once achieved, we are left with an even bigger desire after feeling empty again. We will eventually be pushed to discover that eternal happiness can be found by giving to and fulfilling others. Imagine if everyone was concerned about and cared for me \u2014 I\u2019d never have to think of myself and could devote all of my energy to giving to and fulfilling others. And, others wouldn\u2019t have to think of themselves as well. In this way, we have mutual relationships of care and concern between us, leading us all to live peaceful, happy, and healthy lives. ",
