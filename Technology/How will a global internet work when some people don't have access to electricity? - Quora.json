            "answer_text": "There are a few ways to get around this problem: Space-based solar power (SBSP) is the concept of collecting solar power in outer space and distributing it to Earth. Potential advantages of collecting solar energy in space include a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing atmosphere, and the possibility of placing a solar collector in an orbiting location where there is no night. A considerable fraction of incoming solar energy (55\u201360%) is lost on its way through the Earth's atmosphere by the effects of reflection and absorption. Space-based solar power systems convert sunlight to microwaves outside the atmosphere, avoiding these losses and the downtime due to the Earth's rotation, but at great cost due to the expense of launching material into orbit. (Wikipedia)In one of the original Robocop movies, a news report describes the effects of misalignment of such a satellite, and the concomitant wildfires.Wireless power transfer (WPT), wireless power transmission, wireless energy transmission (WET), or electromagnetic power transfer is the transmission of electrical energy without wires as a physical link. In a wireless power transmission system, a transmitter device, driven by electric power from a power source, generates a time-varying electromagnetic field, which transmits power across space to a receiver device, which extracts power from the field and supplies it to an electrical load. (Wikipedia)Postal power delivery: if all else fails, we can mail batteries to our friends who lack access to electricity. (Personal suggestion)These are a few means of delivering power without wires.

            "answer_text": "The same way it works today when some people don\u2019t have access to a reliable power grid. When I was in Ghana (West Africa) 15 years ago, many people had mobile phones, even in areas without grid power or landline telephones. They charged their phones however they could, including: Solar PowerGrid Power (when they went somewhere that had power, if it was working)Gasoline generators (including motor vehicles)Human powered generators (hand or bicycle cranked)Battery packs recharged by one of the aboveFor Internet Infrastructure, Solar Power with sufficient batteries is the easiest non-grid solution for small devices.
