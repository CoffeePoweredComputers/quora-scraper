            "answer_text": "The lead\u2013acid battery was invented in 1859 by French physicist Gaston Plante and is the oldest type of rechargeable battery. Despite having a very low energy-to-weight ratio and a low energy-to-volume ratio, its ability to supply high surge currents means that the cells have a relatively large power-to-weight ratio. The lead acid battery is the most used battery in the world. The lead acid battery uses lead as the anode and lead dioxide as the cathode, with an acid electrolyte.  The following half-cell reactions take place inside the cell during discharge: At the anode: Pb + HSO4\u2013 \u2192 PbSO4 + H+ + 2e\u2013 At the cathode: PbO2 + 3H+ + HSO4\u2013 + 2e\u2013 \u2192 PbSO4 + 2H2O Overall: Pb + PbO2 +2H2SO4 \u2192 2PbSO4 + 2H2O Source:Wikipedia , Google Images .
