            "answer_text": "If it happens, it will probably be synched to the announcement of a phase one trade agreement. As the article states 260 license applications are in the system so there is no lack of demand by American business to keep from losing their share in the Chinese market. Trump created this crisis so he could use it as a bargaining chip against China. What he gives by allowing the US companies to continue what they had been doing before is not necessarily that big of a deal because the bans have forced China to accelerate their MIC 2025 initiative to become more self sufficient in the technology sector. The example to follow is Huawei. Their 5G base station currently uses no American parts, though it the past they did. If the ban is stopped and licenses are granted, the question becomes what will Huawei do? Will they switch back to American parts or will that be less now than before? Bottom line, Trump has made Chinese tech companies to realize their vulnerability currently and the future as the US uses sales of US parts as weapons against China. My opinion: The Chinese won\u2019t stop their efforts to be independent of the US. It remains to be seen how much market share the US loses and will lose in the future because of Trump\u2019s actions. Instead of winning trade by agreeing 18 months ago to what phase one really is, he may have sacrificed the future of the American market share in China to others and to Chinese competitors. And, it is not only tech, but autos and agriculture are also in the equation. You see Tesla, Boeing, and Exxon Mobile putting in new plants to avoid the tariff war, opposite of what Trump intended. Almost nobody has pulled their Chinese operation back to the US except some small machining operations that I have noticed. ",

No America has lied, exaggerated and tried to extort Huawei, on more than one occasion America said it would lift bans on Huawei if China agreed to Donald's outrageous trade deal! Now if a company is such a terrible national security risk why would you contemplate removing restrictions? Nope, America through Donald have shown themselves to be dishonest in their claims and conviction, if they backed down on their false and exaggerated claims, then they'd be a verified laughing stock! The lie is too big and out of control, it's dragged all of America down. ",
