            "answer_text": "There are three main ways to get bitcoin: 1) buying bitcoin, 2) earning bitcoin, and 3) mining bitcoin. I\u2019m going to do a comparison of each of these so you can decide which one is best for you. Buy bitcoin  Buying bitcoin is arguably the most well-known way to acquire bitcoin, and among the quickest to get started. You can either buy bitcoin in-person using a website like LocalBitcoins.com, or you can sign up for a website such as Coinbase which makes it easy to link your bank account or credit/debit card to purchase bitcoin. Even companies such as Square are experimenting with adding the ability to buy bitcoin from within their app. Depending on where you live, there is likely a local cryptocurrency exchange you can sign up for which will allow you to exchange your local government currency for cryptocurrency. The verdict: Overall, this is a great way to acquire bitcoin if you are willing to spend money. While in some cases account verification and approval can take a while, once you\u2019re verified and have linked your bank account, purchasing bitcoin is quick. On the downside, you actually have to invest money to acquire the bitcoin, and governments may make it hard for you to purchase bitcoin as seen in Hawaii, China, and other regions where regulation of bitcoin has taken hold. Earn bitcoinEarning bitcoin is an attractive alternative to buying it because you don\u2019t have to spend your money to acquire bitcoin. Instead, you can earn it for your time. One of the easy ways to earn bitcoin is to join Earn.com, which lets you earn cryptocurrency by replying to emails and completing simple tasks like surveys. You\u2019re eligible to earn bitcoin simply for signing up and verifying your account, which makes this one of the easiest ways to get bitcoin. Further, you don\u2019t have to spend a single dime acquiring bitcoin. Earn bitcoin on your phone, in any country, with no need for a bank account.  There are also online marketplaces such as Ethlance, and subreddits such as /r/Jobs4Crypto and /r/Jobs4Bitcoins which connect you to people willing to hire gig workers for tasks or projects in exchange for bitcoin. A full list of ways to earn bitcoin is available here in a previous answer I wrote on Quora. Finally, you can earn bitcoin by accepting tips. You can create a wallet and print out the QR code associated with that wallet\u2019s address. Some people, such as the \u2018bitcoin sign guy\u2019 have done this with major success (he netted more than 6 bitcoin from this stunt!)  The verdict: Earning bitcoin is arguably the easiest way to to get bitcoin. It requires little if any technical knowledge, does not require you to shell out money to purchase the bitcoin, and has no geographic limits. For those with little money looking to get started building a cryptocurrency portfolio, as well as people not willing to take the risk of buying bitcoin, this is an attractive option. Services like Earn.com let you passively earn bitcoin by replying to emails or answering surveys, which is one of the easiest and most cost-efficient ways to get started building a cryptocurrency portfolio since you don\u2019t have to invest your own money to start earning bitcoin. Earning bitcoin lets you participate in the cryptocurrency revolution without risking cash to do so. Mine bitcoin \u2018Mining\u2019 is the process by which transactions on the bitcoin network are verified for their authenticity. The \u2018verifiers\u2019 are bitcoin miners. To describe how this process works without getting overly technical: bitcoin miners buy powerful hardware such as GPUs (short for graphical processing units, also known as video cards) or ASIC miners which independently perform computationally intensive operations to validate that transactions made on the Bitcoin network are legitimate. You can think of a bitcoin miner similar to a gold miner back in the California gold rush of the 1800s. Whereas their tools were gold pans, bitcoin miners tools are GPUs and ASIC miners. You can think of bitcoin mining as a business, where: Your initial startup expenses are: buy GPUs or ASICsYour ongoing expenses are electricityYour depreciation cost is the delta between the ever-increasing bitcoin mining difficulty and the constant output of your GPUs (for example, if your mining setup generates 1GH/S bitcoin but after a year the mining difficulty has increased by 10%, your mining operation earns you bitcoin at a less efficient rate than when you first startedJust like any business has a break-even path for reaching profitability, miners think about this in the same way. If you spend $5,000 purchasing GPUs to mine bitcoin, spend $500 per month on the electricity to power them, and earn $750 per month, how long will it take to break-even? Bitcoin mining difficulty has increased exponentially for the past several years:  And there\u2019s a lot of big money invested in bitcoin mining. Plus, in certain regions of the world, electricity is either much cheaper or subsidized by governments. Here\u2019s an example of what a full scale bitcoin mining operation looks like:  It has become increasingly difficult for small time miners (for example, hobbyists who only have one or two GPUs) to make a profit mining bitcoin. As a result, miners who acquire GPUs or ASICs tend to be very strategic about how they allocate their hashing power. Sites like WhatToMine let people optimize for the most profitable coins to mine based on block rewards, difficulty, price, and more. People who mine cryptocurrency for a hobby will often mine altcoins because they\u2019re more profitable. Once they\u2019ve mined the altcoins, they can either hold on to them or exchange them for bitcoin or ether. Here\u2019s an interesting post on Quora about a man who mined bitcoin for several years and reported on his profitability every year. The verdict: Bitcoin mining is for experts only. It is an extremely computationally expensive process that secures the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin miners invest money by purchasing hardware to mine bitcoin, and they have ongoing electricity costs. Unless you\u2019re running a large scale mining operation, it\u2019s difficult to break-even, let alone make a profit on bitcoin mining. When you consider the expensive upfront capital requirements of buying hardware necessary to mine bitcoin, as well as the ongoing electricity costs to power a mining operation, it\u2019s a less attractive option for those who are on a budget. Furthermore, because you need to purchase physical hardware to become a bitcoin miner, there\u2019s a longer setup window than buying or earning bitcoin. Nevertheless, some people decide to take this route to learn more about Bitcoin or simply to support the Bitcoin network. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Note: I work at Earn.com, but I love the product and was using it even before I joined the company.

            "answer_text": "Bitcoin (BTC) has hit the news again, this time for gaining an astonishing 15 per cent in three days. That\u2019s despite anxious markets reacting to geo-political tensions, the upcoming US election and the worrying situation regarding the coronavirus in China. However, this fascinating digital coin that opened our eyes to a world where secure, global payments could be made instantly and for little cost, hasn\u2019t been without its ups and downs. Investors have had to hold on tight during the stomach-clenching roller-coaster ride of highs and lows, making some a fortune while others nurse huge losses.  Visit here to exchange Bitcoin to perfect money Nonetheless, as we enter the 11th year since its creation and with hundreds of rival digital cryptocurrencies trailing in its wake, it seems safe to assume Bitcoin is here to stay. Indeed, when looking at today\u2019s price of $9,356 (\u00a37,206, \u20ac8,485) it seems astonishing to remember that one Bitcoin was worth less than one cent in 2010. Make money with Bitcoin But what about those of us who haven\u2019t got in on the Bitcoin action? Is it too late for us to make money with Bitcoin? Not at all. There\u2019s myriad ways that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be added to our portfolios, to tempt everyone from hardened investors to complete novices who just want to have a bit of fun. Here are a few of the most popular methods: 1. Micro-earnings If you're blessed with patience and don't mind being bored by adverts, you can earn free Bitcoin simply by doing small tasks. Numerous Bitcoin faucet sites work on the Pay to Click (PTC) basis; visit the website and complete the tasks given, be it clicking on a captcha, playing a game or watching an advert and get rewarded with tiny amounts of Bitcoin (Satoshis). Return to the sites frequently and watch your earnings build up. Sounds perfect. 2. Create a faucet Using faucet sites is great for earning small amounts of coins but, if you\u2019re willing to commit some time and effort, you could improve your profitability enormously by producing and running a Bitcoin faucet yourself. By creating your own website, you can charge companies to run adverts on your site and be paid in Bitcoin. Attract enough traffic and that revenue can quickly build up. 3. Become an affiliate Another, easy way to make a surprising amount of money can be by becoming an affiliate to a cryptocurrency company. By signing up to their affiliate marketing programme, you agree to promote that product or service for free and for every paying customer you bring to the company, you earn commission. After joining the programme, you will receive a personalised affiliate link. Then you just need to promote it. This can be as simple as putting the company\u2019s advert on your website or adding the link to your social media postings, to promoting the company on other sites or even running an advertising campaign. 4. Trading The most obvious method to make money with Bitcoin has to be trading. The appeal of cryptocurrency trading is understandable. While global stock exchanges are typically only open from 9.30am to 4.30pm, international Bitcoin exchanges never close, meaning coins can be bought and sold, 24/7 for 365 days a year, wherever you are in the world. By signing up to a trading platform we can swap our fiat money for cryptocurrency and by anticipating the market, aim to make money trading Bitcoin. Investors don\u2019t even need to feel chained to a desk as some companies produce apps for trading on mobile phones, letting traders act quickly wherever they are. Of course, this isn\u2019t for the faint hearted. Bitcoin\u2019s volatility has had the power to leave even hardened traders nervy and anxious. What\u2019s more, disturbing stories in the news have left investors asking \u201cis buying Bitcoin safe?\u201d 5. Mining Bitcoin It would be impossible to talk about how to make money with Bitcoin without mentioning \"mining\". We\u2019ve all heard how easy it is; simply set up your home computer to join the global network to solve the complex cryptographic puzzles required for the blockchain ledger, and you\u2019ll be rewarded with free Bitcoins for your trouble. Indeed, thousands of participants in the early days made impressive profits from mining Bitcoin. Sadly, for most of us, this is no longer an option as the astronomical costs of buying and running the complex computing equipment now required for Bitcoin would far, far outweigh any profit made. 6. Cryptocurrency lending platforms Many investors are already holding (or HODLing) Bitcoins and choosing to watch the cryptocurrency market over the long term. Interestingly, there\u2019s another way to make money here. Cryptocurrency lending platforms offer investors the opportunity to make Bitcoin loans to others and earn interest for their trouble. With some sites offering interest rates of between 8 and 15 per cent, while requiring minimal effort from lenders, this can seem very appealing. 7. Win a share of 50 Bitcoin! Finally, if you fancy a bit of healthy competition, there are two methods of making money with the Bitcoin exchange Exchanger24: Traders keen to show off their skills could take part in the \"Bitcoin Brawl\". Bitcoin Brawl competition (25BTC) The rules are simple. Participants are divided into three leagues according to their trading volumes. The most profitable traders may earn a place on the leader board, where they stand in line to win a share of the 25 Bitcoin prize fund (currently worth $233,319). Leading the table at 18.6 per cent is aqua-panicky-lisk, currently in line to collect an impressive 4.5 BTC, followed by lime-late-cosmos at 4.92 per cent and in line to collect 3 BTC. ",
