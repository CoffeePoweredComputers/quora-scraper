            "answer_text": "There are many! I love reading books and I read them on an app named anybooks but now as it was in high demand the developer of that app made it purchased I mean now you cannot download that app or continue to use it without paying and that's really sad for people like me because I had a huge library there and wishlisted many books..but now my parents won't allow me to purchase it cause it became too costly (999 rupees but after sometime changed to 620). Now I needed to complete my books so I went online and went to search them. I searched full YouTube and other apps asking how to download them or read them but no satisfactory results.\ud83d\ude14 And there it was!I forgot Google!!! After so much searching I found this : If you need any book write it's name then write pdf download and search for it.  Like this\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb Then see the first result it has PDF in box written on it,click that and a pdf will open in Google drive. You can read it there or click more options icon i.e. : three dots icon in that pdf and there will be an download option. Click on it and in some time it will get downloaded and you can read it on My files or file manager on your phone. It is according to the site you visit because some sites download pdf when clicked and some only open the doc. But If you do not get any result with PDF in box with it then some of the top most result will help you out. They do not have a direct pdf but they give a download option inside! Hope this helps\ud83d\ude0a To tell you I downloaded 14 books doing this process so try it! One of the longest answer ever written by me!! If you want to know which books I downloaded then tell me in the comments section below and I will edit this answer adding them! Thank you so much for your time and patience!\u263a\ufe0f For any book, educational or a free time read, this helps. I have found many books like this for the people who have asked me, I hope it helps. ",
