            "answer_text": "Most Profitable Small Business #1: Mobile Businesses While mobile app development is certainly a huge industry right now, that\u2019s actually not what we mean here. In this case, we\u2019re talking about businesses that travel to their customers, offering their products and services wherever the customer happens to be. Wages are set to increase in 2019 and beyond, but consumers feel like they have less and less time, setting the stage for mobile businesses to grow even more profitable. Check out these mobile business ideas to help you take advantage of this emerging trend: Auto Repair Taking a car to the shop for even simple repairs can be a challenge. After all, most of us use our cars to get from place to place! That means taking a car in for repairs often either involves a long wait at the repair shop, renting a vehicle for the day, or coordinating a ride with a friend or spouse. These options are both expensive and inconvenient. The good news is that while some repair jobs do require the equipment of an auto shop to complete, there are plenty of maintenance and repair services that need just a few simple tools to complete. If you\u2019re skilled as a mechanic, consider going mobile with your services\u2014offering oil changes, fluid refills, battery swaps, headlight repair and more right in your customer\u2019s driveway or office parking lot. Food Trucks The food truck movement is slated to keep growing in 2019. As rent in major cities across the country increases, it\u2019s becoming more difficult for up-and-coming specialty food artisans to finance a brick-and-mortar location in the bustling centers of town\u2014where their customers are most likely to be. Food trucks provide a great solution. Hit the road and park yourself at local events, farmers markets, the local town square\u2014wherever you\u2019re likely to draw a crowd. The lower overhead and increased geographic versatility of a food truck means you can turn your grandma\u2019s famous dumpling recipe or that off-the-wall dessert idea into its own thriving business. Keep in mind that bigger, trendier cities like San Francisco, Portland, and Boston already have a pretty saturated food truck market\u2014so you might be more successful in a smaller heartland metropolis. Food trucks also tend to have their own special set of ordinances, business licenses, and safety compliance standards, so contact your local health department to find out what will be required. Car Wash Services Most people would pay a premium for a mobile car wash came to them, instead of having to drive across town to access a car wash. This is especially true for people with upscale cars who prefer a more personalized service. As a mobile car wash and auto detailing service, you wouldn\u2019t only benefit from the unique value proposition of being mobile, but you\u2019d also avoid the significant overhead and startup cost of having a physical location. Not sure how to start your own mobile car wash service? There are a variety of online wholesalers that offer auto detailing start-up kits as well as training for those interested in starting their own business in this niche industry. Electronics Repair To say that Americans these days are obsessed with electronics would be a bit of an understatement. People spend most of their waking hours staring at a screen of some sort. This widespread tech addiction means that when something goes wrong, people want help as soon as possible. This explains the popularity of mobile electronic repair services. You could be the solution for every broken iPhone screen, WiFi card, and laptop battery. And if you\u2019re willing to travel to your customer, you\u2019ve got an instant hit! Apple stores and other electronics retailers have come under fire recently for long customer wait times, which could work in favor of mobile providers. While a mobile electronics repair business involves some overhead in the form of purchasing supplies, keeping your business mobile saves you from the high overhead cost of a physical location. That means more profit in your pocket! IT Support Although two-thirds of Americans think they are think savvy, the truth is that they often need to rely on tech support. Some even make their computers or other devices vulnerable to hackers and identity theft. Unfortunately, when things go wrong, often the free customer phone support provided by manufacturers doesn\u2019t feel supportive or fails to solve the problem. If technology comes easily to you\u2014and you\u2019re a relatively patient person\u2014then consider hitting the road, at least in your neighborhood, with mobile IT support. All you need is time, transportation, and your own know-how\u2014so this low-overhead business model is almost pure profit. Personal Trainers Turning your love of fitness into a career doesn\u2019t have to mean working for a big corporate gym\u2014nor do you need the overhead of having your own location to train clients. Throw a few weights, bands, and yoga mats into the trunk of your car, and take your fitness show on the road! Offer one-on-one sessions in your clients\u2019 homes or advertise group classes at a local park or community center. Making fitness more available to your clients might just be the ticket to helping both of you achieve your goals. As Americans start to eat healthier and exercise more, fitness and wellness businesses are increasing in popularity. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question! Towns and large urban areas offer opportunities for myriad small-scale businesses. As an example, it costs very little to set up shop in the town core, where people come for business or pleasure and could benefit from the assistance of a service provider. Every town has government agencies for helping accomplish certain endeavors. Filing forms, making copies of documents, and notarizing documents are typical activities people often struggle with. Setting up a mobile shop offering help near these centers could earn hundreds of dollars every day. It is useful to look at the data around these centers and offer services to fill in the gaps. Long lines and congestion could mean opportunities for food services, as visitors could get exhausted waiting in long lines, and would like to enjoy some refreshments. Large urban areas also offer business opportunities based on price differences. Folks living in the Los Angeles suburbs could offer nutritious food to ravenous students going to school at UCLA or USC for low cost and still generate a daily income amounting to a few hundred dollars, for instance; or taking wealthy aging or retired people, in most towns and urban areas, for a daily outing could be an interesting business. Consider guided tours, helping people with disabilities, tutorials, services, and many more with no upfront capital requirement. The odds of success increase dramatically in the absence of costs. For entrepreneurial success, the key thing is to examine consumer behavior in a given neighborhood and find underserved populations that any major player is unable to serve. ",
