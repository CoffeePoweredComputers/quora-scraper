            "answer_text": "Define technology as I could make a strong case that most aren't downtown, even as it might seem.  Here's what NW Austin looks like, which you might consider Palo Alto to San Francisco (to use a Silicon Valley analogy) Almost everything health tech related is N of downtown or out in Bee Caves. The tech companies such as Google, Apple, AMD, Freescale, Visa (yes Visa), Bazaarvoice, BigCommerce, Samsung, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Indeed, Revionics, Spiceworks, Solarwinds... I'll think of more... are along 360 and 183. Bio and wet lab space is being developed in E Austin  What do you have downtown? Young or well funded startups. Or service providers such as mobile dev companies as they're highly profitable. I don't know this for a fact but I'd bet that 90% of the startups with founders over, say 35, aren't downtown. Cost of being downtown is already exceptional, relatively speaking, and with Austin's traffic and parking challenges, companies either need money for space or younger employees who live closer (don't drive) and/or pack in. Don't misunderstand my read as criticism of downtown nor what's there; but unlike San Francisco (SoMa), Bay Area (Mountain View), Dallas (west side), Boulder, or Las Vegas as some examples, Austin's burden with traffic is preventing a fairly centralized tech region.  I'm from the Bay Area so trust that I appreciate a good commute and traffic. Generally speaking, people out where I live (Lake Travis), loathe having to get downtown, East, or South. No one comes from Cedar Park or Round Rock to get into the city; we find a lot of tech manufacturing and video game dev there. Those of us used to an hour commute can appreciate how a region develops: people will commute to it. But people here (frankly are smarter and...) won't spend 2 hours a day in a car so companies, tech, are spread all over the place.  Case to consider to validate that is HomeAway. Downtown right? Opening a major campus up around The Domain.  Bazaarvoice is also opening up an office close to that area. ",

Apple's campus is up in Jollyville, off Parmer and McNeil. There are smaller offices in the Arboretum area, where Google, Microsoft, Oracle, and others have small offices. The majority of the startups and hackspaces are in or around downtown, with a few near West Campus. ",
