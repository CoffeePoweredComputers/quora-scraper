            "answer_text": "I prefer the term \"wide moat\", i.e., companies with pricing power.  For the same reasons Peter Thiel (businessman) mentioned, I don't want the government filing anti-trust claims against companies whose stocks I am long. :) Additional Disclosure: I am long or may otherwise transact in the securities (buy/sell/derivatives/limit orders) in some or all of the companies below. Anyway, pricing power means a company can charge high prices relative to their costs so the margins are very high.  Some wide moat tech companies: Google - Hangouts underrated yet virtually every founder I speak with assumes our video chats will be done via Hangouts. No one else comes close. Google Keep can really hurt Evernote in some cases (esp. w/ Evernote's reported security issues). Google Now is amazing. Real-time voice translator coming. Etc. Amazon - AWS dominance still underestimated by many. Google the NY Times piece on AWS. Crazy. Apple - iBeacons underrated, incredible margins. The new Mac Pro is beautiful. Heavy, expensive but I bet sales will be pretty good. Intel - laptop microprocessors and incredible work on the Internet of Things. They did a really good job at 2014 CES. Qualcomm - mobile device semiconductors Oracle/SAP (duopoly) - enterprise software, incl. fulfillment, database management HP - printers. I have a printer/scanner/fax I basically never use. But when need a printer (or fax or scanner), I really need it. Same with most folks that \"don't need a printer\". IBM - enterprise services, Watson Microsoft - Excel, Kinect, Word (track changes for legal docs) and PowerPoint. Shared dominance with Google in search. Shared dominance in operating systems with Apple and Google. Excellent enterprise penetration. Samsung - tablet and phablet market share. ",

            "answer_text": "Modern Monopolies: What It Takes to Dominate the 21st Century Economy by Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson provides a deep understanding of emerging platform business models that is required to create the next Amazon, Google, or Uber. The book showcases a well thought out presentation of the principles behind the core functions and deliverables of a platform, which is the modern day monopoly. One of my favorite aspects of the book are the stories that go fairly in-depth into the network and viral strategies used to propel the biggest platforms today, including Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Etsy, eBay, Paypal, Square, Snapchat, Tinder, YouTube, Skype, Uber, Airbnb, Yelp, Groupon and many, many more. THE FOUR CORE FUNCTIONS OF A PLATFORM: Audience building: Build a liquid marketplace by attracting a critical mass of consumers and producers.Matchmaking: Connect the right consumers with the right producers in order to facilitate transactions and interactions.Providing core tools and services: Build tools and services that support the core transaction by lowering transaction costs, removing barriers to entry, and making the platform more valuable over time through data.Setting rules and standards: Set guidelines that govern which behaviors are allowed and encouraged and which are forbidden or discouraged.\u201cA small but dense and highly active network is usually much more valuable and useful than a larger but more dispersed network. The smaller network will create more transactions and more value.\u201d Those looking for potential opportunities to launch their next startup will also find some great ideas within this book. Some industries that are ripe for platform disruption are health care, internet of things and finance. Nevertheless, the best way to spot potential opportunities is to see what is isn\u2019t being done already and capitalize on advantages of time, network and scale in your new audience. HOW TO SPOT PLATFORM OPPORTUNITIES Look for technology that reduces transaction costs and removes gatekeepers.Look for implicit or undeserved networks.Look for large, fragmented sources of supply.- See more at: Modern Monopolies: What It Takes to Dominate the 21st Century Economy | Entrepreneur Finesse ",
