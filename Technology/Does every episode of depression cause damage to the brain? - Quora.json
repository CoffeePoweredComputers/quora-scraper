            "answer_text": "Actually, that's a pretty interesting concept. The brain is a very, very complex organ, and there's so much we don't know or understand about it, however based off images of the brain taken through a PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan it show's that a depressed brain is in a way \u201cdamaged\u201d. This proves that depression isn't just something you can get over in a week, and isn't just \u201call in your head\u201d, for lack of better term.(you aren't just making it up) PET Scan:  As you can see, the depressed brain is literally different, because of the lack of chemicals like serotonin and dopamine. The brain is ill in a sense, the lack of green and yellow in the depressed brain showing the difference. Depression isn't made up, it's real, and it's serious; however, though depression is a long painful ride, it can be treated. Antidepressants and SSRI's (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) can help treat clinical depression and other types of mental disorders, like bipolar or possibly cases of trauma, however it can vary. Depression doesn't dumb you down, however it makes it harder to think straight. It's harder to make proper choices, harder to focus, and quite frankly sometimes harder to care. Antidepressants and SSRI's also can have side effects that can cause this, brain fog is quite common. This could be mistaken with ignorance, but in reality it's usually just because of how the brain functions while battling depression. Mental illnesses are still illnesses, they don't matter any less than physical illnesses and are still dangerous. Though there's lots we don't know about an organ as complex as the brain, we know that if a person who say had depression were to take an antidepressant best fit for them, it'd have a pretty high chance of helping them out. (again, not always, but they have a pretty good chance at helping) Hope this helped. To those struggling, don't give up. You're stronger than you think. Best regards to all. <3 ~Zoey ***(edit, please read: I didn't add this in my original answer, and a few people in the comments corrected me (thank you) that PET scans, MRI scans, and other scans of such do NOT guarantee a foolproof diagnosis, and as lovely as it would be to have current technology like that, it isn't so reliant as it seems. All I was saying was that the scan shown above could show depression, however like I failed to mention, it isn't fully reliant and getting a thorough doctor to patient diagnosis would be far more reliant that a scan. I just found it interesting, and one of my past doctors mentioned the scan to me to show that depression is real and isn't made up. Perhaps this wouldn't be considered damage, but illness, considering such can be in many cases treated. Thank you to those who corrected my answer, and if anyone else has something they believe I may have looked past, don't hesitate to correct me. Constructive criticism and/or corrections are appreciated and welcome. )*** ",

            "answer_text": "No. You aren\u2019t going to \u201cdamage\u201d your brain by being depressed. Depression is associated with changes in a wide variety of aspects of brain function including working memory, cognition, attention, sleep, appetite, and so on. But this isn\u2019t because your brain has been damaged. Your brain tissue isn\u2019t being destroyed, and there\u2019s nothing going on that can\u2019t be fixed (assuming we are talking about otherwise normal brains without comorbidities such as degenerative brain disease). It\u2019s more useful to think of depression like an instrument that\u2019s out of tune, or a car that needs a tune up. You definitely aren\u2019t operating at peak efficiency when you\u2019re depressed, and there are all sorts of measurable changes in the way your brain is operating. It can be difficult to get out of that rut, but there\u2019s no permanent physical changes that will prevent you from recovering. After all, depression is a natural response to depressing experiences. The brain remains plastic through adulthood, and has a remarkable ability to heal and restore normal operation (assuming root causes for depression are addressed). For many people, regular physical exercise is an effective method of treatment and prevention for depression, although this may be more helpful for males than females. Getting good quality sleep, good nutrition, and managing stress are also very important for maintaining brain and psychological health. We could go into detail talking about neurotransmitters, activation patterns, cortisol levels, and so on, but I wanted to keep my answer high level and reassure anyone who might be concerned that they are \u201cdamaging\u201d themselves just by being in a depressed state.
