            "answer_text": "I would recommend a bank over Paypal. A bank is FDIC Insured and will provide you with regular statements and multiple ways to access funds in a secure way. Paypal has been hacked multiple times in the last few years and does not have all the security in place or FDIC Insurance in place that a bank has. In the event of fraudulent activity, stolen card or fraudulent charges on your bank account, the bank has ways of investigating as well as having either $0 liability or some $50 liability. Having a bank account will also help to establish credit. You might also look at a Credit Union. They are also Insured. ",

But, if you really see this as a choice you need to make, let me ask this: Are your deposits federally guaranteed if something goes awry at PayPal? {I don\u2019t know - I\u2019m asking.} If your Bank fails, your deposits are guaranteed. That\u2019s what the FDIC does. Maybe this s/b your guide. ",
