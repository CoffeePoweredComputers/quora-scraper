It\u2019s only because they like me. I was in the right place at the right time. I just work harder than the others. I don\u2019t deserve this. It\u2019s just a matter of time before I am found out. Someone must have made a terrible mistake.  If you are a working woman, chances are this inter\u00adnal monologue sounds all too familiar. And you\u2019re not alone. From the high-achieving Ph.D. candidate convinced she\u2019s only been admitted to the program because of a clerical error to the senior executive who worries others will find out she\u2019s in way over her head, a shocking number of accomplished women in all ca\u00adreer paths and at every level feel as though they are faking it\u2014impostors in their own lives and careers.  While the impostor syndrome is not unique to women, women are more apt to agonize over tiny mistakes, see even constructive criticism as evi\u00addence of their shortcomings, and chalk up their accomplishments to luck rather than skill. They often unconsciously overcompensate with crippling perfec\u00adtionism, overpreparation, maintaining a lower pro\u00adfile, withholding their talents and opinions, or never finishing important projects. When they do succeed, they think, Phew, I fooled \u2019em again.  An internationally known speaker, Valerie Young has devoted her career to understanding women\u2019s most deeply held beliefs about themselves and their success. In her decades of in-the-trenches research, she has uncovered the often surprising reasons why so many accomplished women experience this crushing self-doubt.  In The Secret Thoughts of Successful Women, Young gives these women the solution they have been seek\u00ading. Combining insightful analysis with effective ad\u00advice and anecdotes, she explains what the impostor syndrome is, why fraud fears are more common in women, and how you can recognize the way it mani\u00adfests in your life.

            "answer_text": "Learned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Life, by Martin E. Seligman Impostor Syndrome is a form of 'learned helplessness', where we externalize our success, and internalize our failures. i.e. Success is due to others and failures are mine alone. This belief system is prevalent in cultures and family systems that denigrate or discourage individualism, its also prevalent if an individual has been cultured to believe they are only approved of if they are a 'winner'. This book helps explain and demonstrate the changes required. A book is not enough though, you need a helping hand. It's difficult to change this type of belief without someone helping you through the process, someone like a coach or therapist. They will help you develop the positive and accurate perspective on yourself that you are missing. The belief that you have will keep you in this space as a prisoner without a safe and objective third party to offer perspective and gentle encouragement. Good luck! ",
