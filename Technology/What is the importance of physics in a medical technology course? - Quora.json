            "answer_text": "Speaking as one whose childhood dream was to make it big in physics, I can tell you that at bottom ALL technology is rigorously dependent on physical principles. Moving fluids, air, rehabilitating joints, assisting in respiratory recovery, . . . , and many other medical operations are critically determined by physics. Magnetic Resonance Imaging, PET Scans, Axial Tomography \u2014 none would exist without firm grounding in quite advanced physics. No doubt more will follow. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Much of the common household tests and procedures that we know today came from fundamental physics. Before delving into that, engineering is ultimately related to physics and you need engineers to design apparatus for medical professionals. So you also need physics indirectly. Now, as per direct influences, I can name two. MRI, short for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, arose as a consequence of Nuclear Resonance Spectroscopy being applied to image the brain. PET scan was a direct application of particle physics. ",

Or, you could learn to operate the instrumentation without any knowledge of how it operates and just be a low level robot. ",
