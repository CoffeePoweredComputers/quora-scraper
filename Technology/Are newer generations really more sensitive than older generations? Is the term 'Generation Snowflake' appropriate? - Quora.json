            "answer_text": "Considering some members of the older generations got dangerously offended when they saw a little black girl entering an all-whites school, and sent death threats to the family and threatened to kill her, no, I\u2019d say that younger generations are not more offended than older generations. You remember Ellen coming out in the 90\u2019s, and the horrible backlash it caused for something as simple as not liking men, sexually? Don\u2019t look at those folks and tell me they\u2019re not \u201csnowflakes\u201d. You have to look at what they\u2019re getting offended by. And yes, some people do take their outrage too far. We know there\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay. We know women should be considered equal, in terms of their rights. We know there is no reason for for blacks to be treated differently because of the color of their skin, by police and businesses. So when we see people advocating for things counter to these points of views, people get pissed off! These aren\u2019t things you can argue about! These are basic facts. Hell, look at the present so-called Commander-in-Chief, and all the mock outrage he spits out at people kneeling during football games, when the true source of his outrage against the NFL stems from a business deal he made during the 80\u2019s. It\u2019s not even genuine, he\u2019s just playing his followers like a fiddle! Some of the members of the older generation get offended at things they\u2019re not even really offended by, they just want to fight! So no, the younger generation doesn\u2019t have an exclusive at taking offense. In fact, the older generation, and generations before them, seem to get offended at the most minute, trivial of things. Like a little black girl\u2019s skin color. I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t know how the hell we beat Hitler during WWII sometimes, or helped beat him rather, with as weenie as some of these guys were. Yes, there were a lot of fine, upstanding patriotic soldiers, but don\u2019t forget that many of these men were the same men who came to lynch black soldiers and gouge out their eyes, once they had returned from their tours of duty. They were the same men who abandoned their black compatriots once back on home soil, because the \u2018standard norm\u2019 didn\u2019t allow for them to be nice to them. They turned their backs on them, and ignored the friendships they had forged. Sometimes they ignored them. Other times, they killed them. Again, it wasn\u2019t 100%. It wasn\u2019t all of them! It may not even have been more than 45%! But it was a large amount. No one can deny that. Many of those Ku Klux Klan members were former soldiers, in all likelihood. Because that\u2019s what you did in the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s, if you lived in certain places, and were vulnerable to certain influences. I\u2019ll never forget the interviews given by some members of supremacist groups in documentaries like the ones on PBS, in archival footage, where individuals go on and on about how blacks can\u2019t be allowed in the neighborhood because they\u2019ll bring down the value, and how offensive it is that they\u2019re living so close to white people, and yet they look like the biggest trash imaginable! It\u2019s not the black people those neighborhoods had to worry about, it was you!!! How\u2019s that for being offended? Over something as trivial as skin color. And of course, now we have the ultimate Snowflake in power, a man who gets offended if the media doesn\u2019t worship him, like a god. Sorry, man, you\u2019re not a god. And if you do something stupid, the media has a duty to report on it. It\u2019s nothing to take offense at. *sneer* ",

            "answer_text": "Younger generations are more sensitive to getting their feelings hurt and extrapolate that narcissistic sensitivity to the feelings of others creating a faux-sensitivity towards others as well as a greater hypocrisy within their belief systems. Texting is an example of their insensitive treatment of other humans. Tattooing and body piercings are examples of their narcissistic insensitivity to the environment. Going to the tattoo parlor consumes fuel and sterilization of the equipment consumes energy. Gold and silver for body jewelry are mined. Trees and grasslands replaced by tattoo parlor parking lots. Medical resources consumed on tattoo and piercing related problems such as infection. So \u2018Generation Snowflake\u2019 is a fitting, appropriate term. ",
