            "answer_text": "I've worked in Sintex for a year now and not in industries but Plastic division and would like to highlight : Better look for better quality shares instead oh sintex. Though the company has great product lines in plastics and a great new flourishing plant in Sintex yarn division but should look for more settled stocks.The company has some serious debt also mentioned on the bse websites or can check their balance sheets also.Though the yarn division is having a great plant and a dedicated talents team running the business, you need to wait at least 3 years to show some postive results as the debt reduction process will take some time.If asked between plastics or industries, please go for Industries with long term hold, also if possible avoid both and try and search companies with healthy balance sheet!.",
