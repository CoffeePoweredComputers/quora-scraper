            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve never owned one of my own, but I know a lot of people that USED to, and some that still do. The usual and correct answer is just barely enough to stay in business, considering the hours you have to work and or sit around waiting to load and unload far from home while you\u2019re worrying about who\u2019s flirting with your wife or husband and you\u2019re missing the kids ball games. Most people who try it give it up within a few years. But this is not to say a few owner operators don\u2019t make a pretty good living. I know one old guy who has a really loyal following who hauls for hire locally and he makes a good living without ever going more than fifty miles or so from home. He doesn\u2019t average a night away twice a year, but he does get up really early some days and get home pretty late some days. ",
