            "answer_text": "We live in times when technology is applicable in almost every industry. As an event organizer and enthusiast, I can surely say that also the event field is constantly being enriched by tech novelties. With technology growing at a very fast pace, new solutions make their way to the list of must-have trends of event organization. Some of the trends have really got me as those innovations can significantly improve event experiences not only for organizers but, most importantly, for attendees. Wearables You\u2019re probably familiar with smartwatches, tech wristbands and so on. This kind of wearable technology helps not only in everyday activities, such as measuring your pulse while running but can also make the event more efficient. For example, wristbands can help you check in at the conference. Sounds better than waiting in a queue, right? Then, there are gadgets like VR glasses that can teleport you to any virtual place you want helping you experience more. For me, that\u2019s definitely a technology worth to consider as a game changer right now. Facial recognition Now, this one is not just about Snapchat filters as some may think. Facial recognition starts to make the verification process much easier and quicker. Regardless of whether it\u2019s unlocking your phone or computer or checking in to the hotel room or conference. The trend to use this technology novelty is strong and surely the world can\u2019t wait where it will be used in the nearest future. Maybe some validation of access to premium areas at events or in office? Can\u2019t wait to find out! Augmented reality This technology allows a user to experience the surrounding environment on its fullest. It can connect us to the world around us. The technology can, for example, help to explore the venue and learn more about it. Just look how Google used it. Fascinating, isn\u2019t it?  Traffic tracking solutions What I found extremely useful in my area of interest are the technological solutions which can help track the behavior of customers (or event participants in my case). Things like beacons technology that follow the phone signal draw the map of every person that passes the beacon device. It can tell you interesting information that later can be used to personalize the offer. Then there are QR codes which when used correctly basically gather for you vital data about those who scan them. Good for generating leads, right? These are just a couple of examples that automatically pop into my mind when I hear about innovative tech ideas. I hope you\u2019ll find some inspiration in these examples.
