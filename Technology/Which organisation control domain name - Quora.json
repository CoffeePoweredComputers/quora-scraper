            "answer_text": "Domain names to be used on the Internet are not free. There\u2019s an infrastructure required to allow those names to be recognized and resolved to IP addresses. Within your own organization you could have domain names that you created yourself provided you either run host files on all your internal machines or your own dns services. Hopefully your domains won't clash with any real domains on machines that can access the internet or else those internet domains won\u2019t work properly within your network anymore and your own domains won\u2019t work either. If you wish to distribute domain names that will work across the internet then you'll need to become an accredited registrar and build the infrastructure to make either a new TLD work or pay the fees to distribute unregistered domains under an established TLD. Several years back the bottom line entry fee was $70,000 dollars plus a few dollars per domain plus all the hardware and software to get your new names into the dns root system. So you pay your money - and you get to play. ",
