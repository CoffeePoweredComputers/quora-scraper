            "answer_text": "Differences between AI, Machine learning, Deep learning, and Data Science. Section A: Computer Science Computer science is a relatively broad field that includes AI but also other subfields such as distributed computing, human-computer interaction, and software engineering. Section B: AI = any computer algorithm that exhibits intelligence AI is a part of computer science. Section C: Machine learning = any AI algorithm that attempts to learn from data Machine learning is usually considered to be a part of AI. Section D: Deep learning = any ML algorithm that uses \u201cdeep\u201d (more than one layer) neural networks(NN*) to analyze data Deep learning is part of machine learning. Section E: Data Science Data science needs computer science and AI. However, it also involves a lot of statistics, business, law, and other application domains, so it is usually not considered to be a part of computer science.  NN* = a neural network normally represents a graph of nodes with weighted relationships using a matrix of decimal numbers and uses some mathematical function to calculate the output values based on the input values and relationship weights, and training through correcting the weights through back-propagation Hope it helps a little bit :) ",

            "answer_text": "To better understand the difference between ML, AI and deep learning, it is imperative to understand the similarities they share. The field of Mathematics gives us a way of representing entities with symbols while allowing us to analyze the relationship between them. Al-Khwarizmi created the concept of Algorithms as a means of further abstracting pieces of the relationships that occur in a mathematical process. So, in the age of computers, ML, AI & Deep Learning are similar in that they use algorithms to describe and represent process(es) as well as the data that they analyze. Machine Learning is different because it uses a suite of algorithms embedded in a computer program to make decisions based on the analysis of logic states and real-time input feeds. Deep Learning on the other hand is a form of machine learning that uses a neural network organized to mimic the learning functions of a brain. While Artificial Intelligence is a system comprising of independently interactive modules that include machine learning, cognition, R&R (Response and Representation), Identity management, etc. whose main predisposition is to create and represent new knowledge using algorithms. The nature and extent to which a module is used in the design of an AI system is limited to the functional domain in which the AI system is applied. ",
