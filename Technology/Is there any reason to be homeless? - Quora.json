            "answer_text": "Generally and for the most part, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness and HUD, the lack of affordable decent/dignified housing has been the main reason why there is an increase in homelessness. People experiencing homelessness and poverty include children, the aging elderly, the disabled, and those who choose to be homeless (the lowest fraction of the population). Think about the more than half million people who were counted as homeless on the one night when volunteers go through a community to count people not living in shelters and the people who live in shelters (both sheltered and unsheltered are homeless). That count does not include the homeless who sleep in abandoned buildings or cars. Those who share a couch or a room with a friend on that Point-In-Time Count are not part of the count. Therefore, you can be correct if you say there are twice as many as half million people experiencing homelessness. Wherever the cost of housing is high, you can expect to see people living on the streets or in the nearby woods. The City of Los Angeles and the City of Honolulu have mutual problems that makes their homelessness count greater than the rest of the country. The mutual problem is: High Area Median Rent. In fact, latest research shows that minimum wage earners can only afford $500 per month or less in rent. Do you know where decent and dignified one-bedrooms can be rented for $500 per month including utilities? That is a fact realized by nearly every community in the United States. The next thing to think about is: Disasters. What do you suppose happens when a town is flooded or destroyed by fire? Fact is that in Chico, California, there were 40,000 displaced without a place to live because of the devastating wildfire in 2018. They are homeless, living in motels or shelters or camping. While we have facts that point to the serious lack of affordable housing, partly because older housing is deteriorating and are not being rehabilitated, land owners and developers and real estate brokers can charge as much rent as they want. High story buildings are very expensive and more costly than building single family small houses. I\u2019m against tiny houses because they are not made to last for a lifetime. I am for creative permanent essential houses that have bathrooms, good insulation, modern kitchen, living room and a spacious bedroom or two. It is what we\u2019ve designed for our development that we hope some day will be built in a village setting. Research shows that people do not like living in high rises, because there are too many people converged into the same space. In rural communities, the environment is cleaner because the population is lower than in cities. However, developers are not building for affordability. They are building for profit. It will take the political will to allow modifications to zoning and restrictions on land. In our region of southwestern Colorado, we have a serious problem with water. Drought has lowered the amount of water washed down after a dry winter with very little snowmelt. While there are many ranches and farms up for sale, their water source is scarce, and it costs millions of dollars to connect to City water and to dig deeper wells. At the same time, waste management is a huge problem for a development. Regulations and laws that restrict properties to be used for affordable housing is compounded by the Not-In-My-Back-Yard (NIMBY) attitudes. Unless civic leaders look at the housing problems differently, we may as well sit back and watch more homeless campsites popping up everywhere they should not be. One researcher says that in order to end homelessness, every State of the nation needs to build 150,000 units of housing in an overnight \u2014 and, every one of those units must be dedicated to the homeless. Wages are not increasing, and minimum wage is not the same as \u201cliving wage\u201d or \u201chousing wage\u201d. This is a worldwide problem. But, America needs to realize there is a drastic shift of wealth since President Trump and the Republicans gave tax breaks to the largest corporations \u2014 the ones who don\u2019t increase minimum wages \u2014 and the top 1% of the wealthy. The big question may be (in my humble opinion): When will a revolution take place by the growing population of the poor and the homeless? History says it will happen \u2014 but, when? We are as a nation on a brink of recession since the most recent drop in the stock market only a few days ago. Trump is threatened by the forecast of a bad economy. He is \u201conly worried about being re-elected\u201d. He has divided this country so deeply that this nation is vulnerable to economic disaster!! We could have another crash of the market. Trump has destroyed our relationships with countries that were our Allies. When America falls, our enemies will have the capacity to destroy us from within. That whole scenario is my greatest concern!! If you don\u2019t like homelessness populations now, wait until the next recession happens; you can expect more people losing homes and jobs. But there is hope! My hope is in the Lord God coming back to rule this earth. He is the only hope! ",

            "answer_text": "Major reasons for homelessness include:  Poor social and familial relationships - If you have very poor or non-existent relationships with your family then you have no one to provide you housing or loans to get you on your feet in troubled times. If you don't  have a partner or an SO, then you can also end up being homeless.Mental illness - If you are a mentally ill person who has an illness that is \"treatable\" on an outpatient basis, then you are likely to become homeless when/if you have personal or financial setbacks.Substance use/abuse - If you frequently overindulge in alcohol & illegal substances, unless you can also maintain employment, there's a strong likelihood that you will become homeless.Poor planning - You see this a great deal in \"boomtowns\". People frequently move to areas that they are unfamiliar with or simply know nothing about and expect to gain employment immediately. When this doesn't occur or when their employment has issues, they simply haven't planned for this, they haven't saved for this and as such end up being homeless.Lack of flexibility - Homeless people are often very inflexible. They want or need conditions to be in manners that are acceptable to them and will actually move out of situations (and back into homelessness) for reasons that could be altered by having a simple discussion or by compromising. There are many agencies willing to help people; but to do so they have to be flexible.While there are many more reasons that people become homeless, at least one or more of the above are root causes of their continued homelessness.
