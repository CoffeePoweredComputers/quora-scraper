            "answer_text": "The death of Alexander the Great (323 BCE).  His empire is broken up between his generals, setting the stage for the spread of Helenism, the eventual fall of the Egypt, and the rise of the Middle EastJulius Caesar crosses the Rubicon with his army(49 BCE).  The led to the civil war in Rome that concluded with Caesar becoming emperor and the Roman republic falling to a dictatorship.  Had this not occurred, Rome would probably not have been the juggernaut it became.The birth of Jesus(ca. 1 CE).  Can't say much else here.Constantine declares Christianity the official religion of the Roman empire(313 CE).  Without this, Christianity would have been much less prevalent and more fractious.The birth of Muhammad ibn \u2018Abdull\u0101h (ca. 570 CE).  Muhammad founds Islam which becomes the second largest religion in the world.The Magna Carta (1225/1297 CE).  Began the decline of monarchy rule in Europe that paved the way for modern democracy.The European discovery of the new world (1492 CE).  While others cultures and explorers had found the new world previously, Columbus capitalized on his discovery by better documentation, enslavement of the native populations and opening the new world to European colonization, culminating in the United States.The assassination of Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria (June 28, 1914).  This led directly to the first World War and indirectly to the second World War, the Cold War, Korean conflict and Vietnam war.  With a single bullet, the West and East are thrown into decades of conflict, the modern map is completely redrawn, the world progresses from the Industrial Age to the Modern Age, and the nuclear bomb is invented.  Powered flight becomes a commercial and military product, no longer a pastime. The Soviet Union and the U.S. become the most powerful countries ever.  Wartime technology becomes peacetime productivity, leading to spaceflight, satellites, computers, the internet and much more.",

            "answer_text": "Johann Gutenberg\u2019s invention of the movable type. I am amazed how liberal arts majors answer questions like these by talking about the French Revolution or European conquest of the Americas. Much of that would not be possible without the spread of knowledge. And those who love military history talk about how some great conqueror and his wars changed the face of the earth. Not really. When someone invaded and conquered your homeland, one of two things happened: If the invader was secular, you now paid taxes to a different king. Or, if he was on a religious crusade, you now prayed to a different God. How much did any of this changed your life in real terms? Not much. You were an illiterate, poor peasant before, and you were an illiterate, poor peasant after. What the invention of the movable type did was to immediately bring down the cost of producing a book from upwards of a thousand dollars per copy to much less than one hundred dollars per copy. It also made it possible to mass produce books and spread knowledge. Earlier, if your father was a poor blacksmith, he had never read a book in his life. He did not own one. And you might have been born with an IQ of 150, but you are going to be a blacksmith too - you are never going to get your hands on a book because they were prohibitively expensive and thus very rare. Now, with the movable type, your poor blacksmith father could afford to buy you a book or two if his children were interested in intellectual pursuits. You could record military history and military leaders could read it and educate themselves en masse. Scientific, social, political thought could be recorded and spread around. You may have brilliant ideas about democracy or military strategy, but before the movable type, who would ever get to know about them? Movable type broke the back of feudalism. Birth privilege was its major casualty. It ushered in the era of egalitarianism. A couple of centuries later, we were harnessing the brain power of our entire society and not depending on a handful of intellectuals. European renaissance, age of reason, age of scientific discovery and industrial revolution \u2026 all came out of this one invention and without it, we would still be riding horses and killing each others with spears and swords in conquest of territory or over religious beliefs. (No, gunpowder did not by itself dramatically change how battles were fought.) So, my apologies to Alexander the Great, Christopher Columbus, Gengiz Khan, Vasco Da Gama, and the like. No, they did not change much in the world. The ONLY thing that brings about significant and permanent change is scientific discovery and technological invention. Invention of the movable type was THE watershed event in the history of mankind. ",
