            "answer_text": "I believe that you are referring to a person having a testable trait in the area of IQ pertaining to technology. The answer is and has been yes. This has always been a part of IQ testing. IQ tests attempt to measure the base intelligence of a person. It measures aspects of intelligence including compression, problem solving, creativity, adaptability, and motor skills among others. How these things relate to technology is more educational than part of the basic concept of intelligence. Why some people, such as younger generation, have an easier time with current technology than older people is that over the years the older generation has developed most of their neural connections to a point where they are essentially hard wired to their past educational experience and have a reduction in adaptability. In the future those who have grown up with the current technology will find the future technology may have outpaced their own understanding as they become more and more hardwired to their own experiences with technology. I am currently in my mid fifties and am far less adaptable to change (in some ways) than I used to be. Although I have a high IQ someone who is much younger than me with the same IQ is not more intelligent, only more adaptable. This difference in adaptability is what you may have perceived as creating new area of intelligence. ",

            "answer_text": "People that can use a computer are not technical minded, when. They could recreate what they use with enough time then they are. What most people do today is being able to use a tool and I think the big reason our parents had a generally harder time learning because as they where growing up tech wasn\u2019t very user friendly, and easy to break expensive machines I think we are headed in the right direction and would love programming to be a basic living requirement but new programming will allow most poeiple to create programs without much technical knowledge there will always be people with real skill and knowledge but for other i say the age of telling a computer what you want it to do like in Star Trek isn\u2019t far off.
