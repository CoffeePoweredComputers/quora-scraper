            "answer_text": "No. (Or at least, probably not.) Simply, wireless charging works with two coils of copper wire. One coil is powered, so makes a short range magnetic field. The other coil, when placed in this magnetic field, induces current and sends the energy down the wire to wherever you want it to go.  (I think this diagram is from Vox) WiFi works dramatically differently. It uses radio frequency (hence the antennas you will probably see on your router), so WiFi charging is fundamentally impossible. However, technologys are being developed that are true wireless charging, like I imagine you were thinking of. It will be some while, but maybe someday you'll be able to. ",
