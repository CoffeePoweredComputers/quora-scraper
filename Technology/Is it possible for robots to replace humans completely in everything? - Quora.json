            "answer_text": "Hi there, Have a long read my dear readers\u2026 Well well well chances are really high that ROBOTS will replace humans completely in future Here, are some examples that have a clear sign that robots will replace humans completely in coming 30, 20 or even in 10 years. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 SELF DRIVING CARS Self-driving cars are poised to revolutionize the transportation industry. There have been many significant shifts in the auto industry since the beginning of commercial auto production roughly eight decades ago, but the basic formula of a human operator guiding a vehicle using a steering wheel and pedals has held pretty steady across that time span. That's changing quickly. Newer cars already have automated features for things like parking and collision detection, and auto and tech companies are hard at work to deliver vehicles that are capable of advanced navigation without input from a human driver. Is the rise of self-driving cars an investing opportunity? With automated driving systems on track to continue improving, it's reasonable to think that the technology could be a huge tailwind for companies that are positioned to capitalize. Business Insider Intelligence reports that roughly 10 million cars with automated navigation technology will be on the road in 2020. McKinsey has predicted that roughly 15% of automobiles sold in 2030 could be fully autonomous. ULTIMATELY LEADS TO JOB LOSS IN DRIVING SECTORS. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 2. HOME CLEANING ESSENTIALS  The future of smart homes is exciting \u2013 there will be around 31 billion devices connected to the internet by 2020, and that number is supposed to grow to 75.4 billion by 2025. Like automatic home cleaners, automatic mopping devices WHICH LEADS TO JOB LOSS IN CLEANING INDUSTRY. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3. ROBOTS IN MANUFACTURING  The loss of jobs with automation gets a lot of attention, as it should. At the same time, automation can enhance the jobs of factory workers by leaving the repetitive work for the robots, allowing humans to enjoy the benefits of consistently higher product quality and output. Moreover, 2 million manufacturing jobs will likely go unfilled due to a projected skills gap in the labor market. Robotics can help manufacturers fill those positions and keep the lights on for everyone. Furthermore, small hardware automation systems can aid in maintaining jobs in existing factories, as opposed to moving jobs offshore because of labor costs. LEADS TO JOB LOSS IN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 4. AI ( ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ) MOST IMPORTANT\u2026 7 ways AI can change the world for better ... or worse Artificial intelligence is impacting the future of virtually every industry and every human being. Artificial intelligence has acted as the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and IoT, and it will continue to act as a technological innovator for the foreseeable future. Employing machine learning and computer vision for detection and classification of various \u201csafety events,\u201d the shoebox-sized device doesn\u2019t see all, but it sees plenty. Like which way the driver is looking as he operates the vehicle, how fast he\u2019s driving, where he\u2019s driving, locations of the people around him and how other forklift operators are maneuvering their vehicles. IFM\u2019s software automatically detects safety violations (for example, cell phone use) and notifies warehouse managers so they can take immediate action. The main goals are to prevent accidents and increase efficiency. The mere knowledge that one of IFM\u2019s devices is watching, Gyongyosi claims, has had \u201ca huge effect.\u201d  Marc Gyongyosi | Photo Credit: IFM/OneTrack.AI  The lower level of IFM was designed to mimic a warehouse environment so products can be effectively tested on site. | Photo Credit: IFM/OneTrack.AI \u201cIf you think about a camera, it really is the richest sensor available to us today at a very interesting price point,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause of smartphones, camera and image sensors have become incredibly inexpensive, yet we capture a lot of information. From an image, we might be able to infer 25 signals today, but six months from now we\u2019ll be able to infer 100 or 150 signals from that same image. The only difference is the software that\u2019s looking at the image. And that\u2019s why this is so compelling, because we can offer a very important core feature set today, but then over time all our systems are learning from each other. Every customer is able to benefit from every other customer that we bring on board because our systems start to see and learn more processes and detect more things that are important and relevant.\u201d THE EVOLUTION OF AI IFM is just one of countless AI innovators in a field that\u2019s hotter than ever and getting more so all the time. Here\u2019s a good indicator: Of the 9,100 patents received by IBM inventors in 2018, 1,600 (or nearly 18 percent) were AI-related. Here\u2019s another: Tesla founder and tech titan Elon Musk recently donated $10 million to fund ongoing research at the non-profit research company OPEN AI \u2014 a mere drop in the proverbial bucket if his $1 billion co-pledge in 2015 is any indication. And in 2017, Russian president Vladimir Putin told school children that \u201cWhoever becomes the leader in this sphere [AI] will become the ruler of the world.\u201d He then tossed his head back and laughed maniacally. OK, that last thing is false. This, however, is not: After more than seven decades marked by hoopla and sporadic dormancy during a multi-wave evolutionary period that began with so-called \u201cknowledge engineering,\u201d progressed to model- and algorithm-based machine learning and is increasingly focused on perception, reasoning and generalization, AI has re-taken center stage as never before. And it won\u2019t cede the spotlight anytime soon.  Google CEO Sundar Pichai On Stage in 2018.

That\u2019s especially true in the past few years, as data collection and analysis has ramped up considerably thanks to robust IoT connectivity, the proliferation of connected devices and ever-speedier computer processing. \u2022\u2022 Some sectors are at the start of their AI journey, others are veteran travelers. Both have a long way to go. Regardless, the impact artificial intelligence is having on our present day lives is hard to ignore: Transportation: Although it could take a decade or more to perfect them, autonomous cars will one day ferry us from place to place.Manufacturing: AI powered robots work alongside humans to perform a limited range of tasks like assembly and stacking, and predictive analysis sensors keep equipment running smoothly.Healthcare: In the comparatively AI-nascent field of healthcare, diseases are more quickly and accurately diagnosed, drug discovery is sped up and streamlined, virtual nursing assistants monitor patients and big data analysis helps to create a more personalized patient experience.Education: Textbooks are digitized with the help of AI, early-stage virtual tutors assist human instructors and facial analysis gauges the emotions of students to help determine who\u2019s struggling or bored and better tailor the experience to their individual needs.Media: Journalism is harnessing AI, too, and will continue to benefit from it. Bloomberg uses Cyborg technology to help make quick sense of complex financial reports. The Associated Press employs the natural language abilities of Automated Insights to produce 3,700 earning reports stories per year \u2014 nearly four times more than in the recent past.Customer Service: Last but hardly least, Google is working on an AI assistant that can place human-like calls to make appointments at, say, your neighborhood hair salon. In addition to words, the system understands context and nuance.WHAT ELESE GONNA LEFT:-) lets cross your fingers that everything will be in human fever.

            "answer_text": "I think that robots will be able to perform any job in the future, but will people be willing to stop working at those jobs? People need a sense of purpose in life. They may find that in charitable work, religious beliefs, raising children, artistic or scientific endeavors, exploration, or other types of work. There are people who can find joy or meaning even in jobs that may seem to others undesirable. Take the Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle as an example (What is Fish! Philosophy and How It Can Change the Way You See Your Job | Success by LiveChat). Their fishmongers enjoy going into work and tossing fish around. They\u2019re not curing cancer, yet they\u2019re able to find pleasure in a job that perhaps you or I wouldn\u2019t. (You can learn more about Fish! Philosophy here: The FISH! Philosophy Story.) No, I don\u2019t think that robots will work instead of humans, even if robots are fully capable of doing so. I\u2019m sure humans will continue working, too. Would a musician stop playing music simply because a robot can do it, too? Would a scientist stop probing the secrets of the universe because an AI is also thinking about it? Would an athlete stop playing basketball or an engineer stop designing circuits? No. Most of these people don\u2019t consider what they are doing as \u201cwork\u201d. It is pleasure. It\u2019s enjoyable and gives their lives purpose. I think what will change are the economics of work. Instead of forcing yourself to go into a job that you don\u2019t like just for a paycheck, with the right systems in place, people will be able to do the work they find interesting or important. If we live for a hundred years, we will want to give that time some meaning. Sure, there may be robots also doing that work, but they will be working cooperatively with us simply because we won\u2019t give up those jobs! Robots will take on most, if not all, undesirable jobs, freeing people to \u201cwork\u201d at what they enjoy. If everyone is doing what the enjoy, they will naturally get better at it. Ultimately, I think this will improve the quality of the output of human work. ",
