It was announced in January 2019 that the Let it Be film was to be re-released at last, and that Peter Jackson would also be wading through the hours of footage available and creating a new alternative film too. As a project which has been promised and delayed for years and years I hope that this time it will be completed, that the four people who make the decisions agree, and that this time we will see the results!
