            "answer_text": "I think the only way to avoid having it dry up is to use it frequently. They are pretty much like regular inkjet printers in that sense. Ink tanks may be a bit less expensive than ink cartridge printers, but I will take a laser printer any day. I have never had toner \u201cgo bad\u201d on me. Other than very special high end art printers, and photo printing, I don\u2019t see why inkjet printers are in use AT ALL anymore. Producing the ink is a great money maker for the companies, but laser printing is cheaper in the long run for consumers. (I guess that is the real answer. Most people don\u2019t think more than 2 weeks out.) ",
