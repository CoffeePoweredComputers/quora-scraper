            "answer_text": "In order to 3D print shoes, you need a printer capable of three things: Printing flexible materials: Printing flexible materials is a little more difficult than the usual relatively rigid materials typically used (e.g. flex materials tend to get stuck in filament paths). Thus you need a print head that can deal with flexible materials.Large print volume: Ideally, since human feet can be up to 20 inches (50 cm) long, you need a printer that can do work over a large range.Prints dissolvable support material: A shoe has an inward structure that it would be very hard to remove conventional single material supports from. Thus you want dissolvable support materials if you are using a Fused Deposition Modeling approach. This usually involves dual extruders.These set of parameters are actually quite tough to find in a consumer level printer. The only one I know about that gets close is the gMax 1.5 XT+ (which has a huge build volume and a dual extruder option). Photos below. With a dual extruder, and heated bed, you\u2019re looking at about $3,500. The other alternative is to go to a commercial large volume Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) system, but we\u2019re starting to talk at least tens of thousands at that point.  And here\u2019s the dual head setup:  And to give you some idea of what the build volume can print \u2026  ",

Of course, you could make the various parts that make shoes all separately and then combine them yourself by stitching and glueing the parts together. But it would be far easier to just use simpler materials to do so, as it takes a lot of time for a shoe to be printed in 3D, even if you just print the parts\u2026 Making shoes isn\u2019t done by the printer anyways. It\u2019s done by the designer of the 3D model for the shoe. Someone has to design it and then the 3D printer can print it. It\u2019s like asking which printer can print a picture of a beautiful sunset. Almost all can, but you do need the digital file for the photo\u2026 ",
