            "answer_text": "I can only speak about postgraduate courses at Deakin University on a general basis. You need to realized the following if you want to study at a postgraduate level in Deakin There is no spoon-feeding in classes/seminars/lectures, so you cannot just be attending lectures to learn. Classes are no longer just \u201csit and listen\u201d, you are expected to contribute actively in the lessons.At postgraduate level, you are expected to do some of your own readings on the course material before coming in to class. This is because lectures and seminars (especially seminars) expect you to bring some ideas from your readings into the class for discussion. So come into class with an active mind and not an empty mind.Now just to clarify what I say in No.2, I am not implying that you should read or know everything before coming into class. But you need to at least have an idea of something that you can bring into discussion in the class.You also are expected to work with your colleagues in class and in certain assignments so having a language barrier in English is inexcusable.Expect some of your colleagues to already have their own families to take care. This can be common at postgraduate level where some students have actually worked for a long time before deciding to come back and study. So be understanding and not treat them as though they are typical full time students.The facilities, particularly the computers, are generally good but you need to aware of \u201cpeak times\u201d. The university is always expected to full of students from 11am to 2pm. So if you really need a computer, avoid the peak hours.I won\u2019t speak about the lecturers you may meet because there is a good chance half of them are not in Deakin on a permanent basis. However, the lecturers here are obligated to take some time to listen to your feedback on their lectures. Most lecturers often end the class 15 minutes early to allow you time to discuss with them on your progress in the course.You also need to able to take constructive criticism on your work and assignments from lecturers, especially if the marks and comments do not reflect what is in your mind. Remember, the lecturers\u2019 job here is also to identify things you need to improve on your work, not to talk down at your work.The university has internships available for every course. These internships are to only to be seen as typical work experience but also an opportunity for positive/constructive feedback on your work and conduct. So the key idea in doing these internships is to understand yourself and identify things you need to improve. The internships are usually not for recruitment so do not expect to get a job from there.",
