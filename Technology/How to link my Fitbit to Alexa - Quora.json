Before trying to link, you should check whether your fitbit is compatible with Alexa or not cus it will work or will be able to link only if it is compatible. Thw best way to check is to go to Amazon website and search your product, then look for anything written as Alexa compatible. Products that work with Alexa will always have it written Alexa compatible in the product detail page. ",
