            "answer_text": "Information technology (IT), as defined by the Information Technology Association of America (ITAA), is \"the study, design, development, implementation, support or management of computer-based information systems, particularly software applications and computer hardware.\" IT deals with the use of electronic computers and computer software to convert, store, protect, process, transmit and retrieve information, securely.   Recently it has become popular[citation needed] to broaden the term to explicitly include the field of electronic communication so that people tend to use the abbreviation ICT (Information and Communications Technology), it is common for this to be referred to as IT & T in the Australasia region, standing for Information Technology and Telecommunications.   Today, the term information technology has ballooned to encompass many aspects of computing and technology, and the term is more recognizable than ever before. The information technology umbrella can be quite large, covering many fields. IT professionals perform a variety of duties that range from installing applications to designing complex computer networks and information databases. A few of the duties that IT professionals perform may include data management, networking, engineering computer hardware, database and software design, as well as the management and administration of entire systems.
