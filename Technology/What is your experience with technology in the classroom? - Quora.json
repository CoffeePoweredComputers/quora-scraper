            "answer_text": "I find it frustrating. Now, I\u2019m not THAT old, but I did graduate college in the early \u201890\u2019s when the first school I was hired at still had a ditto machine  I then left a school district in 2000 and taught in a variety of settings that either included no technology or old technology like an overhead projector. I returned to a district last year\u2026only to discover that I was WAY behind the times. I was given a smartboard\u2026which I had no idea how to operate, and didn\u2019t work well (only about half the time), the school has Chromebooks and googleclassroom, which I did take a training over the summer for but I still find it daunting, so I rarely use them. Additionally, the ability of the students to get around the firewalls and hop onto youtube instead of doing work I find very off-putting. So, personally, I\u2019d rather use paper and pencils and save the computer for final drafts of written assignments. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology in the classroom can be a good thing unless used only for leisure. As long as you keep it strictly for educational purposes only, you won't get distracted by it. One way of doing that is through downloading educational apps that can help with your academics. The perfect app for this is called the DaVinci Club AR. This app guides the students in making observations and experiments in and outside of school by using their own senses and simple devices which allows them to explore while learning new things. This is how the app works:  This can be downloaded in any iOS devices and are perfect for children ages 5 years old and up. ",
