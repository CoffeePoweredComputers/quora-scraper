            "answer_text": "VDSL technology is very new to India and its only available / used by Airtel. Before getting a new connection under VDSL technology you need to understand what it is and how different it is from the others. It works like this. Service provider lay down a Fiber Optical Cable Network till a point (let's call this an exchange) from this point they lay down a copper cable till your premises and provide you with Landline and Broadband Services. This is called as FTT dp - Fiber To The distribution point. This is an economical solution to provide customers with high speed internet connection. But it has its own drawbacks. The main Drawback is where the Fiber Optical Cable ends. The distance between the Fiber Network and your modem should not be more than 800 meters. If the distance is higher then the speed drops. So take care of this. ",
