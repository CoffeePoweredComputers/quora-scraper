            "answer_text": "Reading that question, my immediate response was another question: Have I ever found myself on the second page of Google? And to be honest, I can\u2019t remember the last time I have\u2026 When I was in school, doing research for projects or in university writing reports and my thesis I probably did go through many pages of Google search/scholar but since then\u2026 I don\u2019t think I go further than the first page. This might actually be a sad thing as it means I am biased by through Google\u2019s algorithm and what they deem relevant\u2026 :/ So I guess my answer is yes and no. Generally, the first page of Google is enough for me. (But if and when using Google Scholar, you can find gems even a couple pages after the first.) ",
