            "answer_text": "In certain ways, technology most definitely has been able to mimic operations the brain autonomously performs daily in order to keep us alive.

Humans haven't completely understood the brain in its entirety yet, there are many more discoveries to be made about the pink matter in our heads. We have to fully encompass the capabilities of the brain before we can program an artificial super computer. ",
