            "answer_text": "The trend in libraries show that a library is an information center, especially in rural areas where people have limits to what types of information they can access. Sometimes, even newspapers do not deliver to rural communities. However, at the library, they will always have the local and at least one national newspaper. Libraries serve as a portal to information because not everyone has a computer and internet. At the library that I work at, which is at a 4-year university, we are part of a cohort called the Research Group. We have partnered with the writing center, the center for online learning, and IT department because our work is so intertwined. Students and the public that come into our library and have access to information of any kind. We are also a Federal Repository, where the university library houses various types of information published but the GPO or Government Publishing Office. Today\u2019s library is definitely far from the stereotype. Libraries are more than just a place to store books. Librarians strive to find out the needs of their user community and do what they can to meet those needs. ",

            "answer_text": "All libraries are information centers but not all information centers are libraries. By this, I mean that most libraries will be community places that provide free access to information for everyone. They are no longer just libraries of physical and digital material, but they provide access of all kinds to all kinds of information. Information centers not in the context of libraries could be a page on a business website that gives information about the company. Or it could be a help desk at an IT department. Or maybe it is the Information desk at a large mall or fair where you can get maps and directions. These types of information centers cannot also be called libraries. ",
