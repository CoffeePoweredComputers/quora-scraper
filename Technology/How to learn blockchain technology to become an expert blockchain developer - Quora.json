            "answer_text": "To become an expert blockchain developer, you must first determine which part of the blockchain you want to develop. The blockchain involves a lot of knowledge points, including cryptography, contracts, and traditional back-end, mobile, Web side, etc. To say that the core of the blockchain is still cryptography and contracts, nowadays hackers are generally staring at these parts. It is recommended that you first take a look at the ECC ellipse algorithm, which is the cornerstone of the current blockchain. From this entry, you can look at encryption and decryption, signature authorization, HDWallet and so on. Then look at the implementation of the contract, such as the ERC20 contract of ETH, the contract implementation of various games of EOS, many contracts have loopholes, you can learn the contract with the goal of finding loopholes, and you can legally receive rewards for finding loopholes, such as Slow Mist The company's contract audit will issue a reward for the task of finding vulnerabilities, and you can get the bounty if you find the vulnerabilities.
