            "answer_text": "I don't know that there are any specific preparations that are required before taking IT courses in college.  I would recommend that you stay up-to-date on all of the IT and security news that you can. Join blogs, be a member of Quora's Thinking Cybersecurity group (also Trending Cybersecurity). Also subscribe to Tripwire\u2019s \u201cState of Security, Tech Targert's \u201cComputer Weekly\u201d, Cybersecurity Insider and some of the threat feeds to keep up with all of the threats and vulnerabilities that are coming out. I would also recommend that you figure out what you want to do as a career path by looking at job boards. Then do everything that you need to do to get qualified for that job. You can also go to Free Cyber Security Training and Career Development at Cybrary(.)it and pick a career path to train for with free IT classes (if you are considering cybersecurity). This would get you a head start on many of your degree classes. However, don't think you won't need a degree after taking these classes. That degree along with certifications will be your competitive edge when you are trying to get hired. I do realize that my answer is heavily weighted toward IT security, but the same basic info relates to IT also. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "I started undergrad in 1998 and wasn\u2019t an information technology major (modern networking didn\u2019t exist), I actually majored in technical theater and management (double major). I had an information technology concentration when I went for my MBA (started in 1996) but didn\u2019t get involved with IT until I took an 11-day boot camp in Windows administration after I graduated. I would concentrate on college activities, SAT scores and obviously grades. It would definitely be beneficial to be familiar with Windows 10 and MacOS wouldn\u2019t hurt (I used both), get a basic understanding of HTML, SQL, Cyber-Security, and network design. There are plenty of free or low-cost sources. I have a friend taking Coursera | Online Courses & Credentials by Top Educators right now and he is enjoying it. I wish I had a better answer. Oh, being familiar with customer service helps, many people in IT lack it. I worked for Nordstrom in high school and Gap, Inc during college and undergrad. ",

            "answer_text": "I had this answer to a similar question: As I look back on my time studying for my IT degree I can identify 5 areas that created problems for me as a student. Cost: A college education is expensive and my fellow classmates where always concerned about the debt load their student loans were creating.Time Management: Taking college courses is academically challenging. Unlike most high schools, colleges often pack two years of content into one year. Many students take a full 15 credit semester, while others try to cram in up to 18 or even 21 credits. Always look at what you are signing up to take and plan how to complete the homework. Especially important when writing code for programing classes.Homesickness. My freshmen year I was 5 hours away from home. I missed my family tremendously. The home support network had kept me on track by reminding me of my class obligations. It was sorely missed.Relationships: There are times in every relationship when a couple will have a disagreement which can distract them from schoolwork and add to stress levels. They also require time when which leads back to #2. The break-up I had because of being in different Universities created a major distraction and depression.Diet: Eat healthy, balanced meals. Make time (See #2) to go grocery shopping. I had a small refrigerator in my dorm room. And get a good night's rest as well.",

            "answer_text": "I know this is a serious question, but there is no context for a response. What country do you live in? What country do you want to study in? What school do you want to go to? How old are you? What stage / grade are you in? Have you taken your country\u2019s college entrance exams? Contact the institutions you are interested in and ask them what additional preparation you should do. In the U.S., you usually have to successfully complete your first year before you declare a major. Entrance into a specific degree program is often competitive. ",
