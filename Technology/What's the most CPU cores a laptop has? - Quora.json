            "answer_text": " 12 cores and just 5.5kg. Eurocom\u2019s Panther 5SE laptop model.  If its just portability or if there is AC plug within reach,  FlexPAC 3 X500L3 can fit up to 24 cores. This is not a laptop but it lasts indefinitely since it requires AC connection where it expands. 12 core laptos can run 1 hour with 1 battery. Increasing core count to 24 and more would simply make it 30 minutes or less capable. So if you are going to carry more cores, why don\u2019t you carry this 30kg device and run as long as you want? With up to 7 pci-e bridges, it can be a personal portable super computer. ",
