            "answer_text": "I've been replying here at Quora that laptops can last a longer than you even want them. I have a 2013 ac Air, a year old Dell Alienware 13r, and four Chromebooks. I was give the \"demonstration\" CR48 Chromebook in 2011. It was for IT folks that handled lots of school or big groups of devices. I was amazed as a Macee since 1995 or something, with the Chromebook, so got the first 2011 Samsung Chromebook. All of these laptops are running great for me every day and evening. So I've been of the opinion that business turns over it's computers about every two years. So that their stuff can download and accept the latest special apps that they are using. Families have been keeping laptops for four years. June 29, 2019 my 20ll Samsung Chromebook reports that this devise can no longer be supported upgrades beyond it's current Version 75. Well this has been eight years of daily use for the first Samsung Chromebook. I think that is outstanding. I will continue to doodle along with my sweetheart Samsung until it completely drops dead. Of course 8 years plus is great. We do dump a devise that hardware completely fritzes out, whatever the age. But I'm reporting it's possible that Chromebooks and Macs can last you 8 years before no updates will be made available or the thing dies. :) What have others experienced? ",
