Really useful. Mostly, I keep screenshots of school work from online classes. I'm not a big fan of note taking and I'm not that great when it comes to writing fast. I store all of these screenshots in my phone/laptop and refer to them for further use. I store some art pictures from Deviant Art. They're a great community of people and since I'm a huge space geek, I save a bunch of potential backgrounds for my phone or y'know, just to scroll and take a look while I'm waiting for something. A few funny GiFs maybe. I don't keep photographs of myself since I'm not comfortable with seeing my own face sometimes lmao but since my phone is sort of permeable. It isn't administered but it is permeable so I try to keep pictures away. Even if I want to take pictures, my phone's camera is sort of crappy and the pictures aren't very decent. Mostly I store in schoolwork/projects because I'm a busy Bethany. ",
