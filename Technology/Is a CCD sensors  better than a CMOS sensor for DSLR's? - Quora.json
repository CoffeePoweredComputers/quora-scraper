            "answer_text": "If we talk about overall benefits then I would say like other Quorians have already said that most of the DSLR\u2019s that are available in the market are integrated with CMOS image sensors. In the battle of CCD vs CMOS, if one sensor wins over the other one for a particular factor then other one loses over some other factor. So in short, don\u2019t get into this war so much rather focus on the requirement fullfilment. Since every photographer in this world focus more on the served purpose rather than type of image sensor. Isn\u2019t it? So, regardless of the image sensor type, if the DSLR camera is fulfilling your expectations then all is good. ",

            "answer_text": "CCDs used to be better a decade ago. But now CMOS sensors have achieved/surpassed CCD perforamance at a lower cost, lower power and smaller chip size. CMOS sensors have integrated important principles of CCDs for performance improvement. So no new DSLR camera uses a CCD sensor in the present day. Just to give you an example, digital cameras used to make the movies use CMOS image sensors, one such digital camera which is most widely used in recent movies for film making: ARRI ALEXA. ",
