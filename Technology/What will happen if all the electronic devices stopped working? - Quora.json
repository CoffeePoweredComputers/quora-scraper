            "answer_text": "Not only would all personal devices be down (phones, computers, televisions, hearing aids, etc), most stores, gas stations, radio stations, security systems, banks, ATMs, smart-cars, planes, border offices, embassies, and all major transportation hubs would be out-of-service too. Which means no international travel or communications for a while, either until they fix the problem, or go back to the old way of doing things. I would miss my friends and family who live beyond a 10-mile radius of wherever I am at the moment. There would be no way for me to call or text immediately- I\u2019d have to locate them via old-fashioned telephone (most don\u2019t even own one anymore), or write letters (only if I already have their mailing address on file somewhere), and the snail mail would take weeks/ months to arrive. Postal service for the general population would probably also be out-of-service for a while, since most post offices now operate with computers and electronic cash registers. Plan of action: Assess my current position, immediate needs, accessible resources, and available land/ human networks. At the moment I\u2019m on the fourth floor of a building with two doors that have electronic card-readers, so the first thing I\u2019d have to do, is either break open the doors, or climb out the windows. I would hoard enough food and water (prioritize water) to last me a few days while I figure out where to go next. Well, if electronic media stopped working, there\u2019s no reason why the tap would go out, but, who knows! Society is going through a major upheaval, and people do crazy things when they\u2019re desperate. Are people looting the stores down the street yet? I\u2019d probably try to walk to my father\u2019s house to check on him- that\u2019s only 30 minutes away by train, but since subway trains are now out-of-service, and I dont have a bike, it would probably take about half a day to walk there. If the whole planet is in chaos, then there\u2019s no reason to try sailing off this island to go anywhere else (I\u2019m currently in Taiwan). So how long are the electronic devices gone for? Forever? Or is it a temporary stage? What is the reason for their malfunctioning? The laws of electricity are a part of universal nature, so what the hell happened? Do light bulbs still work??? I assume they do, because you said \u201cmodern\u201d electronic media only- not basic electric tools. That means power tools and most gas-powered cars are still in service. But anyways, if we\u2019re in for the long haul, like if they\u2019re never coming back ever, then the best thing to do is probably to return our focus to localized agricultural/ pastoral-based societal structures until we figure out alternative forms of high-speed communications for the future. Farming families would gain higher positions in society, as they now need to train more people how to cultivate self-sufficient lifestyles, and/or how to recalculate food distribution, to deal with lack of import/ exported goods.* Since I\u2019m in currently in a country where I dont have citizenship, I\u2019d also have to see if they\u2019re planning on deporting, detaining, naturalizing me, or something else completely. Whereas I\u2019d probably have a better chance at survival if I were stuck near my hometown, here I\u2019m at a loss where it comes to negotiating or asserting myself in the local language. The smart thing to do is probably to start identifying the leaders of the communities I'm directly interfacing with, then offer my labor and social capital to the one(s) who can provide me with the best (or at least reasonable) short-term security, according to my needs. In the meantime I would work on improving my language skills and observe how the systems keep shifting, while staying prepared for the possibility of moving on again at any moment\u2026 like, you know, if all modern electronic media suddenly started working again, for no particular reason. *Rice, knife, matches, chickens, fruit trees, vegetables, goats and sheep. Those are the things on my wish list for the coming apocalypse (in that order). ",

            "answer_text": "I'm assuming that \u201celectronic things\" means all electronic components (capacitors, resistors, inductors, semiconductors etc.) cease to function, leaving only mechanical devices and systems in operation. Where to start? Transportation and related support systems (cars, buses, trucks, tractors, trains, aircraft, ships, elevators, traffic control and navigation systems, etc.) would stop functioning. Communication systems (telephones, internet, satellites, television, radio, etc.) would stop functioning. Infrastructure and related support systems (power generation and transmission systems, oil refineries/pipelines, air conditioning, sewage treatment, etc.) would stop functioning. As a result of these and other cascading losses, banking, commerce, industry, employment, and civil society would collapse. Imagine a world similar to that portrayed in \u201cThe Walking Dead\", but without vehicles or zombies, and where limited resources compel people to survive through cooperation in small groups, or through brutality, until we can re-establish ourselves as an agricultural society \u2014 a necessity to feed survivors of what had been a 7.6 billion world population. Infant mortality, injury, disease, and starvation would have prevented the world\u2019s population from ever having reached this number without electronics. If we include the electro-magnetic mechanical relay in the list of electronic devices, we began our dependance on electronics 283 years ago when the world\u2019s population was approximately 1 billion, and the average life expectancy was 37 years of age.

            "answer_text": "Disaster is putting it mildly. Very few humans would survive. And the bad part is that such an event is very probable. An EMP (electromagnetic pulse) from the Sun could burn all electronic devices on more than half of the planet. And if we are very unlucky, could be ALL the planet. Now try to imagine the scenario. You wake up, or you are already at work. Your phone (and everyone else's) is dead. You want to plug it in to charge, thinking it is the battery. Then you notice that there is no electrical power. At all. And not only in your building, but nowhere within a few blocks. You think about going home. Then your car doesn't start. Because it uses electronic devices. All cars that were moving when this happened are crashed into each other. Airplanes that were in the air are at high risk of crashing without all the electronics on-board. Ships at sea would be unable to navigate. All satellites would be useless (and some of them could fall). You would be unable to buy anything (ATMs and POSes won't work). Even worse, your bank records could be gone, so you would have no money at all. Etc\u2026 imagine the worst apocaliptic scenario from movies and multiply it by at least 10. ",

            "answer_text": "It could happen more as a work of fiction than reality UNLESS there was an EMP event. So, let\u2019s assume that an EMP event has caused all running electronics and most electrical devices with electronic controls to cease to work. EMP events are not self-perpetuating and they do not last more than a few moments at best, other than a solar event which could go on for an extended period but here again \u201cextended\u201d in comparison to the usual \u201cshort burst of electromagnetic energy\u201d. Its short duration means that it will be spread over a range of frequencies and damages are generally restricted to \u201csusceptible electronic hardware\u201d. The point of this brief explanation is that elementary electric devices (plug into work or with a simple on/off switch and unplugged devices) will not be affected by the EMP. That means that once the event is over AND electrical systems that were damaged have been replaced and electric current restored your vacuum, extension cords, unplugged simple electric devices will have all survived. The refrigerator, freezer, fully charged cordless equipment may or may not be harmed depending upon electronic complexity and again, susceptibility. Your car will probably need to be repaired electrically and your cellphone will be toast for the most part. The point is that once electricity is restored you will be able to use \u201cnew\u201d electronic devices again until the next EMP event. How long will repairs to the electrical infrastructure take in the U.S.? We are so dependent upon our devices and gadgets at the personal level not to mention our government that it COULD take 6\u201312 months to even begin to recover at the local level. Food, water and heat would become items of personal focus rather than flipping a switch and expecting dinner to come from the microwave. It would be a daunting time to exist and a great many of us would not make it but the good news is that it would be years before a total accounting of lives lost would ever be known. Imagine how vulnerable a country such as ours would be to invasion IF such a man-made event were to occur. ",

A visiting couple, my wife and I lit my grandparent's oil lamps that we keep on a shelf. It was a cool evening but nothing the wood fired potbelly stove count not handle. With the wifi, internet and TV out, we played a card game and then went to bed (using a bucket of lake water to flush the toilets). In the morning, the power was still out, but we were able to make scrambled eggs and bacon on the propane fired grill. (OK, I did use the piezoelectric ignition, but you said \u201celectronic things\u201d - and a kitchen match could have done the same thing.) As we planned to return from the cottage after breakfast, we just checked things, and closed up. So \u201cwhat will happen\u201d? Life will revert to using the simpler technologies of our grandparents. ",

As our civilization for the last hundred years has been built up and around layers of technology that require electronics (think of trucks, trains, food refrigeration etc..) , its instant shutdown would collapse the basics. The infrastructure supporting food and sustainable shelter in urban areas would collapse resulting in riots of unimaginable proportions. Millions would die within a few months from lack of potable water, starvation and disease. The survivors would likely band together in roaming herds trying to find survival resources. Government authority would eventually collapse. Eventually life would become as it was in the 1800\u2019s. More rural farmlands, communities becoming smaller and more centered around the basics such land that can provide available water, farm land, and livestock support. What form of government would rise out of this is anyone\u2019s guess. Needless to say, we wouldn\u2019t be writing about this in a Quora forum!! ",
