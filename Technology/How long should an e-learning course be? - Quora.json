            "answer_text": "There is no a rule of thumb, it largely depends on what you want to learn and what learning methods suits you best. But a bite-size learning has been an online learning trend for quite some time. This means that online video classes are getting shorter and shorter in order to keep students engaged and cater to their attention or concentration span. What\u2019s good about bite-size learning? The average video class is around 15-30 minutes, which allows teachers to make short videos covering small topics in depth (breaking down the topics into sections as much as possible) and allow students to focus on and process one topic at a time. This does not mean that classes above this time are not good. For some practical classes such as sewing or digital illustration, it can be difficult to fit all of the processes and techniques into one video. However, shorter courses and classes are gaining a momentum nowadays. ",
