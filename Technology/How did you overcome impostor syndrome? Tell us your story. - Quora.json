            "answer_text": "Given the syndrome is about disbelieving ones success is attributable to their own efforts and not luck then the \u2018therapy\u2019 needs to be about showing \u2018in time\u2019 evidence of their efforts. When I suffer this, and it often comes as self-doubt following coaching assignments with top managers/leaders that have had high impact, I use writing therapy; ie writing down the interventions and learning, so I can see where my efforts had an impact and it was not just luck or coincidence. I do a timeline of highs and lows, pinpointing across the timeline where positive impact occurred. There\u2019s a view that women suffer this more. I'm not sure, I just think they are more honest about it. They are better socialised to express their feelings and thoughts. This is a personal not empirical view. ",

Also, in order to learn effectively, it is imperative to focus on progress versus current status. When I was learning software engineering I realized that .002% of the world are professional software engineers. There are 7.4 billion people in this world. It helped me to recognize that! The world is huge and we are only used to seeing a small chunk. ",
