            "answer_text": "Coins and rocks are relatively cheap to collect. It just depends on how you get them. Coins can be found around you. They only get expensive when you decide to buy that rare coin at a collectors show (I have a coin that is worth at least $25). If you decide to buy the uncirculated coins, that is also expensive. I was paying a dollar for a quarter that I didn\u2019t have yet or $2 for a dollar coin that was only released as uncirculated. Rocks can also be found around you. Just look at the ground and find interesting rocks. This habit becomes expensive when you want to mine your own, find rarer pieces, polished pieces or massive pieces. A 3\u2032 tall amethyst can cost $200-$500 depending on size and quality. It all depends on what interests you. My beanie baby collection started because I could find them at garage sales for 25 cents. My coin collection started because I found foreign coins in the Coinstar. It all depends. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many cheap things you could collect, basically just find something cheap that you really, really like and collect it! Souvenir type things from as many places as possible is a popular, cheap collection. People even ask their friends and family to send them a (whatever they collect, say a spoon or shot glass) from their travels and major events. Decorative items such as animal figurines. People collect based on different standards, like one of every color, every size, type, maker, material made from (glass, ceramic, paper machete, clay, etc). There is no end to the standards you could use. Practical things like salt & pepper shakers, teapots, sugar dishes, cream pitchers, clocks, lamps, you name it. Personal items of all sorts. Jewelry, watches, combs, razors, shoes, handbags, again just about anything. Most collections can be done pretty cheap or very expensive. It\u2019s up to the collector. ",
