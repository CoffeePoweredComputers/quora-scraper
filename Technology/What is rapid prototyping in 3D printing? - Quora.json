            "answer_text": "Well, 3D printing as we know it now IS in fact, rapid prototyping. It used to be that the sorts of things we make with 3D printers would have to be sculpted, and then a mold made before there was anything that could be handled and examined. Or a machinist would fabricate a one-off widget from drawings. This was a laborious skilled task. It took a long time. Now, a new design can be cobbled together in a few hours in a 3D modeling or design program and printed out in a few hours or days rather than weeks. ",

            "answer_text": "3D printing belongs to rapid prototyping, 3Dprinting includes FDM, SLS printing, SLA printing. there are also other method to achieve rapid protoyping requirement, such as urethane casting, CNC machining, they are different in cost, time, depends on your project. ",
