The ZUK Z2 PLUS comes with a topline Snapdragon 820 chipset, that blows every chipset in the budget range. But this phone is just for users who want just raw power (great for gaming too). The lenovo K8 comes into play when it comes too the best ever budget phone in the 10K price tag. It has got a dual 13MP+5MP setup, with a wide f/1.7 lens, Depth Sense is also available, 1080p, and a 13MP f/2.0 1/3\u2033 front camera with a LED flash and 1080p support. Power wise, it comes with a Helio X23 DECACORE chipset ( two quad cores of 1.4GHz Cortex A53 and 2.0Ghz Cortex A53 and a dual core 2.3Ghz of Cortex A72 cores, all of which can run simultaneously and you can get incredible multicore performance more than the Snap 820 and offcourse better than Snap 636 in the note pro. It also has quad core MALI T880 MP4 at 700Mhz that can run 1080p screens better. It has 4100mah battery for all day powerup. ",
