            "answer_text": "It has been assumed that once the Supreme Court issues a decision, the other courts in this country are bound to follow the decision for all future cases that fall within the announced rule. However, it can be argued that in most circumstances, neither the Constitution nor federal law requires other courts to follow the Supreme Court. Indeed, it has been the Supreme Court itself that has demanded that their decision be binding on future cases. This seems to be the type of usurpation of power is the type our Founders detested and the Constitution was meant to prohibit. The traditional view has held that once the Supreme Court makes a decision, that decision becomes the law of the land and cannot be overturned, except through an act of Congress or constitutional amendment. Until Congress acts, lower courts are believed to lack the authority to rule counter to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. This can lead to poor decisions remaining the judicial law until either the Supreme Court or Congress overrules the decision. This happened in Plessy v. Ferguson, where the Supreme Court ruled \u201cseparate but equal\u201d laws were constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. This decision remained the law of the land for nearly 60 years before the Court ruled against \u201cseparate but equal\u201d in Brown v. Board of Education. This mindset can also lead to the waiting game we have seen surrounding ObamaCare since the Court\u2019s decision in NFIB v. Sebelius. Since that decision, upholding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we have seen plenty of activity trying to get the Court to overrule themselves and declare ObamaCare unconstitutional. However, we have seen little action from Congress or the lower courts on overturning ObamaCare. It is as if people are waiting, and hoping, the Supreme Court will do the dirty work themselves and overturn their previous decision. However, there is another way of looking at the judiciary\u2019s role in deciding constitutional matters. This view holds that the Constitution does not require that lower federal courts follow past Supreme Court decisions in future cases. The use of the term \u201cinferior\u201d in Article III implies these courts are somehow smaller, either in the types of cases they can hear or the area they have jurisdiction over. The term \u201cinferior\u201d also means the courts can be overruled on appeal; however, it does not mean the courts must be subservient or deferential to the Supreme Court. This view further holds that the judicial power is the power to decide individual cases and controversies, not future cases. Article III grants this power to decide cases and controversies to the Supreme Court, but it does not grant the Court the power to determine the outcome of future cases. However, federal lower courts should be required to follow Supreme Court decisions in particular cases when they are issued the cases on remand. There must be a final decision in every case, and when a case is in the federal court system the Supreme Court has final decision making authority. Article III vests the judicial power in the Supreme Court and does not require any other federal courts. Therefore, the Supreme Court must have the power to have their decisions followed in each specific case. Courts should be permitted, but not required, to follow Supreme Court decisions. This fits with the Constitution\u2019s structural principle of dividing power and preventing the centralization of power. It also helps ensure federal law remains the supreme law of the land by preventing the Supreme Court from equating itself with the law, and thus becoming a law unto itself. It is better to reach the right conclusion as to law, rather than follow previous decisions, even if it means there may be some discrepancies between the circuits. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, not the Supreme Court, because of this judges take an oath and are bound to the Constitution, not the Supreme Court. ",

            "answer_text": "No, or Presidents would have already done it! The American system is set up as \u201cchecks and balances\u201d and broken into three branches of government. Legislative, Executive, and Jydicial. If the Supreme Court rules a law passed by Congress and signed by the President is unconstitutional, then the only way around that is to pass a Constitutional Amendment There\u2019s only been 27 Amebdments passed in the coubtry\u2019s history, and for good reason. For an Amendmejt to the Constitution to pass it has to pass Congress but also be ratified by a two-thirds majority of the states. That\u2019s virtualky impossible to obtain because of the strong political differences of the states. The Equal Rughts Amendnent which would give women the same rights as men failed every year for two decades to get the majority needed on an issue most people would think would pass easily. The Legislature can also change the way a bill is written to pass the law that the Supreme Court has shot down. In other words, it may just be one part of the law that the court has an issue with, so they just remove that portion and the remainder of the law is usually fine. So, regally only Congress has a way to make changes to get past a Supreme Court ruling, the President doesn\u2019t have that kind of power, other than signing the bill into law. However, one thing to keep in mind is no matter how people present it, the Supreme Court is as political as the other two branches even though that was not the intention of the founding fathers. It\u2019s why each party is desperate to be the ones to fill a vacancy because they know those positions will in most cases follow their political ideology. Where the way it is supposed to be, the Supreme Court is only supposed to interpret the law the way they believe it was written, not the way they believe it should be. Ubfirtunstejy, that\u2019s not the case very often if it\u2019s a hot button political issue. ",

            "answer_text": "It happened at least once. In 1832 president Andrew Jackson refused to obey the Supreme Court ruling in Worcester v. Georgia. Jackson famously said, \u201dJohn Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\u201d Those were very shaky times for the Supreme Court. It was not even clear that it had the authority to review the constitutionality of federal and state laws. All that any court can do, then as now, is to render decisions and issue orders. The courts themselves do not have any means of enforcing their judgments. For this they must rely on the executive branch of government. If the executive branch refuses to enforce a court order or judgment the court is powerless to do anything about it. This is where both Congress and public opinion play a very significant role. Congress can exert a great deal of direct pressure on the president to compel him to obey the court\u2019s judgment. President Nixon had been ordered to surrender White House tapes to the special prosecutor. He had failed to comply within a reasonable period of time, in this case just hours. Congressional leaders met with the president and threatened to impeach him if failed to surrender the tapes immediately. The tapes were promptly surrendered. The only other recourse to compel compliance would be a groundswell of public pressure on both the president and the Congress, demanding that Congress impeach the president if he should fail to comply with the order. Courts today are on much firmer ground than two hundred years ago. Their orders and judgements today carry more weight and prestige than in Chief Justice Marshall's day. The fact that they do is in no small part attributable to his legal and political genius. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there OP, Certainly he can, he/she is free to act and take responsibility for his/her actions. As a result of overriding a Supreme Court decision he/she would either be impeached, tried and removed from office, or taken kindly and gently to Walter Reed Hospital because he, or she\u2019d have had a breakdown. Then the 25th Amendment[1] would come into play and the Vice President would take over until the President is able to resume his/her duties. Edit: (Bob Trammell reminded me that I forgot to mention a key point.) If Congress agrees with the President\u2019s action, there will be no impeachment and the court will be overridden. That is checks and balances in action. Of course, there is another issue to have to overcome, and that is finding someone to obey his/her orders to disregard a Supreme Court, or any Federal Court ruling for that matter. The Constitution is rooted in the Separation of powers that strikes a balance. The Executive cannot Constitutionally override the Judicial.[2] Ciao.

First , the justices have lifetime appointments and their decisions can affect future generations. There are three co-equal branches of government in the united states. The president cannot reverse a supreme court decision. On the contrary, a law enacted by the supreme court can be challenged in the future by either political party depending on the direction of the court ( liberal judges VS conservative judges). To my narrow understanding, the supreme court is a political institution, because the justices are appointed by either a Republican president or by Democratic president. At this present moment, in 2020, president Trump and the Republicans are trying to dismantle, step-by-step, all the 15 provisions of the Affordable care act, enacted by the supreme court, through a series of lawsuits. Since the court, now, is leaning towards the right, the nine justices will decide the faith of The Affordable care act. ",
