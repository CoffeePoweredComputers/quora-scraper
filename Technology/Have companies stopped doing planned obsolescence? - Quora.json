            "answer_text": "To be blunt - HELL NO! Companies are just better at disguising it. Apple makes phones that can\u2019t have replacement batteries. No one gets real lifetime warranties, most are limited to 2\u20133 years and they still want you to buy added protection policies. This is an example of something that Sears used to do. They put a lifetime warranty on their plastic trash cans. If it failed an any time for any reason that wasn\u2019t intentional damage, they would replace it regardless of how long you had the item. I bought one and two years later the handle broke and the side split. So I went to my Sears to get a replacement. I was told, we do not sell that anymore. So I asked for a refund or the new replacement model. (mind you this was just about a $18 garbage can). I pointed to the label that said lifetime warranty, and they said we don\u2019t sell that anymore so we do not honor that warranty. I asked to see the manager, and got the same story. So I asked to see the general manager of the store and was told I could see his assistant. The assistant said she would talk with the manager and get back to me. They did not get back to me. So I reported the whole thing with documentation and photos to the better business bureau. They did nothing. I promptly cancelled my Sears charge card, and my corporate account, cut up the cards and some documents and sent it to the general manager and some corporate so and so. I got a phone call 2 weeks later and the caller said they were sorry and they were sending me a gift certificate for $15 (not $18.) No wonder they went out of business! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Darren Great question for the times \u2026.        There\u2019s more to this article, if you want to read that please search the website. I remember the family getting a Sears heavy duty washing machine about 1973. About 1987 it was still in the family working. At about that time it did have a part went out and that was something like a nylon reciprocating glide that was about a four dollar item at a parts house that I installed myself. On into the year 2000 and beyond I\u2019ve replaced a toaster oven nearly every year or two or three years with more expensive models. sometimes the microwaves last a lot longer. A logic behind this is third-quarter earnings for shareholders and a silly conspiracy to get all of the minerals out of the earth for the aliens. There is a trend toward better quality and paying a little more money yet if something lasts twice as long and cost even 50% more it is a good deal. Less in the landfill is better for everyone all the way around! Mark ",

            "answer_text": "Because of the pace of technology products often obsolete themselves. As soon as your refrigerator pays for itself in electricity savings it seems like there is another refrigerator that\u2019s much cheaper to run. I don\u2019t believe companies plan obsolescence any longer, but they do look at cost/quality trade offs and lean hard into making things cheaper. ",
