            "answer_text": "Last year I moved to a stone throw away from a country park that has some 20,000 trees as well as Go Ape. Im not certain what inspired me to begin tree climbing. Whether it was memories of my youth but I began circumnavigating the park several times to see how many different types of trees were more suitable and safer to climb. Surprisingly the more obvious ones; trees with low branches were not necessarily the safest to climb. As the days went past and I began experimenting looking at the type of bark on the trunks and branches looking out for mistletoes and anything that could put harm in my way the tree I fell in love with was the Plane London. I found a tree that I could climb about 50 feet up although it took me a couple of times to build the confidence. While walking through various paths throughout the park I have discovered upwards of may be a total of a hundred trees that would excite me to climb. For me I only want to climb a tree that provides me with a \u201csafe\u201d challenge. I say safe but in essence I am also risking very serious injury and possible death if I fall. However, Iv\u2019e become like the free climber who prefers the feel of the rock and without safety equipment for his climb. I can understand this too in so much that one day I had a slight fright. The day was very sunny and I had been pushing myself every hard on other trees I climb. I don\u2019t just climb trees to see how high I can climb. More about this later. Getting down from high on a tree is invariably more of a challenge than climbing. With climbing down there appear to be more blind spots. But I am learning too how to climb trees safely or rather to lessen the chance of falling or slipping. Will get more onto this a bit later too. On the occasion I had exercised hard I was up the tree at 1pm not the safest time in the heat of the sun and I felt a bit of sunstroke. I realised if I did not get down I might become disorientated and this is when panic could easily set in; was almost on the verge of it. Fortunately this time luck was on my side. However the following day I decided to climb the same tree to as high as I could possibly go. This time I took with me a 16 foot strap and tied it around my shoulder and waist in case of emergency. When the same symptoms began as the day before I tied one end to a large branch below just in case I slipped. The bottom line is I felt more unsafe using the strap as it was getting in the way of my focus. I ditched the strap and climbed down safely. Now don\u2019t get me wrong every time I climb high up a tree Im focused on my safety. That goes without saying. I am also getting used to the type of branches that are more likely to support my weight either I am standing on or are hanging from. There are also other types of branches that look as though they could never support my weight; because their circumference is so little. But I have learned that certain types of trees, branches have much resilience and can easily flex but at the same time offer safe support. Another thing I am doing that has more to do with body weight exercises; calisthenics, a type of exercise I learned three years ago now helps me with my tree climbing. Because I have developed a pretty strong core, have good grip with my thighs as well as other body parts. All my body weight may not be at any one time on a branch. For example I could be standing on a branch with one hand holding onto a branch and the other onto another branch while my torso is gripped around the trunk or another branch. Since I can often remain for upwards of a few tens of seconds in this position I can begin to examine the best and safest descent. However, climbing up to the top of any tree is not about climbing to the actual highest point; that could be pretty dangerous. Last week I was on the top of a tree where I lost my balance. Now you might be shocked. But don\u2019t be. It was a different type of tree with a lot of foliage. Although I fell backwards and landed upside down six feet below I felt perfectly safe as there was much support from multiple branches all that were resilient to flexing and supporting my weight. However, on the very high trees there is not this type of safety support. So its all about building up resilience to fear and confidence. But as I began repetitively climbing trees I began getting to know which were more safer to climb than others. I also have other safety protocols in place. I try not to climb trees where there is a bush or brambles directly below me or above a fence or wall. I have more chance to survive a fall when there is nothing in my way to bounce off or fall through; admittedly I haven\u2019t encountered this type of bad luck yet and I hope this never occurs. The last thing I need is to slip and fall and hit sharp points that could do me more harm than good. I have just commented on my tree climbing habits. You can see the type of trees I climb by visiting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9UkRJ-7C7c&t=13s This is the tree I fell six feet from and what you will see is me singing a song I recently composed called, \u201ckeep this body moving\u201d. It was while I was singing that I fell. But then Im here to tell the tale. Since I have digressed slightly I want to get back to telling you how you can use trees to exercise on. If you visit my youtube channel at The Tree Climber at Fit For Over 60. Here you will be able to see how I make use of trees as my premier fitness equipment. Of my latest exercises I am demonstrating the use of an aerial hoop hanging from a branch that can support my weight is no difference from a swing I might have hung from a rope hanging from a branch. But the exercises you can build on the lower branches I will be able to show you how to build upper or whole body strength.  However, where using trees to exercise on really counts and where you can challenge yourself with a variety of bodyweight exercises are on a tree\u2019s lower branches. There are other advantages of working out in nature. Amongst the healthiest that comes to mind is freshest of air so very beneficial for your lungs. The other very healthy point is not having anyone around you to spread any of their germs. Especially with the coronavirus now is the time to get into the habit of working out on trees. I will also carry with me a bottle of liquid chalk that I use not only to help with my grip but also as it contains alcohol may be beneficial in keeping viruses at bay. You can also find me on Instagram where you can see all the exercises I do. I am also creating a website dedicated to my treeclimbing experiences and as soon as it is up and running will post here.
