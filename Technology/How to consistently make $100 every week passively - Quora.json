            "answer_text": "Passive income from the stock market is typically the result of dividends. Dividends are usually paid quarterly. The S&P 500 is currently paying about a 2.10%. There are companies that have been paying an ever-increasing dividend yielding much more. For instance, Coca-cola, Pepsi, and Johnson & Johnson, have been paying out dividends which have been increasing for well over 25 consecutive years each. J&J has been paying an increasing yield for 53 straight years. These three stocks are all yielding around 3% each. If you wanted $100 each month, which would be $1,200 a year, you would need a sizable portfolio. Accepting the yield of 2.10% from the S&P 500 would mean that you would need a portfolio of more than $57,000. If you were willing to invest your money in individual stocks yielding 3%, you would only need $40,000. In order to amass that much money, you would have to save and set aside some cash. If you could save $100 a month, you could reach $40,000, in 40 months (a little over 3 years). Obviously, if you could save $200 each month, you could get there in half the time, etc. Alternatively, if you wanted to avoid investing in individual stocks and simply invest in an S&P 500 index fund, you might need about $57,000, so you either need to save more money or allow additional time to reach your goal. One caveat, the yields will vary based upon the prices of the stocks and the amount that they pay in dividends. In other words, the yields today will vary tomorrow; they may be higher or lower. Unless you are willing to spend time and energy focused on monitoring your individual, I might suggest sticking with the index fund. Perhaps there are other ways to obtain $100 each month passively, but I am now aware of any that are obtained as easily as this. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "The only way you can achieve this passively is by having something of worth working on your behalf. Therefore unless you have an asset of some sort that people will pay you to have the use of; ie. Money, property, plant machinery, etc.., then you will probably have to do a little work. The only things I can think of online are either buying/selling on Ebay type sites or perhaps something where you get paid per click, but this is not passive. I am sure there are other ways online, but I am not aware of any of them. Being honest, I would be more inclined to take another job (job market permitting); get out and meet people as that would solve the money issue and actually put you in a new place that could perhaps lead to new opportunities.  Of course, the ultimate reality could just be that you need to be realistic and change jobs altogether. ",
