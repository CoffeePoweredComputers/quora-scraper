            "answer_text": "AI and the human brain operate so differently that it is almost pointless to compare them. For example, to train a neural network to tell if a photo is a cat or a dog it will need to have thousands of photos fed through it. But a child knows the difference with only a few hundred (or even less) exemplars. Humans are very good at holding on to ideas that are in direct conflict. Algorithms not so much. AI can\u2019t tell the difference between true and false data without being explicitly trained on that data class. And even then it is only partitioning the data, not thinking about truth. A neural network can be trained on data that humans can\u2019t even \u201cload\u201d into their brains. No human can process a list of millions of items, especially when the variables are abstractions. Deep Learning does this all the time. Will AI ever surpass humans across all problem domains? I suspect that we will be getting close to that point when AI starts to exhibit the machine version of mental illness. I say this un-ironically. AI that has the complexity and richness of human experience will almost certainly have fluctuating \u201cmental states\u201d, some that are substantially less functional than others. So to answer your question - yes or no depends entirely on the task at hand. ",
