            "answer_text": "Approximately 1.1 billion years from now, the sun will be 10 percent brighter than it is today. This increase in luminosity will also mean an increase in heat energy, one which the Earth's atmosphere will absorb. This will trigger a runaway greenhouse effect that is similar to what turned Venus into the terrible hothouse it is today. In 3.5 billion years, the sun will be 40 percent brighter than it is right now, which will cause the oceans to boil, the ice caps to permanently melt, and all water vapor in the atmosphere to be lost to space. Under these conditions, life as we know it will be unable to survive anywhere on the surface, and planet Earth will be fully transformed into another hot, dry world, just like Venus. Red Giant Phase: In 5.4 billion years from now, the sun will enter what is known as the red giant phase of its evolution. This will begin once all hydrogen is exhausted in the core and the inert helium ash that has built up there becomes unstable and collapses under its own weight. This will cause the core to heat up and get denser, causing the sun to grow in size. It is calculated that the expanding sun will grow large enough to encompass the orbit's of Mercury, Venus, and maybe even Earth. Even if the Earth were to survive being consumed, its new proximity to the the intense heat of this red sun would scorch our planet and make it completely impossible for life to survive. However, astronomers have noted that as the sun expands, the orbit of the planet's is likely to change as well. When the sun reaches this late stage in its stellar evolution , it will lose a tremendous amount of mass through powerful stellar winds. Basically, as it grows, it loses mass, causing the planets to spiral outwards. So the question is, will the expanding sun overtake the planets spiraling outwards, or will Earth (and maybe even Venus) escape its grasp? K.-P Schroder and Robert Cannon Smith are two researchers who have addressed this very question. In a research paper entitled \"Distant Future of the sun and Earth Revisted\" which appeared in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, they ran the calculations with the most current models of stellar evolution. According to Schroder and Smith, when the sun becomes a red giant star in 7.59 billion years, it will start to lose mass quickly. By the time it reaches its largest radius, 256 times its current size, it will be down to only 67 percent of its current mass. When the sun does begin to expand, it will do so quickly, sweeping through the inner solar system in just 5 million years. It will then enter its relatively brief (130 million year) helium-burning phase, at which point, it will expand past the orbit of Mercury, and then Venus. By the time it approaches the Earth, it will be losing 4.9 x 1020 tonnes of mass every year (8 percent the mass of the Earth). But Will Earth Survive? Now this is where things become a bit of a \"good news/bad news\" situation. The bad news, according to Schroder and Smith, is that the Earth will NOT survive the sun's expansion. Even though the Earth could expand to an orbit 50 percent more distant than where it is today (1.5 AUs), it won't get the chance. The expanding sun will engulf the Earth just before it reaches the tip of the red giant phase, and the sun would still have another 0.25 AU and 500,000 years to grow. Once inside the sun's atmosphere, the Earth will collide with particles of gas. Its orbit will decay, and it will spiral inward. If the Earth were just a little further from the sun right now, at 1.15 AU, it would be able to survive the expansion phase. If we could push our planet out to this distance, we'd also be in business. However, such talk is entirely speculative and in the realm of science fiction at the moment. And now for the good news. Long before our sun enters it's red giant phase, its habitable zone (as we know it) will be gone. Astronomers estimate that this zone will expand past the Earth's orbit in about a billion years. The heating sun will evaporate the Earth's oceans away, and then solar radiation will blast away the hydrogen from the water. The Earth will never have oceans again, and it will eventually become molten. Yeah, that's the good news\u2026 sort of. But the upside to this is that we can say with confidence that humanity will be compelled to leave the nest long before it is engulfed by the sun. And given the fact that we are dealing with timelines that are far beyond anything we can truly deal with, we can't even be sure that some other cataclysmic event won't claim us sooner, or that we wont have moved far past our current evolutionary phase. An interesting side benefit will be how the changing boundaries of our sun's habitable zone will change the solar system as well. While Earth, at a mere 1.5 AUs, will no longer be within the sun's habitable zone, much of the outer solar system will be. This new habitable zone will stretch from 49.4 AU to 71.4 AU \u2013 well into the Kuiper Belt \u2013 which means the formerly icy worlds will melt, and liquid water will be present beyond the orbit of Pluto. Perhaps Eris will be our new homeworld, the dwarf planet of Pluto will be the new Venus, and Haumeau, Makemake, and the rest will be the outer \"solar system\". But what is perhaps most fascinating about all of this is how humans are even tempted to ask \"will it still be here in the future\" in the first place, especially when that future is billions of years from now. Somehow, the subjects of what came before us, and what will be here when we're gone, continue to fascinate us. And when dealing with things like our sun, the Earth, and the known Universe, it becomes downright necessary. Our existence thus far has been a flash in the pan compared to the cosmos, and how long we will endure remains an open question. ",

            "answer_text": "The earth should survive the suns transition to a red giant. Hers the basics of why\u2026. As the sun runs out of fuel, the outer layers of the sun begin to expand. Initially, the expansion will be somewhere around 100 times its current size. The sun at the moment has a radius around 695,700 km. (Times this by up to 100). As there is no increase in mass, the outer shell of the sun will get thinner and thinner as it expands. This will cause the solar winds to begin ripping away the gas from the outer layers of the sun, thereby reducing the sun`s mass The force of gravity is dictated by an objects mass, meaning that the greater mass an object has, the greater influence that object will have on its local environment. Because the sun is losing mass, the gravitational influence the sun has on the planets within the solar system will be reduced proportionally. This means that the planets orbits will change. Most of the planets will drift out to a wider orbit. Initially, the earth`s new orbit, assuming the earth drifts out fast enough, will be roughly near the current orbit of Mars and Mars will in-turn drift out to near Jupiter`s current orbit and so on Mercury will not be able to move fast enough away and will be consumed by the expanding sun. So too will Venus. This is the first expansion phase and is generally referred to as a sub-giant. Once the sun evolves to a full red giant, it could expand to up to 2000 times its current size. The sun will continue to lose mass will therefore have an reducing gravitational influence of the remaining planets. Again the planets will probably drift out to wider and wider orbits and some of the objects in the Oort cloud may leave the solar system all together. If the earth is lucky, it may survive the red giant phase ",
