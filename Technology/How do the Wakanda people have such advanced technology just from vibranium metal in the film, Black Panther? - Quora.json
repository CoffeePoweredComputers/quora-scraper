            "answer_text": "It's not actually the vibranium that makes them advanced. It's the not being conquer part. The afro futurism revisionism. The \"what if\u201d that Marvel's so famous for. What if africa had not been exploited, divided, pilaged family and tribes destroyed amd enslaved and decimated be removal for slave trade? This is a theme explored by all the other minor civilizations but never Africa. Every other civilization had a self inflicted dark age. Africa was an external infliction. Also since Africa isn't a monolithic civilization, one nation could fall but all it's neighbors would retain that technology. A way to look at this is that Europe didn't have many features that ancients had figured out long ago. Two major things. Running water. Which is just weird since they actually had contact with the roman empire. This coyld have mostly elimanated the black plague frim starting. Refrigeration. This would have prevented food poisoning and the rats and pests that thrived off the unsecure food supply. Africa\u2026 had refrigerators. Nah not electric. Just a way to keep food chilled. If I leave a sandwich with mayonnaise out for and hour, im paralysed for a week. So gow the $@@& do these stories where they \u201ckilled a beastvso giant they were able to feast off it for a month\u201d. How? How were the villagers not sick? Convection refrigeration that doubles as Tupperware. Why is this primative woman so happy when she doesn't even own a shirt? Because she has steak in that pot. Zebra steak, lion steak, aroch steak, crocodile steak, and a haunch of peppered panther.  \u2026and I have tortillas and hot tamales.  ",

            "answer_text": "Its not JUST the Vibranium, though that is like 90% of it. I'll try and do this point form The way Vibranium works basically rewrites the laws of physics, so while the rest of the scientific community looks at the world one way, Wakandan science looks at it another (clearly more effective) way.Due to the Vibranium, the soil of Wakanda is especially furtile (thats why they can grow the Heart Shaped Herb there), so they've never lacked for resources so they've never had to waste time, resources and people on external war like the rest of the world. To add to this point, Wakandans are generally a xenophobic culture who wanted nothing to do with the outside world (why go anywhere when everything you need is right here?), adding to why they never go to war (save for defending there borders, which I'll address next).Xenophobic or not, they've still been attacked, they just have Zero fuckaround when it comes to defense, in the early days (pre-gun) some Vibranium laced through your clothing made you for all intents and purposes unstoppable. Even when guns became a thing, bullets fall to the ground after hitting the VibraniumThey're one of the oldest countries in the world. As in Pre christ. They've just had their shit together so much longer than everyone else, and in all that time, never got into the rest of worlds petty squabbles over land, religion, or anything else.Tl;dr version- Better understanding of the laws of physics and never had to waste time/manpower/resources on long drawn out conflicts.
