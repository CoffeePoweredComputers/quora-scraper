            "answer_text": "Well most companies that come to mind when it comes to selling info are Facebook and google,both companies that operate their business free for everyone,sure they have ads but that doesn\u2019t bring them enough revenue so the need to sell the data to stay afloat. So my opinion on this is simple if a bit controversial.Pay for the service so they don\u2019t lose money,for instance some sites have a free and a paid version so maybe that could work.And if that doesn\u2019t work then pass a law that makes it illegal for them to sell/give away the info if not specifically authorized by the end user.But we all know that wont happen.
