            "answer_text": "Arguably, it used to be. Concrete almost entirely out of use with the end of the Roman empire. There were a handful of Medieval projects using concrete, but hardly any. It was, if not completely lost, then at least rather hard to find. But it has been regained since then. Concrete was essentially reinvented in the 19th century, and between that, increasingly sophisticated analysis of Roman concrete, and better understanding of history and historical technology all around, we\u2019ve pretty much figure it out. No doubt we\u2019re missing a few details about the full range of techniques the Romans used, but we can, if we care to, make and work with it about as well as the original users did. Indeed, you can go on line to find how-to videos and buy all the materials necessary to make Roman-style concrete yourself. ",
