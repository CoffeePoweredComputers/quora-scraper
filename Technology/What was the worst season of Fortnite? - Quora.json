            "answer_text": "Well, that depends. For the pros and the professional side of things, it was definitely season 10 as epic games decided to do some really stupid things with the game, for example the M.E.C.H.s and the nerf to turbo building, even if that only lasted about a day or two. For the more casual side, you could argue on this. For me it was season 10 too as it got VERY boring with the mechs and the HORRIBLE additions to fortnite. Some people could argue season 9 as well as then people started to leave the game, and only the people who really loved fortnite stayed. ",
