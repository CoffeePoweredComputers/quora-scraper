            "answer_text": "After 12 years of living here and growing up here, I can say it matters more with who, where and when you open a business, then what type of business it is. But I will try to give you the best areas in my opinion. Best ways of making money: Buy cheap and resell expensive. You but items in bulk, get great deals and resell individual items. (Import, export and local bulk). Safe your momey in cash and be ready to buy good oportunity items.Tourism. Get clients from outside the country for all type of activities. Most business here pay 10% comission for clients. Hotels, tour guides, restaurants, real estate, pretty much anything. So instead of investing in your own physical business. You invest in marketing and advertising.Loans. Cash for more cash. Mini loans and loans with stuff as guarantee like cars, bikes, houses are very common here. 20% interest is normal. 20-50% interest on mini loans. Its a risky and kinda stressful business but if done right, lota of profit posible. I have seen people come from nothing to rich over the years just with loans.Niche businesses. There is lots of new stuff coming on the market in all aspects and D.R is a 3rd world country so there is lots of oportunities to become the first in your business area.There is different ways, I would say it really depends on what person is trying to do business and that person needs someone that is of trust and knows the area in and out.

            "answer_text": "Dominicans love clothes (new and used), make up, toiletries, food (canned, dry, and packaged) , and almost anything from the US. Those things are considered foreign but very popular and sought after. Especially if you can sell it at a cheap price. You can bring some items or ship then to yourself using a ocean shipping company which is very common to do and set up shop either from your house putting a little sign outside or renting a small room or booth somewhere. That should be less than $2000 usd for this including the shipping. Im not sure how much profit you will make. It depends on how much you pay for the products. ",

I am in Australia, and we sell coffee mugs through Amazon and Etsy, mainly to the US market. You can get started in this business for just a few hundred, but if you have a few thousand to invest, then you can kickstart things a lot faster.
