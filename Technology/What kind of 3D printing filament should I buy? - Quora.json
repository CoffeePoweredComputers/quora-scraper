            "answer_text": "BEST 3D PRINTER FILAMENT TYPES PLA In the realm of home 3D printing, polylactic acid (PLA) is king. Although it\u2019s often compared to ABS \u2013 next in line to the throne \u2013 PLA is easily the most popular 3D printer filament type, and for good reason. ABS Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) ranks as the second most popular 3D printer filament, after PLA. But that just means it\u2019s the second most commonly used. With respect to its material properties, ABS is actually moderately superior to PLA, despite being slightly more difficult to print with. It\u2019s for this reason that ABS is found in many manufactured household and consumer goods, including LEGO bricks and bicycle helmets! PETG Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the most commonly used plastic in the world. Best known as the polymer used in water bottles, it is also found in clothing fibres and food containers. While \u201craw\u201d PET is rarely used in 3D printing, its variant PETG is a popular 3D printer filament. Nylon Nylon, a popular family of synthetic polymers used in many industrial applications, is the heavyweight champion of the 3D printing world. Compared to most other types of 3D printer filament, it ranks as the number one contender when together considering strength, flexibility, and durability. TPE, TPU, TPC (Flexible) As the name implies, thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) are essentially plastics with rubber-like qualities, making them extremely flexible and durable. As such, TPE is commonly found in automotive parts, household appliances, and medical supplies. PC (Polycarbonate) Polycarbonate (PC), in addition to being the strongest 3D printer filament presented in this list, is extremely durable and resistant to both physical impact and heat, able to withstand temperatures of up to 110\u00b0C. It\u2019s also transparent, which explains its use in commercial items such as bullet proof glass, scuba masks, and electronic display screens. Wood Interested in printing objects that look and feel like wood? Well, you can! It\u2019s not really wood of course \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t make for a very good 3D printer filament \u2013 it\u2019s PLA infused with wood fiber. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends what you want to do: do you care about strength, convenience, flexibility, price? Here are the options in rough order of popularity:  ABS: This is what lego bricks are made from. Slightly flexible, pretty strong. A little tricky to print with: releases not-so-pleasant gases when printed, is very subject to warping (so usually needs a printed bed). PLA: This is the up-and-coming champion, especially for beginners. Pleasant smell when printed, cheap (about $22 a kg), easy to print, made from corn. Only issues really are brittleness and doesn't do well with continual exposure to the elements (since it's biodegradable). PETG copolymer: This is a really nice material to print with --  it's got a nice gloss to it, releases no toxic gases and is stronger and more flexible than PLA, but without the issues of ABS. Some refined versions of PETG do better e.g. Colorfabb XT, Taulman n-vent. Bit more expensive than PLA. Nylon: The strength king! Printed nylon is a little bit flexible, but super super strong. It's a pain to print with -- needs a hot bed, doesn't stick to the bed. Exotics: You can buy lots of exotic filaments: ones with carbon fiber, ones that feel like steel, wood, bronze, copper; others that are conductive and yet others that are somewhat transparent. This chart from Taulman, one of the high-end filament makers (the other being Colorfabb) gives an admittedly Taulman centric but still useful overview:   ",
