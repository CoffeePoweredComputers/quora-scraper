            "answer_text": "[Spoiler Alert: Movie spoilers prowl here.] Nope. Not even a miracle can save us if aliens invaded in 2021. Especially not with the current president leading the most powerful military in the world. The current COVID-19 numbers reflect in spades on his ability to lead. He is more likely to blame an alien invasion on Obama, or tweet something inappropriate about it, than do something meaningful and decisive.  The underlying problem is that our world does not have a unified government. World leaders have a fundamental distrust towards one another, so when a calamity strikes, like the current pandemic, the response is inconsistent and often ineffectual. We are lucky that the Coronavirus is not as virulent as other pathogens of the past, but due to its ability to spread rapidly, it still brought the world to its knees.  In fairness, however, there is really nothing we can do against an interstellar civilization that has mastered faster-than-light travel (FTLT), for such technology will be required to traverse the immense distances between stars.  Unlike most alien invasions depicted in movies, they will not engage our military forces on land, water and air. Rather, they will do so from space. Cobra (from the movie, G.I. Joe: Retaliation) had the right idea when they launched a platinum rod kinetic impactor from orbit against London.  Aliens would most likely do the same.  But why waste rare metals when an enormous variety of space rocks litter the Solar System. Using precise orbital calculations, they could nudge one or more of these planet killers from their current orbits, boost their velocity, and hurl these asteroids on a collision course with Earth.  Generally speaking, a small meteorite blazing at incredible speed can do just as much damage as a large one traveling more slowly. Moreover, a larger body requires more energy to move. Therefore, depending on their technological capabilities, they could launch one large object against us, or several smaller ones.  If they are advanced enough to perform precise trajectory calculations, they could even selectively target areas on our planet with the highest energy consumption, thus destroying our densely populated urban centers at the onset.  If the aliens\u2019 aim is simply to mine our metal-rich core, and they have the technology to move such a massive celestial object, they could use our Moon to blast the planet into a million pieces. Our lone satellite, after all, is a mere 405,696 km at its farthest from Earth (apogee), so the effect would be more immediate compared to the more distant asteroids.  There are other ways to attack our planet with minimal casualties on the invader\u2019s side. For instance, drawing inspiration from the 2008 movie remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, the aliens could unleash a swarm of Nanobots that consumes all organic matter, metals, plastics and other synthetic materials, while multiplying at the same time.  This would be a very efficient way to convert Earth\u2019s various natural resources, which would be more complicated and tedious to mine individually, into their highly priced weapons of mass destruction.  Hence, the aliens arrive with one Genetically-Organized Robotic Technology (GORT), and leave with an entire army of newly manufactured GORTs.  Currently, we do not have any effective technology to prevent huge celestial objects from impacting our planet. Neither do we have any weapons that could counteract a nanobot swarm, as depicted in Keanu Reeve\u2019s 2008 remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still. Consequently, if an alien civilization invaded the world in 2021, we will all be dead.  Source: Google Images ",

            "answer_text": "No. Well, we have the concept of a pack of octopus-bicycle hybrids fronting up waving zap guns and tentacles, it\u2019s been around since 1895 or so, but in terms of actually being able to mount a meaningful defence\u2026 yeah, nah. The first problem is that ETs have sufficiently advanced tech that they can survive interstellar travel. Which probably means FTL; so we literally wouldn\u2019t see them coming until after they\u2019d arrived. And that means really powerful engines, extremely good radiation shielding, and quite possibly some sort of FTL radio so they can phone home for backup. As for armaments, they\u2019ve got the advantage of the high ground, and that means one thing: Dear Earthlings, Please surrender or we will continue to drop dirty great lumps of high-velocity rock on you from 600 miles up. Love and Kisses, The Space Invaders. Who needs fancy lasers when you can just apply F=ma on people? INTERNAL MEMO From: Supreme Fleet Leader To: Orbital Bombardment Group While it is amusing, and the concept does appear in Earthling comic drawings, you will stop shaping orbital drop rounds to resemble Earth grand pianos. This is not only slowing up the pacification process, but is causing rounds to fail at a higher rate than acceptable. Oh yes. If they manage to make their intentions clear, that means that they\u2019ve been observing us all this time, so they\u2019ve got a damn good anthropology department and the sociopolitical drop on us as well. And of course, that means politics would rear its head. If you think the whole world would set aside its differences and conflicts to battle the invaders, you need to lay off the magic mushrooms and visit reality for a while. So\u2026 if an invasion fleet does front up next year \u2014 nope! We\u2019re screwed. May as well run up the white flag and take all the fun out of it for them. ",
