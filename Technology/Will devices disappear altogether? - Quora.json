            "answer_text": "Can you defined \"device\"? To me, a hammer is a device. So is a toothbrush. So is a fork. We need devices to build houses. To eat. Are you saying that one day we won't have cups? You're imagining a future in which we don't need houses? We -- what? -- just sit outside, naked (you need devices to make clothes) and think? We never have any urge to do anything tactile?  Are you imagining we no longer have material bodies? That we've been translated into bits and are living inside a computer simulation? Isn't the computer that's running us a device? Assuming that doesn't happen -- that we still have bodies -- it's important to remember that no matter how \"abstract\" our devices get, we are essentially unchanged from our \"out of Africa\" ancestors. We evolved as SENSUAL creatures. We naturally understand the world via grabbing, scratching, licking, sniffing, etc. Why would we perversely deny what we are and what we do so well? If we are translated into bits, won't we feel like quadriplegics if we don't at least have virtual limbs and sense organs? Huge portions of our brains evolved to wiggle toes, waggle tongues and bend fingers. Those portions will get translated into bits, too, and they'll want exercise. So I'd imagine we'd invent virtual devices for them. Which would be real as far as we'd be concerned. They'd be as real as us.  It's interesting to me how tactile and sensual OS interfaces are becoming. I used to control computer by typing and sliding a mouse around. Now I pinch, slide, flick... Apple understand that humans are built to be sensual. ",

            "answer_text": "There is the Castle museum in York, England, which has a collection of everyday things that have evolved or gone out of fashion.http://www.yorkcastlemuseum.org.uk/Page/YorkCastleMuseum.aspx It is best known for its recreated Victorian street, Kirkgate, which combines real shop fittings and stock with modern sound and light effects, to evoke an atmosphere of Victorian Britain.The street was named after the museum's founder, Dr John L. Kirk, a North Yorkshire country doctor.  He was worried ordinary things people used were disappearing so fast and being replaced with new technology, they needed to be saved. My wife and I sat down to watch the people become startled, when they rounded the corner and found the stuff from the 50's and 60's, they were still using at home, on display in a museum. No devices? Well that is reminiscent of the Krell in the movie \"Forbidden Planet\" in which the machine made what people thought. http://www.grg.org/charter/Krell2.htmUm, that didn't go so well. So some kind of device, maybe just a better ergonomic system for our use. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, devices will eventually disappear altogether.  As crazy as that may sound, I really do believe there will be a point where the bridge between information and the physical world will be nothing more than an intuitive understanding of the real world's OS. Where I differ with Colin on this is that it is not the device that will become so intuitive and easy to use, but the software that runs on it. I conjecture that at some point that software will be nothing more than a UI for the real world's OS that requires only one 'device' to control -- the brain. ",

Oh wait, no that was the vision of the future at the Worlds Fair 50+ years ago.  No devices won't disappear, but they will become so intuitive, so easy to use, and so good at predicting needs, they'll get out of the way for the most part. Plus there's too much money to make in making devices. ",
