            "answer_text": "Wifi is a standard for radio communication between nearby devices using microwave signals. \u201cThe internet\u201d is a massive collection of interconnected servers, routers, switches and so forth that facilitates the retrieval of information from systems that you don't manage, have physical access to, etc. How do they relate to one another? Most people have access to the internet by way of a modem in their home. A modem encodes one type of information into a different type and then transmits it to another party. So in the old days you had a digital signal converted into sounds by your modem and transmitted via phone line to your dialup internet service provider (perhaps AOL or NetZero). On receiving the encoded sounds, the ISP would forward the request where it needed to go and give you back the resource you asked for. It's a similar process with high speed connections today but phone lines turn out not to be the best connections, and now we often prefer coaxial or fiber optic cables. If your modem is a dedicated piece of hardware rather than a component in your device then you'll need some way of getting your requests to the modem. You could do this by connecting your computer to the modem with a network cable. But what if you have multiple computers and want them all connected at the same time? Then you'll need to have a router as well. So now you plug the router into the modem, and plug your computers in to the router. But wait! You have a tablet that you want to connect to the internet, and there's not a port on it for plugging in a network cable. Now you'll need to connect a Wireless Access Point. A wireless AP broadcasts a wifi network and connects your wireless devices to the rest of your network. So you plug it in to your router, configure it, and connect your tablet to it (in this scenario we've created). Now your tablet and your computers can talk to one another and your tablet can also request things from the internet. Nowadays it is common for your wireless AP, router and modem to all be included in one device. Once it powers up you'll soon see it broadcasting a wifi network, you connect to it and you're on the internet. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Which is better WiFi or Internet? The Internet is a worldwide network allowing you to gain access to many sites and services located over most of the world. WiFi is just a short range (normally less than 100 metres) interface and is often used as an alternative to a wired (Ethernet or similar) connection between devices (PCs, TVs, games consoles, etc) and the local router. You can have Internet without WiFi, and you can have WiFi without Internet. If you just want to connect local computers, printers, etc, together, then WiFi is better than Internet, although Ethernet may be much better than WiFi. If you just want to access sites, use email, etc from around the world, then Internet is important and WiFi may be irrelevant if you can use Ethernet. Generally, for fixed devices such as desktop PCs, TVs, etc, then Ethernet is better than WiFi. For portable devices such as tablets, smart phones, etc, then WiFi is better than Ethernet. Some devices will not have WiFi capability and if they are to be part of a home network they will normally connect to the router by Ethernet. Other devices may not have Ethernet capability and will be connected by WiFi. I have two desktop PCs that each have WiFi and Ethernet. Both use Ethernet as their network performance using Ethernet is much better than WiFi. Ethernet and WiFi both exist to provide connections inside the house. The Internet provides the connection outside the house to the rest of the world. Between the Internet and the Ethernet/WiFi are my modem and wireless router. To answer your question, you have to decide what you want to do and what alternatives exist. ",
