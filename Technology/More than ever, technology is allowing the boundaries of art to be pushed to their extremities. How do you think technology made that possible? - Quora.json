            "answer_text": "Technology is only pushing the boundaries of articulation of human art in new media, as a tool to be directed by humans. Technology may, by its nature, may provide some slightly new concepts for artists to explore but technology is usually just another tool for artists. Most highly technological art I see is still running with accepted and even old concepts in art. A lot of computer art is conceptually a rehash of surrealism or no further than new articulation of the old kaleidoscope images or old film techniques, while still claiming to be new art. It\u2019s not conceptually new at all and the claim annoys me no end. I\u2019m looking for technological art that really challenges my thinking, gives me new ways of thinking, new ideas about reality, not just presenting impressive images or forms or movies that tell the same old stories. Since I was a student, interested in cybernetics and process, I made a system using sound spatially in a self developing process with one phase leading to unpredictable evolving. I used sound at the time because virtual reality was not on the scene and would have preferred starting this process with real reality, real things in space. At various times throughout my life I\u2019ve asked various people in computer art or cosmology or mathematics to help me digitise the process, to no avail. I\u2019m 70 now and have decided to leave my idea, to others, in the form of a short novel before I fall off my perch. We have to be careful with art and technology because the magic of new technology overtake our judgements and can blind us to the reality that, so-called \u201cnew\u201d is not really presenting us with anything conceptually \u201cnew\u201d at all! johnrossmcglade.wordpress.com ",
