            "answer_text": "While I'm not a \u2018psychic\u2019 or anything like that, I do have some unexplained moments where I \u2018feel\u2019 or sense things. It's not something I try to do nor can I control it or predict when it will happen, it's just a random but interesting coincidence. Of course like a lot of parents, I can sense when a child is doing something mischievous by the sheer loudness of the silence in the house\u2026 Or \u2018feel\u2019 them lurking motionless around a corner ready to leap out and shout Boo! .. I have an 80% score of turning this back on my 15yo son and scaring the beejebus out of him instead ;p this isn't really a sixth sense just parental awareness. I always sense when my older daughter is about to visit and will say \u2018Sissy will be here soon\u2019 usually 2\u20135 mins before she arrives. Her visits are random and I can't hear her car or anything. No idea how to explain that. I am constantly finding I will txt my kids that have moved out of home at the exact minute a txt then comes from them - after I've started typing . Possibly explainable by subtle frequency from a mobile signal but not until they have pressed send I\u2019d have thought? I randomly get people a drink or pass them a pen or something and they reply \u2018How did you know I wanted that?\u2019. Not even when it would be expected they would feel thirsty such as after hard work, or when they are doing an activity that requires a pen etc. I was talking to a stranger online and, so weirdly and, ramdomly got a strong feeling they were north-east of me at the time, but they said they lived south. After 3 msgs from them. Turns out they were. Seems such a small silly thing but these types of things happen a lot and it's just super interesting to me and I am curious as to How it happens. I'd love to hears others who experience this and any theories or explanations on how or why or if it's just pure coincidence! ",
