            "answer_text": "I have been using it for more than 3 years so I qualify to answer about there service. The broadband connection is good as long as you don't have an issue with your broadband connection. This is where the worst part comes. to list the cons the customer care service is the worst I have ever experienced. They will note your complaint, you will get the complaint no. on the registered mobile no via text. The problem-solving time they ask for is 1 to 3 working days. Nobody will ever come to your house/office to solve the problem unless it\u2019s a regional broadband service problem. You need to visit one of there branches to have your problem solved, even then not every place is responsible for technical problem-solving IDK why. In nutshell, broadband service is average as long as you don\u2019t run into a technical snag. Rearding the internet speed it\u2019s not the best not worst, average I would say. Almost all ISP have problem with customer care service, so choose the network that works the best in your area, before opting for long term broadband service of any ISP. ",

            "answer_text": "Very bad experience... Every now and then connectivity gets lost. If you take GTPL Broadband then it's like Wake up every morning and first of all call GTPL Customer Service Center to tell that I want to use my internet and there is no connection. If your usage are such that a single second internet interruption affects you then it is not advisable to go with GTPL, because there are interruptions very frequently. In fact if your usages are not that high still you should go with some other broadband provider because there's no guarantee that the moment you want to connect to internet, you would be connected. Yes, GTPL is the cheapest option but so, are their services!! You will not regret spending 2000-3000 Rs. extra (anually) for other broadband service. P.S. I am not their competitor or enemy, I am their customer only who is suffering a lot because of their poor quality service. And I have suffered loss due to them many times because I do my all work online. And for that I need a good broadband and for sure that should not be like GTPL. ",
