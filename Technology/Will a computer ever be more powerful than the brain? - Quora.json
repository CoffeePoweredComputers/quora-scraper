            "answer_text": "The capacity of human brain is unlimited. Let me explain how: There are approximately 100 billion neurons in our brain and each neuron consists of approximately 2000\u20133000 dendrites (Dendrites are projections of a neuron (nerve cell) that receive signals (information) from other neurons. The transfer of information from one neuron to another is achieved through chemical signals and electric impulses, that is, electrochemical signals.) So any information or calculation or how we perceive & experience reality and our world is done through neurons by making connections between different dendrites. For example if you learn anything then whatever you learn will be stored in your brain in form of connections between neurons through dendrites. Same happens with calculation or processing of information. A computer also does calculations and stores information but in form of electric signals in form of 0 and 1. Even if you combine together all the available hardware in our planet which can store data then also it will not be equal to the capacity of 1 single brain with 100 billion neurons (the amount of data that can be stored in our brain through all the permutations and combinations of all the available dendrites of all 100 billion neurons is more than total number of stars in our galaxy). But unfortunately we are not able to use our full potential of brain that is why we think a computer is more powerful than a brain. Every second our brain is processing various amounts of data that is being sent by our body through our 5 senses. The ancient practise of yoga and meditation was invented so that we could use the full potential of our brain. Day by day we are getting addicted to technology and are not using the most sophisticated gadget that we have got which is our brain. I can go on and on about this but I hope you must have got an idea how powerful our brain is. The more you use your brain the more you will be able to utilize it's true potential. ",

            "answer_text": "Your Brain Is Still 30 Times More Powerful Than The Best Supercomputers. ... \"[This method] provides a relatively independent estimate of the price of computing hardware roughly comparable to the brain.\" One of the great mysteries of AI is that--despite becoming billions of times more powerful =over the past 50 years--computers have only become marginally better at, and complete fail at, many tasks that human brains perform instantly. Physicists have long speculated that this gulf is because the human brain might be a quantum computer rather than a digital computer. If this is the case, then there may be tasks that digital computers will never do as well as humans. If this proves true, human beings can defend themselves against the encroachment of AI by developing and honing the characteristics of their brain that make them uniquely human. (Hint: Steve Jobs did this, as I'll explain presently.)  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2192 CLICK ME FOR WATCH FREE VIDEO \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Quantum vs Digital Quantum computers (which have yet to be built in a laboratory) differ from digital computers because \"in theory they can answer questions that weren't asked,\" according to professor Richard Rothwell. No digital computer ever does that. Quantum computers (which again exist only in theory) would vastly outperform digital computers in other ways as well. For example, a quantum computer can search through disconnected data set many orders of magnitude faster than even a massively parallel digital computer. Both those behaviors are characteristic of human intelligence. \"Answering questions that aren't asked\" is the key characteristic of human creativity. Similarly, human beings instantly sort, recognize, and contextualize everything around them--huge masses of data. Despite the similarities, though, there's never been a way to prove (or disprove) the idea that the human brain is a quantum computer. Until now, that is.  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2192 CLICK ME FOR WATCH FREE VIDEO \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The New Research Matthew Fisher, arguably the world's foremost quantum physicist, recently assembled a worldwide team of quantum physicists, molecular biologists, biochemists, colloid scientists and behavioral neuroscientists to \"seek explicit experimental evidence to answer whether we might in fact be quantum computers.\" This is a huge undertaking because it involves measuring the behavior of molecules inside the human brain while the human brain is actively thinking. Indeed, the difficulty of such testing is why the \"brain is quantum\" has remained a hypothesis for so many years. If the hypothesis is proven, \"their research could shed new light on how the brain works, which might lead to novel mental health treatment protocols,\" according to UC Santa Barbara chancellor Henry T. Yang. Just as important, though, such research would strongly suggest that, rather than worrying about being replaced by AI, humans should instead focus on increasing the brain's inherent ability to do things that digital computers can't, like creating new things and ideas.  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2192 CLICK ME FOR WATCH FREE VIDEO \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 ",
