            "answer_text": "Zumwalt Class Destroyers  Although it looks like some sort of bonkers submarine, this is actually a multi-role battleship with stealth capabilities. The low-radar cross-section and a wave-piercing hull combined with a range of other technologies make this destroyer a ship far less capable of detection by enemy radar than it's comparable counterparts. Back by $9.6 billion in research and development costs, the Zumwalt Class Destroyer is possibly the most expensive vessel of its kind. The design apparently gives the destroyer a radar profile similar to a fishing boat and make it 50 times harder to spot than standard destroyers. The Zumwalt Class Destroyer also boasts an Advanced Gun System which comprises of a 155mm naval gun capable of firing a Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) over 80 nautical miles. A controversially expensive destroyer with plenty of interesting technologies that demonstrate the power of the modern American Navy. ADAPTIV camouflage  The enemy can't shoot what they can't see. That's the goal of BAE Systems ADAPTIV camouflage; to mask a military vehicle's infrared signature and shield them from detection by allowing them to blend in with their surroundings. This technology essentially renders thermal imaging systems obsolete and ensures friendly fighting vehicles are offered some protection from initial detection. The ADAPTIV camouflage is made up of a honey-comb like system that can be installed in modules on any vehicle and heated or cooled as necessary to match the surrounding environment. The same system can also be used to highlight allied vehicles to friendly forces and prevent blue-on-blue incidents. Sea Shadow, used to test Stealth capabilities in ships.  CV90120-T Ghost  The Swedish T Ghost is a camouflaged tank that uses BAE's ADAPTIV camouflage to make it invisible to enemy thermal imaging systems. The Ghost tank also uses a high-calibre 120mm compact main cannon with new technology designed to reduce recoil and lower overall vehicle weight. The result is a nimble and powerful medium fighting tank. The bleeding edge technology on this tank, in theory, allows the users to strike first before the opposing forces even realise they're there. Black Knight Unmanned Combat Vehicle  The Black Knight Unmanned Combat Vehicle is a prototype unmanned combat vehicle with the appearance of a small tank and the firepower to match. A 30mm cannon and 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, combined with the ability to be deployed from a military transport aircraft make this a combat vehicle to be reckoned with. CV-90 Armadillo  Precision-Guided Firearms  Precision-Guided Firearms are designed to take the missile lock-on system from fighter jets and apply them to traditional long-range rifle systems. These firearms use target tracking, advanced fire control and heads-up display technologies to help guide a bullet to its target and account for human error to ensure a higher probability of hitting the target first time, even at long range. Laser Avenger  The Boeing Laser Avenger is an aerial defence weapon that can be mounted to a vehicle and used to shoot down enemy UAVs. Unlike conventional anti-aircraft weaponry, the Boeing Laser Avenger system doesn't create a muzzle flare or smoke trail when it fires. This means it can be fired from concealed positions keeping friendly troops safe and out of harm's way. Personnel Halting And Stimulation Response (PHASR) Rifle  This crazy looking weapon first appears like an alien-technology or something out of a science fiction flick. It's actually a non-lethal incapacitation device designed to temporarily blind and disorient targets. The PHASR rifle fires a low-intensity laser beam with a blinding effect and is perfect for a variety of situations where the aim is to disable the target. Electromagnetic Rail Gun  This monster cannon is actually the culmination of over a decade's worth of development and testing. An electromagnetic rail gun capable of firing projectiles at over 4,500mph and smashing through concrete structures 100 miles away. XM25 Counter Defeliade Target Engagement (CDTE)  The XM25 Counter Defilade Target Engagement System is a semi-automatic airburst grenade launcher with a laser rangefinding system allowing soldiers to calculate the distance to target for most effective combat use. Canadas Next Generation Smart Gun  The Canadian military is developing this futuristic rifle. It can hold a standard semi-automatic rifle as well as a shotgun or grenade launcher attachment.Hypersonic Missiles  Since the 1990s, the American Air Force Research Laboratory has been involved in the design, development and testing of a hypersonic propulsion system with a view to creating a missile capable of Mach 6 (4,000mph). The result is the Boeing X-51 Waverider, an unmanned scramjet aircraft designed to be launched from a B-52 bomber or F-35 fighter. Still a work in progress, the X-51 Waverider has shown plenty of promise during testing reaching speeds of over 3,000 mph Fostech Origin 12 shotgun  The Fostech Origin 12 shotgun is pitched as the World's fastest firing shotgun. Although not fully-automatic, this shotgun is capable of firing 30 rounds in under eight seconds. KRISS Vector  This compact submachine gun is an extremely capable and flexible weapon that's compatible with a range of different ammunition calibres including .22, .40, .45 and 9mm Parabellum. But what makes it interesting is the KRISS Super V Recoil Mitigation System which pushes expended energy from fired rounds downwards to keep the gun on target and dramatically reduce recoil. The Vector is also capable of firing over 1,200 rounds per minute and takes standard Glock pistol magazines, means it's perfect for Police forces and military bodies who use Glock guns as their standard sidearms. Active Denial System (ADS)  Another non-lethal energy weapon designed to help with crowd and riot control. Also known as the \"heat ray\" this system works by heating the target's surface on the same principles as a microwave oven. Laser Weapon System (LaWS)  The Laser Weapons System is essentially exactly what it sounds like - a ship-mounted laser cannon. This laser system allows for pinpoint targeting and destruction of enemy assets including everything from small ordinance to enemy craft engines. TrackingPoint XS1.  Comanche stealth helicopter  YF 23 Black Widow II (F-22\u2019s competitor)  HiMAT (Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology).  The KM, nicknamed the \u201cCaspian Sea Monster\u201d. Not exactly a boat, plane nor a flying boat. More like an hybrid of all of them. It used the \u201cground effect\u201d to \u201cfly\u201d just above the water surface.  Boeing Bird of Prey, Used to research Stealt  F-22 Raptor  Saab JAS 39 Gripen  Stealth Black Hawk, one of them crashed during the operation that killed Bin Laden.  Horten Ho 229, The very first jet powered flying wing design, being virtually undetectable by radars.  The B58 Hustler  The V22 Osprey   Thanks for the read! :) (: ",

            "answer_text": "What are some of the most futuristic looking weapons in military history? Well, one\u2019s I think are futuristic and are very old.  The Lockheed F-104 Starfighter! Even the name is kick ass futuristic. Hard plane to fly, killed some pilots though, but definitely futuristic when it was created and decades afterwards.    The HK VP70 Z. The first in Polymer, I owned the civilian version of this, without the stock. \u2018Just four moving parts\u2019 they said, a very early plastic, for the time, a very large magazine capacity, 18 rounds, and they gave you three of them, which in the civilian version went from being a neat feature to onerous! The stock attachment turned it into a machine pistol! The trigger pull was HORRENDOUS. I\u2019d hard hands, calloused, strong from lifting and doing hand exercises, when I had the thing and it still HURT my damn fingers to shoot that thing because of the pressure on the trigger.   It\u2019s a blade type, the BESH Principle Wedge Military in that some elite organization allowed for them. The BESH Principle Wedge is a knife that can penetrate, without having an actual point, but instead has an edge in place of a point, eliminating the weakness of stilettoes while coming close to their advantage.  Each side is ground so that instead of a point, they meet in that third edge. While not as sharp as an actual point, it\u2019ll penetrate as a cutting edge, These are two countering wedge grinds so it\u2019s not a chisel point. ",
