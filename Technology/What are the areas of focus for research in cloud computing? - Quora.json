The factors I consider to be relevant in these terms are: System Performance: how well does one cloud perform relative to another - measurable using standard performance benchmarks like SPEC CPU and many othersNetwork Performance: how well does the network perform in terms of latency and throughput (in and out) to various regions of the worldAvailability: how reliable is the cloud, what is the actual uptime %, when outages occur, what is the problem and how fast is the vendor able to resolve it.I've posted some results from research I've conducted here: http://blog.cloudharmony.com ",
