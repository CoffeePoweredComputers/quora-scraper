To be clear, there is no ending for the Web Technology and it will keep growing as now. Earlier it was HTML and now it is HTML5 which is also used for Mobile Apps Development.

All kinds of devices will have a small operating system and connectivity capable of providing APIs for common people who know JavaScript to extend their functionality. You'll be able to hook your phone with just about anything you own that has power in it and access them anywhere. Just like today one can install a server on their computer and hook it up with their phone but it'll be much more accessible and it'll just not be only computers but all sorts of devices. Because of this, new frameworks will be published where you can connect your stuff securely into social media and other resources. Your presence will not just be you behind the keyboard but it'll be also your stuff available online. ",
