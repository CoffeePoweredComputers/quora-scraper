            "answer_text": "There is an existing book that would curb your appetite. It is written in the way, which is accessible even to non-technically educated people and according to my detailed reading of the book, that will enable everyone to penetrate the core of thinking of the segment of complexity applied to companies, societal interactions, and markets. The book of Andrew Ilachinski, Artificial War: Multiagent-Based Simulation of Combat ,[1] is definitely the book that opens your horizons toward agent-based modeling on interesting examples with impressive results. After this introduction with fully documented algorithm schemes on how to design the real thing, you will become very aware of details that stay hidden to newcomers. After this book, it would be interesting to go through articles and after it books of Dirk Helbing who started his research on ABM describing escape behavior of people from confined buildings using realistic physically-based models, which later extended into societal and business areas of research. Your interest will intersect with achieved knowledge by studying those two very important resources of such type of modeling. Finally, when you want to taste the advantages and difficulties of ABM, it would be great to start with freely available software called NetLogo.[2] An amazing tool to learn ABM from scratch. You can download & install it or run it through a web browser. Actually, it would be great and check some of the many examples freely available online and written in the NetLogo language. Good luck and a lot of success in your search. :-) Footnotes[1] Artificial War[2] NetLogo Home Page",

Work with this and be careful with mathematicians, as mathematics is a competing model of reality. Complexity is an organic[biological] domain, and there are no numbers in nature. Complexity[aka Complex Systems] tends away from drawing conclusions. Complexity is more akin to Anatomy. An Introduction to Complex Systems: Making Sense of a Changing World\u200b eBook: Tranquillo, Joe  The following two are important contributors, with some view to practising what you have learned.
