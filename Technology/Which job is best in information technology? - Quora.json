            "answer_text": "Whatever job is being performed by somebody that enjoys performing that job, is the best job for that person. This will change over time. - Some IT people love deploying and repairing hardware but don't enjoy coding.- Some (rare) IT people enjoy helping non-IT people with general IT issues.- Some IT people enjoy writing the smallest possible code and working with the least complex hardware possible.- Some IT people love designing algorithms that solve really hard maths problems, but hate dealing with physical hardware constraints. - Some IT people like relatively simple programing, enjoy watching people use the tools they create but don't enjoy fixing hardware.- Some (very rare) IT people may love dealing with non-IT people but hate coding or keeping up with the minutia of the latest hardware architectures.- Some like connecting things together and configuring them but don't enjoy coding, dealing with people or fixing hardware. These people are:- IT Support people (hardware).- IT Service Desk people.- Embedded systems programmers.- Serious AI, graphics or simulation programmers.- Line of business, application programmers.- IT Business Analysts.- Networking specialists. The spectrum of IT work is huge. This is only a very small sample.\"The best job\" is only \"The best job\" for that one individual that is answering the question. For other IT people that same job is an absolute horror of missing documentation, unstated critical requirements and unsupported features.Just ask any of the people that have replaced me over the years...

            "answer_text": "I agree with the other answers in that it depends on where your interests and skills lie. However, personally, I\u2019ve enjoyed working as a systems analyst and project manager the most. Well, I enjoy teaching and being a chair at a university, but those don\u2019t count. As a systems analyst, you document a business process, then use process modeling to Develop a database schema, relationship diagrams, use cases, etc. you might be able to improve the process through business process re-engineering. You work with database administrators to build a database, and with application developers to develop a database application. You then work with system and network administrators to host your application, and with testers, clients, trainers, and technical writers to document the application and implement it. It\u2019s basically your application, and you get to work with a large number of people with diverse skills and outlooks. It requires technical and interpersonal skill sets. I find it very rewarding. The same applies to project managers and program managers, at a higher level. You\u2019re responsible for managing your team, and for project requirements and deliverables. You develop and manage budgets, and you often get to develop the strategic vision and plan for the project. Ninety percent of project management work is communication, and you get to work with your team, as well as the customer and your C-suite. I find that as rewarding as the systems analyst role. I\u2019m not suggesting those are the best for everyone. I have worked in all of the jobs in information systems over the years, and those are simply a couple of my favorites. ",
