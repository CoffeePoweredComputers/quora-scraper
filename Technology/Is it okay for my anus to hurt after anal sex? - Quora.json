            "answer_text": "Okay? Depends on the definition. Pain as in low level, nothing to worry about. Start slower next time and use more lube. If you're bleeding, prolapsed or at least in a big enough amount of pain for it to affect you, you may have seriously hurt yourself. Also if youte a male, could just mean you've strained your prostate due to a strong orgasm. You'll know if a) you're male (or at least male bodied) and b) the \u201cpain\" is inside your butt, not at the hole. However I'll be honest. If you're posting it on quora, odds are it isnt a medical emergency, therefore you're not too worried about it. If so, you probably shouldnt be worried. You know your body best. If it hurts too much or feels literally damaged, see a doctor or nurse. If there is bleeding in small amounts but not a lot of pain it could be an underlying condition, like a rectal fissure or haemorrhoids. Again, see a doctor if you think this. The main point is, you're probably fine (based on very limited context) and just take it a little easier next time. Foreplay and lube are your best friends for anal sex. ESPECIALLY if you are on the receiving end. ",

By \u201cdoing it wrong\u201d I mean that you didn't take the necessary time to slowly and patiently let yourself \u201copen up\u201d properly to accept what was being offered to you. I completely understand the sense of urgency along with the huge sexual excitement of the moment that causes us to cast caution to the wind and just go for it. Listen, we usually have a really good idea if we are about to have anal sex or not. I've learned to put something in me 30 or so minutes BEFORE I get to the location of where I'm going to play. By the time I get there, I'm already sufficiently good to go and it only gets better from there! Good luck, doll! ",
