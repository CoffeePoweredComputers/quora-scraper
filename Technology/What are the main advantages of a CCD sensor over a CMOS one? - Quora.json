            "answer_text": "For consumer applications, CCD has no advantage over CMOS at all. The distinguishing architectural difference is that CMOS is readout is massively parallel, CCD is not.  Since the conversion circuitry is at each pixel site, CMOS readout is much faster.  This also means that the amp bandwidth can be narrower, and thus generally less noisy. Practically, CMOS is better simply because that's where the investment has gone.  The sensors in mobile phones are all CMOS.  This virtuous cycle of greater volume, greater investment means that CMOS development has lept ahead. CCD still has a niche in, well, very niche applications.  CCD still has a performance advantage in near infrared; the electron multipler CCD still has a slight advantage in extreme low light applications.  However, you won't find these kinds of sensors in any consumer oriented devices. ",
