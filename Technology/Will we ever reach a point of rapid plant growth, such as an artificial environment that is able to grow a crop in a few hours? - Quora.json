            "answer_text": "With current technology and our knowledge of plants - no. But there is no way of predicting what scientific discovery\u2019s may be made in the next century. In theory it sounds impossible with our current knowledge. Plants grow at the rate they do due to their genetics. Modifying plants genetics is highly unpopular. Although GMOs exist it isn\u2019t a field that has ever managed to perform such a miraculous feet as accelerating growth to a few hours. Using hydroponics, deep water culture, gibberellic acid and other organic plant growth hormones has resulted in increased growth in both yield and speed - but there are limits and growing in hours would require a change to the DNA of the plant. A new light or environment is unlikely to have that kind of effect although who knows what the future holds. It sounds highly improbable but so did cell phones and driverless cars years ago. If scientists continue their work, and universities continue to operate, maybe we will see such a discovery in the future. ",

            "answer_text": "The best bet for that would be some kind of seaweed, or maybe a floating flowering plant. The reason for this is that the plant wouldn\u2019t have to waste resources on things like roots and stems: all its growth could go into producing more photosynthetic area. Duckweed (a flowering plant), under ideal conditions, can double its mass in as little as sixteen hours, or two days without artificial lighting. It\u2019s a high-protein crop, and is commonly used as stock feed. I have no idea what it tastes like, but a few decades of selective breeding, even without genetic engineering, should be enough to give it pretty much any taste you want. Seaweed:  Duckweed:  ",
