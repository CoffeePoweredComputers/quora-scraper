            "answer_text": "A simple sales funnel is nothing more than a page or site that has the key word used by a search included within it. And, it can give all the features and benefits on the landing page. This page then has a call to action such as an order form or direct link to the payment processor. Sometimes, the landing page\u2019s call to action is an opportunity to click a button to get more information. And, then there is another call to action for the order. Complicated funnels will get into the \u201celse then\u201d coding techniques where the user is faced with a yes/no type of question. Then whichever choice they select takes them down a path that gets to the order after answering their concerns. These yes/no type questions can be scattered throughout the user experience and like a great funnel, they eventually get to the order. An example of the yes/no type question is a button that says buy-me and another that says Not yet, I need more information. These \u201cI need more information\u201d buttons often have multiple choices of information types. like: (X) Show me the specs, (X) What additional Benefits, (X) What choices of colors, etc Every page has a junction which includes the choice to buy now or an alternative. Some will end the funnel with the only option is buy now. ",
