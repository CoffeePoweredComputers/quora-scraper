            "answer_text": "Students use HB the most. HB (American #2) is the standard lead grade used for writing because it's dark enough to be read clearly while having minimal smudging. Artists probably use B grades (like 2B) the most. B leads are smooth to write and draw with. They smudge easily, but are readily erased. They're perfect for pencil drawings as artists can take advantage of the brush-like expressions. ",
