            "answer_text": "It is rather interesting timing of this post, because after 3 years, I have finally fallen out of love with my Model S P85D, after years of blindly loving it and not questioning its short comings .. of which there are many. I have owned many high-end cars in my tenure, including BMW and Mercedes. I also own a Ford F150 and to be frank, I find myself driving that far more than I do my Tesla. Some of the reasons I have fallen out of love with my 3 year old 21k miles Tesla, after spending $120k on it include: Cosmetic build quality is very poor.Window switches are losing their paint/coveringSteering wheel is fading fast and looking very raggedySeat leather (pleather?) are fading too, and showing lots of wear, far more than they should be for a car of this mileageSeats do not feel solid; they have some movementMechanical Build Quality poorEvery 6 months, something needs replacing on the car. The last one was the actual charging unit, as I was left stranded in a super-charging station with the car refusing to accept charge. Tesla had to come out and rescue meWindow seals melt in extreme heat (and we\u2019re talking only Virginia here) and have had to be replacedThe sun roof is known to let in the odd drip of waterThe latest, the back window refuses to go up nowThe center console frequently locks up becoming non-responsiveKey handles will often refuse to present themselvesServicingFor such a high tech company, I am still amazed at how poorly they manage this process. There is no reminder to tell you when you should be getting your next service - they don\u2019t even leave a sticker on your window! Fortunately though, due to the poor build quality you find yourself visiting the service center plentyExtremely expensive for replacement items; do not let Tesla replace tires or windshield wipers, unless of course you want a way to launder money straight into Elon\u2019s pocket. I know dealers have a huge markup anyway, but Tesla takes it to a new levelSoftware UpdatesMore often than not, break more than they fix or add. After reading the Reddit from the ex-Tesla software engineer (and being in the software field) I now understand why there is so many bugs.I have been locked out of the car many times, as fob and app alike fail to activate the car.DepreciationThis one is huge, after 3 years, the Tesla sales person was only offering me 45% of the original value of the car to upgrade to a new Model S.MisconceptionsInsane/Ludicrous modes ;;; only ever used to show to new people what it feels like. Those that want to experience what all those YouTube videos feel like. Otherwise, never ever used. Power is way over sold on the car.Auto Pilot ;;;; makes driving very boring and dull, and I can\u2019t remember the last time I turned it on. The adaptive cruise is the only thing I use, but what was once a Tesla exclusive feature is available on most modern cars.Long journeys ;;; requires planning. More often than not, I just use a conventional gas powered car. This is an issue with all EV cars so can\u2019t lay this on Tesla.Cold mornings ;;; really hammer the crap out of battery usage. Creating heat for the interior of the car requires a lot of energy.Standing still costs ;;; If you use your car for airport parking, factor in around 1\u20132mile loss of range each day it sits. Advice - turn off the feature that was added to auto-cool the car down in hot weather.Poor SoftwareOutside of Google Maps, the large console is pretty much useless.The media player has gone through a lot of changes and versions and each one gets worse.Bluetooth locks up a lot; failing to pick phone. Usually that is a sign that the whole console needs rebootingThe browser is a complete joke and gimmickOther niggles that are over soldFrunk ;;; that small front area, is so small it is impractical for anythingSelf-parking / movement ;;; again when it was first released it was actually quite good and the car would happily move itself in and out of the garage. Feature has been watered down now, that it is uselessWhile some love how Tesla can quickly fix/change the car over the air, it does fill you with a sense of dread every time it updates, and you often see subsequent updates coming quickly within days of each other, again, illustrating a lack of any real testing going on.The car was cool for a time. It turned heads. It set the car industry alight and woke up other manufacturers as to what could be done. But Tesla are no longer setting the standard, and if you look around, you will get a lot of car for the price of a standard Tesla. As they say, it was fun while it lasted, but my advice, don\u2019t buy a brand new Tesla, pick up a great bargain (the second hand market is very buoyant as many fanboys are still out there itching to get their hands on the future).

            "answer_text": "The good, the bad, and the ugly. I\u2019m a fairly recent proud owner of my Model S P100D, but I do a lot city traffic driving, as well as some 2.5k miles + return journeys. TLDR Model S: Expensive to buy, extremely cheap to own, under warranty, at least so far (~12 months). Amazing to drive, somewhat poor quality car in terms of luxury compared to other cars in its price range. Software is amazing, autopilot above any other car. Should you buy a Model S/P100D? Yes if you\u2019re after a toy, otherwise buy a Model 3 instead, or a fleet of them. P100D is for adult children with more adrenaline rush than sense(yours truly). High spec Teslas simply aren\u2019t worth the money, unless you\u2019re a very very confident driver and you want to win every traffic light drag race. If you still want one but don\u2019t care about performance, buy cheap, even if you want more, benefit won\u2019t scale, and you\u2019ll still have a car faster than 98% of all other cars, sports cars included. 4.2 seconds in a Model 3 AWD is on par with a Mercedes AMG Sedan, a Bentley GT pre 2019, etc. Futuristic: The most amazing realisation when you own a Tesla is that electric will become standard. For now, it\u2019s very expensive, because scaling up and doing R&D costs money. There are problems for sure, the charging network, the service industry, the speed of charge, the cost, and so on. But it\u2019s so incredibly obvious electric cars are so vastly ahead as a mass market product, there\u2019s simply no question where the world will be in 30 - 40 years. It won\u2019t be long before petrol cars will be a very old memory, and something generations to come will only learn about from stories. A word of caution: This review is written by a man child with more love of fast cars than sense, the very audience for the P models. A lot of it applies to all the Tesla range, but it\u2019s a review coming from someone after easy to own sustainable performance, not an economically sane family sedan, where I honestly think the Tesla would come off a lot better. Collection day photo of my pride and joy.  Good The way it drives It really doesn\u2019t feel like anything else you\u2019ve ever set foot in. The power delivery and the AWD system is insane in the best of ways. This car knows no weather, and does not care much for road conditions either, you can floor it all the way whenever you feel like it. It\u2019s perfectly stable at all times, and it feels incredibly safe, plus you can accelerate out of harms way whenever you need to. Is it a true sports car? No, absolutely not. It\u2019s a big heavy family sedan, with Porsche 918 Spyder vibes only up to 70mph, not much going for it beyond that. But if you\u2019re in a busy city it\u2019s a dream, you have on tap the launch power of a \u00a31m+ exclusive hyper car for run costs of a Toyota Prius. This is the essence of what\u2019s insane about it, any other brand you go to you would need to drop very serious cash, multiples of a Tesla price, to get anywhere near the same drive train quality. Here\u2019s my friend trying the P100D for the first time. The speedometer reads in miles, so that\u2019s a 0 - ~105kmh. It feels like you\u2019re in the Space Mountain in Disneyland every single time.  If you skid in a Tesla, you\u2019ll be the first, that\u2019s how insane the power delivery/traction system is. It\u2019s not fun in the controlled drifts way, it\u2019s fun in the \u201choly craaaap\u201d way. You get used to it after 1 - 2 months, but 0 - 60 in 2.28s seconds or whatever makes all other cars obsolete in city driving, and unlike sports cars, it doesn\u2019t cost you a small monthly fortune to be naughty in a Tesla all the time. Quite literally, nothing, not even a Bugatti, can hold a candle to you in city traffic. Seriously: List of fastest production cars by acceleration - Wikipedia. When the worlds most expensive Ferrari or insert name here creeps up in front of you at the traffic light, it\u2019s amusing and entertaining. Nobody can ever overtake you from a standstill, and there\u2019s no such thing as an yellow light anymore, which come in quite handy if you can use them responsibly. That kind of launch power in a petrol car is a major event, it means launch control, good grip, no wheel-spin, good weather, dry road, even road surface etc. In a Tesla it\u2019s business as usual, all day every day, every time you floor it you\u2019re flying, you don\u2019t even think about it, it feels like you\u2019re playing an unrealistic PC car game. Driving a Lambo like car through the city at that speed of flow is impossible, any car with anywhere near the performance to 60mph would be too low(close to the ground) and too compromised to compete, you\u2019d have to cause very serious damage to the car to keep up with the Tesla. \u201cReally? Tesla vs Lambo? Reality check please\u201d. I\u2019ll let you judge for yourself, courtesy of DragTimes, Model S P100D vs Aventador SV Launch Control. I\u2019ve tried that competition in person, in my own SV. Without launch control, the SV has a very unimpressive throttle response, there\u2019s almost 1.5 seconds of delay in between flooring it and it starting to move. The Tesla simply flies.  Here\u2019s a cuter sample, courtesy of a dear friend and his son.  Run costs are near 0 It\u2019s not cheap to buy, but after that life gets a whole lot easier, unlike other cars(especially performance ones), which generally require a continuous forking of cash for things every month. Without oil to replace, break pads and discs to worry about, anti-freeze and a lot of the petrol engine saga, there\u2019s almost never a reason to open up your wallet again. Mine was a fairly expensive, 6 figure price tag, high spec P100D. Ever since? \u00a3300 on a tire + replacement because of a nail, nada on all else, and still drove 2000km with a nail in the tire before it was found. I live near a supercharger which helps tremendously. Tires will wear out because of the acceleration, but they already behave much much better than other cars I\u2019ve owned, and 4 tires every 2 years is something I\u2019m happy with. Servicing is run on a 0 profit model. Maybe the most amazing and understated feature of being a Tesla customer is the way they don\u2019t try to rip you off in a service. Owning other brands, at even higher price ranges, has meant a very off putting routine of every 3 weeks visiting lets say Mercedes Service, for this reason or the other, all at a very very heavy premium. They always take forever, cost a fortune, and don\u2019t care for you one bit, except for selling you stupidly expensive monthly care packages that don\u2019t actually end up covering for anything.. If you call Mercedes, you go through 5 answering machines, and you have this back and forth test of patience with their absolutely idiotic phone system. It\u2019s not possible to call your service technician directly, they never have a replacement car, and when they do it\u2019s not even supplied by Mercedes, but a third party company, etc. If you want to get things done fast, they tell you to come at 8AM, you turn up and you\u2019re casually told service technicians are not in until 11AM, things like that. The best or nothing as they say, so you truly get the nothing because it\u2019s cheaper for them to make it happen. If Mercedes is the most incompetent car brand of all time at post sales, Tesla is the very best there ever was. If you call them from a known phone number in their system, by the time someone picks up the phone, they will know who you are and what care you\u2019re on about. Mobile technicians are deployed, and there\u2019s never a talk of cost estimates, because warranty means warranty in Tesla, and that\u2019s pretty amazing. I had a door mirror replaced post a minor incident, no one ever talked about dollars. Government likes you buying EVs(at least in the UK) The purchase terms of an EV are very friendly, and the Tesla staff has been extremely useful in pointing out the correct channels. A \u00a35k government contribution, no congestion charge(otherwise, \u00a311.50 per day), no fuel no matter how you drive, and barely any consumables(no engine oil, no break pad/disc wear due to regenerative breaking etc). Business owners choosing to purchase EVs are allowed to do so pre-tax, unlike all other types of cars, with a significantly decreased tax burden for benefits in kind, which will go to an even lower 2% in 2020. Leases are very competitive, so the conversation starts at half the APR your average dealer would begin talking to you. With New Inventory, I have been offered an APR of <1%, which is a steal. There\u2019s a lot of space There\u2019s more trunk and frunk space than in almost any other car, and short of buying a semi-truck, you won\u2019t get more load capacity buying from the competition. This is pretty cool if you have a family to carry around. I generally carry everything I need to carry, which my one laptop bag, in the frunk, so it doesn\u2019t wobble around as I drive through the city like I\u2019m auditioning for a role with McLaren\u2019s F1 team. It\u2019s really convenient, and you do feel the car has great light permeability, the sunroof is really fun, and the really big windscreen is pretty cool, there are barely any blind spots when driving, and it\u2019s a great feeling of openness. The autopilot is incredible If you\u2019ve never trusted your car to drive itself before, it takes some getting used to, but you\u2019ll never go back. If you\u2019re tired, drowsy, on your way back from work on a late night, it\u2019s perfect. I am comparing it to one of my other cars, a Mercedes with Distronic technology, which will casually steer into adjacent lanes, not keep pace etc. Cruise control/distronic are highly useful on a motorway, urban use is a problem, though Mercedes explicitly warn you against using Distronic in the city. The Tesla is pretty spot on at all times, and I\u2019ve done 2000 miles plus in a single journey on autopilot, taking over only for roadwork areas, where lane markings are confusing, and I\u2019ve done it at 95mph/150kph, the car can be trusted. Hands off the steering allowed only up to 20 seconds, so for now it\u2019s not fully autonomous, more of a \u201cparty trick\u201d. If you ignore the car\u2019s warnings to put your hands back on the steering, auto-steering will become unavailable for the rest of your current journey.If you drive at 150kph in autopilot and press the acceleration, auto-steering is also automatically disabled, so the car will penalise you for trying to be too naughty.Confusing lane markings, such as new lanes on old road, roadworks, etc, will nearly always confuse it, so watch out.Below is a video of me doing 150kph with the Tesla autopilot, intentionally driving at the max speed possible, on a completely empty road and perfect weather conditions. Great scenery too.  Most of the interior is pawned from Mercedes The indicators and many elements of the steering column are borrowed from Daimler, because they are exactly the same as in my S class and I\u2019m sure other Mercs. If you\u2019re used to a Merc, you can jump straight into a Tesla, and your reflexes work instantly. The best part is that there\u2019s no on/off in a Tesla, no button to press. You simply put it in drive mode and off you go. At the end you press the P button at the end of your mode switch and done, no off button. That\u2019s quite fun.Bad The car feels really cheap In spite of its very generous price tag, the quality of everything you touch is on par with a car 1/4th of its price or less. Note, it\u2019s a good looking car, and I don\u2019t want to try and account for taste, but the interior looks like an entry level Ford or worse. Many people love the \u201cminimalistic\u201d approach, however they tend to be people who don\u2019t have the experience of owning a Tesla or if they have a Tesla they\u2019ve never owned another car of a similar price tag, so they cannot compare. Interior wise, it\u2019s a 2.5 out 10 for the Tesla. It\u2019s a little bit of an unfair comparison, as the price gap from a 75D to a P100D is mostly battery and tires, and they are not secretive about that in any way, but I still feel mass producing the interior could be done better, and in time I have no doubt it will. Over the years Tesla has always incrementally upgraded every detail about the car. This is about comparing a 6 figure priced car with other cars in a similar range. The consumption range is too dramatic. Being a wildfire traffic hopper can mean you have to charge every 2 days, up to 75%. It\u2019s pretty incredible, but in Ludicrous+ the range calculator is another piece of decorative kit. The computer is simply pretty useless at adapting to individual driving habits, location, or recent consumption, instead of re-working your averages, it provides you with a false rolling instant value. E.g you\u2019ve done 800Wh/mile until now, we\u2019re still going to assume you are going to do 250Wh/mile until destination. That means in city traffic and power driving, you could get as little as 120 miles of range in total and Mr computer is largely useless at warning you in advance.The paintwork sucks, it\u2019s really really crappy, and it gets dirty all the time, and it just looks cheap. It also costs \u00a31000, which is insane, because it\u2019s 100% not worth it. A paint job in a base spec Mercedes is another world apart quality wise. Same story for the rims and wheels, cheap stuff with cheap paint over it, sold in a very expensive wheel upgrade package.The car has out of the box LTE internet/connection, but it\u2019s really poor, and as soon as you\u2019re out of the home country, good luck. The number of times the GPS crapped out, or Spotify stopped working, too many to count, so it\u2019s a completely unreliable connection. You can pay and add your own SIM card in the car, which improves life a lot.The steering wheel is way way too big and uncomfortable and nowhere nimble enough, that whole steering column could do with a massive upgrade. It makes it tiring for long drives, and manoeuvrability is terrible, the turning radius is only slightly smaller than the circumference of the Earth.The headlights are too powerful, to the point where other motorway users constantly flash you to warn you you\u2019re on full beam, even when you\u2019re really not.The car feels like its made of cardboard entirely, and the door feels like it weighs 500 grams, but not in a good way. No soft close, no nicety features, leather is very poor quality, no massage seats, no seat cooling, no proper seat settings(lumbar support etc).Cry me a river I know, but these are all common features in other cars of similar price. When you slam the door to close it, which you have to, it feels like you\u2019re about to tear it in half. Other cars in this price range will always have soft close.The lights inside the car, both interior and the trunk/frunk are useless. I don\u2019t know how they managed to cheap out on these, but it\u2019s painfully annoying, dinner candles in the 15th century were much more powerful. There\u2019s also no 12V socket in the trunk or frunk(seriously???).It\u2019s completely missing on the nicety features you\u2019d expect, like a decent set of air vents. Everything is cheap cheap cheap, and doesn\u2019t really work at all in very hot weather, where you have to drive with the ol\u2019 windows open technique.The cupholder system is a nightmare, and the storage space is pretty useless for a car of its acceleration. There\u2019s nowhere to put stuff to prevent it from flying all over when you floor it, it\u2019s very poorly thought through as a performance vehicle. If you don\u2019t drive like you\u2019re trying to beat Ayrton Senna theres plenty of space.The sound system is decent but could be better too, in spite of the Dolby Digital surround sound etc, it\u2019s not on par even with the entry level sound systems in cars of similar price(S Class Coupe, Range Rover Autobiography, Aston Martins, Bentleys etc etc).The performance is inconsistent, after you floor it a few times and accelerate all the way to motorway speeds, the car will cut you back significantly to prevent battery overheating. This happens very very quickly. In a petrol car, I can be wild all day long on a track, in a Tesla I\u2019d be out of juice in one lap.The front windscreen is great for visibility, not so great for direct sunlight. Fortunately not often a problem in the UK. You get massive sun glares or condensation from battery heat all the time. I don\u2019t know how you make something this bad, a 20 year old Vauxhall(Opel) Astra does better.It\u2019s physically very hard to see in front of you on a sunny day, and it\u2019s a basic thing in any other car. Not in a Tesla.The windscreen wipers are extremely feeble, and consequentially when you drive at speed/wind, they look like they are about to fly off, and barely work. They are too thin and cheap, especially for the massive windscreen they have to deal with.The GPS is completely useless through a busy city, it has no knowledge of traffic whatsoever, constantly takes you down poor routes, and so on. It\u2019s a decorative piece unless you\u2019re driving long range.Top end Teslas are not as fun for petrolheads Having a Tesla is quite fun for the engineer inside you, and for the futuristic geek inside all of us, but the inner child is left with a bitter taste of disappointment. If you\u2019re a real car fanatic/adrenaline junkie, you might want to skip buying a Tesla, for now, because it\u2019s dtill a heavy sedan with a big turning radius, so not the thing you would take to the track. Kills at the drag strip though. The straight line speed is fun for the first month, but the truth is 6 figures on a car will never ever make any financial sense, unless you\u2019re buying a big semi-truck and your name is DHL. It\u2019s a straight up vanity purchase, no two ways about it, especially in the higher echelons of Tesla pricing, but it\u2019s missing any kind of excitement whatsoever. Not really the biggest problem in the world, but if you buy a toy for the entertainment value and smiles per electrons, Tesla is probably not your top choice. It\u2019s absolutely incredible for the city though, probably one of the best daily drivers out there, for any amount of money. The interior, the lack of sound, the poor interior lightning, and the various details remove the sense of occasion and excitement, no matter which model you buy. Other cars for the same money would either give you serene luxury you would enjoy every time(S Class, Audi A8, Porsche Panamera etc), or full on boy racer noise and performance, as well as great luxury(Mercedes C63S/E63S/S63 Coupe). It\u2019s also dangerously close to the price of a barely used Lambo Huracan, McLaren 570S or a Ferrari 458, which are extremely fun cars to own. With a Lambo/McLaren/F Car, you know you spent the money at all times, and at all speeds, it just feels amazing and even going to the supermarket is an occasion, in a Tesla it\u2019s too civilised, which makes buying a top end Tesla even more unjustifiable, since you don\u2019t really need drag strip record times for the city. Longer journey? Double up the time Longer journeys take much longer, anything above 500 miles requires serious planning&math. If you\u2019re a statistics nut like I am(life of the party I know), it\u2019s pretty cool, and a bit scary. The consumption in a Tesla increases far more than in a petrol car depending on your driving. I\u2019m comparing a P100D with the average performance petrol car, which is why the mpg figures are quite low versus the average car. Motorway cruising at 70mph, ideal weather conditions. Tesla: 200 - 240Wh/kmSports Car: 20mpg - 22mpg or 14L/100km. Motorway cruising at 100mph(Autobahn in Germany, ideal weather conditions. Tesla: 400 - 450Wh/kmSports Car: 16mpg - 17mpg or 17L/100km. If you\u2019re doing that kind of long range you want to keep a good speed, but you simply can\u2019t or you\u2019ll miss your next charge. In a Tesla, you are constantly calculating and optimising. Do I drive faster because the battery charges faster in the initial phase, so it\u2019s fine to end up at destination with less charge? Do I keep pace? Have I accounted for wind? Why am I doing 300Wh/km at the same speed as I was doing 250Wh/km earlier? Oh, 1% elevation, hmm. All part of the fun. Like in no other car, you get to feel first hand how changes in weather conditions, elevation/incline, road surface changes, affect \u201cfuel economy\u201d, because Tesla is kind enough to give you a live rolling chart. As a rule of thumb, you will lose 40 - 50% of the excess miles. E.g if your next supercharger is 200 miles away, I would charge for 300 miles, and hope to have 50 - 60 miles of range left at destination. Even at constant speed, the GPS estimates are way off. You will always arrive earlier than predicted, with less range left, even if you autopilot at constant speed all the way there. Realistically you will need to stop every 250 - 300 miles, and spend 40 min - 1 hour each time. Supercharger coverage is still a problem, for now It\u2019s absolutely amazing that you can drive so far and for free, but it\u2019s not something you can take for granted just yet. For one, the European coverage for Tesla is pretty scarce. You can get from A to B for most of it, but not efficiently. It looks good on a map but compared to petrol stations it\u2019s nothing, for now. You incur a significant number miles added to your journey, just so you can pass through superchargers. On a 700 mile journey in a petrol car, you might do 1000+ in a Tesla, not even accounting for the charge time. If you\u2019re in France/Italy, you will pay additionally for every charge, as you\u2019ll go in and out of the same motorway to access the chargers. It can be as much as 2 -3 times the toll charges in a normal car, if you do this very often it could be meaningful. Superchargers are rarely located in places normal gas pumps are, and have no service industry around them yet. That means you may or may not get a toilet at your next stop, which in long range mode can be fun. If you\u2019re lucky, you end up near a shopping centre. This is in Orange, France. The GPS on the car will tell you what facilities await at your next stop, so you can in theory pick and choose, but in practice this can add huge mileage to your journey.  Most Superchargers in France have turned out to be \u201cin the middle of nowhere\u201d, in the courtyard of some hotel etc etc. It\u2019s a little bit weird stopping for an hour at 2AM in complete darkness in the middle of a field. Value for money Looking at the competition, say S Class, spending \u00a375k for a base model is a whole other world from dropping \u00a3140k on an S63 AMG, or a used Maybach, completely different planet. Looking at a Maybach vs an S560 is a visible, obvious, world apart difference, no one would wonder where the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 went. In a Tesla, it\u2019s the same car with slightly more range and acceleration. I know this falls more in the \u201ccry me a river\u201d segment of the market, but equally, you expect something for your hard earned dollar or GBP, which Tesla somewhat fails to deliver on. They are very upfront about it, more money = more power and more battery, but it\u2019s a whole lot of money \u201cjust for that\u201d. The option list is both surprisingly short and expensive. A little more software/equipment, some autopilot fancy gear that\u2019s not legal yet, and a bit more battery, for \u201cjust\u201d twice the price of the base spec. As a normal sensible consumer, this is somewhat extreme. It\u2019s certainly the cheapest \u201ccity focused Lamborghini\u201d you can buy, but beyond that the pricing structure really makes no sense in terms of value for money, and I would probably struggle to justify spending the same again. The sensible thing is to buy a mid range Tesla and save half the price-tag, and still get everything except the acceleration. Not being able to floor it in a Lambo through the city isn\u2019t exactly the mass market problem solving Elon had in mind, but ironically it\u2019s kind of all you get in the P100D. Conclusion: You\u2019re paying for a power train, battery tech, and technology. You won\u2019t get a fancy car, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after don\u2019t spend that kind of money on a Tesla just yet. Go half the price and get a Lexus hybrid instead. The car is really amazing in one way, a little boring in another. Overall the best piece of commuting/city gear you could ever have, though P100 models are ultimately an expensive toy. Love of Tesla: Having \u201ctalked it down\u201d so much, I do feel the need to re-enforce the insane capability of this car is very addictive. Even if you\u2019re fortunate enough to have driven crazy cars, yes it would get more feel, but you would not have more acceleration and torque, and the lack of sound is replaced by the consistent \u201choly sh******t\u201d launch power at every single traffic light. Update(after 12 months of owning it): The honeymoon phase is now long over. The performance is still there, the run cost is still brilliant, but Tesla as a company is sometimes showing some fairly ugly colours. Tires lasted quite well, got a comfortable few mm of thread depth left. If you knew how I drive, in Ludicrous Plus constantly, that\u2019s an insanely impressive thing, nearly 20k miles later. Loss in traction is noticeable, and I\u2019m certainly way more careful in the wet than I was on fresh tires. At some point the \u00a31k replacement cost will be unavoidable, in the next few months.Range is a big lie. 10 - 15% lost to software updates, restricting max charges further and further. I haven\u2019t seen a number starting with 300 since the day I took delivery of the car. As detailed further above, do not trust the range of the car.Charging speed has decreased massively. It used to be you would drive to the supercharger with 10% - 15% and it would bump straight up to around 114kw - 117kw pretty much straight away, and stay there till the battery was nearly 80% when you could go home. No longer, the car now only goes to 85, then slowly to 95 and so on. It may be a software update to preserve battery life, however you have less range and longer charges.No yellow cornering on the screen which lots of other people report, but it\u2019s definitely a pain in the a**, it randomly resets itself, as you drive, or as you follow the sat nav, for no apparent reason. Music cut offs etc for about 30 seconds while the screen reboots for no apparent reason.Suspension isn\u2019t proving very reliable. 1 year in and squeaks and creaks from everyone single corner possible. Car went to service and got cleaned by Tesla engineers under warranty, all back to normal now, no squeaks and creaks.HEPA filter had to be replaced after 14 months, around \u00a3186 inclusive of VAT from Tesla. Not terrible and done same day, however it\u2019s a consumable and not under warranty.Software updates coming constantly have actually made the car a lot worse. Now it barely ever reads speed limits properly. While the AP is fully trustworthy, it won\u2019t change speed limits, so you have to pay attention a lot more or you might get a speeding ticket and those lovely points on your license.Completely new design delivered around 5 months ago, and I hate it with a passion. They\u2019ve made it more Model 3 like, but it\u2019s absolutely stupid, various things on the touch screen overlap, as if it wasn\u2019t hard enough already to touch things accurately while driving.The Dolby Digital surround system constantly gets deactivated as an option for no reason whatsoever, which drives me crazy, and nothing I do seems to affect that at all, I have to remember to re-enable it every time I get in the car, which is not great for an audiophile such as myself, the sound system is pretty terrible anyway even if you go for the high end option, at least compared with proper in car audio systems.Would I buy one again? The answer is absolutely not, I got carried away by very low interest and tax benefits, and Ludicrous acceleration, but the honest to god answer is that I simply don\u2019t enjoy driving it at all, it\u2019s far too basic, too plastic and too crappy for the enormous price tag. I don\u2019t dislike the car, but similarly I never look forward to drive it, and all I keep thinking is I could\u2019ve bought x y z make and model instead.It\u2019s coming from a place where I am fortunate that run cost isn\u2019t my number one concern, but it\u2019s been the only reason why I kept it, it\u2019s very hard to say no to driving around for an extremely small cost, again when considering the performance. Like I said above, buying it is pricey, after you pay close to nothing beyond insurance. However, for the buy price of the car, I personally want a lot more.Value retention, Luxury, exclusivity, convenience, and a feeling of being able to drive it endlessly, like an S class, where after 15 hours of driving you don\u2019t get that \u201csticky\u201d feel of having been in a car for that long, you feel quite good.None of this come with a Tesla, and 99% of Tesla owners are extremely fanatic, but the reality is the majority of them don\u2019t come from a high vantage point, and it\u2019s by far the most expensive car they ever bought. Yes it may be better than a Honda Accord, but for many times the price tag isn\u2019t that implied?The worst Tesla experience so far After a bump traffic so light that not even the paintwork on the car is damaged, the steering felt really funny, so naturally I pulled over into a side road, and phoned my beloved highly competent Tesla assistance. They quite literally told me to f off, there\u2019s no other way to put it nicely. They said it\u2019s not their problem, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to tow it to a Tesla depot(even if I offered to pay for this separately), and that the car is no longer safe to drive. Insult to injury and acid pour on it in the span of a 10 second conversation. I had the extreme luck this happened 2 miles from home, where it was manageable, had it been 3AM in the middle of nowhere, the messiah of all car companies would\u2019ve had me stranded useless in the middle of nowhere, no their problem of course, the nearly 150k they billed me for the car just a few months earlier had long been forgotten from memory. Thanks to good friends, I made my way back home, and the next day after insurance told me they are happy to help/cover the costs, but the car should go to a Tesla garage since no one else can repair a Tesla, low and behold, it was entirely possible to pay and have the car towed. What in the actual f*ck? A very nice Joe shoes up 3 hours later with a tow truck, and while on the phone with his boss/colleague, he politely asks me to dictate my credit card details so he could further dictate them on the phone. I thought he was joking, but no, he was dead serious. I told him no way josay, take cash or no deal. One cash machine trip later, the saga ends, the car is loaded on the tow truck and off it goes. Or so I thought. The wonderful people at Tesla politely informed a new steering rack is required, post my 2mph barely any paintwork damage hit, for the great price of nearly \u00a34000 inclusive of VAT. How wonderful, the steering rack mechanism can be completely destroyed by softly blowing air towards it, the build quality is insanely poor, more so than any other car I have ever owned, including a 20 year Vauxhall Astra I drove for a long time, with 200k miles on it and no problems. The truth? I\u2019m seriously hoping this was a bad assistant on the other end of the phone, because this has felt like a slap in the face, which after the latest massive price drop adds a little bit of insult to injury. I\u2019ve got a car worth a lot less than what I anticipated it would be worth, and a service quality that seems to fluctuate a lot based on who you get on the phone. ",
