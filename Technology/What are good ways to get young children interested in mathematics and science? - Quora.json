            "answer_text": "Young children enjoy being read to, and there are several books which can spark a love of numbers and mathematics. My first recommendation is, \"How much is a million\" by David M. Schwatrz. Children as young as 4 will enjoy this. Another book is \"G is for Googol: A Math Alphabet Book\" by the same author, this book can be enjoyed by children reading at a second grade level.  The series \"Magic School Bus\" is an animated TV series available on DVD and in book form is a great way to interest children in science. It covers biology, ecology, weather systems, and much more. Finally, you as a parent or mentor are the greatest influence. Model an interest in science and \"think out loud\" about how you observe the world and it's many connections around you. They will quickly think and act as you do. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many different ways, and it depends on the child and how old they are. Making slime can be fun and educational. Figuring out how much further the trip to a place they want to go using road markers. There are a lot of fun games that use math and science. Heck even the dreaded Legos can teach math. Addition and multiplication to figure out how many legos to build a wall 4 bricks high if it takes 10 bricks to go around an area. I found a lot of resources by searching for educational game websites and teacher resources. And it was all free and sorted by age group. ",
