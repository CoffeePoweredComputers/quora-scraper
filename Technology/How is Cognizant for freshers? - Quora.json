            "answer_text": "After working for 2 years at Cognizant, I think I can answer this. After a long wait of around an year, got the joining location as Pune. We arrived a day before and began our search for accommodation. We didn't had much idea of Hingewadi, so the first place we stayed was Arusha hostel. First day we were supposed to report at phase 1 office, and since some of my engineering friends had also got the same joining location, we went together with all documents. Got the temporary pass, got the documents verified, and also we were told our training location as CDC. Now this campus was in phase 3, all surrounded by ghats and mountains, it was really fun getting there plus the craze we had for our 1st job. Then we were assigned our horizontals(technology) and verticals (Heath care, Banking, etc..) and our time table and classes were rolled out. Training was all fun. We learnt the basics of Java, SQL, and some behavioural lessons. Behavioural sessions used to happen post lunch and our trainer used to come and give some assignments which could be completed quickly. All the time after that was spent either outside at shops, or in cafeteria. Then there were also mandatory assessments which we had to clear. But you've enough dumps available that if you go through once, you'll surely make it. Some of them got less than 70, so they had to reattempt. But all in all, everyone clears in the end. Some crazy girls spent there time sipping on coffees in pantry, while some guys booked a zoom car and better utilized the post lunch session. You get Saturday and Sunday off, with your first salary in pocket, and you feel like this is it. How 3 months passed We didn't come to know. MFRP is my first real project which everyone has to submit to clear their training. It was fun to visit each others hostel late night, getting source codes fixed, creating presentations for project, and cooking for ourselves. I can tell you, if you get your joining location as Pune, then those 3 months are going to be craziest time you'd ever have had. You've got bikes available on rent easily in Hinjewadi just google it out. Do visit places, go to ghats around, go to Lavassa, go to lonavala late night, go to KP for good food, stroll around FC road for vibes... etc. Make the most out of that time, but also make sure you clear your assessments well. Do ping me if you need to know what's where, and how to do that. Post training life is different, let me not delve into that for now! If you've read this far, give a thumbs-up and share your comments. Do check out this link if you're interested : Prashant Dixit's answer to After training at cognizant what will happen? ",

            "answer_text": "Even though it mostly depends on the project, we at Cognizant have an upper hand with respect to many other service based companies. Why? See below for some points:1. No strict working hours : Yes, you don't have to spend 9 - 9.5 hours daily in office as it is not criteria for appraisal and no one will ask about office hours if you complete your work timely.2. No Dress Code: We have all day business casual Dress code policy and until your dress is decent (as per business/cognizant policy like no shorts etc), you can wear anything. 3. Friendly Environment: Most of the teams have very friendly environment for work in offices, they talk, enjoy, take 2-3 good breaks without any problems from higher management (As I said, keep your work complete on time)4. Friendly Management: One can argue about this point, but it is true that managers in Cognizant are mostly friendly, depends on how much one involves with them.5. Awesome Learning: We have a big repository for learning whatever you want. Now that CCA (Cognizant Career Architecture) came into picture for most of the employee, it will be mandatory now to keep yourself updated and busy in learning for skills according to employee's role.6. App for Everything: Whatever process (requesting something, timesheet, policy, gsd, payrole, profle and almost anything) you want to do in Cognizant, it has app for every single thing! Just go t OneCognizant and search by keyword. Very simplified process.7. Not much Hidden Policies: Many companies have policies about which employee do not aware of until they face it during times of requesting transfer, relocation, project change, separation. In Cognizant, most of the policies are documented and you can easily look and decide accordingly. Although there would be some policies which only managers will be knowing as per BU recommendations.8. Training: Ah! the best period I spent in Cognizant! It was really fun. Training period is Mon-Sat 9 to 6. But it is a chill training, mainly to teach people, who came from College that how is it working in Organization apart from some basic job related skills. The assessments are not difficult and you get lots of guidance from senior batches. A lots of fun activities will be there and you will make lots of great friends there and love hanging out with them. I bet, you will miss the awesome training life when it is completed. The only thing lagging now is the Bell Curve Ratings which is still followed in Cognizant, although it has its goods (ex. most employee come in average atleast) and bads (ex. promotions becomes limited), Cognizant is also closely following the result of Bell Curve Rating removal in other companies as Infosys, Deloitte etc before they decide to implement it! So all in all, Cognizant is one of the best service companies to work for! ",
