            "answer_text": "Magic is too unspecific thing for anyone to say. One analogy might be one that's commonly told about guns versus bows. One session at a shooting range convinced me rifles were a far better weapon than bows except for being noisy. However, early guns are typically portrayed as slow to reload, dangerous to the user, unreliable and usually inaccurate. Still they spread at the expense of bows before they had become better in many ways because of ease of use. If magicians need extensive training technology will push magic aside for serious use. ",

            "answer_text": "If we could accomplish things by magic we wouldn't spend as much time learning how things happen naturally, more time learning how the magic happens instead. while it is not proof that magic doesn't exist there is something called an argument from usefulness. It goes like this, it magic is so real and so powerful and is so useful, as many psychics and spell casters claim, why is it not being taught in every University on the planet and used by every major money-making corporation? Perhaps because magic simply doesn't work, ever, and never has. ",
