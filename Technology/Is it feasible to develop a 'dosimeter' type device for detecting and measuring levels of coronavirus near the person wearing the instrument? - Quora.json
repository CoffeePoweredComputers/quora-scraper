But it will be a very \u201con/off\u201d detection, and may not trigger on any but those showing massive symptoms. I will however say \u201cno\u201d, and point out that it is not \u201chow much total\u201d you have been exposed to, but \u201chow much in so many minutes\u201d. More like a Geiger Mueller tube with some short term integration. ",

            "answer_text": "If they could measure the virus in your air space then it would be too late. There were ideas that all smart phone owners could be alerted if people with positive tests in the last two weeks were in your vicinity. Apple and Amazon published identical programs early in the pandemic but they didn\u2019t warn you. Only 50,000 downloaded them because they didn\u2019t help you but made you traceable. The Big Brother watching was a deal breaker ",
