            "answer_text": "Q: What would happen if every non-Muslim read the Quran? A: Personally, I tried reading the Quran, I really did, but it\u2019s sooooo boring, I\u2019ve already waded through the prequel, the Bible, twice. And that was boring as hell, not to mention ludicrously unrealistic. I\u2019m going to wait until a religion produces evidence of its gods before I waste my precious time reading its myths. Pointing at an book that kinda, sorta resembles real life isn\u2019t evidence, it\u2019s special pleading at best. Apologetics isn\u2019t evidence, it\u2019s lame excuses for the lack of evidence. Your personal beliefs or experiences aren\u2019t evidence, unless you can reproduce them, and they aren\u2019t explicable by other means. Learn what evidence is, find some, present it. I\u2019m not going to be intimidated into accepting religions with threats and violence, or promises of a great sex life after I die, in a place I can\u2019t show even exists, because, you know, evidence. You need evidence and reason, the one thing religions are set up to avoid at all costs, that\u2019s why they have to behead teachers and drive trucks through crowds, they can\u2019t scare illiterates with tall tales any more, so they fly planes into buildings and elect orange dictator idiots to high office instead. It\u2019s extremely unlikely that any rational person would be persuaded by reading the Quran, you might convince a few religious types to switch religions, but unbelievers won\u2019t be fooled, very little would change.

And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing\u2026 but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun(the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)\u201d Quran (4:89) \u201cThey wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah . But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper.\u201d Quran (4:95) \u201cNot equal are those believers remaining [at home] \u2013 other than the disabled \u2013 and the mujahideen, [who strive and fight] in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred the mujahideen through their wealth and their lives over those who remain [behind], by degrees. And to both Allah has promised the best [reward]. But Allah has preferred the mujahideen over those who remain [behind] with a great reward -\u201c Quran (5:33) \u201cIndeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment,\u201d Quran (8:59-60) \u201cAnd let not those who disbelieve think they will escape. Indeed, they will not cause failure [to Allah ]. And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know [but] whom Allah knows. And whatever you spend in the cause of Allah will be fully repaid to you, and you will not be wronged.\u201d I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m beginning to get some bad vibes here. I\u2019m not sure having more people reading it would be such a good thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Mere reading the Qur'an is NO big deal. It is reading with the sole intention of finding out what the scripture says ,IS the big deal. Reading it with a free mind, without any bias, and with the aim of seeking to know the truth about what it says,that is important. If you do that, I promise you that you may end up becoming a Muslim because you will find out that all what non Muslims thought and said about the Qur'an is the complete opposite of what is inside. You may burst into tears with emotion. So prepare for that. One advice though, you are required to say a little prayer and ask God to Protect you from the accursed Satan, so that you will NOT be distracted from reading it by him, and you will also encounter lots of curses against Satan inside the book. However, if you know cannot be able to cleanse your heart of bias, then I highly recommend that you FIRST of all, read the authentic biography of the Prophet Muhammad (s) BEFORE you start reading the Qur'an. The reason is that when you read his biography, you will find out without an iota of doubt, that such a man will NEVER dare to tell a single LIE about God. It will give you the confidence to read the Qur'an without any bias. Cheers and best of luck. ",
