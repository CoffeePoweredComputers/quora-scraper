            "answer_text": "Yes, there have been multiple scientific studies showing that. There were cases where the researcher took the same resume, and change nothing but the name (to a male name or a female name), and they got significantly fewer invitations to interviews. And when employers are asked to rate those resumes, ones with female names get rated lower in things like technical competency, but higher in things like communication skills. Even though they are exactly identical resumes beside the name. In the US women have same rights as men, but the culture still expects them to behave in a certain way (and also for men to behave in a certain way). ",
