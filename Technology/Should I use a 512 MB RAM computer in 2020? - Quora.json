            "answer_text": "Not if you are running windows. 512 MB of RAM is not enough for Windows 10 and any windows system that will work in 512MB is no longer supported and not at all secure. You can run Linux but you would need really pick a light x windows manager or just run in command line. To be honest no you can\u2019t really do much with a 512MB computer in 2020. You really want a computer with 8GB of ram or 16x more. ",
