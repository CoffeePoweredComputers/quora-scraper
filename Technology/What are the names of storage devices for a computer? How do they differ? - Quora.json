USB flash drive, jump drive, or thumb driveMemory cardMemory stickSSDOnline and cloud: Storing data online and in cloud storage is becoming popular as people need to access their data from more than one device. Cloud storageNetwork mediaPaper storage: Punch cardEarly computers had no method of using any of the above technologies for storing information and had to rely on paper. Today, these forms of storage are rarely used or found. In the picture to the right is an example of a woman entering data to a punch card using a punch card machine. OMRPunch cardWhy is storage needed in a computer? Without a storage device, a computer can not save or remember any settings or information and would be considered a dumb terminal. Although a computer can run with no storage device, it would only be able to view information unless it was connected to another computer that had storage capabilities. Even a task such as browsing the Internet requires information to be stored on your computer. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow, that is a horribly complex question. Even considering just data storage, you can run the gamut from between pen-and-paper all the way to holographic data storage to the nerve cells in your brain. I\u2019m going to not really answer your question and leave a set of considerations when thinking about storage and/or examples of storage\u2026 as with all interesting tech applications, some of these considerations are more of a function of your storage format or the software that\u2019s written to let you consume the storage rather than something inherent to the hardware or media itself. Is this read-only (e.g. pen-and-paper) or read-write (e.g. pencil-and-paper)? Even read-write may not be infinite / be subject to limitations.What is the maximum capacity for data storage, and what drives that (e.g. areal density for a hard drive)?How fast is the read/write throughput? Is the storage optimized for read vs. write? (e.g. Amazon Glacier storage is great for writing archival data but can require a longer time to access it when you need it).Is there any redundancy or error correction?How is the storage device accessed? (e.g. a local hard disk vs. cloud storage vs. physical media like CDs/DVDs)How much does the storage cost, and how much more does it cost to incrementally add storage capacity? (Cloud storage is great for elasticity)? How much does it cost to maintain? (CapEx vs. OpEx\u2026 don\u2019t forget the cost of who you have to hire to manage it)What kind of data am I storing? (e.g. structured data from a database, or files that sit on a server, etc.)How durable is the storage?How easy is it to transfer the information from this storage to another? (How portable is the data I have in the storage?)How is the data in the storage protected (e.g. zero-knowledge encryption)?How is the data recorded (e.g. block storage vs. object storage), and does that matter to me?Is the device meant to store ephemeral data (e.g. in-memory cache that can be lost if a server shuts down) vs. persisted data?There are even more considerations for above for people working in the field (e.g. legal compliance, disaster recovery, etc.) managing storage for large enterprises or organizations. Your particular application (what you want to do with that storage) affect your specific needs. In short, data storage is a big problem with lots of different solutions. There are a lot of flavors of storage out there. Thinking about examples from history, the present, and the future can be a pretty big task. =) ",
