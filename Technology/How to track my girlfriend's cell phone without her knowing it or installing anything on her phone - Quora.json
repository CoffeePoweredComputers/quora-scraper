            "answer_text": "I saw from your comments that you are concerned about someone doing this to you, but the answer is the same. I'm not going to tell you how to do it, and nobody here will, if they do, they are wrong (it won't work), omitting information or looking to get arrested. This action is illegal. Don't do it.You can't do it without installing something, you/they may not realize it was installed but something (malware) must be installed.Saying that they wouldn't know is a given, else it would just be a parental control app.This is often done by tricking the user into installing an app from an untrusted source, ie not on Google Play. If it's an iPhone, you can't unless the phone is jailbroken. If the user upgrades their iOS the jailbreak (and the hack) go away. For android, often upgrading the OS is helpful, but there is also security features that need to be turned off in order for these hacks to work. Android also has antivirus, which isn't the greatest but will work more often than not. I should note Android antivirus may have gotten better since I last looked at it, and it worked well enough even when I saw it. If anyone is caught hacking someone's cell phone in this way they are looking at 5 years+ prison time. If you think you are a victim of this, look around for a professional who will be able to discover it, often a small information security company. They will need your phone with full access to find out, so be prepared for that. If they find it, do not delete it - YET. Contact police first and see if they are willing to investigate. Unless the person using these types of hacks knows EXACTLY what they are doing they WILL get caught. The \"virus\" or trojan which spies on phones has to send the information somewhere, and police have ways of finding out who is the one picking the information up. Lastly, if your intention was to see if someone did this to you, don't ask how they did it, ask how to find outing they did. Hacking is not like what you see on TV. Real hacking is not exciting nor theatrical to watch. ",

If you distrust your girlfriend so much that you feel the need to track her movements through her cell phone then you should end your relationship now. Don\u2019t worry about tracking her cell, just break up and go your separate ways. You should seek counseling for your need to be controlling before you begin another relationship as well! ",

If you feel that your girlfriend is not trustable and she gives you headache on how you can track her cellphone, Then you are risking. It is better for you to stop that relationship with immediate effect. The reasons why a person would want the ways to track his girlfriends cellphone, is because you have realised that she might be cheating on you. The best solution is to dismantle that relationship so that you can come out of frustration. I know you may not buy that idea of mine but it can help you, rather than straining to look for things that are not appropriate. ",

I would like to give you an appropriate piece of advice; It is better you sit with her and ask her whether she is reaady for friendship or not. She can not threaten your life until you are disturbed. Tracking her may not be the best solution. I wonder if she can give you her phone to hold for a day, receiving calls and responding to texts. ",
