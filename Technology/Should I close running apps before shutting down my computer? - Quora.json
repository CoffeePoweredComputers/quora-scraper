            "answer_text": "Not all computer programs have decent checkpointing and recovery mechanisms. You might lose data. In some cases, you might lose a lot of data - months of data analysis, for instance, or a digital painting you\u2019ve been working on for weeks. Microsoft Word has such a long history of crashing and losing data that I believe it now has an autosave function. Kind of like Quora, your draft is automatically saved every few minutes. Most of the applications I use on Linux are sufficiently reliable that that hasn\u2019t been a consideration. If I just kill a drawing program or image editor I\u2019ll probably lose work. A planned shutdown sends processes a TERM signal then a KILL signal; in theory a well-written program will trap TERM and save open files, but mostly they don\u2019t. My normal text editor saves a keystroke file which can be replayed after an unexpected shutdown, but I have to manually do that then delete the file. Better to close the program myself in the first place and not leave a keystroke file. ",

            "answer_text": "In the current company where I am working in. We are obliged to close all of it. The logic behind that according to the supports is if ever the next person or if I myself will use the computer again they will experience latency/lagging on it. I just adapted it on my personal computer, I thought it is just I am using a failing hard drive that is why my pc is slowing down but after I make it a habit to close all the remaining apps before I shut down, I notice a big difference. Chrome and other apps are being pulled up right away whenever I open it. I dont have a monster spec but I guess if you got a ultra high end pc shutting down like a 1080ti sli, 32 gb ram and such other high end monster pc combo it wont really matter. ",
