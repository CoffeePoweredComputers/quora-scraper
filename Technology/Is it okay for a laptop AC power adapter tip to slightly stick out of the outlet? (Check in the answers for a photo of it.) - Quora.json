            "answer_text": "Not ideal but perfectly safe. It seems to indicate that either the laptop relative to the PSU was poorly designed or the wrong PSU is being used for the design. That being said as long as just one conductor is visible it should be fine. It's worth checking the PSU, it will have a symbol which indicates the polarity:  In your case I would prefer positive polarity (left) because it means that there is zero chance of you shorting anything out and breaking anything. With negative polarity there is an above zero chance that you might damage the laptop if you somehow* shorted that exposed metal to another connector on the laptop but no risk to your health. *I am envisaging something like a long metal necklace or exposed piece of wire touching the exposed metal and somewhere else on the laptop that is metal. This might, possibly cause an issue, but this is unlikely to happen. ",
