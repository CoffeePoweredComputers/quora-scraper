            "answer_text": "It really depends on how you define a smartphone.According to Wikipedia, the first mobile smartphone to integrate digital display is invented by IBM back in 1992, which has the essentials of being a \"phone\" but not much more than that.    The modern smartphone however included various elements that traditional \"phones\" by definition don't have, and that's what makes it unique:Such as personal diaries, data logging, calenders, and Instant messaging (IM) etc.Which means, the first \"smart\" device would resemble that of a Personal digital assistant (PDA), which was first invented by Psion in 1984.  More modern smartphones then include features such as a touchscreen, the Global Positioning System (GPS) and internet connectivity (Wifi), among others. Even though these more modern smartphones pop up here and there in late 1990's to early 2000's, it isn't until a very eventful day where suddenly everyone gone crazy about smartphones. And that is in 2007, the release of Apple's first iPhone.   Hence now here we are in 2015, in a society with people constantly having their heads pointed down the restaurant table staring at his facebook page because a high school mate he hasn't talked to in years posted yet another new status update and totally ignoring that you're paying the tip for that meal as well as consoling his girlfriend that because he looks at his phone even when making love does not mean he does not love her.
