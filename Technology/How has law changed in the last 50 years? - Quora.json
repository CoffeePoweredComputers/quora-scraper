            "answer_text": "You're kidding, right?  In the last 50 years?  And you think the internet was the only thing to change law.  Here are a few: 1. The copy machine.2. The fax machine.3. Word processing (computers).4.  LANs (I had internal email before I had access to the World Wide Web).5.  Computer assisted legal research (which has become cheaper and more accessible over the years).6.  The internet.  The amount of research that I can do online today which goes well beyond case law searches in data bases is amazing.        a. I can look up all SEC filings for almost any public company in seconds.         b.  If I want to know about an opposing party, most likely his linkedin profile will tell me what I want to know.         c.  I can order a variety of records and have them delivered in hours rather than weeks. But you confuse accessibility with the ability to use this information.  While substantially more information is available to you far cheaper than it used to be, without law school and some formal training as an attorney, you will likely do a poor job of using it. ",
