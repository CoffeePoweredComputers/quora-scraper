            "answer_text": "First note, it is not the software as such which is being patented, but the 'invention' which is implemented in software.  Anyone who uses that invention, no matter how it is implemented or in which language or even if they have developed the invention independently, will be infringing. In contrast, copyright only attaches to the software code itself, and is dependent on the programming language and implementation details. It's possible to reimplement the 'idea' behind a copyrighted software work in another language or even in the same one provided it doesn't rip off the 'expression' of the copyrighted work. So a patent is a stronger monopoly right than a copyright which is why people go for them. Arguably, the 'problem' with software patents is that the claims in software patent are sometimes a lot vaguer and broader than is to be desired. This creates uncertainty and enables some companies to leverage that vagueness against practising companies in order to extract royalties. Though some software patents might be genuinely pro-innovation-i.e where they protect high R&D costs, as in some 'codecs'- a large component of their value seems to be strategic: defensive use, as you say. They may also play an important role in attracting venture capital funding, see study here Do Patents Facilitate Financing in the Software Industry? ",
