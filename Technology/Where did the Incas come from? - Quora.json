            "answer_text": "Pretty much from where they were. The Andean coast had seen a long, long succession of civilizations stretching back to origins around 3500 BC, around the same time civilization appeared in Mesopotamia. Norte Chico, the Moche, Nazca, Wari, and other urban civilizations rose and fell over the millennia. The Inca empire in particular has its origin in the kingdom of Cusco in what\u2019s now inland southern Peru, founded in the 12th century. In the early 15th century, its ruler, Pachauti, the kingdom began an explosive expansion. Three generations later, the empire controlled a swathe of the west coast of South America stretching from modern Columbia through most of modern Chile. ",

            "answer_text": "Historically, the Kingdom of Cuzco preceded the Inca Empire, it lasted for about 200 years before becoming the Inca Empire. But I\u2019ll tell you the two myths we are told growing up in Peru about the origins of the empire. The first one, and the one that most people in Peru know, is the legend of Manco Capac and Mama Ocllo. They came out of the Titicaca Lake in Puno, as the children of Inti (Sun in Quechua). Manco Capac had a golden staff. He was instructed by Inti to settle where the staff sank. Manco Capac and Mama Ocllo kept traveling, until they ended up in the Cuzco Valley, where the staff sank, and that\u2019s where they decided to found the Kingdom of Cuzco. The second one is the legend of \u201cLos Hermanos Ayar\u201d, or \u201cThe Ayar Siblings\u201d. 8 siblings, 4 brothers, and each one had a sister, who was also his wife. They came out of the Pacaritambo mountain, somewhat close to Cuzco. They travelled, and eventually 3 of the 4 brothers died, one was trapped in a mountain, and the other 2 turned to stone. The last surviving brother founded the city of Cuzco. His name was Ayar Manco. He was later known as Manco Capac. So essentially both stories end with Manco Capac becoming the first ruler of the Inca, but has his origin near Cuzco, while the other has Manco\u2019s origin in Puno. ",
