These types of research usually trade statistical and sampling precision for cost\u001aeffective methods. As such, they can't be relied upon for major decisions, but are quite effective as a \"first warning\" mechanism to alert you of member and industry trends, issues, and impressions. Data collected informally is also an excellent starting point for more comprehensive efforts, or to quickly test an idea prior to a more rigorous study.\u201d \u201cThe term \"informal\" is not synonymous with \"un-planned.\" Source: Wayback Machine ",

            "answer_text": "Informal research is collecting and analyzing data/information in an unstructured fashion. For example, you may not have well defined research objectives, questions, a methodology or design. However, the data/information garnered is useful for rough judgement of a phenomena or decision making. For example, asking all you colleagues in the office what is their opinion about a particular product or service. Another example is, conducting a quick poll on social media. ",
