            "answer_text": "A lot depends on the definition of child in this case. If the individual is a legal adult, then they are much more responsible for making their own choices. However \u201cDoesn\u2019t go to school\u201d seems to imply not a legal adult. In which case the child is not the one to make choices about whether to got to school, to a doctor or to somewhere else. If the parents are not taking proper care of this child (and from the limited information in the question, that seems likely), then one option as others have mentioned, is to call Child Protective Services and seek help for this family.

            "answer_text": "It is irresponsible for a parent to not care about this child who is clearly suffering. He needs to see a doctor to find a plan to alleviate how unhappy he is.. It starts with the doctor, but if this is not your child, then I would call Protective Services to report the lack of care. You will be doing the child a favor. Their role is to provide help to parents who need it and taking the child away from their parents is the last thing they want. ",
