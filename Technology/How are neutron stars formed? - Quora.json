            "answer_text": "It is a very interesting process, so its worth to read this answer completely.  Well, it all starts with a star. Star, just like our sun, are huge mass objects primarily made of hydrogen(later they start producing heavier atoms). Due to this huge mass, gravitational force at the centre( due to the surrounding atoms of the whole star) crushers the atoms together at the centre and increases the temperature of the core. The whole stars seem to collapse at its primary stages. But when this temp increases beyond 100 million Kelvin then nuclear fusion starts. The interesting thing about fusion is that it releases more energy than it takes to start itself(up to the production of the iron atom). This nuclear fusion produces a huge amount of energy and each explosion produces a huge pressure which balances the gravitational force of the whole star and protects it from collapsing more. So there is an equilibrium between these two forces  After that helium fuses to form carbon, carbon fuses to form Nitrogen and so on. And produces a lot of energy. But when there starts production iron, Its fusion takes more energy and it releases none. Hence there is no more energy to further start the fusion of iron. So the hydrogen, helium, carbon etc. starts consuming more to balance the forces, but a critical point reaches when the sum of pressure releases in these different fusion reaction happening at different parts can\u2019t balance the gravitation force of the star and the whole star starts to collapse in its centre. The whole star collapses so much that even the electrons of the atoms starts crushing each other and starts experiencing repulsion. This repulsion is called Pauli's repulsion. Which is based on the fact that no two electrons can have the same quantum state  If the mass of this stars is huge enough than the critical mass(1.4 - 3 solar masses), then even the Pauli\u2019s force can\u2019t prevent the stars from collapse and all the electrons and nucleus starts crushing with each other and proton fuses with electron to form neutron with a production of neutrinos and antineutrinos. This process produces a huge amount of energy and a huge explosion happens, known as \u2018nova\u2019, if this explosion is high enough we call it supernova or hypernova.  Most of heavier particle dust spread out due to this explosion. So now all there is left is a pure mystical gem, soup of neutrons and some charged particles. Which are so closed and packed with each other, that the size of the stars becomes so small(about 10 km radius) and density so high 10^17 kg/m^3, which makes it the most spherical and dense object of the universe. This star is made up of a dense substance of neutron, we call this substance neutronium. This is how neutron stars are formed.  pulsars Now what happens when a spinning ball suddenly shrinks, well it starts spinning more rapidly. Here is an example  The same happens with this collapsed star, the former star was not spinning so fast. But when it gets shrunk, its spin rapidly increases to conserve its angular momentum. The neutron stars start spinning so rapidly(1000 rotations per second), that some charge particles in it start to produce their own magnetic field. These magnetic field produces a huge force on charge particles inside it, about the axis of the magnetic field of the star, hence ejecting a large amount of charged particles in the form of a jet. We call this spinning jet of charged particles, pulsars. These pulsars are also an interesting thing to talk about. But for now, this is more than enough.

            "answer_text": "So before going through anything, let\u2019s first go through Life Stages Of A Star:-  (Image Source:- www.cyberphysics.co.uk) If there is a star same as that mass of sun, then it goes through following phrase throughout it\u2019s stellar evolution:- Stable Stage:- It is a phrase when star form of hydrogen, due to immense pressure and temperature squeezes hydrogen nuclie together to form helium atom, this process is known as Nuclear Fusion. It is a phrase where star is quite stable and keeps fusing hydrogen into helium, and releasing immense energy\u2026Dying Star (Red Giant):- After a time star\u2019s core runs out of hydrogen and the inert helium atom began to get colser and core becomes denser, resulting in expanding sun, which at at last changes into nebula.White Dwarf:- after that it has a peaceful ending changing into white dwarf.But, the stages are not same for the star having greater mass then sun about 3 to 4 times more donot go through these stages their stages are as following:- Massive Star>RedSuperGiant>Super Nova>BlackHole or Neutron Star Now wheater a Massive star will become a Black Hole or Neutron Star depands on the mass of star if mass is enough, then it will become black hole or else it will become a neutron star. So the brief the answer is:- \u201cwhen a massive star (3 to 4 times that of sun) runs out of hydringen and undergoes supernova explosion it can either change into black hole or into a neutron star depanding on mass of star\u201d ",
