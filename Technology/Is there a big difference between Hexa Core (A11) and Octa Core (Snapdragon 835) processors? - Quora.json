            "answer_text": "You cannot tell difference between any processor by no. of cores it has. Performance of processor depends upon many things like cores designing (A53,A7,A72,A73), amount of silicon used, fabrication process, transistors, clock speed, Cache memory. On paper Snapdragon 835 looks superior but real life performance is different. A11 uses four power efficient core maybe A53 based design and two performance cores, A73 or A72 and neural processing for Face ID and AI related operations. There are two major ways to increase performance either you increases clock speed which will increase hearing problem or you use large amount of silicon which will be expensive and increase the size of processor. Qualcomm can not use the amount of silicon which Apple uses because they have to make profit and large amount of silicon will increase the price of processor, manufacturer will not buy it. Other reasons for the fast performance of Apple A11 bionic chip is that they use large cache memory compared to Qualcomm which will increase the benchmarking results drastically. They also use large no. of transistors which will also increases benchmarking results. Another reason for high performance of bionic chip is that Apple controls both hardware and software so they can optimize the performance more than any other manufacturer as other manufacturer use hardware from different sources and they put heavy skin on stock Android which further degrades the performance. Both processors are very capable but Apple A11 is faster. Snapdragon is now focusing on new custom Architecture which may increase the performance and supperior GPU may also increase the benchmarking results.

But this article cleared everything and gives a exact insight. Why are Apple's chips faster than Qualcomm's? - Gary explains and yeah apple's R&d rocks. ",
