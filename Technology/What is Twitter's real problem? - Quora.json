            "answer_text": "Too hard to use off the bat. New users don't see much value, apparently.Blown reputation. One billion inactive accounts. Mediocre feature releases like Moments. There's little evidence anyone other than a very small group really likes Moments - whether they are new users, old timers or folks who reactivated.Formidable competitors. Facebook is a monster. Robert Scoble is there and keeps talking about how great Facebook is compared to Twitter, etc. And Facebook owns Messenger, Instagram, etc. All growing much faster than Twitter.Fake and near fake content, followers, retweets. One tweet of mine had 45 retweets, all from what look like fake accounts to me.Ballmer owns 4% of Twitter. If he's buying, I'm selling. KIDDING!",

            "answer_text": "No offense to anybody. In Russia we have a joke about Twitter:Twitter is like a bathroom, everybody dumps, nobody consumes. Twitter's real problem is that it is a very poor communication tool. Twitter does not really unite people, it cannot serve as a discussion platform. Ability to give a substantial feedback is crucial for social media, but Twitter isn't supposed to serve such purpose. At best, you throw a catchy phrase, your follower (should he bother to read the feed) smiles at the screen with your tweet, and that's it. Probable re-tweets and responses give you a little incentive, but they don't really make Twitter a tool of communication. The first wave of fun of Twitter passed. Celebrity-tweetters had become famous before they joined Twitter. Regular users don't care about each other and have no means to attract attention within Twitter. ",
