            "answer_text": "What? Are you crazy? A thousand years from now a WWE champion, a Brock Lesnar-type will be president, I'm sure. And water will be replaced by Gatorade. Unlike regular water, Gatorade, filled with healthful electrolytes, will be used to replace the natural electrolytes our bodies lose during physical activity. We'll still be able to go to Costco and buy a 30-pack of it along with a 100-pack of Ramen, but Costco will have become a 20-mile long building by that time. And how about working for 900 more years? Not sure I want to stay in a nursing home for that long either. I'd probably be miserable once I saw how much our culture had changed or witnessed the further decline in our society. As an analogy, consider the epic poem \"Beowulf\" written a thousand years ago. The original Old English version is the earliest direct ancestor of our modern English language. How everything's changed SO MUCH. On the plus side though, it'd be nice to be a kid just a little longer. On my 999th birthday, the cake would be huge. Also imagine the wisdom and perspective we would gain with such a long life span, not to mention the memories. We become new people on our journey through life changed by what we learn. A thousand years from now, I\u2019d be nothing like the person I am today. And I'd readjust my focus every fifty years or so. First, I'd become a top scholar, then maybe a top poker player, then a triathlete, and so on. And what about all the great movies I've yet to watch? It wouldn't be possible unless I live a thousand years. By then I'll be able to transfer myself directly into a videogame too, I'm sure. If I live a thousand years and never see another Feral Ghoul Reaver, it'll still be to early. ",

            "answer_text": "The earth will have no supporting resources to sustain so huge a population that would grow many many fold from the current numbers. So, even if the human lifespan may stretch to 1000 years, due to lack of availability of sustainable resources people will not be able to maintain themselves till their 1000th birthdays. Leave aside the fantasy of living 1000 years. Consider the present reality of living even 100 years in the face of lack of food and shelter for all. Automatically the fear of insecurity takes over the mind. This feeling of insecurity coupled with reduced intake of food automatically signals the genes to adjust to the external conditions which in turn slows down the metabolic activities in the long run. That makes a new kind of humans in the evolution. It then automatically implies the other way round also. If there are abundant resources, the human mind forgets its insecurity and such a free feeling will again give rise to an increasing lifespan. ",
