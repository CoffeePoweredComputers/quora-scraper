            "answer_text": "Q: What is a payment gateway error? It usually means the merchant account you are buying from cannot attach to your bank and therefore cannot get an approval code. It\u2019s usually temporary. Here\u2019s an explainer. Source: I keep getting Gateway Error: This Transaction Cannot be Processed. How do I fix this? A gateway error comes from the payment system you are accessing as it is how transactions are verified over the global network. All transactions be it online or in a store must attach the payment gateway. It is NOT a part of SL but part of the payment network. The answer below may work however, more often than not, it means the merchant account (SL) cannot attach to your bank and therefore cannot get an approval code. These are almost always temporary and when they are not, they cause huge problems for everyone therefore, long term issues are very rare. I would give it a few minutes and try again. If not, I would contact your bank to see if they are online. ",
