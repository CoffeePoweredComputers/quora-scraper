            "answer_text": "With the RIGHT associate\u2019s degree you can get a full time job with benefits making $25/hour. \u201cUnfortunately\u201d this is going to require that you spend two years in school at a total cost of $10,000. For example the CC close to my home in the suburbs has a robotics program. Many of the classes are free\u2014government grants. The class size is 3\u20134 students. (All the \u201csmart kids\u201d are taking The History of Rock and Roll at a four year college downtown. Their job expectation is making lattes.) I forgot the good part. Many of the prospective employers have a tuition benefit. You could complete your bachelor\u2019s degree for free. This is not glamorous. There is no football team. It is definitely not cool. It is just low risk and affordable. BUT three or four years from now you will be driving in your (used) Lexis with your hot girlfriend to the airport to fly to the College National Championship game at some warm location. Your old high school buddies will be working at a part time job at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods for $8.50/hour trying to figure out how to pay off their student loans. (You don\u2019t like robots? I have a better opportunity at a CC in northern Kentucky.) The idea that you need a degree from a four year college to get a decent job is a &&^%* myth. There is a HUGE mismatch between the skills obtained at a four year college and the skills required at many of the well-paying jobs available in today\u2019s economy. CC\u2019s are filling that gap.

            "answer_text": "It depends on which industry you're going into and how big your ambitions are. If you have excellent transferable skills (e.g. communication [written and verbal], relationship management, attention to detail, etc.), you could land a \u201cgood\u201d entry-level job. If you want stability and just want to stay in the same spot, you can work hard to get incremental salary increases or move into a better paying position afterward a longer period of time. You'd be considered a strong & steady performer, but staying in an entry-level role for more than 4+ years would raise some eyebrows if you ever become unemployed. If you are looking to get a leadership role in the future, an associate\u2019s degree will not suffice in most companies\u2026unless you\u2019re an anomaly like the 20/30-something year olds running billion dollar companies. However, if you are fortunate, you could complete an associate\u2019s degree and then find a job at a company with excellent benefits who can pay for you to complete another degree. If the cost of education means you can really only afford a 2-year degree, spend those years wisely and build your network, whether that be speaking to your professors regularly and asking them to introduce you to people in the industry, building a strong LinkedIn profile and meeting people you admire for coffee, etc. P.S. If your communication and relationship skills aren't very good, you will REALLY need to figure that out and hone those to succeed in the long run. Good luck :) ",
