            "answer_text": "Yes it does. And depending on how much data you want to send, there are different technologies out there. Just not radio waves. For example, a Swiss company Hydromea developed a line of portable optical nodes that allow for high bandwidth (10\u201315Mbit/s) wireless exchange under water at any depth. They had deployments at 4000 meters in the Pacific last year. Like with your home wifi router, the distance within which this communication is possible is limited to about 100\u2013150 meters. And because it's based on Led technology, water should be clear enough for light to pass through. Basically, the murkier the water, the lower the range. Like in a house: the more cement walls, the lower the signal. You can stream HD Netflix movies over Hydromea modems underwater. There is also a possibility to use a laser beam, this can travel far, but it requires an eye to eye alignment, which is not usually possible in water unless the sender and receiver bolted to the sea floor or a fixed structure. Acoustic signal will travel miles in water, but the bandwidth is in a few kilobits, good enough for sending binary data. ",

            "answer_text": "WiFi operates at 2.4 & 5.8 Ghz. These frequencies are way too high for underwater propagation (preferred UW frequencies are in range 10 Khz - 50 Khz .. some specific applications going up to 230 Khz). WiFi signal would get severely attenuated if used UW. I would be very much surprised if one gets even a few cm under water coverage with WiFi signals. As regards heating of water in microwaves, microwaves oven typically use a low power , S band magnetron i.e at approx 1.8 Ghz , at this frequency , the wavelength approximately coincides with inter molecular gap of water molecules thus causing resonance related molecular level agitation leading to heating of water. Will WiFi frequency of 2.4 Ghz cause water heating , I very much doubt. ",
