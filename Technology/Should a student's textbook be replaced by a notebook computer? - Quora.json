            "answer_text": "Probably not. This is just one article exploring the issue: Evidence increases for reading on paper instead of screens We really don\u2019t know how our brains process material we read from a screen. The Reading Brain in the Digital Age: The Science of Paper versus Screens To me, the way the brain processes material is an interesting concept to study. When we read from a book, we are dealing with print on paper. We can hold and touch the book, run our fingers across lines of text if we want to. We can curl up in bed to read. We can easily flip pages back and forth, and for me anyway, it\u2019s easier to annotate a paper text (it may be easier for digital natives to annotate computer text\u2014I don\u2019t know). There\u2019s a smell factor to books, too, especially old books. Our brains are processing this experience far differently than if we\u2019re reading from a screen. On a screen, we\u2019re dealing with issues of light from the computer (or e-reader). The tactile experience isn\u2019t as pleasant\u2014a computer is cold and hard, and unless something is really dirty about your keyboard, there\u2019s no smell. I find it harder to swipe back and forth between pages and nearly impossible to annotate. It\u2019s not just a matter of comparing text to text when we\u2019re comparing books vs. computers\u2014the whole experience and whole process are different. However, I had high hopes for computer textbooks. I\u2019ve watched kids struggle with textbooks for 6 different classes. They\u2019re big, heavy, and awkward to carry. It would be lovely to have all of them contained in one little device. And for a personal library? Think of the storage book nerds like myself could reclaim if our books were all contained on a device rather than arranged on bookshelves. Those hopes were dashed once I got a Kindle. The IDEA of a Kindle was exciting to me, but the actual device I didn\u2019t enjoy at all. I found it physically tiring to read from a screen\u2014again, that may be because I\u2019m a digital immigrant. I ended up giving mine to a student. The issue of print vs. screen is, I suspect, far more complicated than we imagine. It may be as simple as starting kids with screens to have them comprehend as well on them as they do on print. A young brain may wire or rewire itself so that the screen becomes as efficient if not more so than the page. But it\u2019s probably more complicated (for example, how does backlight from the screen impact comprehension?), and we\u2019ll have to wait for more research before we know for sure. One final thought: taking standardized reading tests on a screen is problematic when you want to look back at text and have to swipe back several screens\u2014if the test will even allow that. It\u2019s far easier to confirm basic comprehension answers when you\u2019re using an old-fashioned print text. If you have a choice between screen or print for a standardized test, pick the print.

            "answer_text": "My answer would be yes but I think a large table would be more affordable. The right tablet will be half the price of a notebook and the battery life is much better. Personally, most of the time I would like to have a real paper book in front of me. However, I recently replaced a clutch on my car. I found a youtube video on the procedure and have had a change of thought. I was able to pause the video at each step and restarted once that step was completed. Like I said the tablet (a 10\u2033 galaxy tab E) would last the whole day and the touch screen was more convenient. Also everything was there making it easy to move around. On the down side\u2026 no real keyboard. As a text book, its already being used in many Universities now. I think it would work very well. ",
