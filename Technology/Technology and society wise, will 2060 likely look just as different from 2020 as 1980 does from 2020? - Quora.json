            "answer_text": "No, technology builds on existing technology so it accelerates. In addition to this factor we\u2019re undergoing a 3rd industrial revolution. From 1995 through 2005 we saw our communication infrastructure change from paper systems to digital ones. This had the effect in these systems of changing them from hub and spoke or hierarchical models to networked models. We\u2019ve now begun to make the same change to our transportation and energy systems. By 2070 we\u2019ll be powered almost entirely by renewables and battery power and transportation will be a service where you grab call for transportation (or it identifies patterns of your behavior) to take you where you want to go. Additive manufacturing will be done at a scale that seems absurd now and robots will build and break down factories and factory infrastructure in weeks not years. By 2060 we\u2019ll have Neuralink type devices that enable us to leverage AI at the speed of thought, that change our thinking in as radical a way as the train and automobile changed our ability to transport ourselves via walking. For Technology 2060 will be as different as 2020 is from 1920. Social systems are much more constrained in their ability to move fast. For social systems we can expect roughly linear change similar to what we have seen from 1980 to 2020. ",
