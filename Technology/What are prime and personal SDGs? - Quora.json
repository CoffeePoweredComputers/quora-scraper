            "answer_text": "According to me the answer is as under: Prime & Personal SDG (A solution for UN 17 SDGs) The Prime & Personal SDG it not part of UN 17 SDGs because it is prime & personal responsibility of every individual to implement and enforce Prime & Personal SDG into his / her life. Without this SDG our lives will remain with no goals, no aims and no objectives. Further, without this SDG no one can make efforts for UN SDGs as well. In other words, UN SDGs cannot be fulfilled and all 17 SDGs are dependent on that Prime & Personal SDG. Yes, you are closer. It is \u2018Ethical Advancement EA\u2019. Without EA, no goals can be achieved whether for individual progress or collective progress. Hence, it should be a dire need to do something for EA. You are seeing from a couple of decades the Technology Advancement but we don\u2019t see significant advancement in Ethics. Technological Advances is excellent but it is nothing without Ethical Advancement. No matter if a nation is strong enough to have Technological Advancement but imagine, if that nation doesn\u2019t have Ethical Advancement, will Technological Advancement benefit that nation? No definitely not. Neither they will utilize Technology nor will they sustain it accordingly. I have a good example of it, let\u2019s assume a citizen of that technologically advanced nation, is not social, he avoids family, friends and relationships etc., he acquires a robot in his home and starts living a life with that machine. No matter, how advancement is made in AI, that robot will not be able to replace a human partner for that individual. Hence, that individual will always lack a companion, a relationship and a lot more. Further he will not be able to live a life but will pass it only. Ethical Advancement teaches humans how to live a life, how other humans are necessary for life, why should help others needy & poor and finally how to get a goal for life particularly how to be on the collective goal for lives, i.e. UN Sustainability Development Goals. Finally, without Ethical Advancement, any advancement is nothing that can benefit the People & Planet fully. With Ethical Advancement, the World will be able to live with real Peace, Progress & Prosperity. Again due to limited time & space, a quick look is being given here with this brief innovative article. However to move further on this Holly Mission of Ethical Advancement in People, you can team-up with me till the final development, consideration & implementation of it by United Nations globally. Some brief suggestions will demonstrate as how the above can be obtained. 1. I propose that our greater United Nations should take some initiatives for Ethical Advancement worldwide. I have some plans as how to measure Ethical Advancement of a country and which steps can improve it\u2026 2. World\u2019s top Technology Companies i.e. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon etc. should take some steps for Ethical Advancement. I have some brilliant ideas that these great organizations can adopt for global peace, progress & prosperity etc... 3. Countries / Governments can also take their vital part for it. Again I have some unique and useful ideas...
