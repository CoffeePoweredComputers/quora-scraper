            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure that they are trying to do that. I would suppose that virtual therapy could disrupt the industry, much in the same way that Uber and AirBnB have done in their industry, without intending to do so. By offering a better, cheaper and faster product. For many mental health issues virtual therapy is an option, in particular I believe in prevention, an area that has been overlooked in large part by the mental health industry. So I\u2019m guessing that virtual therapy could rob the mental health industry of their potential cli\u00ebnts by offering something better, cheaper or faster, in particular when it comes to prevention.
