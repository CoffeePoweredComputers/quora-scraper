            "answer_text": "I would argue that Performance Art is subsumed under the umbrella of \"Theatre.\" (or Drama, if you prefer.) Performance Art is one of many styles or movements, and is part of (grew out of) the avant-garde movement in theatre. The first time I read Antonin Artaud's book \"The Theatre and its Double,\" (first published in 1938) my first reaction was that his more \"idealized\" theatre experience evoking connection and emotion from audiences with mise-en-scene, such as movement and color and sound and imagery, and not so much with \"literature\" (written plays that copy \"life\"), he was describing much of the Performance Art I had seen or in which I had participated. MoMA (www.moma.org) says, \"the term Performance Art, used loosely at first, arose in the early 1960s as American practitioners sought a way to refer to and describe the many live events taking place at that time. Performance art usually consists of four elements: time, space, the performer\u2019s body, and a relationship between audience and performer.\" And they mention that it may also be interdisciplinary. Theatre is interdisciplinary. It is not just written plays that tell stories of our lives, but includes any media, any interdisciplinary collaboration to connect, educate, communicate and/or provide catharsis to an audience. I have used dance, movement, ritual, music, art, architecture, costume and prop design, light and sound design, film, slide projection, spoken word, etc., in theatre pieces as tools to evoke a particular experience for the viewer/audience. Even in nature... theatre is all around you. If you sit on the grass under a tree and watch the struggle of a yellow leaf to stay connected to its branch, to eventually fail, and to watch as it lilts in a gentle breeze wondering where it will glide to next and when it will finally fall to the ground, that is theatre. The story of the leaf, the drama of whether it will fall, what path it will take, the anticipation of the inevitable end, and the sense of closure when it finally lays still. It is drama / theatre because you were there to watch it, interpret it, perhaps even recognize the story of the leaf as a metaphor for the human existence. It engaged you. That is theatre. ",

            "answer_text": "You are right, all of the nice, technical answers to your question that are easily found with a Google search are missing something. Even the concept that the artwork be difficult to replicate does not apply to many performance art pieces. So what is missing? Christopher Lee Burden - Google Search and his most famous work, \u201cshot\u201d are the perfect example of what separates performance art and theater. This may sound redundant, but actors act. A performance piece is closer to reality. Mr. Burden actually shot his friend, it was not an act. The gun was not a prop. (This in no way should influence anyone to harm themselves or others). Mr. Burden later regretted his stupidity. See The 25 Best Performance Art Pieces of All Time for a good overall definition, that is still somehow lacking. ",
