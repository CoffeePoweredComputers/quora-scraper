            "answer_text": "Geez what\u2019s up with all the misdirection and impractical answers? \u201cFormer Soviet Republic\u201d that means if you visit Armenia you\u2019ll get tossed into the gulag! Bask in our superior western version of \u201cfreedom\u201d muahaha. Jesus Christ! Get over yourselves!! Ok, here\u2019s a much more practical down to earth answer that will hopefully actually answer the meat of the question: I\u2019m an Armenian American, I was born in Tehran during a VERY not-free Islamic Revolution, we went from that level of state repression to 1980\u2019s America which was (sadly for our present era) the apex of personal liberties in American life since recent memory, so I\u2019ve seen extreme un-freedom (Tehran) and extreme freedom (1980s America) but this is a digression back to the question! Armenia today 2016 to present (2018) is actually a VERY free country. I\u2019ve tested it out to quite some limits, for instance in 2016, I showed up in Yerevan, with a bicycle, a bicycle mounted helmet camera, and proceeded to cycle all over nearly every downtown street in Yerevan taking 360 photographs. Did any police stop me and tell me I couldn\u2019t shoot in this way? Not really, I say \u201cnot really\u201d because the only interaction I did have with guards were when I passed by the embassy of Italy cycling on the sidewalk on Italy st traveling northbound, I was going about 3 mph in order to get more dense photo interval captures and the guard at the guardhouse asked me if I was filming, I told him I wasn\u2019t recording any video, and he seemed happy enough with that. There was another time as I was cycling through one of the many parks and had to go up a set of stairs to ge to the other side of an outdoor park complex a park police patrolman asked me what I was doing and I explained that I was shooting gps-tagged 360 photospheres for google maps because there was no systematic coverage in Armenia. Upon learning that he was happy to let me proceed on my way. Now I had looked up whether or not this was legal in Armenia, and it turned out that there were open panorama laws passed that allowed free photography of public spaces from public roads and easements (just like google themselves abide by in the USA). I shot over 2,700 images on that trip in 2016. The next year I returned with a custom built car-top mounting kit. We collected over 7,000 images that summer and got the total number of images up over 9,200 including driving to the republic of artsakh and covering the city there. One police officer asked us what we were doing and we explained our mapping project and he let us proceed. Think about that. This summer I\u2019ll be showing up with a much more powerful camera and I\u2019ll be preparing for a spring 2019 launch of our high-powered streetview coverage campaign with professional level 60MP imaging equipment. You can\u2019t do that in Azerbaijan (I checked for laws allowing public panoramic photography, and they have not passed such laws). You can\u2019t do that in Iran (same deal with regards to panoramic photography in public spaces in an organized manner (not counting the stealth captures provided by tourists on their phones). These are neighboring countries, we can use them as scientific \u2018controls\u2019 as the typical level of unfreedom in most middle eastern countries for the purpose of comparison. What else\u2026 what about guns? Well I\u2019m not a citizen of the Republic of Armenia so I have not looked into it in depth but it appears that Armenia (like many countries outside the US) has quite strong gun control and restrictions on ownership for the citizenry. I believe there are hunting permits which can be applied for and obtained which carry strong restrictions however\u2026 I have just described\u2026 Canadian gun control in a nutshell as well and most North Americans consider Canada to be a very free country. So in short, is Armenia a free country? Considering where it is situated, it is VERY free, however it is not as free with regards to gun rights as a country like the USA, but then\u2026 I don\u2019t think ANY country can approach the USA in that regard. I hope this helps. Oh and for more about our project see: https://Armenia360.org ",

            "answer_text": "Free is a rather vague term. It is better to define the question. Free as in independent or free as in a democracy or free as in guaranteed personal and press freedoms? Armenia is a former Soviet Republic but is now an independent nation. Armenia is a representative democracy with a parliamentarian form of government. Overall freedom is difficult to measure and every attempt to quantify the result will involve making particular choices as to what is important as regards society and the individual. One such attempt is the The Human Freedom Index which tracks 79 indicators and is co-published by the Cato Institute, the Fraser Institute, and the Liberales Institut at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom. According to this Index Armenia ranks at 55 among the nations of the world. For comparison, Peru is at 53, Singapore at 40, Turkey at 73, Canada at 6, and the United States at 23. Oddly enough Hong Kong comes in No. 1, which goes to show that one can have a lot of freedoms, but not a lot of security in keeping them (The Chinese government hovering over everyone\u2019s shoulder, as it were). I hope this answer is helpful.  Stewart J. Thomas, Artist and HistorianI grew up in two different Armenian neighborhoods of Tehran, Iran ",
