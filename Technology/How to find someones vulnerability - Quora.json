            "answer_text": "Being vulnerable, means being open to God completely and committed to the love of the universe in your life. When there is no fear, guilt, shame, or negative energies you are vulnerable. This is what people do not understand, that to be vulnerable and allow the love to fill you, is actually your protection. You can not attack love. People attack to defend or bully. A vulnerable person will not be attacked because love is like an amour of protection. The more vulnerable, the more love in their hearts is available to protect them from attack. ",
