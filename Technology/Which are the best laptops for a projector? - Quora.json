            "answer_text": "Anything with an HDMI port should work fine. I\u2019ve used low power netbooks to high-end laptops with many different projectors. There are certain caveats. If you projector is 4k capable and you which to project that resolution then you will want something fairly powerful. Anything with an i5, 8gb ram, should do fine to play 4k video. Of course the more power the better. If it\u2019s just 1080p then and i3 or equivalent AMD should do fine also. Now if you projector is older then it might only have an RGB port for video input. In that case your laptop should have one to if you want it to work, obviously. You can get adapters for usb if you don\u2019t though. So it all depends on what the specs of the projector are. Once you know that, then you can take full advantage of it with a capable laptop. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the answer is one that\u2019s compatible with the projector at hand. If you\u2019ve got an older projector with VGA video input, a laptop with VGA would make things easier. Dell and others often have these on sale, larger is usually cheaper. I saw one last week for a couple hundred dollars. Most newer video gizmos use HDMI for video input, and newer, larger laptops will have HDMI out. Smaller laptops might only have USB-C for and a dongle, maybe $39, is needed to get the video output. Where I teach, the classrooms and meeting rooms have projectors and some are older VGA, some are HDMI, the little dongle I use with my little Dell XPS\u2019 USB-C port supports either, plus it\u2019s got an ethernet port on it.
