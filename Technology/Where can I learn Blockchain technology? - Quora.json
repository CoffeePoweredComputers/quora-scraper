            "answer_text": "There are several aspects to learn blockchain. Since it is still relatively new, there are lots of opportunities for all of us to explore and innovate. It is fast catching-up with industries and already there are many products and solutions available to fit into the ecosystem of Blockchain and there are scope for many more before it becomes another commodity. You will find a lots of courses and also free materials available online. I have listed few of them below. And the reason I have listed all the courses from Udemy is that, apart from being completely hands-on courses, they are also very cost effective and 30 days refund policy (if you can\u2019t align with the course) makes them very attractive to go for before you make big investments into your learning. Investment is a subjective word here :). Getting straight to the business \u2192 Platform development (private/ public Blockchain platforms): For this you need to understand the fundamentals of Blockchain, complex/large system design principles, strong programming abilities. Among the many courses available in the E-Learning sites, I found Blockchain A-Z\u2122: Learn How To Build Your First Blockchain from Udemy to be the most useful one for me. In this course, you will learn Blockchain, build a small representational Blockchain, build your own crypto-coin, learn truffle EVM and a bit of Solidity.Application development \u2192 Build applications over a Blockchain platform. You need solid understanding of application design principles and also programming abilities to excel in this area.Ethereum (used mostly for B2C use-cases): The most popular among the available public Blockchain platforms. And to learn this, I found Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide from Udemy to be the most useful one for me. This course very comprehensively explains Blockchain, Ethereum, Smart contracts, Solidity, Web3 and application development using Node.js, ReactJs. It provides a crash course of ReactJs which is very useful. You will learn to develop a multi-page application on Ethereum in this course.Hyperledger Fabric (used mostly for B2B use-cases): The most popular and accepted DLT platform for industries. You will find courses on Linux Foundation and IBM sites. I found Blockchain Development on Hyperledger Fabric using Composer again from Udemy :) to be the most useful one. The trainer very patiently covers the concepts of DLT, Hyperledger, Fabric, Composer, setup of development environment and implementation through example application.Hope this information will help you and the followers of this thread a bit in their endeavor to learn Blockchain. Happy learning :) ",
