            "answer_text": "Pygame is basically a set of functions in a class which do different stuff. If you understand Python well, all you have to do is call those functions depending on what you want to draw. I would suggest going through the pygame documentation to understand what every function does. You don't need to memorize them - no one can. Just know that those are set of labels which tell us what each stuff does. Also, watch some tutorials to get a better idea. Again, you need to be good at Python otherwise you are going to have trouble using pygame. ",

            "answer_text": "Python has been recently voted the #1 most wanted language in the stack overflow developer survey 2019. PyGame is based on Python, therefore, is a very strong framework to learn! If you have already learnt Python you can quickly pick up Pygame. Some basic skills you need to learn are how to create a game window, how to process user inputs, how to render shapes into your game and how to move objects/players around within your game. If you want an easy to follow tutorial that is completely free you can head over to UKDevGuy and check out the PyGame Tutorial in Python 3. The tutorial starts by slowly introducing you to game development and hopefully, in the end, will be able to create your own game! Good luck! ",
