            "answer_text": "From Android 6 Marshmallow and 7.0 Nougat, Android supports split screen. For a split screen it is a necessary to at least open 2 apps. Just touch and hold the Intents button. You may know it as the \u201crecent apps\u201d button. Notice that it changes to a different icon(in case if it is present within the screen) to indicate you\u2019re in split screen mode.  Now you have an active app, being the rest in recent apps mode. Selecting anyone of them will make you work in a split screen mode.  Touch and hold the slider in the middle of the screen, and you can use it to increase or decrease the the amount of screen of that particular app. To end your split-screen session, touch and hold the recent items button and the screen will go back to your original app. ",

            "answer_text": "Android 7.0 adds support for displaying more than one app at the same time. On handheld devices, two apps can run side-by-side or one-above-the-other. On TV devices, apps can use picture-in-picture mode to continue video playback while users are interacting with another app. If your app targets Android 7.0 (API level 24) or higher, you can configure how your app handles multi-window display. For example, you can specify your activity's minimum allowable dimensions. You can also disable multi-window display for your app, ensuring that the system only shows your app in full-screen mode. If your app supports multi window then it will be appeared in split screen. ",
