            "answer_text": "Before you choose a laptop there are some very important things that every consumer should know! 1. The industry average lifespan of a computer is only 4 years, with a 10% to 25% failure rate over just 2 years, and an average cost of $730. ($180 per year).(Apple\u2019s score doesn\u2019t reflect the massive number or recent keyboard failures. Historically, Apple\u2019s reliability is about average.)  2. A well configured quality laptop, with reliable upper binned components can cost between $1300 and $2800 and serve for 10 to 20+ years. ($130 per year).  3. Almost everyone recommending laptops is an affiliate, paid about 2% of the sale by the vendor, to link to their laptop(s). This includes magazines, YouTube videos, blogs, and almost every computer website, linked to by Quora \u201cexperts\u201d who own them, or just don\u2019t know any better. The least expensive vendors, of the most reliable laptops, don\u2019t have affiliate programs.I\u2019m a professional researcher, not an affiliate of any company! 4. Affiliates never do any REAL research. If they did, they would know that Apple, Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Razer, Samsung, Toshiba etc, don\u2019t manufacture computers. They are all just vendors, who order, market, rebrand and sell computers. 5. The names of the companies that actually manufacture most of the world\u2019s laptops (ODMs) are Compal, Foxconn, Inventec, Pegatron, Quanta, and Wistron. So, whether you buy an Apple, or a Dell, you are really buying a Foxconn, Pegatron, or Quanta, who manufacture laptops for both of them. 6. Affiliates also seem oblivious to the fact that Apple, Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Razer, Samsung, Toshiba all have deplorable customer service, with review scores below 3 out of 10. All of the well vetted vendors that I recommend have customer review scores of at least 8 out of 10. 7. You know the saying \u201ca chain is only as strong as its weakest link\u201d? I can\u2019t count the number of times I\u2019ve seen configurations for an expensive laptop with a decent CPU and GPU, but it had an HDD drive, or it throttles because of a totally inadequate cooling system, or it has RAM chips from a manufacturer with 10 times the failure rate of the RAM that I would recommend. In order to have a RELIABLE computer, every component must be high quality binned, from a manufacturer with low failure rates. Most of the laptops on \u201ctop 10 lists\u201d have low binned components that failed quality testing, or are way overpriced. 8. A computer doesn\u2019t become prematurely obsolete because of how fast technology advances, but because of current technology that it lacks. A quality laptop, configured for reliability and longevity, will have components rarely found in off the shelf laptops.  PCIe SSDs (Solid State Drives) rather than SATA HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). PCIe SDDs have sequential read/write speed of >2000 MB/s vs HDD speed of <150 MB/s. PCI will be the connection for drives for the next 15+ years, as SATA has been for the last 15 years. Techies brag about HDDs that work for over 6 years (52,000 hours) because it\u2019s so rare. Quality SSDs should serve for 60+ years. (Based on 3,000+ writes, rewriting the entire drive every week. 60 x 52=3120.)Room for at least 32GB of 2666+ Mhz, CL <16 RAM. Most off the shelf laptops come with only 2 or 4GB of RAM, with room for no more than 8GB.An NVidia GTX or RTX graphics card. Most off the shelf laptops have integrated Intel GPUs, which steal resources from the CPU. Even if you\u2019re not a gamer, an integrated GPU is like putting wagon wheels on an automobile.Room for 2 to 4 storage drives. Most off the shelf laptops have one crappy HDD drive (or non-SATA eMMC SSD). Need more room? You have to replace the current drive (many are soldered), rather than add a new one. I usually recommend two drives so documents, files, music, video, and disk images of the main drive, can be saved on the second drive. Making recovery a breeze.Flexicharger technology. By configuring Flexicharger in the BIOS, the number of Lithium-Ion battery cycles can be increased from the typical 500 - 1000 cycles to over 5000. No off the shelf laptop has this technology, so a battery that lasts for more than a few years is rare.Desktop CPU. For those who want all the power in a laptop that they can get, An Intel DESKTOP CPU is 35% faster than the fastest laptop CPU. The compromise is battery life, but pure sine wave power banks are the best alternative, to extended time away from an outlet, without sacrificing performance.Thunderbolt 3 is the USB port of the future. Capable of speeds up to 40Gbps. A Thunderbolt 3 USB type C combo port is a necessity for connecting to the devices that will emerge over the next couple of decades. With all but the last 2 options, I can recommend one of the most reliable laptops, from a great vendor, with a price tag under $1300, that will rank in the top 15% fastest laptops in the world. (Laptop #3) For a laptop that has a desktop CPU, much faster GPU, enough RAM, Thunderbolt 3, ranks in the top 1% fastest laptops in the world, and should serve for close to 20 years, the price is around $2800. ($110 to $1250 more from one of the more expensive vendors.) A gaming laptop with an i9\u20139900K Desktop CPU and NVidia RTX 2070 GPU (The 2080 is only 13% faster, but costs $495 more.) that is 35% faster than the 8950HK laptop CPU in the fastest off the shelf gaming laptops for around $3100. Now that you kind of understand why cheap laptops are slow, unreliable garbage, and what makes a quality laptop\u2026 The most reliable laptops, when configured with the most reliable RAM, SSDs, Wifi, and Thermal Paste are manufactured by the 4th largest Taiwanese Exporter, Clevo. What I do is, every month I look at the prices of all of the well vetted Clevo vendors, and choose the vendors with the lowest price for each laptop that I recommend. Now of course, you\u2019re welcome to spend days finding Clevo vendors on your own, (Some of them have failed my vetting process.) and guess at which components to configure. You\u2019ll likely end up spending hundreds of dollars more, or choose high failure rate components (like WD or Seagate drives). By the way, despite being the fastest, and the most reliable laptops, you\u2019re not likely to find them in any \u201ctop 10\u201d lists, which are ALL just advertisements, including Consumer Reports. But just how much better is a quality laptop? Well, to put it simply, the laptop that I primarily use is 4 years old, and still ranks in the top 8% fastest laptops in the world. At that rate, at 20 years old, it will still be faster than most laptops (>50%).At any given time, I usually have 10 Chrome windows open, with at least 20 tabs in each window. Microsoft Word, Photoshop, Excel, Irfanview, Thunderbird, Notepad++ and a video playing or streaming on an extended display. With all of that running, a new program pops up instantaneously (under 1 second. Adobe programs can take 2 to 5 seconds to load completely).

            "answer_text": "BEST LAPTOP BRANDS \u2013 2020 If you\u2019re interested to know about the best laptop brands then you\u2019re at the right place. It doesn't really matters what you're buying but the brand certainly matters in 2020. Same goes for laptops and computers and there are only few brands that deliver reliable and robust machines. Almost everyone has their favorite laptop brand and it's important to know how most of the brands are performing currently. Finding the right brand of your laptop isn't easy anymore since there are so many new laptops flooding the market with all these new generation specifications and even computer geeks like us get confused, so you need to make sure that you understand every single aspect while buying a new laptop. When it comes to a laptop brand, you don't just look at the design and specifications of laptop but plenty of opposite things like their technical support, value for money, durability and much more. It involves an in-depth research that's really hard for an average person and that's where our experts come in with their personal and professional opinions. We will be listing 10 of the best laptop brands here that are very well-known and deliver the quality laptops. We have ranked these brands according to their features, support, popularity, price and overall quality of their machine. 1. APPLE  Apple is surely one of the luxury brands when it comes to laptops, computers, tablets, smartphones and music players. Unlike other brands, Apple have their own Mac OS that comes pre-installed on all their machines including iMac, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and the latest MacBook. Apple tops the segments like customer support, build quality, user friendly, design, power and display. Their laptops are extremely attractive with a backlit Apple's logo on the back making it one of the best things to show off. When it comes to OS, it totally errors free unlike Windows and incredibly easy to use. Anyways, while researching I checked some of the articles regarding best laptop brands and guess what, everyone's favorite and best choice is none other than Apple. The reason behind Apple being number one is surely their efforts, innovations and quality. Also if we consider reliability and durability, Apple's MacBooks have no competition and most of their products last for a very long time. When it comes to portability and lightweight, Apple's MacBook Air was the first laptop to be such thin and light. The Retina technology is a very-well known screen that offers crisp and clear display that none of us would have ever imagined. You should also know that most of their products come with 14 days refund policy which can be very helpful for most of the users. You now know why we have listed it as the best laptop brand of 2020. 2. DELL  If you're looking for the best Windows laptop then you will certainly have to go with the Dell. Their technical and after sales support is really worth praising and is appreciated by users worldwide. Majority of Dell laptops are budget-friendly and most of their design and hardware is very straight forward and powerful. However, not everyone likes a simple design and that's the only reason some users avoid Dell. In past, Dell wasn't really as competitive as it is today and reason behind that is surely their XPS series which totally changed the game for Dell. Inspiron series notebooks have also helped them to get where they are today. Their gaming machine brand, Alienware is the biggest name in the gaming industry and their ratings are on top since its launch. There are number of reasons for why Dell is the best Windows laptop brand like their support, professional design, fair prices and durability. If you want to stick to one brand for all time then you can easily go with their three series' like Inspiron, XPS and Alienware. Inspiron is a perfect choice for budget users where XPS can be used for high-end usage and of course Alienware for gamers. Also according to recent lists, Dell is one of the best-selling laptop brands in 2020. They have laptop for just about everyone. Their collection of laptops is seriously hard to count and most of their notebooks have all the latest features covered including touchscreens, backlit keyboards, powerful processors and long lasting batteries. 3. LENOVO  Lenovo is one of the most premium laptop brands and their prices are slightly higher compared to other manufacturers. However, their laptops are ideal for all kinds of tasks and can be used by anyone including professional gamers, businessmen and college students. They are mostly known for their business class laptops that offer not only power but also super flexible design. The Yoga and Flex series include some of the best portable laptops of 2020. The Chinese brand has recently started manufacturing smartphones and they are known for their long lasting batteries. They have been manufacturing Electronics that include desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, monitors and projectors. They have perfection in number of features such as graphics, touchpad, keyboard, display and audio quality. Since we're all business users, most of our staff uses laptops from Lenovo Ideapad series for their office work. Lenovo also announced about their gaming brand named as \"Lenovo Legion\" and they will introduce laptops similar to ASUS' ROG and Acer's Predator. If you ask me, I am personally a huge fan of Lenovo and have been using their laptops for more than 10 years now. To be honest here, the performance they offer in their devices is extreme and most of their notebooks come with a solid build quality. 4. ASUS  ASUS laptops are mostly known for being affordable compared to other brands and reason behind that might be their in-house manufacturing of motherboards. Their mini laptops and Chromebooks are highly known for being the best budget-friendly machines. Most of their hardware is of ideal quality including HD displays, storage drives and of course motherboards. The Taiwanese brand also manufactures other electronics including smartphones and tablets. There was a time when ASUS wasn't even considered in the list of best laptop brands but with their vast collection of attractive and powerful laptops, they have reached the 4th spot on our list. Currently they have a big lineup of computers from budget notebooks to high-end gaming beasts. They have also improved their technical support recently and you can get help from them over phone, Twitter or Facebook. Even their budget machines offer a good performance, full HD display and over 4 hours of battery life which proves that ASUS cares about the user's experience. When it comes to design, they use premium quality material even if you're looking at their laptop under $300. They also offer unbelievably powerful gaming laptops thanks to their ASUS ROG series and these days most of the gamers prefer ASUS ROG over MSI and Alienware machines. If we look at the overall reviews, Apple is the only brand to have more positive reviews than ASUS. One thing is definite about ASUS in 2020. They have become a major laptop brand. 5. HP  HP also known as Hewlett-Packard is one of the oldest electronics brands that is not as popular as it used to be. When it comes to desktops, they still provide the most reliable machines and are widely used by gamers and professionals. As a laptop brand, HP is way better than Acer and ASUS when it comes to durability as well as performance. However, the battery life is a huge issue in most of the HP laptops and that's why many users avoid going with HP. Other than laptops, their printers, desktops and monitors are also worth considering. Their customer service is simply fantastic in countries like United States, Canada, Australia and England. Not really sure about other countries but there aren't really many complaints about inadequate support. They have a collection of laptops that ranges from $200 to $2000, and almost anyone can own a device from HP. Most of their machines feature great performance, design, hardware and display. Their popular series' are Envy, Spectre, Pavilion, and Elite. We also gave a minus point to HP for almost no innovation in the last couple of years and almost all their machines are similar to other brand's devices. All in all, HP computers might not be able to offer the stylish and attractive design, but they are very reliable and come for a very reasonable price with excellent warranty and support. ",
