            "answer_text": "Pointy, a startup out of Dublin, Ireland, which has built hardware and software technology to help physical retailers \u2014 specifically those that might not already have an extensive e-commerce storefront detailing in-store inventory \u2014 get their products discoverable online without any extra work. Pointy was co-founded by Mark Cummins (CEO) and Charles Bibby (CTO). Notably, this is Cummins\u2019 second exit to Google. His first company, the visual search startup Plink, was Google\u2019s first-ever acquisition out of the U.K. Pointy\u2019s primary product was a piece of hardware that plugged a company\u2019s point of sale/barcode scanning units so that every time a retailer scanned its products at the point of sale, it would upload the products online (including quantities of those items), and then keep stock numbers up to date with every subsequent purchase that was made and scanned in. Pointy doesn\u2019t track incoming inventory per se: it uses algorithms overtime to figure out stock amounts to a very close degree of accuracy based just on purchasing patterns. Then, a user who might be searching for that product online might come across those details through Google\u2019s search results (\u201cSee What\u2019s In Store,\u201d which come up in Google\u2019s Knowledge Panels and on Google Maps), or via advertisements. The aim: These listings could potentially result in shoppers buying those products from the retailer in question, ideally getting them to come into the store, where they would buy even more. The hardware retails for around $700, but Pointy also has a free app that integrates with specific POS devices from Clover, Square, Lightspeed, Vend, Liberty, WooPOS, BestRx and CashRx POS, removing the need for the hardware. Google\u2019s initial partnership with Pointy in 2018 was part of a push to build out Google\u2019s search portal with more e-commerce tools, and it was coming not a moment too soon: Amazon was both ramping up its own efforts with physical retail, and becoming a bigger threat to Google as a first port-of-call for online shoppers. Two years on, those themes have only grown bigger with Amazon\u2019s rise, perhaps one reason why Google was keen to bring Pointy in-house. Now, it can more deeply integrate the tech, and build upon it. Pointy had also started to work a little closer with retailers, giving them insights into what was selling well, and what they might want to stock more of in the future, but it had never delved into the actual transaction aspect of products that it was listing online: that was left to the retailer and a shopper visiting a store to buy in person. All of that leaves a wide door open to how Pointy \u2014 and Google\u2019s own retail commerce efforts \u2014 might develop in the future. ",
