            "answer_text": "This is a really neat question - I don\u2019t think it is and unfortunately, a lot of times information is refereed to as technology. In my mind, here is the difference. Let\u2019s say we have a combination lock and we need to unlock it, in any way possible. Technology is using a special drill to break it, or using a listening device to tell when the pins line up as a means to determine the combination. Information is knowing the combination and just opening it. Of course, one can argue that information is part of everything, which is true. After all, unless we have the information on the design of the lock, it is hard to know what technology would be best at opening it. But typically, information in this context refers to specialized knowledge that is critical in accomplishing a goal. On its own, it is not a technology which has wider applicability (knowing the combination to one lock does nothing to open another, but knowing that a special drill worked, we can now open all locks of the same type). The term Information Technology refers more to the technologies associated with managing information, rather than the information itself. ",
