            "answer_text": "HAI, UTI, microbes resistant to antibiotics. Solution: Preventing fecal dust forming , by using the $14 VERTICAL jet bidet, the KO BIDET, thought to be a defining act, as its use, instead of t. paper, will offer more in convenience, dignity, 100% cleaning, even on hemorrhoid presence (immediate proof: the always clean underwear), time sparing, ecology, water economy and mainly hygiene ( it reduces: fecal dust and so UTI, HA Infection, antibiotic resistant microbes, as MRSA etc), and also in reducing hospital functional cost by 10% . *FECAL DUST: It comes from fecal residue, left after wiping with t. paper (complete or, worse of course, incomplete) . Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air is going to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination. That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause of the known HAI. The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a 4-6 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density in the wards is a one more factor that increases their chance of developing antibiotic resistance.\u201d It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added. CDC, responding to my relative question about fecal dust\u2019s role in HAI, said they could not give me any answer positive or negative. That means that nobody had done any relative research work.
