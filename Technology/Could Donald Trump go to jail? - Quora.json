            "answer_text": "Original Question: Could Donald Trump go to jail?  He could. Let us start by making an observation. Many people are assuming not only that Donald Trump is a criminal, but that Mueller has the evidence that would convict him. No matter how likely that seems, we still do not know that to be the case. Secondly, there is also the possibility that Trump could resign in exchange for a Pence pardon. That is risky for Pence and the Republicans. I am not saying it is impossible, but they remember 1976. The \u201cX\u201d or unknown factor is what the Trump base might do if Pence does not pardon Trump if Trump resigns. Would they accept it? Or would they turn on the Republican establishment, including Pence? I lean toward the idea that the Trump base would turn on the Republicans, which would be more disastrous than pardoning Trump. Even losing the 2020 Presidential election because Pence pardoned Trump would be less bad than having the MAGites turn on the Republican Party. Pence and the Republicans would of course, have to amp up their rhetoric about the Democrats being controlled by the \u201cDeep State.\u201d They could probably do this. And the Republicans will still have gerrymandered districts until the 2022 election. But a Pence pardon of Trump would definitely turn independents against the Republicans. All of this presumes, of course, that Trump is willing to resign in exchange for a pardon. Would he actually accept that deal? I think so, but I am not certain. If he does not, and barring the Democrats nominating an idiot, Trump is going to lose in 2020. And if he leaves office unpardoned, he will face prosecution. One fair bet is that he will refuse to resign until after the 2020 election, and then only if he loses. The question in that case will be whether pardoning Trump would hold any value for the Republicans. Each day that passes, the value of a Trump resignation declines slightly. It is an imperceptible decline right at the moment, but after the New Year it speeds up, because if he is going to resign, Republicans need time to get their 2020 campaigns going. Pence cannot assume the nomination is his. If Trump resigns, whoever the Republican nominee is in 2020 is going to have win over the Trump base. So, assuming Mueller has the evidence that would convict Trump, Trump\u2019s only way to avoid jail would be to resign and receive a Pence pardon. Pence himself might be in trouble too. So that is a bit sketchy at the moment. Pence may have personal motives for not wanting to pardon Trump. Like say, keeping his own freedom. So it is very possible that Trump could see the inside of a jail cell. ",

He is the capo, the crime boss. He can\u2019t cut a plea deal. He is probably facing equivalent charges to Manafort of tax evasion, bank fraud and money-laundering. If he survives to the end of this term or the next without getting impeached, he may never see the inside of a courtroom. If he gets impeached or loses the 2020 election he will doubtless face many charges. His Tweets tell everything you need to know. He is convinced he cannot be fingered for collusion. He thinks that because it was Manafort, Cohen, Flynn, Gates, Stone, Papadopoulos, Kushner and others who actually met Russians and made any quid pro quo deals, that his hands are clean. But he also knows he is guilty of multiple financial crimes that to him, are just part of business. They aren't, but that\u2019s how he thinks. By now he has realised that regardless of whether he escapes impeachment and conviction for his campaign\u2019s dealings with the Kremlin, he will not get away from dozens of charges of financial impropriety which add up to 100 years in jail. \u201cWitch Hunt!\u201d That means No Fair! You\u2019re supposed to be investigating Russia and you\u2019re digging up all this other stuff! Wah! \u201cDisgraceful and discredited Mueller and his angry Dems!\u201d That means his personal financial transgressions are part of the business game he his playing, not the politics game he is playing. No Fair! Wah! Chances are he will either walk on the understanding that he won\u2019t do jail time, or that he will get 86\u2032d at the 2020 elections and then spend a very long time in court. If he lives long enough, he might even make it to jail, but I doubt it. He is so used to cutting corners and pulling strokes, legally, so completely used to the laws of the land not applying to him. So privileged, that it didn\u2019t even occur to him while running for President that this would happen. He always settled out of court before. Over 400 times he did that. Over four hundred times he was sued for not paying his bills, for fraud, for criminal behaviour. He just threw money at the problem and it went away, 400 times. Not this time. He has walked into the lions\u2019 den wearing a suit made of bacon. ",

            "answer_text": "The history of American Presidents getting impeached is - scanty. There have been exactly two Presidents who have been called in front of the Senate to answer for their actions. Both were acquitted of wrongdoing. That being said, there is reason to believe that Richard Nixon would have been the first President who would have been found guilty and probably removed from office and indicted - had he not stepped down and been pardoned by Ford. Trump may or may not be impeached. It is too early to tell and the GOP, who control both Houses of Congress are currently watching with extreme caution the ensuing allegations being brought by Mueller and his team. Note, Mueller didn\u2019t attach his first allegations to any wrongdoing directly by Trump at this time. However, there are indications that Papadopoulos has admitted that he personally tried to collude with the Russians by meeting with two individuals - one of whom he believed was Putin\u2019s niece. Trump can scream that he had nothing to do with Papadopoulos - however, he is on tape saying that he thought that Papadopoulos is a great guy and there\u2019s a picture of the two of them together. In many people\u2019s minds, there are dots connecting. Now, on the one area that can give Donald Trump coverage is his base - as far as I can tell the GOP base is still behind him - eroding, but strong enough that the GOP leadership is interested in harnessing that popularity to get their agenda through the legislative process. As long as they perceive that he can turn his base against them - to their detriment, so they lose their Congressional seats, they will back him. However, his constant feuds with his own Party - not to mention the fact that some in the GOP leadership are looking at losing their seats any way, may end up meaning that they will feel no loyalty to someone who has no loyalty to them. Last but not least, if the House turns over in 2018 all bets are off. If the Congress flips, the Democrats will be salivating at the prospect of serving the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate. A disenchanted Senate may feel that taking their chances with Pence may be better at getting their agenda passed, and will cut Trump loose. If Trump is the first President to be removed from office - and he doesn\u2019t make a deal with Pence to be pardoned, he may in fact be indicted. ",

He is not perfect or sinless but he is getting our country back on track. Our country had gotten to the point that \u201ceverything goes.\u201d You could come into our country illegally and commit crime after crime and get away with it. Gangs allowed so much power people were to fearful to try and stop them. Our Veterans who fought for our country homeless and could not get medical care. The suicide rate alarmingly high. Our teenage suicide rate high. Drugs at an epidemic with 177 people dying everyday from overdose. Cartels bringing drugs into our country and them killing our young people. Sanctuary cities and governors supporting them. Prisons full of people who have ridiculous sentences for the crime or innocent people in prison. High black population in prison. Elder abuse at an all time high. God band from the schools and other places. Muslims thinking sharia law was going to let them have the freedom to have sex with minor children in the name of religion. School shootings out of control and bullying in schools. Foreign countries being given excessive amounts of money by our government while our people work and keep them up through taxes. Obama had a health plan that supported lazy people not to work. Using excessive resources from other countries, that we can produce in our own. Much cheaper and better for our economy. President Trump works for free for the people. We the people put him in office. Hillary Clinton is a criminal but has not done any prison time. Many people have tried to take President Trump down with false accusations and they have all failed. They will continue to fail. President Trump is gaining popularity at a fast rate despite the fake news and the liberals trying to destroy everything he attempts. I do not think President Trump will ever do a day in prison. He is an excellent president and doing what needs to be done to make America great again. I do think he is arrogant at times but I also think that is just a defense mechanism to put up with all the controversy. He is putting God back into our country, respect for the flag and making great progress with supporting our military. This is my opinion. Just that, my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "Has he been found guilty of a crime? He has been found guilty in the court of public opinion with all kinds of fact checked \u201cevidence\u201d to support impeachment and prosecution for charges yet unproven in a court of law regarding financial misdeeds. How about we let Mueller do his job, let the Federal courts do their job and determine guilt by the hard evidence presented on the record in a court of law and let a Federal judge or possibly the Supreme Court rule by applying the laws they feels are appropriate? Now Trump may be found guilty on some or all of his ALLEGED crimes with the EVIDENCE gathered by Mueller team or Federal prosecutors looking into the Trump organization and possible misuse of funds. I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN MUELLERS REPORT OR KNOW WHAT IS IN IT BUT I GUESS THT DOESN\u2019T MATTER TO MANY. If there is hard evidence to prove there were criminal acts committed in financial matters or t to show guilt of a charge of collusion, Trump and any associates should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Who knows maybe it will be found that Trump and his loyal aides were found to be \u201cextremely careless\u201d but the evidence does not substantiate any criminal prosecution. Mueller\u2019s report may be politically damaging as hell but lacking sufficient evidence of criminal activity. As Comey once famously stated \u201cno prosecutor would take such a case.\u201d There is a BIG difference in those two outcomes. Aren\u2019t people tired of the endless speculation and cobbling together of \u201cfacts\u201d and history to \u201cprove\u201d Trump is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt? If the verdict is already in by the public, why are our tax dollars being spent on a long drawn out investigation by Mueller a et al if it is so crystal clear that Trump just has to be guilty?

            "answer_text": "Anyone could go to jail. But, in the US, the person needs to be charged with a crime, properly represented, a court decision is made (which can be appealed) and then \u201cif\u201d found guilty a sentence will be imposed. It is not likely that an actual prison sentence would be imposed for a minor infringement such as campaign finance violation (not reporting a contribution after the election as supposed to). It\u2019s actually common and there is no precedent of charges resulting in any prison sentencing. There is possibly a small fine for the paperwork omission. The other armchair grabbers such as considering building in Moscow (But later deciding against it) or paying off an extortionist you once had an affair with to keep a lid on it, or saying crude things are not illegal. There is no viable way to charge someone because their adversaries believe (or want to make others believe) they might have done something, but they just can\u2019t find or figure out what exactly it was. For those wanting a perp walk and severe prison sentence, this may not be a popular answer. But, it is grounded. It\u2019s not suspenseful, won\u2019t get me ratings or viewers every night waiting for more heightened suspense, all intended to have the popcorn flowing while everyone waits for the grand finale. Sorry folks, unless there is some real crime found, there isn\u2019t going to be a harsh sentence because of the need to fill a void and make the ending good. This is reality, and if you were a President, and had the same minor infraction (if that) it would work that way for you too! ",

            "answer_text": "If he is somehow sent to prison it would further illustrate the insanity that pervades Washington. Both of the Clinton\u2019s did things 10 times worse than President Trump. But, as the American people found-out, there are two sets of laws in Washington, one for the average American and one especially for the corrupt Clinton family. Recently, it was reported that Bill Clinton was listed in the pilot\u2019s log of Jeff Epstein's private plane, 27 different times as a passenger traveling one of Epstein\u2019s islands. On Epstein\u2019s islands were young under aged women kept against their will to provide sex for selected people by Jeff Epstein. Our Ex-Pervert in Chief just couldn\u2019t keep his zipper in the up position. He went 27 times to screw young \u201cunder aged\u201d girls. But, sexual perversion is common with \u201cWild Bill Clinton!\u201d His presidency was filled with numerous immoral sexual conquests. He totally destroyed the life of Monica Lewinsky who was only 22 years old when they met. They had sex in the Oval Office as Bill shoved cigars up Ms. Lewinsky\u2019s vagina. Definitely a perverted act. Bill and Hillary had to pay Paula Jones $850,000 for long term sexual harassment. Several other women said that Bill Clinton had raped them. Hillary fought back by calling Bill\u2019s conquests and insulting them calling them terrible names. There were also rumors that Hillary may have been a dyke. She was obviously a drunk! The Clinton\u2019s have set a wonderful example for the American people, especially America\u2019s young people. When the Clinton\u2019s were in the White House in the 90\u2019s the Oval office was referred to as the \u201cOral Office!\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Will Trump go to jail? Almost certainly not, at least not while he is in office. The Talented Mister Trump may or may not be indicted, which would be problematic, but not impossible for a sitting president. Meanwhile, he will almost certainly be impeached after the midterm elections in November 2018, and it is more likely than not that he will resign or be removed from office. What makes all of this problematic is the fact that Trump has a loyal following of about 1/3 of the voting public. However, 2/3 of the voting public are not at all loyal to Trump, nor is the voting public going to be the final arbiter of these decisions. Rather, the 116th Congress will play a central role, as will the Supreme Court, along with the Justice Department and various State Attorneys General. The bar for indicting a sitting president is high, but the legal opinion asserting that it can't be done doesn't really say that. Even if it did, a legal opinion is not the same as a Supreme Court Opinion. The argument that a president plays such a critical role in government could easily fail by virtue of the fact that we have a vice president, whose job it is to fill in for a president when a president is incapacitated. Moreover, the prosecution of a president could be commenced but paused for up to eight years. Problematic, but not impossible. What does make the prosecution of Trump much more problematic is the fact that he enjoys enough popular support to make a prosecution more trouble than it's worth. However, that could easily change if and when Trump is impeached and resigns, or is removed from office ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, after he\u2019s impeached and thrown out of office. Some on this answer think that the Vice President will pardon Trump, but I don\u2019t believe he will. The reason. When Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon, it was highly controversial. Some on both sides saw it as a backroom bargain between Nixon and Ford so that Ford could attain the presidency. It was felt that this was the main reason Ford lost the election to Jimmy Carter in 1976. From the Wikipedia article on Ford: The New York Times stated that the Nixon pardon was a \"profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act\" that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's \"credibility as a man of judgment, candor and competence\". On October 17, 1974, Ford testified before Congress on the pardon. He was the first sitting President since Abraham Lincoln to testify before the House of Representatives. Ford would come to regret the decision, even though it may have been the correct one at the time. Again from Wikipedia: After Ford left the White House in January 1977, the former President privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon of Nixon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision. The reason why I\u2019ve changed my tune on Nixon\u2019s pardon (as an angry 14 year old, I felt Nixon should have rotted in a Federal prison in Alaska) is that we had gone through 18 months of turmoil as a nation. A Nixon trial would only have prolonged the pain even more. As far as Ford losing the election in 1976, AFAIC, the Democrats could have run Lancelot Link: Secret Chimp against Ford and he\u2019d have won.  President Lancelot Link and the First Lady Mata Hairi Here\u2019s a message to the trolls out there; I don\u2019t think for one minute that Trump and Pence made a deal prior to the election that would \u201cguarantee\u201d Pence the presidency should the Donald be impeached or forced to resign. I believe that Trump thinks, at some point, this will all go away because the American people don't seem to care. He doesn\u2019t plan that far ahead. He and the rest of his Gang That Couldn\u2019t Shoot Straight are probably in for a rude awakening. Trump\u2019s support by the GOP is hanging by a thread. I believe they made him the nominee because he polled well and promised that he\u2019d sign any stupid bill they passed, get us out of the Paris Accord, repeal the ACA, etc. As we are seeing, his coattails are shortening and he probably won\u2019t have any credibility left within the party come the 2018 mid-terms. Pence won\u2019t pardon Trump because it wouldn\u2019t be politically expedient. As far as a Trump trial is concerned, the news media as a whole would probably broadcast the thing all day and then rebroadcast the feed all night. ",

I think most people would prefer the latter, but he seems to be hoping for impeachment, daring the House to begin the proceedings. Trump seems to be operating under the illusion (delusion?), perpetuated by media and popular lore alike, that impeachment would benefit him, like it \u201cbenefited\u201d Bill Clinton. Well, it might have improved Clinton\u2019s personal approval rating, and it may have helped the Democrats in the short term (\u201cThe Republicans did poorly in the 1998 midterm elections which took place in an environment dominated by the impeachment process. As a result, Newt Gingrich lost his job as Speaker of the House.\u201d Democrats draw the wrong lessons from Clinton\u2019s impeachment), but it certainly didn\u2019t help 2 years later in the 2000 elections. The Dems lost the White House and the Republicans won the House and kept the Senate (107th Congress). Also, the Watergate investigation was disapproved of by most voters\u2014at first, but as they continued, and the public began to hear testimony on Nixon\u2019s nefarious dealings, that disapproval in the investigation transformed into presidential disapproval. That\u2019s the lesson both Trump and the Democrats seem to be deaf to. Impeachment hearings need to begin now, as they would give the Dems over a year to inundate the voting public with testimony from those people most intimate with the Trump business, campaign, and administration\u2014all the folks Michael Cohen mentioned in his testimony (and are going to testify before the House anyway). It will be (eventually, I believe) Trump\u2019s worst nightmare. ",

Treaty 106-16, passed by the senate in 1999 (ironically Biden voted for the treaty), specifically authorizes the Ukraine and the United States to work together on criminal investigations. Trump is the head of the executive branch, which is the investigative branch of government. Trump is specifically allowed to work with the Ukraine on criminal investigations. You are free to look up the treaty.Obama\u2019s administration authorized the FBI to pay a foreign agent, to work with Russian intelligence to compile a dossier on a political opponent. Furthermore, it appears that the FISA system was abused to enhance this information gathering on an opponent.Trump's behavior, whatever you think about it, is specifically authorized by a treaty ratified by the Senate.If I'm a conspiracy theorist, this impeachment is a two-part strategy, first it might trip Trump up because it increases the pressure. More importantly I think it is a smokescreen for the previous administration. It forces Republicans to defend the behavior, and when the Obama FISA abuses come to light, they won't be able to attack Obama with much fervor. In theory you can say they were both working with foreign governments against a political opponent, although one is specifically authorized. ",

Donald Trump, right now, cannot be charged by the FBI for a crime as DoJ rules state that Presidents can only be charged with crimes by Congress (also note investigations into Presidents must now be authorized by the head of the DoJ). This leaves only state law cases brought against Trump. If Trump commits a felony where state law applies he will most like go to prison. As it is now, I\u2019m inclined to say no, Trump will not go to prison. If Trump continues to be President into 2020 the odds of him going to prison is a flat zero, whereas if Trump is no longer president with a Democrat win it is most likely that the FBI will be instructed to go over Trump\u2019s actions with a fine tooth comb to find something to charge him with. And considering Trump\u2019s storied history they will most like find something, Trump will be charged, and given maximum sentencing which may include prison. ",

But Trump has the money and lawyers to milk his cases that will inevitably continue chasing him long aftet he leaves office; however that may be. With that comes better legal options to plead down charges, get charges dropped for admitting to something else, etc. But when its all said and done the fact is Trump will most likely never spend even a single day in prison, or away from his money-laundered, lavish lifestyle until he dies.

            "answer_text": "Other than for Treason a President can not be indicted while president but they can be impeached and then charged with a crime. If the investigation shows Trump committed a crime the prosecutor Mueller would send that report to congress where they would decide through a bill of impeachment if what Trump is accused of rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Then an impeachment hearing would be held and Trump could be impeached or acquitted. Clinton was acquitted by congress. Impeachment is a political process but it has legal implications. If impeached it is very likely depending on the crime that Trump would also be charged with a Federal or state crime upon impeachment. Trump can be pardoned by the next president or any sitting president and there is a possibility his VP Pence would take over his term and would pardon Trump. Nixon was pardoned by Ford. However, there is also a possibility Trump may be charged with state crimes that he can not be pardoned from and those could be as serious as RICO charges which could result in prison. In General our Government has been reluctant to impeach or charge any president in the past probably because it could open up our government to charges by foreign countries and is a black eye and embarrassment for the country, ",

Otherwise, his current vice president can pardon him by becoming President. Pardons allow the President to forgive crimes against the federal government, but not against the various US states, for example, New York state. It is extremely unlikely for this to happen. I do not believe it will. I believe he will be found guilty of many, many crimes, or shown to have committed them by the end of the current investigation, since all the evidence so far and all the relevant testimony so far shows he is probably guilty of those crimes. But I also believe that his office and the office his VP would end up holding shields him against the law, and so does the Republican controlled Senate which long, long ago sold out the country in favor of political power for their party. The voters, I am more sure can be shown the light, but those in power know they are in the wrong and still believe it to be for a greater good, and are absolutely corrupted beyond any redemption. ",

Are you kidding me? This is the guy who\u2019s under investigation for colluding with the Russians, violating campaign law and obstruction of justice. This is the guy with four very close former associates who have already been indicted and convicted by the Mueller investigation. Some of them are now fingering him for all sorts of crimes \u2014 and that\u2019s just for what he\u2019s done lately. This is the guy who\u2019s been caught lying more than ten thousand times since taking office. This is the guy who tried to get the leader of a foreign country to investigate a political rival to help Trump in the 2020 election. His face should be in the dictionary next to the definition of sleazy. I get that some people are Republicans or really like Trump. But it\u2019s time for you guys to stop pretending like Trump is as pure as the driven snow and Mueller and Pelosi and the media and all of the Democrats are just picking on him. You\u2019re not fooling anyone except (maybe) yourselves. But, to answer the question, it is true that due process is necessary before Trump can go to jail. That is, incidentally, a lot more than what Trump supporters wanted to give Hillary \u2014 and there really is no evidence that she did anything wrong. ",

People opining, prognosticating, or making predictions on this and currently related topics and individuals keep saying \u201cwill so-and-so go to jail.\u201d The appropriate word is prison. Here in King County, state of Washington (for those who don't know, that's the county that Seattle is in; FWIW, King was a senator from Alabama, later vice president to Franklin Pierce, and possibly, although this is disputed by some historians, gay), jail is a holding facility before trials or for incarceration for less than 365 days, on local or state charges, generally of a less-serious nature than, among other possibilities \u201cconspiracy against the United States,\u201d sometimes referred to as \u201ctreason in peacetime\u201d (the more-correct name for \u201ccollusion,\u201d which was only a placeholder designation). Prison is where an individual is sent, after conviction, for longer sentences after conviction for state or federal. The distinction between jails and prisons and the uses the justice system makes of them are probably relatively consistent across jurisdictions. (OTOH, and in distinction to the prevalent but incorrect usage of many people currently, Paul Manafort is already in federal prison, only awaiting trial.) Ah, but back to DJT, beloved by some, reviled by others, and whether he'll go to prison. There are several imponderables here: (1) we don't know exactly what information the Special Counsel will eventually present and how damning it will be, but as the weeks pass the information seems more compelling, more damning; we'll see eventually what the SC has, (2) there is the question of whether a sitting president can be indicted and tried in a court of law; possibly not, but if he is impeached and convicted, or after his term ends anyway, he could be, certainly, (3) there is the issue of his age and health, and how long he will live. Related to his baseline, in addition to his probable poor health is the enormous stress he is likely experiencing, and its effect on his health and the remaining length of his life, and (4) there is the question of how much cash he or supporting parties can marshal to fund delaying legal efforts. Still, based on the likely results of the special investigation, including probable culpatory testimony from several individuals, as well as parallel state legal efforts in process, and if I was a betting person, I'd put money on DJT spending some time in prison.

            "answer_text": "Again who knows? So far the Mueller investigation is indicting campaign staff. Whether Trump gets charged or not depends on: What he knew his staff was or was not doing?Did he approve of what his staff was doing? Here he already has a legal point of defense in that he either dismissed or asked for resignations when negative information came out about these same individuals.Can it be PROVEN that he personally knew about and approved of illegal acts. This goes to INTENT, a legal requirement for a crime.I like to compare this with the Nixon Watergate scandal. Richard Nixon employed a group of individuals to find out who was leaking confidential White House matters to the press. I am sure he did not go so far as to personally sanction ILLEGAL acts by this group. This group exceeded their authority and committed a felony burglary. Where Nixon went wrong is he tried to cover it up. First he denied knowledge of their actions (probably true) but THEN he tried to \u201cstonewall\u201d and cover up the incident even when he found members of his own White House staff were involved. He FIRED NO ONE, DEMANDED NO RESIGNATIONS but tried to protect all these people. He even FIRED Special Prosecutor Archibold Cox, a real big mistake. Trump on the other hand has acted totally opposite to Nixon. When evidence of possible wrong doing of any of his people was revealed, he again dismissed them or asked them to resign. He allowed a major RIVAL of his to be appointed as the investigator of the matter and, even when pressured to do so, has steadfastly REFUSED to fire Mueller. He has NOT tried to interfere with Mueller\u2019s actions or investigation even when the investigation went well beyond the initial scope of the investigation, prying into Trump\u2019s business dealing over the years, his family, his social acquaintances and other matters not having anything to do with the \u201cRussian Election Interference and Collusion\u201d. Before you say anything, I did not vote for Trump or Clinton, I am politically neutral. I have tried to present this as an analysis strictly from the view point of what has happened and the LEGAL aspects of the matter. IF they can find and prove where Trump committed illegal acts with respect to the election, then let the chips fall where they may. I do not approve of being CONVICTED of a crime by the MEDIA. The media is NOT a Judge and/or Jury. ",

It is possible, although not likely, that he will be re-elected, then any such action would have to wait until 2025. At his age there is the possibility that he will die or become too disabled to stand trial. There is also the possibility that he will make a deal to resign on condition that he is not prosecuted. If none of these things happen, then it is likely that the indictments will be unsealed as soon as Trump is out of office, and he will have to answer to various charges of illegal dealings with the Russians during his campaign, money laundering, RICO violations, income tax evasion and violation of the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution. In terms of his legacy, I would give it near certainty that he will go down in history as the worst President of the United States. ",

Personally I think this whole impeach Trump thing before we have hard evidence of fucking actual high crimes and misdemeanors and prejudging him as guilty based on overly sensationized leftist media propaganda, really shows how fucking shamefully stupid Americans are becoming. To pre-judge anyone as guilty without extant evidence is not only unAmerican in my opinion, but just plain a display of moronic thinking. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: If he is indicted, I doubt it will be anytime in the near future. Based on what the media is reporting, the Special Counsel's Office (SCO) is investigating whether or not Trump obstructed justice when he implied he wanted Comey to drop the Flynn investigation and later fired him. The SCO may be investigating other crimes, but this seems like an obvious line of inquiry. Assuming the SCO has enough evidence against Trump, it is not clear whether or not the special counsel can indict a sitting president for a criminal offense. The case, Clinton v. Jones decided the president has no immunity from civil ligation for acts committed unrelated to his time in office. However, this decision does not say anything about criminal offenses. When investigating Bill Clinton, Ken Starr's office authored a report claiming a sitting president is not immune from criminal prosecution, but this theory has not been tested in the courts. If the SCO feels there is enough evidence to indict Trump for a criminal offense, he will most likely present that case to Congress, and they can decide whether or not to impeach. If they remove the president from office and the next president does not grant him a pardon, then he is vulnerable to prosecution. Even if he is granted a pardon, this does not prevent the states from indicting him under state laws. Assuming there is enough evidence to support impeachment, I doubt the Republican-controlled House will start the impeachment process right before the 2018 midterm elections. If the Democrats regain control of the House, they could begin impeachment proceedings sometime in 2019. Even if the House votes for impeachment, two-thirds of the Senate need to vote to convict, or the president would need to resign. Additionally, investigations like these take time. The Manafort indictment came five months after the appointment of the special counsel, but that indictment was only possible because the FBI was already investigating him. Bottom-line is I expect this investigation will continue for the at least another year if not more. If there is an indictment against Trump, I would be surprised if it happened before 2019. ",

So far it seems reasonably certain that he could be caught on some campaign issues with paying off some women to keep quiet about some personal issues. A good share of the country doesn't even care about it and even more don't believe there should be laws regarding such things. I personally believe that we should hold our politicians to a higher standard than that. But if we were to remove him from office over it and hold everybody else in Congress to the same standards\u2026 Washington would be a pretty lonely place. The point of that commentary isn't that I'm excusing it, it's that The senate is highly unlikelyto even remove him from office over it, much less send him to prison. ",

Democrats will win back the Senate majority in 2020, all thanks to President Trump The Actual Laws Trump Has Broken Amount to 10 Years in Prison President Trump Really May Go to Jail\u2014For the Rest of His Life ",

I believe, with all of my heart, and I literally pray my guts out about it daily, that this terrible, sick man who bears the undeserved title of POTUS will be tried and convicted of crimes committed before he assumed office. Even if he pardons himself before lumbering in his usual unbalanced manner out of the WH, he cannot pardon himself in regard to state crimes and so SDNY will be waiting for him. And as he has consigned so many to a life behind walls and masks (the smart ones anyway), he will be consigned to his time behind iron bars. I hope it is long enough for him to turn to dust there. ",

            "answer_text": "Not during his presidency, and possibly not after it either. The only example we have is Richard Nixon, who committed crimes while in office and was never prosecuted for any of them. The Constitution provides a single solution for a President accused of crimes - impeachment by the House (the functional equivalent of a grand jury indictment, or official charge of wrongdoing) followed by a trial in the Senate. If found guilty by 2/3 of the Senate, the president is immediately removed from office and is then subject to the possibility of civil or criminal prosecution. We\u2019ve had two presidents impeached - Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Neither was found guilty by the Senate (Johnson escaping by a single vote). Neither was really subject to prosecution after leaving office because the accusations against them were politically motivated. In Nixon\u2019s case, there were actual crimes committed. Articles of impeachment were being drawn up, and the Republican Senate leadership met with him to tell him that he would probably be convicted in the Senate on those charges. He chose to resign instead, which left him open to criminal prosecution once he was out of office, but he was almost immediately granted a full pardon by Gerald Ford. That is probably the same scenario that would play out for Trump if there is evidence of actual criminal behavior on his part. If he were to be impeached, convicted, and removed from office, he would undoubtedly be pardoned by Mike Pence and not subject to federal prosecution for those crimes. But\u2026 A presidential pardon only addresses federal crimes - it\u2019s useless against state crimes. Some of the stuff that Trump and his cronies have been accused of fall under the jurisdiction of NY and the AG of that state is investigating. It is quite possible that he could be charged with a host of federal crimes and be pardoned without even seeing the inside of a federal courtroom, only to walk into a buzzsaw in NY. It\u2019s also possible that he completes his one or two terms of office without any impeachment, but NY will still be waiting for him. If he goes to prison, it will likely be not because of what he did as Donald Trump, POTUS, it will be because of what he did as Donald Trump, a citizen of NY. ",

For two, if this President is impeached or removed from office because of crimes, a future President could issue a pardon like Ford did for Nixon. Three, without any idea of the nature and severity of potential charges, no one can guess about a potential conviction or sentence. Four, jury composition is difficult to grasp. There is one President and his lawyers could argue that a jury of peers can\u2019t be found. Five, Trump is not young at 72 and trials tend to take a long time to conduct with discovery, motions, and filings. Trump may die of old age before going to trial. Trump will never see the inside of a jail cell. ",

But because it is so crucially important to the wealthy interests who actually control our government to have us believe that our \u201csystem\u201d is infallible, the imprisonment of a president, no matter how egregious his offenses might be, is a practical impossibility. GW Bush, by every definition an outright war criminal and political fraud of gigantic proportions, along with the other criminals of that administration, enjoy continued freedom and prosperity even though they did things that would have resulted in either imprisonment or execution, if they were subject to impartial US \u201cjustice\u201d that most other folks would be subject to. They escaped this fate because the wealthy class do not ever want for us average folks to get the idea that an administration should be culpable for the actions they take, in our name. ",

If Trump or anyone in his campaign solicited contribution of information from individuals associated with a foreign national government, regardless if they knew the law or not, they could be found to have committed a crime.

What about the President?\u201d (This has to do with my tax fraud conviction and Trump\u2019s presumed guilt in the same arena.) My answer to that is I have to worry about me and own my crime. What Donald Trump does is his business - and not mine. But I\u2019ve read a lot about Donald Trump and I\u2019d bet he\u2019s a bigger tax cheat than I was or ever could be. I mean\u2026look at the lengths he\u2019s gone to keep his tax returns hidden. What would that tell you? More than a whiff of impropriety! There are a lot of people in positions of power who want him prosecuted. And it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if after he serves his term, they\u2019re going to go after him with a vengeance. So I\u2019d say there actually is more than a negligible chance that Trump could eventually serve some time in a prison. Remember\u2026I bunkeed with Paul Manafort. And he was pretty high up on the food chain. Now he\u2019s serving a 7 year sentence. It could happen to the President once he\u2019s no longer \u201cteflonized\u201d by his position as the head of the USA. ",

He should but he has skated all of his life because he has money and good attorneys. the fat orange one has done numerous things that he should be in jail for but he buys his way out of. Hopefully(!!!??) the Russian investigation and his yrs of money laundering will FINALLY put him where he belongs. Many around him have been found guilty of lying, etc and since he is so insecure and controlling u can bet he was and is involved in numerous illegal activities. I only hope he goes to jail, where he belongs, and not only fined. Fines mean nothing to him just like his tax bill. Yes, he will pay more in taxes but it won't really hurt him or his friends but the people it will hurt most r the everyday men, women and children. ",

America has never removed a President from office before their term has expired. We\u2019ve come close, but we\u2019ve never done it and I doubt we ever will. When President Nixon stepped down in shame in 1975, he was immediately pardoned by his former Vice President, Gerald Ford. Many of us liberals were outraged, but it probably helped heal the nation to pardon him. Remember, that pardoning includes an admission of a crime. The best case scenario would be for Mueller to uncover devastating evidence of the vast crimes Mr. Trump has committed, before and during his Presidency, forcing Mr. Trump to step down. At that point, Pence would likely pardon him too. Trump wouldn\u2019t fade into obscurity, but his legacy would be forever tarnished, far moreso than he\u2019s tarnished himself to date. He\u2019s 71 and putting him in jail would just be seen as petty and vindictive. ",

Even then, due to him being the president, it is doubtful that he would see the inside of a prison. Other factors to consider are he's old , any charges brought against him a good attorney will keep him out of court for a long time,at this point age becomes a factor. My personal opinion on this is he, and along with most of his offspring and close business associates should have all been in orange jumpsuits long before now. If it's proven that he's guilty of any of the accusations against him, he needs to be held responsible for those. Under the current political environment we are in at the moment I don't have any faith that this will happen. ",

His former presidency will give him no cover, but it will increase his already unjustified sense of invulnerability. He will once again fail in business, and he will resort to his past illegal tactics to save himself from financial disaster. He\u2019s not so talented a crook as Bernie Madoff, but he\u2019s just as persistent. Everyone will be waiting in anticipation of the inevitable restart of his life of crime. As soon as it begins, the victims will complain and the authorities will pounce. It will at last be payback time for decent, law-abiding Americans. ",

Of course what liberals really want to accomplish is one standard when allegations are made against Republicans and conservatives guilty until proven innocent, and another when there is actually criminal activity by a Liberal like Hillary.

The IRS people are not stupid. And Donald Trump doesn\u2019t file the returns himself, he has hired professionals do it for him.

There are other scams, including fraudulent rent increases in some of his NY apartment buildings. I\u2019m sure there will be tax law violations found. I don\u2019t know if the statute of limitations will rule out some prosecutions but some are clearly recent enough to be prosecutable. These offenses are much worse, and much different, from the normal political hyperbole in our politics. Mr Trump is more like a mobster than he is like a regular politician. This stuff will land him in prison, not disagreements about his political positions or policies. ",

HOWEVER\u2026.the instant he is no longer president he can be charged, tried and convicted just like anyone else. That is what I think is going to happen, assuming we have a peaceful transition of power, which is not guaranteed anymore. After Trump is out of office he will be charged with dozens of financial crimes, convicted and maybe go to jail. He IS very wealthy, even if not as wealthy as he says. The wealthy have a much lower chance of going to jail in the U.S., so he MIGHT be able to get away with his crimes. ",

Then there is a risk he doesn\u2019t recognize his loss in the 2020 election. He would quickly be sent to Gitmo as an enemy combatant (working on behalf of the Russians to destroy our democracy). If he doesn\u2019t end up in Gitmo after his presidency he won\u2019t risk trial on any one of dozens of potential charges. He\u2019ll likely seek his asylum in Russia. He knows the Intelligence Agencies and Military support our Constitution and not his Russian backed schemes.
