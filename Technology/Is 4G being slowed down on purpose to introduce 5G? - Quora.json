            "answer_text": "Not exactly. Data usage in telecommunications is increasing at a furious pace, 5G was developed as the next generation of wireless service to provide for increased demand and future IoT (Internet of Things). Carriers now invest in 5G expansion, and limit investment in older technology, like 4G. While an area waits for 5G upgrades the existing 4G network is being pushed to its limits. As more users send/receive more data with their 4G phones (some still have 3G) the network gets congested and your service becomes slower. ",

            "answer_text": "Most carriers never bothered to implement 4G. Most still use 4G LTE, the code name of \u201cfaster than 3G, but not fast enough to call it 4G.\u201d The few that did eventually role out 4G usually call it 4G LTE-A because they\u2019re afraid just calling it 4G will sound like it is something less than 4G LTE.To more directly answer your question though, it\u2019s unlikely at this point that any carrier would deliberately worsen the network that most of their customers rely on. There are a lot of factors that play into wireless connectivity, if you\u2019ve actually experienced a worse connection it could be due to a variety of things. ",
