            "answer_text": "Health information technology (HIT) is information technology applied to health and health care (including the aged care market). It supports health information management across computerized systems and the secure exchange of health information between consumers, providers, payers, and quality monitors. Based on an often-cited 2008 report on a small series of studies conducted at four sites that provide ambulatory care\u2013three U.S. medical centers and one in the Netherlands\u2013 the use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) was viewed as the most promising tool for improving the overall quality, safety and efficiency of the health delivery system. According to a 2006 report by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, broad and consistent utilization of HIT will: Improve health care quality or effectiveness; Increase health care productivity or efficiency; Prevent medical errors and increase health care accuracy and procedural correctness; Reduce health care costs; Increase administrative efficiencies and healthcare work processes; Decrease paperwork and unproductive or idle work time; Extend real-time communications of health informatics among health care professionals; and Expand access to affordable care.

            "answer_text": "As a medical IT student in Germany, I can tell you a couple of things about it. When I was getting ready to enter university, i was pretty hyped for IT. But there was something about it that seemed a little\u2026well \u201cdull\u201d I guess. In german I\u2019d say \u201ctrocken\u201d. How to spice it up? Combination! Combining IT with Medicine/Health made the whole thing more interesting and also gives you a direction you could get very involved in. After graduation you could do the same jobs as people who majored in \u201cnormal\u201d IT, because we have many classes together. So it sure isn\u2019t a limitation. Classes we only Health IT students have: Basics of Medicine, Documentation Systems in Hospitals, Biosignal Processing, Medical Computer Graphics To name a few. If you\u2019re interested, go mail a professor or even just attend the class to get the feel of it. ",
