            "answer_text": "Both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals use the 2.4 GHz band. When both are turned on, the data throughput of Bluetooth will drop sharply, the paired devices will be difficult, the Wi-Fi will be intermittently interrupted, and the network will be limited. At present, there is no way to cure this problem, but you can use the following scheme to temporarily solve some problems.  There are 4 ways to provide, you can refer to the following: Method 1: Connect to a 5GHz wireless network Now that you know the problem is in the band conflict, consider buying a dual-band (2.4GHz + 5GHz) router and connecting to a 5GHz Wi-Fi network. This method can completely solve the interference problem. In short, don't use the same frequency band as Bluetooth devices. Method 2: Replace the Wi-Fi channel Take the TP-Link router as an example. Log in to the router web management page and find the channel option in Wireless Settings -> Basic Settings and change it to any of 1, 6, and 11. These are 2.4 GHz non-overlapping transmission channels, which are more stable than other channels. Method 3: Turn on the NIC Bluetooth coexistence function In the wireless network cards produced in recent years, the Bluetooth coexistence function is supported by finding the Bluetooth Collaboration or Bluetooth Coexistence Mode (name may be different) in the advanced tab of the network adapter properties and set it to enable (Enable) ). Windows will automatically reconnect to Wi-Fi, and the interference with Bluetooth will be alleviated. Method 4: Keep away from interference sources Separate the Bluetooth terminal from devices that use the 2.4 GHz band, such as routers, microwave ovens, and cordless phones. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhenever I connect my Bluetooth headphones with my phone, WiFi stops working or slows down. Why?\u201d Does this happen on all WiFi networks, or just on one specific network, probably your home WiFi? If it happens with all WiFi networks, then it is probably a fault in the phone. If it happens only with one network, then that suggests an incompatibility between your phone and your router. A few percent of device/router pairs have issues such as: The device will not even see the WiFi network.The device detects the network but refuses to connect.The connection is erratic.The connection is slow.If it is incompatibility and it affects only your connection to your home WiFi, then you might need to add a second network either with a wireless access point or a WiFi Range Extender. Make sure that the new network uses a different network name. ",
