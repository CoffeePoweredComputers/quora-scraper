            "answer_text": "Personally, I got a Prusa printer and am very happy with that decision. It is more expensive than an Creality or other lower cost printer, but it is that much better. I built a less expensive printer similar to the Creality Ender, but I was never satisfied with the prints or the quality of the machine. Now, the Ender is a great machine for the money, but I\u2019d prefer the Prusa Mini for just a bit more money. ",
