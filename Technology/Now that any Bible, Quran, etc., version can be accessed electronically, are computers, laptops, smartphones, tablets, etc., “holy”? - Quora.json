Oh I get it, the ink & paper must be blessed before it\u2019s written on, NOT! The written word is the issue here, however it\u2019s written, God blesses it because He doesn\u2019t care! Think about the POW\u2019s in Vietnam, they obviously didn\u2019t have an \u2018AUTHORIZED King James Bible there but they had a Bible, written from their memories, on whatever they got their hands on but it was still their only Bible!

            "answer_text": "As for the Bible, I would agree with Matheus Costa\u2019s response, that it is the contents, the concepts, the ideas, the message of the holy book that are holy; \u2018set aside for a purpose\u2019, not the books, scrolls, parchments, animal skins, or computer chips that they are written on. I am not a lawyer, so couldn\u2019t say as to the legality of an elected official swearing on a DVD containing a PDF of the Bible, or some such; I think that is more traditional than anything else. In an age of fast printing, and easily accessible copies of any book, the \u2018holiness\u2019 of a specific Bible is probably a concept that is no longer valid. Such a thing does not necessarily make it profane, or common, or without value, it just emphasizes how extraordinary its contents are. ",
