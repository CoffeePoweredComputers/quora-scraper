            "answer_text": "There are several things cooking that will become more important around 2020. The one that still has my attention the most is augmented reality glasses. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Magic Leap, Apple, are all spending billions on developing these and other players from China are too. But around that time cryptocurrencies will actually start being useful, some cars will start self-driving, and mobile phones will do very advanced augmented reality (multi-party, for instance). Artificial Intelligence is getting better, and the effect on our jobs and lives will be very apparent by then, if it\u2019s not already. If you haven\u2019t already tried the camera (product scanning) feature in Amazon\u2019s app, or Google Assistant, then you are missing out on something else that\u2019s coming in the glasses that will arrive about then: the ability to look at things and learn more about them, or buy them. Voice tech will be so good by 2020 that many will move much of their computing over to it (I already have moved a good percentage over to using Google Home and Amazon Alexa, along with Google Assistant and Siri, etc). 2020 sure is looking like a pivotal year for technology. To wrap it up, my bet on biggest advances for humans will be augmented reality glasses (some call them spatial computing, or \u201cXR\u201d because they will wrap in virtual reality too). Why? Because this will change how we interface ourselves with computing and that will enable self-driving cars, cryptocurrencies, new ways of entertaining, shopping, and educating ourselves, and more. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "For technologies to become disruptive, they need to fit into larger narratives of what the world is looking for. Right now, these are the two biggest trends: Efficiency. Relentless competition and a growing population means we have to do more with less, and with abundance rather than scarcity.Pollution. People are starting to appreciate that economic growth is not the whole answer, especially when it means a tradeoff with health. People understand that we need to maintain nature as to improve quality of life.Most technologies usually take several decades from they are invented until they start disrupting the world. We already know about a number of technologies that will change the world as we know it in the next decade, since they all fit into one or both of the megatrends above: BlockchainSolar energyElectric transportationAutomation and roboticsArtificial Intelligence and Big DataInternet of Things (IoT)Augmented Reality (AR)Low cost space launchesFor many this may also double as a list of the most hyped technologies - but just because something is hyped doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going to happen.
