            "answer_text": "Well it depends\u2026There are many types of razor out there so the is not a simple answer. I have some old and modern open blade razor (straight razors) and based on the age of the old one a hundred years is very possible. DE razor blades give me 3\u20139 shaves depending on the blade and the razor I use with it. The \u2018clubs\u2019 seem to find that one week is enough for most of their customers. Plastic disposables are in the 3\u20139 shave range as well. For me the multiple blade versions too often pull and cut whiskers below my skin line and cause irritation. The duller they get the more this happens to me. For some people this progressively closer shave is desired but the low angle of my whiskers has me tossing them after two or three shaves. Electric razors\u2026 the good ones last years and if your face likes them enjoy. The comfort of a shave and the life of a blade can be improved with preparation and a good lather or cream. Whiskers do soften with water and by washing with soap and water the protective oil can be removed and water allowed to soften the whisker. Skin will also soften and while a little exfoliation is nice a good shave process should also lubricate the skin to improve the glide of the razor frame and blade across the skin. Modern blades are a marvel of technology. Corrosion is almost eliminated with a micro layer of platinum or chrome. Cutting force is reduced by the application of PTFE (Teflon) at the expense of altering the temper and hardness of the steel. Electronic etching can produce an ultra fine edge. Abrasives used in sharpening have arrived from the space age. Electrostatic classification allows precision \u201cgrit\u201d vastly finer than old school classification in water which was limited by stokes law and thermal motion. Exotic ceramics, diamond, cubic boron nitrite are all available at submicron sizes. (See Stokes law and Brownian motion also Boron nitride - Wikipedia). Technology has moved the problem from the sharpness of blade to preference, skin+whisker/hair preparation and operator. It can take a while to discover what works for an individual and the answer can change over a lifetime. I am a fan of wet shaving\u2026 blade, brush, soap, water.It is a blood sport so do not share kit with anyone and exercise prudent sanitation. The micro abrasions from any razor even electric razors risk transfer of viruses and bacteria so sanitation is important. Some folk do get a month or more of shaves from some shaving things. But for me five shaves is a lot for a DE blade or tossable plastic razor. The differences are not obvious so sample packs of DE blades are a good thing if you decide to try a DE razor. My travel tossable is a BiC yellow handled thing. Easy to rinse clean, inexpensive good for one or two OK shaves and TSA mostly OK so far. If I check luggage I pack a DE and a couple blades that happen to have a dull slot keep safe in the plastic dispenser. ",
