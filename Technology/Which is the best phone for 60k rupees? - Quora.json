            "answer_text": "There are quite a lot of phones which you can buy around \u20b960k. So if you want some really fast updates and the best camera in the smartphone market you can go for Google pixel 3 or maybe even xl(even one of the loudest speakers). You can also consider the most satisfactory brand OnePlus new flagship or maybe even flagship killer which combines the latest hardware(pop up,90Hz display) with \u201cthe best os\u201d. And if you want some brand value you can go with Samsung's flagship S10 which combines everything and brings the best experience so its your own personal preference what you will prefer all these phones are great value for mlney especially the OnePlus ones so choose wisely. Happy buying\u2026. ",
