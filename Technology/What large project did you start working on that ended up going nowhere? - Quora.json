            "answer_text": "Most of my large projects that ended up going nowhere were software projects. They could have succeeded if I worked harder and got help or funding from others, but I chose to do it myself. Sometimes, in software, the game-industry and gaming-public can change overnight. So a project can go nowhere, just because the market moved it's interest elsewhere before the project is completed. ",

It is not yet a clothes peg but \u2026 together with friends and colleagues we found a purpose to a little peg called WimClip which you can use to connect wishing cards or pictures on a wall. You see : if some doors close another opens. KeepDreamingandworkingGreetings. ",
