            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re asking about the \u2018small unmanned aviation system\u2019 kind of drone under 55 pounds, right now it seems to be China that makes the best. DJI\u2019s pretty much regarded as the best at every price point and they\u2019ve got something like 85% of the market for GPS and vision stabilized \u2018pro-sumer\u2019 drones like Phantoms and Mavics, plus the professional and enterprise Mavic 2 versions and their Matrice and Agra lines. Their new Mavic Mini is the most capable drone under 250 grams and is flying off the shelves just a few days after its release on 11/11/19. I don\u2019t know all the reasons why China\u2019s the best now, might be because of some of the sticking points in the trade negotiations. Or, for drones it might be because they\u2019re smart, lots of dedicated and talented engineers, lots of smart hands to build stuff, and they got into the market with the best product as they were moving way past \u2018developing nation\u2019 status and have developed into a manufacturing juggernaut where the government\u2019s a partner in every concern. EMAX, Beta, and other FPV/racing drones are Chinese, too, and are amazing for what they do for the price. Yuneec\u2019s Chinese, may be in trouble. The Yuneec pilot\u2019s forum has lots of complaints with service. It took me nearly six months to get an $1800 thermal camera I crashed repaired while the dealer waited for parts. They don\u2019t seem to be much competition for DJI, don\u2019t have good 3rd party apps like Litchi or DroneDeploy. Parrot\u2019s French, and IMHO their Bebops are toy drones and the Anafi may be too. They\u2019d need years of building better drones to convince me to buy another Parrot. Draganflyer\u2019s Canadian and they\u2019re what I started with years ago, but they\u2019re geared toward enterprise and first responder markets and and have nothing I can afford or want for what I do. Autel Robotics is US-based with their EVO, but Chinese owned, has some following but gets reviews like \u2018too little too late\u2019. Some people like them because they don\u2019t do geofencing. I haven\u2019t had an EVO, don\u2019t need one, don\u2019t mind being geo-fenced. Skydio is a US company, looks like their Skydio 2 might challenge the Mavic Platinum and Mavic 2 in some ways, but we\u2019re a long way off of whatever they might do next. I pre-ordered mine the day after they released and am now waiting for production run 3, some time in the Spring of 2020. They\u2019re not going to beat anybody at market share if they can\u2019t deliver, and I wish them the best. Some articles make me think they\u2019re wanting to get into autonomous delivery/survey drones as soon as the US decides on the systems for drone traffic management. This video comparing Mavic 2 vs Skydio 2 tracking is great:  ",
