            "answer_text": "The fundamentals of chemical engineering are necessary, I.e. Thermodynamics, mass and heat transfer, fluid dynamics, chemical kinetics. It is important to understand how to measure and understand the density, viscosity and other properties associated with fluid. But more  understanding the change of these properties before and after a chemical reaction or a process is even more important. However, I would recommend that you prepare yourself by spending time on control systems, mass and energy balances and instrumentation. It is not only important to design processses but also instrumentation that are able to be controlled and activated when specific parameters of a process arise.  For example, a pressure safety valve is placed along process flow lines in order to protect upstream equipment from being exposed to pressures greater than what the equipment was designed for. A process upset or failure could cause the pressure to build up in the equipment. At this point the PSV will pop open and begin relieving the built up pressure before the internal pressure reaches the maximum design pressure of the equipment.  Once enough pressure is relived the PSV will close. It is also important to have a thorough understanding of thermodynamics and fluid dynamics because if you relieve a gas from a higher pressure to a lower pressure, it will drop in temperature across the valve due to the ideal gas law. If dealing with a large pressure drop then you will have a large temperature drop, sometimes into the sub-zero ranges. At this point the construction and selection of the material of the PSV and the downstream piping should be able to operate at the cryogenic temperatures.I can go on and on but the PSV is a great example of capturing the necessary skills of the process engineers. TLDR - fundamentals requirements are : thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, chemical kinetics, mass and heat transfer. Specific requirements: control systems, mass and energy balances, instrumentation, mechanics of materials, computational modeling ",

            "answer_text": "In terms of technical skills they have already been mentioned. I\u2019d like to add that being able to read, interpret and draw p&ids is crucial. To be able to look at a drawing and see flaws or better ways and also to see safer ways of operating. Which brings me to my next few points: Process safety: Know the best practices, know the basic safety things such as \u2018Lock out tag out\u2019 whether you are in design, operation or commissioning; safety needs to be at the top of your list right above efficiency and cost benefit Communication; if you want to be taken seriously you MUST be able to communicate ideas effectively. You need to be able to sell a good solution, often you are talking to non-engineers and often they only see numbers and profit. Sometimes a safe design is more costly, you need to be able to communicate the value of your solutions and not get bogged down. Finally stay humble :) ",
