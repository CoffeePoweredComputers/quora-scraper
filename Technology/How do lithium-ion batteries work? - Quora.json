            "answer_text": "Lithium-Ion battery works in similar to normal batteries. Principle is the same as exchange ions and flow of electrons. Below mentioned are the few properties:WorkingThere is an Anode and Cathode in a Lithium Ion battery. At present Graphite( Carbon Material) is used as Anode. The reason behind the use of Graphite can be explained due to its internal structure.While charging, Lithium-ion (Positive charge) move from Lithium based Cathode to Anode through the Electrolyte. At Anode, the Ions place themselves between two Graphite layers.  Blue ones are the Lithium Ions and Black ones are carbon atoms. There is no chemical reaction that takes place at Anode.  During discharge process, electrons flow through the external circuit to the device and back to the Cathode(Layer d Oxide) e.g Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminium Oxide, Lithium Iron Phosphate, Lithium Cobalt Oxide). Positive Lithium Ions move from Anode to Cathode via Electrolyte.  Again there is no chemical reaction that takes place at Cathode. Electrolyte would be a Lithium Salt in an Organic solvent.  Charging of these batteries are done at Constant Current/Constant Voltage(CC/CV) principle. Initially charging current is set at 0.5C (0.5*Battery Capacity) to charge the battery. Once the battery State of charge is 95-98%(SOC) constant voltage is maintained decreasing the charging current.Charging Discharging curves are based on the type of Cathode material used. Lithium Ion batteries are know as maintenance free batteries. They are also know for their high specific energy (90-200 wh/kg). They can be operated in wide range of temperature operating ranging from -40C to +75C. They don't have memory effect. I hope this helped you. ",

            "answer_text": "Lithium ion batteries are those batteries that use a lithium compound in their internal structure to act as an electrochemical cell. Lithium is a highly reactive alkali metal with just one electron in its outermost shell. So having it play an active role in batteries is essential to create a battery with high energy density. The lithium ion batteries are of three types mainly. Lithium Cobalt Oxide batteries:- These batteries are commonly known as ICR batteries and use a Copper/Graphite anode (negative terminal) and a Lithium Cobalt Oxide compound as a cathode (positive terminal).These batteries can be easily manufactured to hold very high capacities and also possess good energy densities thus making them useful for laptops, mobile phones, tablets, consumer electronics and other Personal Digital Assistants. However, due to their higher internal resistance, their use has been limited to only low drain devices with their discharge rates restricted to less than 2 Amps continuous. 2) Lithium Manganate Oxide batteries:- These are also known as IMR batteries and use a Copper/Graphite anode (negative terminal) and a Lithium Manganate Oxide compound as a cathode (positive terminal). It is easy to manufacture IMR batteries at higher current delivery capabilities, thus making them ideal for use in Electronic Cigarettes, Portable Power Tools and Electrical Vehicles. They can give upto 20 Amps continuous and have peak current abilities of upto 40 Amps even for smaller battery sizes such as 18650 size. 3) Lithium Ferrous Phosphate batteries:- These are a special type of lithium ion batteries that use a Lithium Ferrous Phosphate compound as their cathode. They are also known as IFR batteries. The fact is that these batteries can be manufactured to have higher discharge rates as well as lower discharge rates. They are also thermally stable and have lesser chances of explosion or thermal runaway because of the stable bonds between Lithium, Iron and the Phosphate. Unlike their lithium ion counterparts, they can undergo 2000 charge cycles on an average, while the former can undergo only 300 to 500 charge cycles on an average. However, the nominal voltage of the IFR batteries are 3.2 Volts with a maximum voltage of 3.6 Volts, different from conventional lithium ion batteries which have a nominal voltage of 3.6 Volts and a maximum voltage of 4.2 Volts. This makes them an ideal replacement for Lead Acid batteries when they are in a pack of 4 cells in series. However, they need Battery Management Systems to monitor them. The lower voltage decreases their overall energy density but IFR batteries are still useful for their applications. ",
