            "answer_text": "As it was mentioned already, there are two ways of looking at it: a view from a person who\u2019s experienced all that year 2018 has to offer, and a view from a person who\u2019s been at the point of Internet\u2019s widespread usage (late 1990s).They will be two different answers. I suppose a more detailed response is needed, only if to record it for my own child (who\u2019s Gen Alpha) and won\u2019t ever know about the dial-up. Sigh. So, looking back, it was a monstrosity - I don\u2019t even have a proper word for it. The following steps were needed to secure that coveted connection: a computer (not readily available in every house, and house which had a computer was frequented by those without one; I made a laptop purchase, in year 2000, if my memory serves me correct, and total was about $2k - no, it was not a \u201cloaded\u201d option, just something you won\u2019t pay even $100 today). And yes, I am THAT old.a phone connection (regular landline, which you would then pluck out of the wall socket, and connect the cord to your machine, just pray that the snapping piece won\u2019t break off due to frequent usage)a monthly Internet subscriptionand inability to use a phone while you are online (at all, all calls would get dropped)You then sit and wait for MINUTES (!) while the machine was making a connection - that modem thing (stands for \u201cmodulator and demodulator\u201d) was critical.And so you would know first-hand what AOL was about (back when everyone who was anyone was on it) and what Yahoo! (company) was (bigger than Google is today, really, it was THE only search engine, with a layout that will make you cringe) and if you wanted to send a message to someone, you would do it only when you were in front of a computer (no, text-while-walking was not an option). For reference, here are the sounds..   Now, the best part of it all was what the Internet meant to people who experienced it way back when.It was a miracle, really.It truly was. You can send emails - instantly! - it\u2019s coming from a person who was raised on telegrams (no, not the app) and letters (the snail mail kind, which at times got lost).It also meant not going to the library as much (the actual walking and talking to humans there, using the manual system of looking up books and reference materials - oh, the stories I have for you!) - and here, there was this magical experience of getting to what you want by simply typing in commands and otherwise being pretty much unstoppable. It\u2019s same as making a leap from basically being rooted in Middle Ages and into Industrial revolution in a matter of a couple of years. I was actually on the \u201ccutting edge\u201d of it all - I worked at what we now call startup (I was a programmer in my past life), and the company worked on spreading the magical service of enabling people faxing from their machine. Yeah, that faxing thing was alive and well, and way back then, the company had quite many clients. It was sold then for what back then was insane amount of money (basically one large house in a good neighborhood today - nothing monumental to speak of, in year 2018) - only to be upstaged by eFax as a competitor, and then the whole faxing thing went away for good\u2026 ",

A lot less videos and bigger pictures, because they took forever to load, more goofy little spinning things and plain text. Most sites were \u2018under construction\u2019 semi-permanently, with little joke construction worker graphics and all. The Internet wasn\u2019t as popular, people were still using things like BBS\u2019s (think something like a forum, with some games and things, mostly text based or low graphics). A lot of times your chatting, gaming or browsing would be interrupted by someone trying to make a call or \u2018noise\u2019 on the line would randomly fill the screen with text gibberish. Also, if you were using chat, sometimes the connection would get so bad, you\u2019d have a \u2018net split\u2019 that could divide up chat rooms like some kind of dimensional portal and other strangeness.

            "answer_text": "Dialup internet connection is a service that allows connection to the internet through a standard telephone line. In which the user's computer or router uses an attached modem to encode and decode the information into and from audio frequency signals, respectively. Also, this allows you to receive and send an email, search the World Wide Web, participate in chat rooms and plenty of other features the web has to offer. Dial-up connections to the Internet require no infrastructure other than the telephone network and the modems and servers needed to make and answer the calls. Because telephone access is widely available, dial-up is often the only choice available for rural or remote areas, where broadband installations are not prevalent due to low population density and high infrastructure cost.
