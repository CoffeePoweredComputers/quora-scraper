            "answer_text": "Books! If you want theoretical knowledge, you can subscribe to newsletters, magazines, get a library card if you have one near, or simply buy the books you need from stores if it is feasible. It\u2019s not necessary to buy new books only, second-hand stuff is also alright. If that also isn\u2019t in your budget, then you can ask your friends/ neighbours/ family to teach you if they live in your vicinity. If you want practical knowledge - you\u2019ll either need a hands-on approach from a qualified individual, or someone who actually works in that particular domain to get a hang of the subject/work/process. There are also colleges that provide at-home education by mailing (via post) learning materials and assessments which are posted for evaluation. Honestly, the avenues for studies are many. You just have to search for them :) Cheers and happy learning! ",
