            "answer_text": "Due to the volatility, it can seem like cryptocurrencies are not a reliable way to invest. But it is quite possible to adapt to this. So yes, this is a good way to invest. Moreover, stablecoins are not as volatile as other coins. Their price is pegged to real currencies such as the dollar or euro. You won't capitalize on price changes, but you can take advantage of the ecosystem. A good example is the geckoin platform. You can invest in their stablecoin eurg and receive passive income. ",
