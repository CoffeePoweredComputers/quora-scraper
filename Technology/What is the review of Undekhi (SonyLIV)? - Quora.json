            "answer_text": " Undekhi web series is the new crime-drama series from SonyLIV. SonyLIV is the new streaming platform announced in May 2020. After \u2018Your Honor\u2018 and \u2018The Raikar Case\u2019, Undekhi web series the third series on the platform. This series premiere on 10 July 2020. Plot Incidents of innocent and wealthy people escaping by killing someone, crushing someone, torturing someone, are not rare in India. After doing this, these influential people do not regret even a little. Our society has witnessed many such incidents. Movies have also been made on such incidents and now web series is also being made. SonyLIV\u2019s web series \u2018Undekhi\u2019 is also inspired by similar incidents. The story is set in a top hotel in a picturesque location in Manali where a grand wedding is planned. Daman and Teji are couples. Teji specifically invites wedding makers from Delhi to shoot the entire event. Meanwhile, a soldier from the Sunderbans is on trial for a tribal girl on the run. He tracks her to Manali. What happens when one of the wedding video crew becomes a witness to a murder and accidentally shoots it? How is it related to the Sundarbans probe? Does the overall power-drama on display by different parties make the story a cross? Undekhi web series is the story of a thrilling, kill-and-run race, in which there are many twists.  Review Screenplay The \u2018Unseen\u2019 web series is mostly successful because it succeeds in presenting the power struggle and one-handicap in an entertaining and exciting way. It is, on the surface, a simple story of standing up for what is right, but its beauty lies in the establishment of influential people. There is a thrill in this crime thriller series but there are many holes in the story, which are easily known. Many of the points in it are part of the narrative, which we know and may seem predictable, but it is presented attractively. In the first three-four episodes, there is a lot of thrill in it, but as the series progresses, it also adds many different stories, which slows its pace and also reduces the thrill. But this does not go away. Leave these shortcomings, then it hangs. Another problem in this show is the abusive use of it. Abuse and abuses are a new trend for web show makers. Inexplicable dialogue and needless foul-mouthed abuses. Not only this, now the abuses have also been renamed, which has been seen as very unnecessary. This carelessness with a good concept makes the subject lighter. Performance The actors have done a fantastic job in this series. They have covered the shortcomings with their skills. Dibyendu Bhattacharya is the central protagonist of the series in the character of DSP Ghosh. He has a special style, which also suits him. His character is instantly likable, and he has played his part in galleries with an intense attitude. Surya Sharma in the role of Rinku has done an amazing job. He has brought to life the role of a domineering, cruel and sly youngster. Harsha Chhaya has played the role of a bastard, drunk, ill-tempered elder.  Ankur Rathi has effectively portrayed the character of Daman trapped between family and girlfriend. He incorporates despair and confusion into his prophecy. Abhishek Chauhan as Rishi impresses. Anchal Singh also influences in the role of Teji. Direction The story is based on the Satya incident and Ashish R Shukla, director and creator, has shown his creativity in reshaping it. he is nice and very close to reality. He has not allowed the series to move much. Other Departments The screenplay is well-worked. However, there are many holes in the script written by Mohinder Pratap Singh, Umesh Padalkar and Siddharth Sengupta, which are easily visible. The dialogues by Varun Badola are excellent. Should you watch it or not? Despite some shortcomings, this web series entertains enough. Undekhi web series can be a good option for those who watching a different type of crime series. Cast The series features Harsh Chhaya, Dibyendu Bhattacharya, Ankur Rathee, Surya Sharma, Anchal Singh, Abhishek Chauhan, Ayn Zoya, Apeksha Porwal and Sayandeep Sen in the pivotal role. Makers Ashish R Shukla is the director of the series. Siddharth Sengupta creates Undekhi web series. ",
