            "answer_text": "The answer is no. To work on the Pi4 you have to find an OS that was made to run on the Pi4 because it uses a different ARM processor from other Pis. I suggest that you do a search for OSs that work on the Pi4. I had to check to get this right. Raspbian - Wikipedia says that Stretch was the cute name used for Raspbian OS release 9. Buster OS release 10 had to come out in order to support Pi4. The wikipedia article has a table of green checks and red x\u2019s to graphically indicate which hardware is supported. Download Raspbian for Raspberry Pi will probably change as the OS is updated or upreleased. Today, it shows three zip versions of Buster available for download. I find the medium sized one best for my needs, it is a working desktop version but without LibreOffice, GIMP and other softwares that I can install, later. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t yet have a Raspberry Pi 4. However\u2026 The latest release of Raspbian is Buster. Since it coincides with the release of the Raspberry Pi 4, I\u2019m assuming there are reasons. The RPi 4 uses a different SOC (System On a Chip) than previous Raspberry Pi boards and has some significant hardware changes. such as a second HDMI port. No doubt Buster includes devices drivers and other software that supports and utilizes the new hardware. Stretch would be a step backward. At best, you would lose functionality. If Stretch includes software that isn\u2019t currently a part of the Buster release, there are reasons for that. For example, I\u2019ve heard that Buster will have access to a new version of Wolfram Language. ",
