            "answer_text": "Contact tracing will become a major tool when and if the Socialists take over the White House. The Socialist will trace and target all opposition to their agenda. People spying on their neighbors, employers submitting lists of subversive employees, news papers controlled by the Socialist government to print their propaganda and lists of employers who remain loyal to self determination will be put out of business just as the subversive employees will be black balled from employment. Does this sound familiar? It should because it is used in China, Russia, Iran and a number of other oppressive countries. Connecting the dots would give you a better picture of just how close we are. * Deliberate instigation of class and social warfare - *constant attempts to disarm the public.- * Constant propaganda machines bombarding the * airways, * news stand and * social media - *censorship of anti-Socialist stories, * blogs, * social media and * internet. * using radicalized extremist to destroy reminders of history * to protest against individuality, personal freedom and free choice. And * using violence against all that don\u2019t agree that Socialism is best. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what type of contact tracing you mean. Many people are not able to remember where they have been or who they were with in the last 2 weeks. So those contact tracing applications that will help you reconstruct your movement will most likely stay. Those who transmit that information especially to a central authority will not be accepted.
