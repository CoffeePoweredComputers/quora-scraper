            "answer_text": "Plain and simple answer. VHS offers no real advantage - absolutely none - over DVD. First, the VHS tape is so big and clumsy. Compare it with DVD and see how convenient the DVD is for handling. Second VHS had poor quality video. Even though technically SD (486i NTSC, 576i PAL), the output is too noisy. The video is prone to fading and damage over the years. Play a VHS tape on modern flatscreen high resolution TVs - you will stop watching in 15 minutes. Third, the best sound that one can get in VHS is Dolby Surround whereas DVD upped the antennae to Dolby Digital 5.1. VHS is dead. DVD is also almost dead, by the way. Current disc standard is 4K UHD Blu Ray or at least 1080p FHD Blu Ray. The only advantage of VHS could be that every VHS tape is re-recordable and one could record new content on the tape. DVD (most of them) are write once only. ",
