            "answer_text": "May sound really simple but - Getting a job By getting a job, you are earning money, you are paying taxes and paying into a system. The more people that pay in, hypothetically, the better the system it can be, and the more robust it can be. Once we are paying into the system and contributing, we have to make sure that we aren\u2019t taking more out of it! For example in the UK where you have free healthcare, you can pay taxes but go to the accident and emergency room for a grazed knee, you are depleting the resources, especially when busy. Second Level Starting a business, like below, if you start a business and it is successful, then you can employ people and increase the employment stats. By doing this you will pay business tax, PAYE, or something similar and drive the economy, this is good. You just have to make sure you and your businesses pay your tax! Many start a business, and mitigate their taxes, which they can do legally and can be sensible as you can put that money back in, but avoiding taxes are illegal and are hurtful to the economy. Final Level This is a personal one, but investing money. Having money in your bank just means that they will use it to lend on mortgages etc, however, if you invest it in the economy and businesses, you can help give a bit of extra cash in some places. HOWEVER, this isn\u2019t directly affecting the economy, plus it is selfish because you hope to make returns out of it. Secondly, be careful about where you put your money and what businesses you give it to, remember, this is your hard-earned money and make sure you speak to a financial advisor when you start looking at this! To end bluntly, if you want to contribute tot eh economy, make sure you work, give something back, and don\u2019t take too much away.
