            "answer_text": "Xiaomi right now has pretty much the best balance of price, features and choice of devices, meaning its market share is rising fast. I recommended their devices to a few friends and they are generally happy with them, although personally I go for smaller Chinese brands. I'm not sure their position will last for long however, especially as brands like Oppo and One plus are after the same segments and xiaomi still has to bring out something truly new, with the possible exception of the 108 megapixel camera. That said, right now they are one of the top choices for any segment except the super premium one, where Samsung, Apple and Huawei are still the brands to go, with hopefully Microsoft joining them with the Surface duo.
