            "answer_text": "It depends on the skill and how much you really want to learn. Is your goal to become an expert, or simply dangerous enough to use the skill randomly? Learning through experience is the fastest way to gain practical utility, so I would recommend finding the path that gets you into experiential learning as fast as possible. Find blog articles and baseline how-to articles in order to develop a baseline understanding.Think about how you\u2019d want to use the skill, and find a *very small* sub-problem that will be your initial project.Scope out the project. What will you build? What data is required? What are the user flows? These questions will vary depending on the skill you\u2019re looking to learn.Assess your scope and identify where you currently lack knowledge to build your project. Go find more blog articles, how-tos, and documentation to fill in your knowledge gaps.START! Even if you\u2019re still unsure, you can take an iterative approach. Build the project, model, code, or design \u2014 whatever it is, go into it full-steam and get excited. You\u2019re about to hit some serious obstacles that will discourage you\u2026 let your excitement be your fuel to overcome them.Surround yourself with experts who know the given skill, show them your project, and ask for their honest opinion. People enjoy helping other people. If you don\u2019t know many people who know your targeted skill or don\u2019t want to use Jobstart, cold emails can work\u2026 simply present yourself as a learner who really values their opinion as an expert.BONUS: Blog about your process and learnings. By writing out everything that happened and documenting your learning history, you can both develop the personal brand of being ambitious and reinforce your learning through introspection.",
