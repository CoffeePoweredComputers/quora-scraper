            "answer_text": "\u201cCondenser\u201d is an old term for \u201ccapacitor\u201d \u2014 essentially two conductive plates parallel to one another but separated by an insulator such as plastic or air that are capable of holding a charge. In a condenser microphone, sound waves impinge on a charged flexible diaphragm that makes up half of the capacitor:  Since capacitance is a function of the distance between charged plates, the motion of the diaphragm relative to the fixed electrode behind it changes the capacitance and a current flows. This current is then amplified and becomes the audio signal. The main advantage of a condenser microphone is that because the diaphragm has a very low mass, it is much more accurate than a conventional dynamic microphone. For that reason, condenser microphones are generally preferred in applications where sound quality is important. The main disadvantage is that, unlike a dynamic microphone, a condenser microphone requires a power supply to charge the plates. Professional equipment often has an option to supply \u201cphantom power\u201d to a condenser microphone via the mic connectors. However, it is possible to make inexpensive electret microphones in which the diaphragm is permanently charged, obviating the need for a power supply in consumer applications. ",
