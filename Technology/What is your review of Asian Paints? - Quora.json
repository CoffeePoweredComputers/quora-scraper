            "answer_text": "We used asian paint royal paint shiny costly one. However we done design with asian paint man. And after just 6 months putty was coming out , however my house having no wall with water seapage. And also their company is telling you that you dont have to worry , company is taking on his head , because of paint was seapage proof. So without seapage , putty was coming out along with designed paint. And we spended almost more money than the tiles for design. All things coming on our head now.So my personal advice is go for tiles instead of colours , because of colours are fading or became more dirty walls with dirt soaking inside it. Go for tiles you will pay 28% gst , but you will satisfy it till 15 years. You have to just choose good design tiles and your work was done there. And never see back on walls.If you dont know my paint ran only for 6 months , while my neighbour done again paint in just 2 years. So it was costly , you cant afford in huge gst era , where core products are inflating prices at double highs of real product value. See dont renovate house till tiles comes in bracket of 5% gst. You are paying now 28% gst that is unfair for public. Just wait for 2022 , if new goverment form in 2024 then you will definately get profit from renovating house. Because of when core prices are reduced , so fruit , vegetable and grain prices are reduced. So overall labour prices are also reduced. ",
