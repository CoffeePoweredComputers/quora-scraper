            "answer_text": "Yes. But they didn\u2019t just \u201cstart\u201d recently. They\u2019ve been increasingly embracing open source for about six years, at the time of this writing. Since 2014 when Satya Nadella was named CEO, Microsoft has embraced more and more open source. The previous anti-open-source stance of Microsoft was largely a Steve Ballmer-driven phenomenon, and reversed dramatically when Ballmer left. Here are a few highlights: Nadella stated \u201cMicrosoft loves Linux.\u201dNadella stated \u201cWe are all in on open source\u201d when Microsoft acquires GitHub, the largest open source project infrastructure.In 2014, Microsoft opened the source code for the .NET Framework.Microsoft opened the source for code for Visual Studio Code.Microsoft is among the most active contributors to open source projects.The Microosft Azure cloud platform explicitly supports several open source solutions.In 2016, Microsoft introduced Windows Subsystem for Linux, allowing Linux applications to run on Windows.Microsoft has invested in Linux server technology and Linux development, has promoted cross-platform compatibility, has become a Platinum sponsor of the Linux Foundation, and has a seat on the Linux Foundation board of directors (in 2017).Microsoft delivered the keynote of the Southern California Linux Expo in 2018.Microsoft transitioned its Edge browser to use the open-source Chromium project.",

            "answer_text": "Sort of. Microsoft is busy buying influence in the open source world, like buying a seat on the Linux Foundation board, buying keynotes at lots of Free and Open Source conferences, and generally trying to make it look like they \u201clove\u201d open source (they still *hate* the Copyleft and Free Software)\u2026 but they love what they can do with (weakly licensed) open source\u2026 they can exploit it (and its communities) with minimal cost to themselves. They are trying to kill open source by dividing and conquering it, and/or tweaking the bits they can get control over to suit their needs, like an unpaid workforce. They \u201cLOVE\u201d open source the way a tapeworm loves a healthy gut\u2026 and their \u201cembrace\u201d is like that of a constrictor embracing its prey. Open source communities should be very wary of gift horses. Despite some of the (highly publicised) appearances, Microsoft is a very very nasty partner, and no friend to Fee and Open Source Software. If they could, they\u2019d kill it, but since they can\u2019t they\u2019ll try to exploit it. ",
