            "answer_text": "16gb is probably too small. Add a few podcasts, shoot some videos, and have a normal amount of text messages and you\u2019ll be running out of space pretty fast. And don\u2019t even get me started on apps like WhatsApp. Those can be huge if they save all your old conversations. But the plus model is a big phone. It\u2019s hard to use with one hand, and easier to drop. That\u2019s the model I use most of the time, but I know how I use my phone, and in it\u2019s near 3 years of use it\u2019s been dropped maybe twice. Your mileage may vary. All in all, I would recommend the 64gb plus. It\u2019s easier to drop, but the space on the smaller screen is too little to be very useful. ",

I have replaced the battery 2 weeks ago, still same thing\u2026 All the parts replacements were done in Apple store. I don\u2019t know about the ones you buy brand new from the shops these days, but trust me when I say it\u2019s almost impossible to use it now when It\u2019s poorly functioning. ",
