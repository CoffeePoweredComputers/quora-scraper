            "answer_text": "Chemical Engineering is more to do with designing of the equipment/ chemical process. It involves in depth calculations of the process design of the equipment for eg calculating the heat transfer area of the heat exchanger, calculating the residence time of the reactor or calculate the pressure loss in the line of the pump etc. Thus it has got a lot of practical stuff. Chemical Technology is the study of different processes in Chemical Industry. e.g. Study of process of production of Ammonia, or study of the process of petroleum refining, study of the process of production of caustic soda etc! Thus it is more theoretical. It involves deep understanding of the effect of operating parameters on the process. ",

Also in some institutes chemical technology is taught in different subjects like paint; petroleum and food etc. Also in chemical engineering degree awarded is B.E. or B. Tech. . So really speaking there is not really difference in the way it is taught. ",

In terms of roles and responsibilities both are different.
