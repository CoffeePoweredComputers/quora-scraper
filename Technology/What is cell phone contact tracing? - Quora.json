Well generally speaking someone, possibly multiple companies, have or can give themselves access to your phones location. There are rules about how they can use that information and who they can give it to. So imagine that I make a program that every lets say 5 seconds checks each phone and looks for other phones within 6ft. When it finds one, that number gets added to a list of contact traces for that number and gets +1 contact points. Now two weeks from now, that person gets tested positive. Now they run a query on their number and find the numbers and thus contact info for each person with a significant contact score. Now they go and talk with or look at them, or let them know that they\u2019ve had contact and should be on guard and/or reduce the amount of contact they have with people. For example they are told to go back to working at home. ",
