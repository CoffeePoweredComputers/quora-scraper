            "answer_text": "Well, there used to be only one way to sell products on Instagram. And it was to build your own follower base first and then selling your products to those followers. But building a strong follower base on Instagram was always as hard as it is now. So many of us decided to sell our products using other people\u2019s networks. So we began finding out popular Instagram posts and in their comment sections we recommended our products and stores. And since the products which we had to offer were relevant to that niche and audience, so many of them used to end up visiting our store and purchasing our products.  This was the alternative way we were using to sell our products back then on Instagram. And it was working out just like magic. But there was one terrible problem we had to deal with. And it was to cut our working time and coming up with several hours to do enough commenting. So it slowly began less profitable for us because many people started using this strategy, an it began requiring us to spend even more hours to do mass commenting. And finally, Instagram completely disabled their feature to add active backlink to their comment sections. So that was the final blow and we\u2019re left with that one strategy to sell products on Instagram. And it was to spend 6 or 7 months to build a strong follower base on Instagram. But I think you already know how hard it is to gain followers on Instagram. There\u2019re already thousands of established pages and new ones just keep coming on daily basis. So it was a whole lot of difficult job to sell products on Instagram. But thanks to the Automarketer Pro, a tool which is now helping tons of businesses to use that previous alternative strategy to sell things on Instagram. It automatically uses certain #hashtags to find out Instagram pictures and videos that are related to your niche. And then it automatically leaves customized comments where they recommend your product. So you can now use this alternative Instagram selling or marketing strategy without wasting your valuable hours. Automarketer Pro will do it on your behalf, while you can be busy with completing your orders. So in order to sell products on Instagram, I would suggest you to use this alternative marketing strategy. It will certainly help you get instant sales from the giant Instagram. Hope this helps Cheers\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": " Are you wondering how to sell your products on Instagram? Want some tips to get started? To make the most of interactions with customers on Instagram, your images and descriptions need to stand out and purchasing needs to be as easy as possible. Discover tips for selling on Instagram. #1: Develop a Signature Look Before you start posting, think about how you want to position your products on your page. The right product placement is key to driving Instagram sales and engagement. Identify the aesthetic you want for your page and stick to it. Once you have your product shots, use Instagram\u2018s internal filters or an app to make your photos visually sharper and clearer. Remember that you want to showcase the true product to your customers, so sometimes no filter works best in social selling.  Rocksbox developed a signature look that showcases the products, not the models. #2: Give Product Descriptions Something Extra While it\u2019s important to be clear about what you\u2019re selling, you also need to attract the attention and interest of likely customers with your descriptions. #3: Promote Product Visibility in Search With Hashtags Hashtags have a lot to do with how your products get discovered on Instagram. You can use Instagram\u2018s search and explore feature to view the top hashtags for your demographic and vertical, and then use three to five of them in your social selling campaigns.  Find relevant hashtags using Search and Explore on Instagram. Don\u2019t forget to create and use your own branded hashtag, too. Do a daily search for that hashtag to see who\u2018s using it, and consider regramming the best photos or videos from fans on your own marketing platforms. #5: Partner With Influencers You can expand brand awareness and increase sales by partnering with Instagram influencers to reach an audience that\u2018s specifically targeted to your products and services.
