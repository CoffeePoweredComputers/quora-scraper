            "answer_text": "Yes, that is a real patent. And that patent has been publicly available to anyone with an Internet connection for at least 12 years. The fact that the patent issued reflects the fact that the examiner did not find any earlier references to a method of treating an AIDS patient with Ag4O4. So it might be novel (as of 1996). And now that the patent has lapsed, anyone can do this without having to pay that patent holder. It might have been rejected as lacking utility, but perhaps the examiner was being overly friendly to that applicant. It says treating, not improving or curing. You have to read word very carefully. Note that \"cavity-fighting toothpaste\" can be called that even if it does not reduce cavities. The term doesn't require that the toothpaste win any fights, just that it fights. Lemon juice can be used to treat AIDS. The patient will still be in the same condition afterwards, but there was a treatment. To that is the answer to the actual question. Now let's answer the underlying question: Can Ag4O4 cure AIDS? One answer is \"no\" and while that explains why we don't see it being used and people still dying of AIDS-related causes, that is a boring answer. The other answer is \"yes\". Now, think about it for a moment. What does that imply? - That someone or some group is blocking the development of this as a drug. (Believable) - that group also has some mechanism to keep all medical researchers from breaking ranks, developing the drug and curing AIDS. (Believable?) - that group has determined that the power/money/control that they could obtain through selling a blockbuster drug that works would be less than the power/money/control that would come from having people sick and dying. (That does not appear to be at all a reasonable approach to global domination, because there are so many easier and cheaper ways to maintain a dependent populace than coercing every medical researcher on the planet.) Lastly, I echo the suspicion of the commenter who observed that only after diseases arise and cause significant distress do cures appear. Always on that order, disease then cure. Not cure then disease. Very suspicious. Also, very not suspicious. ",

Here's one to cure hiccups by sticking an electric cup to your face: United States Patent: 7062320 If you're asking why no one uses it, that's easy. It doesn't work, it's quite harmful, and it's illegal to promote it as a cure in the US. I'll quote here, though anyone can quote any website. Feel free to do independent research. All reputable sites have the same info as AVERT:  A Cure for AIDS\"Tetrasil (or Imusil) is a substance containing tetrasilver tetroxide. A patent held by Dr. Marvin S. Antelman claims that this simple chemical compound cures AIDS by \u201celectrocuting\u201d HIV. Dr. Antelman admits his approach to AIDS is \u201cnon-conventional\u201d and he does not trust viral load tests: \u201cAccordingly we have patients who display viral load reduction and those that do not who are nevertheless cured of AIDS\u201d, he has said. Tetrasilver tetroxide is more commonly used for disinfecting swimming pools. After it was promoted as an AIDS cure in Zambia the government banned Tetrasil because it has no proven benefits for people living with HIV. In America it is illegal to promote Tetrasil for the treatment or prevention of any disease.\" ",
