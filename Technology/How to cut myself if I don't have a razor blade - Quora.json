            "answer_text": "Razors are preferable because they are sharp and precise. While other objects can be kinda sharp but largely dull or blunt. Which means they hurt more and you never can really tell how they're gonna cut. However if you've never used a razor before I'd tell you to be extremely cautious. The first time I cut with a razor it was disastrous. I was used to using the dull serrated kitchen knife\u2026 Hard and fast strokes. Best way to break the skin with out having to saw. So when I first used a razor I did hard and fast, and was surprised that it made such a clean cut. Not blood at first, literally right down to the white. But when it started gushing out\u2026 I thought I was gonna die, maybe I would have if I didn't limit the blood flow after I lost a good bit. Enough to turn my favorite white t permanently red brown. What I'm trying to say is you can cut your self with just about anything sharp. But razors aren't really for amateurs\u2026 not to say you are. But experienced cutters can get to \u201cit\" when they need to, where they need to. I'm not encouraging you\u2026 cutting is like cigarettes. They're fucking terrible at first, then you're addicted. Anyways, just be safe. And never cut deep unless you know what your doing or what you want to do. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you have pencil sharpners? If so unscrew plastic outside, pull blade out, then disinfect it. You can sharpen scissors and use those. To sharpen, jist slide scissor on metal surface or object. If you are looking to self harm then burn, you can use erasers. I don\u2019t recomend fire. And don\u2019t use eraser to fast on skin and for to long it can cause a 3rd degree burn and you may have to be hospilized for that. Also if you burn with eraser it\u2019s normal for skin to look worse the next day and if you go for a little longer than usual when rubbing the eraser you may get fluid filled bubbles and thats normal. DON\u2019T POP THEM. But this is only if you choose this route. Just ask me if you need any support or have any questions! ",
