            "answer_text": "Smart phones and laptops are designed for different purposes, and have different hardware. Smart phones are designed to be used intermittently throughout the day, rather than continuously. Any time you are not actively using them, they enter a low power state to conserve power. That means that, for example, the screen is off, the audio circuitry is off (until you receive a phone call or a notification), the radio is only checking in with the network periodically, and the speed at which apps are running in the background gets slowed down. Laptops, on the other hand, are designed for continuous use. The whole time your laptop is open and on, the screen is on and programs are running. The CPU in your computer tries to make the most of the battery by scaling itself down unless you\u2019re running something CPU intensive. You can get more time out of your laptop by configuring the screen to turn off sooner when you leave it idle. You can even spend the time to uninstall or disable programs running in the background, so that fewer things are taking up CPU time. Ultimately, though, the draw on the laptop battery even if your laptop screen is off and the machine is in a lower-power CPU state is still going to be more than the draw on the phone battery when your smart phone is idle in your pocket. How the devices are used is the key. You may also observe that if you use your smart phone continuously throughout the day to, for example, watch YouTube, Hulu, or Netflix, you\u2019ll notice that the battery dies a lot faster. In that scenario, you\u2019re using your Smart phone like you\u2019d use your laptop, and the batteries dies just as quickly as your laptop would. ",

            "answer_text": "phones have maximum power draw at around 2 Watts and batteries having around 3000mAh (3Ah) and 3Volts since W=A*V (Wh is Ah * V), its kinda easy to show that in the worst-case scenario - maximum power draw - battery in smartphone will die in 4\u20135 hours (3Ah*3V=9Wh; 9Wh/2W=4,5h) And either for this you would use wifi/4g and play some heavy games constantly. Since it\u2019s mostly idling in your pocket, it stays constantly in power-saving mode with just low-level connection to the network so you could get a call. laptops on the other hand may reach 100+Watts (gaming ones) or 50 Watts (ultrabooks) when connected to charger gaming laptop i worked on has 56Wh battery - so if battery and circuits could survive that and didn\u2019t limit power draw to cpu and gpu, not mentioning the constantly bright 15\u2033 screen, it would die in just 30mins. But since load is not always at 100%, and without external power source laptop won\u2019t let itself work at 100% anyway (power saving features, you can\u2019t really shut them all, for this exact reason), i was able to get from 100% to 0% in a bit over an hour. This is why, simple math. You could put more battery cells inside, but it would make laptops heavier and bulkier - so less mobile and \u201clap top\u201d friendly and more treated as desktop replacements. but then of course they wouldn\u2019t need batteries at all ^^ ",
