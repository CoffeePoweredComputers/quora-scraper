            "answer_text": "Yes it is, the rock at the moon's poles has a different composition compared with other areas of the moon has hematite, a common iron oxide. I tend to disagree how it came about. The distance to the moon is over 240,000 miles and that is a long distance for moisture from the earth to reach the moon. The dispersion rate alone would make it highly unlikely that enough moisture from the earth could reach the moon in the quantities needed to cause rust. Since oxygen is the most abundant element in lunar soil, comprising nearly half of the lunar regolith by weight I tend to believe that the source of oxygen comes from the moon its self rather than the earth. Still, I\u2019m not a astrogeologist so you should probably pay attention to the people that really know what they are talking about. ",

            "answer_text": "Not in the sense that you might be thinking. That\u2019s just typical pop science. Rust is the oxidation of iron. Iron makes up only about 10% of the Moons composition and doesn\u2019t usually exist in a non-molecular state, particularly with reactive oxygen about. While oxygen makes up the lions share of the Lunar material, is is basically already bound to other atoms and it isn\u2019t just floating around looking for an fulfilling relationship. In other words, most of the Moon\u2019s iron is already rusted. You could easily say without fear of contradiction that the Moon is chemically and geologically dead. Nothing much happens there and it\u2019s been that way for a loooooooooooong time! ",
