            "answer_text": "To join the chorus; a laptop's fundamental purpose is to provide desktop-grade, or as close to desktop-grade as possible within the limitations of the equipment, computing power to users away from their home or office desktops. With the increasing capability of various components resulting, in recent years, in many laptops' becoming credible substitutes for desktops, a lot of people have adopted laptops as their primary PC's, even with the rise of tablets (which, as David Wyatt notes, still have limitations in some critical areas). Desktop PC's are still very much a viable option, though, for people who need them for purposes for which laptops or tablets just can't provide enough power - high-end, high-intensity gaming is the most usually cited example, but other resource-intensive tasks such as CAD, high-end image editing, 3D digital art, etc. are all better done on a desktop with large quantities of RAM, a powerful CPU and an equally powerful video card. Personally, I own all three; desktop, laptop (just bought a new one, in fact) and tablet, and use them as the occasion demands for whatever's appropriate. ",
