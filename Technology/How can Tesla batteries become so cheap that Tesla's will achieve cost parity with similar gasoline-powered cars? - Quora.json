            "answer_text": "When you look at features, tech, and performance, they pretty much are right now for sports sedans and SUV\u2019s in the luxury or premier class. Take a BMW M340i which has about the exact same speed and all wheel drive. Add the heated seats and radar cruise, and you are at $63k vs. 47k for a model 3 LR AWD or 55k for the performance. Some differences, but the 3 has it on interior space by a fair bit, tech, acceleration (easily with the performance)\u2026 Or take an Infinity. Their Q50 red sport is slightly slower than a Model 3 AWD, but the price is $14k to get it with the adaptive cruise components. Or say you want a Caddy sedan with over 15\u2032 of storage and decent room. Wait\u2026 even the CT5 doesn\u2019t get close. Ok lets say you don\u2019t care about the Model 3 having 50% more storage. And you want the heated seats, Nav, adaptive cruise, better stereo, etc\u2026 You are well over 50k. For a slower smaller RWD trim vs. the price of the model 3 LR AWD. The trim comparison is so tough. Not many vehicles offer a panoramic roof. Not many offer a vehicle you can start the heater or A/C on while you are wrapping up shopping, or have a setting that ensures it won\u2019t get over 105 degrees in the car. I can\u2019t find many that let me pull up a show on netflix while my wife is getting her hair done. Not many let you choose between sport and comfort steering feedback modes. Not many let 5 drivers each pick their saved seat adjustments, or automatically roll up the windows, lock the car, and turn on the camera security system when you walk away. Not many give over the air updates to improve how it works. Last week my rearview camera went from normal to this 3 camera view:  I had one random option the other day I never knew I wanted but am happy to have. I was going to grab a bite at Chic-fil-a and hadn\u2019t eaten out in forever, so I wanted to see their menu while I was in line before I got to the outside guy who didn\u2019t seem to have a selection on his tablet he was taking orders from. So I clicked on it on my nav screen and pulled up their website to check their menu. Heck the model 3 even competes with standard vehicles at times. Take the Nissan Maxima. A bit smaller interior (less passenger and luggage space). FWD is over $43k to get the heated seats, bigger screen, Nav, some of the tech in a Model 3, etc\u2026 And the RWD Model 3 with the upgraded interior is $38k. I think the current issue is comparing the Model 3 vs. same class vehicles rather than to a Base model corolla and saying it costs more. Or comparing the price of the AWD versions of the 3 to non-performance sport sedans. Sure you can say this one corners a bit better, or this one has more wood trim on the doors, or this one has this or that. But in the end, comparing the closest apples to apples, Tesla\u2019s come out on the less expensive side vs. their actual peers. And you can do the same with the model y. The Macan S and Turbo are two similarly powered SUVs as the Y long range and performance. Give the Macan S/turbo the heated seats, panoramic roof, wireless charging, lane keeping and adaptive cruise, etc, you are looking at $20k and $40k more for their comparable cars. And you truly aren\u2019t even close (Macan has 17\u2032 of cargo space behind the rear seats. The Y has 24\u2032). To get up to that space you are upping to the Cayenne. I think the one area left is budget and base model cars that batteries need to drop for. And trucks of course. But in the world of luxury and premium sports sedans and SUV\u2019s, Tesla has itself placed well under most of it\u2019s counterparts. ",

            "answer_text": "Economies of scale enable lower cost to manufacture because you are buying so much quantity that you get a better price and in manufacturing you build a one up custom cell and the cost to copy that manufacturing cell does not have much engineering cost associated on the repeat copies of that manufacturing cell. Also distribution is cheaper once the first unit is sold and has repeat customers making a repeat sale is so much easier (cheaper). The major change that will leapfrog the ICE is not Tesla but rather rolling battery swap done often and at 40 mph in 40 milliseconds. Energy sipping as you move across the city will drastically shrink the size, weight and cost of battery packs for all cars that use the automated swap mechanism and share the battery mule fleet. Since the battery mule contains the road mode drive train and it made in large quantity its economies of scale will obsolete the fart car instantly. The business model of the borrowed mule and monthly subscription cabin will make is impossible to compete by selling a fart car outright or financing for the current 72 month payment plans. These dual mode swap vehicles convert and go up onto a safe high speed guideway and ICE cars cannot legally go 180 mph like you can on the 3D controlled guideway with a 2D asphalt surface for guidance at speeds more than 85 in Texas or 80 in most states. Map Guideway is not a highway and the speed is only 180 mph while in that mode.  ",

            "answer_text": "It is claimed that the total cost of ownership, that is purchase price, fuel, and maintenance over a 100k mile ownership already puts a $45k EV at cost parity with a common ICE sedan. The number of things an EV does not have that will eventually break or wear out with an ICE makes up the difference. Many small savings add up over 100k miles. These are things like no oil to change, no exhaust system to replace, no emissions systems sensors to replace, no fuel injectors, a very simple gear system (no automatic transmission issues), no engine repairs. There are several hundred moving parts in an ICE, things like timing belt, valves, bearings, serpentine belt, pistons, rings, etc. An EV has one or motors with basically one moving part, the rotor with its bearings. The electric motor(s) of an EV should last the life of the vehicle without maintenance. Even brake parts should last longer because of regenerative braking. The development of \u201cthin film\u201d and \u201csolid state dielectric\u201d technologies will dramatically increase the storage density of batteries by both volume and weight decreases. These developments will also substantially reduce the amount of costly metals that go into a battery, by increasing the active surfaces with much thinner plates closer together. The manufacturing techniques right now are costly but will decrease in price. Think of the state of digital electronics in the 1970\u2019s when a simple gate chip could cost a buck, now an entire computer chip is cheap. I saw an add yesterday for a PC \u201cmotherboard\u201d the size of a credit card that was fully populated with GBs of RAM and SSD, USB, video, and serial connections at a price of $10. Just the connectors would have cost $10 a decade ago. It has more speed and power than the PC I am now using to write this answer. The $10 even includes the power supply, and the total power consumption of the credit card PC is less than the consumption the desktop by about 40:1. Thin film battery plates and thin solid state dielectric layers will also make a battery much more like a capacitor. The features of a capacitor that are of great value if migrated to a battery are: 1/ extremely fast charge/discharge rates (a capacitor in a radio frequency can cycle millions of times a second from full discharge to full charge and back to full discharge). 2/ efficiency (a capacitor does that MHz fast cycling generating almost no heat) and 3/ longevity (it can do it continuously for a decades without wearing out). Combine those attributes with reduction of space and weight required for a given range, and the cost reduction from using less precious metals and batteries will no longer be a serious limit for EV adoption. They may well cost less than a transmission, and last just as long. ` ",

            "answer_text": "How can Tesla batteries become cheap that Teslas will achieve cost parity with similar gasoline-powered cars? Tesla is already a better deal. Properly maintained batteries will attempt to keep the charge approximately between 20% and 80% of a full charge, and minimize the time (recharge as soon as you can when under 20% and don\u2019t charge to 100% until just before departure time, which Tesla helps control) spent outside these values. Doing that have allowed the older Teslas to run at least 300,000 miles and still going. It is estimated they will go 500,000 miles. So based upon 15,000 miles per year (higher than the typical yearly mileage in the US), the batteries will last at least 20 years, and can be double that amount. And that end-of-life is based upon the capacity of the battery pack reaching 80% of the original capacity. But the batteries are still usable, just not as much range. When it is time to change them (many years down the road), they will be reused in non-mobile products, like the Tesla Powerwall, which stores Solar Panel energy. After that, the batteries are recycled for their metals. If you did have to replace them, the price would be somewhere between $3,000 and $7,000, depending upon the capacity of the old battery. This is about the cost to change an engine in a gasoline (ICE) car. The average engine of a ICE vehicle is 200,000 miles. Tesla\u2019s batteries are already passing 300,000 miles. I\u2019d think more about how ICE cars will keep up with Tesla! ",

The other answers have already said that the Tesla is cheaper than equivalent IC cars and that it costs less to run I will talk about the expensive part of the Tesla - the battery Manufacturing engineers keep taking costs out until you start to get close to the actual costs of the materials A Tesla battery is (we believe) about $8,000 - the raw materials to make the battery are probably about $800 This gives a lot of headway - room for improvement! Tesla are still at the start of this process and are probably cutting that cost by about 20% every year Gas powered cars are at the end of that process - still working on it but more like 4% a year than 20% At the end of the day the electric car has a LOT less parts than a dino burner and it will end up a good bit cheaper ",

So electric cars have to run on addiction power plants and distribution systems. Gas cars create the energy in the ICE so no addition power plant capacity is required.

Nobody adds the cost of the new electric generation capacity in addition of the cost of the car so that their costs can be compared to gas engine cars. It is a product of poor public education. ",
