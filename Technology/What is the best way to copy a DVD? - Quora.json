            "answer_text": "I guess you want to make a digital copy your DVD collections. For this, I recommend you copy DVDs to ISO image or Video_TS folder. Because these two video formats keep all the information of a DVD without any loss. Then you choose a lifetime free program to help you do this job.If you are using Windows PC, you are lucky to have many choices. Here I recommend the one I know that would work well for you. That is WinX DVD Ripper Platinum. Get one free full license from its giveaway(http://www.winxdvd.com/giveaway/holiday-offer.htm) before Jan. 1, and you could free use it for a life time.   The advantage WinX DVD Ripper Platinum has over some open-source program like Handbrake and VLC Media Player is that it can deal with most encryptions directly, including  DVD CSS, region code, RCE, Sony ArccOS, UOPs, Disney X-project DRM, without needing any third-party software or packages. Cheers, novices. ",
