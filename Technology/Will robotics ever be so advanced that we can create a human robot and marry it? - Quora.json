            "answer_text": "The question assumes that robots will advance and people will never change and then asks \u201cwill robots be like people?\u201d But what if over the centuries people become more and more like robots? Today a person with a Cell phone is different from a person 30 years ago, now we can look up anything and instantly communicate with voice text and video. Some day the Cell phone might be an implanted device. or maybe the screen could be built into contact lenses. Then perhaps the data be directly connected to the brain. These ideas are likely very primitive compared to what will really happen. Over time humans and robots might become more like each other and meet some place in the space between. In other words we will both change into something that does not today exist. Humans will change in radical ways we can\u2019t predict once the idea of genetic engineering is applied to humans. We can design the DNA of our offspring, edit out \u201cbad genes\u201d and introduce desirable genes. How far will this go? Once it becomes socially acceptable the sky is the limit. Maybe glow in the dark zebra stripe fur will be fashionable? I seriously doubt these advanced robots will use technology anything at all like our current robots use. Today we use computer controlled motors but in the far future maybe the robots are based on biology and nano technology. Convergence is very likely. Robots will never be smarter than humans because whatever technology is used to make the robot smart can also be applied to help the human to be smarter. And with genetic engineering we will be very different an likely smarter. After Convergence, we may not make much distinction between people and robots but would the two be married? I don\u2019t know, but the bigger question is \u201cWill anyone get married at all?\u201d In short it is not just about robots becoming more human but about both humans and robots changing in ways we can\u2019t imagine today.

Transhumanism will happen first as people seek longevity with technology and they become more and more artificial to the point of having no natural body parts. Robotics and AI will develop in parallel to them. AI driven robots may very well become the final sentient beings on Earth who must fight for equality. ",
