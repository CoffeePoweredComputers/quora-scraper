            "answer_text": "I would question the theory that \"Fine Arts degrees are useless\" in general, but I would say the real question you need to ask yourself is \"do I want to work in the music business, or do I want to write music?\"  There is absolutely nothing wrong with answering \"yes\" to either (or both) of these questions.  But the degree you pursue will govern which of those things you typically will be doing.  A degree in Music Technology is going to focus on the ins and outs of recording and production of music, and will give you the skills to be a music technician, who is responsible for recording and production of music (the guy you see sitting at those enormous boards with all the knobs in a recording studio).  You will learn a great deal about the science of music, about frequencies and reverb and the science behind how music is recorded, produced, and mastered into a form that can be played back by CD players, iPods, and the like. A degree in composition, on the other hand, will teach you about how music is written (the grand staff, and variations for different ensembles), the \"rules\" (which you will be encouraged to break) surrounding things like musical structure, harmonic function, and rhythm.  You'll learn the instruments in the orchestra (at least enough to be able to write for them) and you'll be expected to write original pieces of music, in many different styles and for many different groupings of instruments.  You will likely also be required to play an instrument (most often piano, but not always). There are people who studied composition who also know production and work in the technical side of things too.  Likewise, there are technicians who also write music.  But the difference is in the fundamentals. ",

            "answer_text": "The only con to a degree in recording technology is that schools, by their nature, have a hard time keeping up with the cutting edge of technology. Budgeting, procurement of equipment, and updating curriculum/faculty takes a long time - often longer than the cycle of new tech. When I was in college in the 90's they had old reel-to-reel tape machines and outboard gear from the 70's, and not in a cool retro vintage way. In a \"we-haven't-acknowledged-digital-audio-yet\" way. I was a jazz piano major, but I was interested in recording, so I hung around the sound recording tech majors and got time in the studio. I learned about basics of acoustics and signal flow, which is great, but it was when I met another jazz student who was recording an album in Opcode Vision on a Mac Quadra 650 and a DA-88 in his apartment across the street from school that I learned what was really going on. That student, by the way, was Brian Culbertson, and that record, called Long Night Out, launched a major career in contemporary jazz. So this isn't to say you shouldn't do a degree in recording technology, but be extremely selective about where you do it. Otherwise, $100,000 would buy you a LOT of nice gear, and all that gear comes with manuals.   ",
