            "answer_text": "No, Google Search Results are not getting worse, in fact, in most instances the results delivered by Google when a word/phrase/question is queried are becoming more accurate.  Google's been cracking down on web spam in recent years with its regular Algorithm updates.    These updates have made it nearly impossible to rank web pages that are irrelevant, incomplete, low quality and/or don't deliver (the most) valuable information on the web about the phrase being searched, on the first page of Google search results.  You're not the first to suggest that these updates might be backfiring by rendering results less relevant, less accurate and thereby worse.  In an article published on Search Engine Land, for instance, Danny Sullivan questioned whether Penguin Made Google's Search Results Better Or Worse?  Nevertheless, overall Google Search Results are getting better and more capable of delivering results that are personalized and accurate.   The trouble you're experiencing finding answers to questions you ask within the first few pages of Google search results may be related to the subject of the questions for which you're searching.  For instance, you mentioned that you were experiencing difficulty finding answers on questions relating to web development.  The trouble you're having may have more to do with proliferation of new web development terms and complex questions involving these terms flooding the web, than it does with the quality of Google's search results.    Give Google a bit of time to learn how to correctly interpret new web dev lingo and the results you're looking for will most likely start appearing where you'd expect and like for them to appear - i.e. on the first page of Google search results.   The same could be said for the other topics you mentioned, politics and business. ",

            "answer_text": "Naturally my view is just one more subjective opinion. But I think Google Search has got worse to the point of uselessness for many purposes. When Google first appeared it was marvellous. If I was searching for information I had many relevant hits on the first page. These days I often give up after looking through the first half dozen pages. Problems include hijacking of everyday words for company and product names, IT-related uses overshadowing older uses of words, people trying to sell me stuff, people trying to force their ridiculous world view down everyone\u2019s throats, \u2026 and Google seems to be getting less and less effective at filtering out this crap. Perhaps SEO Is the real villain. After all, it is at root a form of deception. Its purpose is to get a higher ranking than the page content (or the product it is selling) deserves on merit. Today I tried to find information about the way that the human eye is adjusted to focus accurately at infinity in the early years of life (and how it may fail to do so if a person does to much reading/computing/TV-watching, rather then getting outdoors and active). I got reams of information about cameras and about other aspects of human vision but after trying to refine my search for thirty minutes by excluding dodgy words I simply gave up. This is just one example of many. ",

            "answer_text": "This won't be the answer to the original question equested. Instead, I'll simply offer that there are rigorous scientific approaches to testing the quality of a search engine' relevance. A couple of anecdotal experiences is way too limiting of an approach to assess quality.  I was asked to measure the quality of search results of three separate search engines on behalf of a major organization. We built an interface that enabled us to swap out the underlying search engine or add and subtract search features to measure the impact on quality.  We were also able to measure relevance across various search types (i.e. Navigational, Informational and Transactional) It's not hard to accomplish this task and someone with the proper motivation could easily offer an ongoing test-bed that monitors the relevance of the major search engines on an on-going basis.  One of the challenges the search engines have is the increasing amount of content being published on the web. Let's take an imaginary point in time when there were just 1,000,000 pages on the Internet. For any search query, an engine has to select the top 0.00001% for the ten results that appear on page 1. Now that there are over a billion pages in the index, the algorithm has to select 0.00000001% of that vastly larger index to make it on to page 1.  So, does more content on the web make it easier or harder to choose the 10 best? I would suggest it makes it harder. This is one of the main motivators Google has for limiting the size of their searchable index to just the absolute best content. ",

UNFORTUNATELY, Google (and many other search engines) seem to have taken away many useful search operators (or hidden them very well) so as to make it harder to get a straight answer and get out. ",

Yeah that sounds like dated thinking, but how else can there exist real incentive to actually provide what\u2019s being paid for? Many of us would pay a premium to access a search engine that serves up what we\u2019re actually searching - and nothing else. Someone with the resources to make this happen will eventually recognize and figure out how to meet this demand. When they do, there\u2019s money waiting for them.
