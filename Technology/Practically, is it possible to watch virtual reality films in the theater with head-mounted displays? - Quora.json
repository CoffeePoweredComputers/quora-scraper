            "answer_text": "I presume the question is asking if there is perhaps some day in the future where individuals will go to a theatre, don VR head-mounted-displays (HMDs) and experience a VR \"film\" as a group? I would say it's unlikely in an extreme. The reason people go to movie theatres is primarily to experience media they cannot otherwise. A movie theatre provides a big screen, surround sound, 3d/stereoscopic viewing etc. As home media has improved, theatre attendance has plummeted to the point where the entire industry is threatened.  Similarly home game consoles have reduced arcades to a rarity compared to the past. Currently the major draw for attending theatres (or game arcades) is social - having somewhere to go and an activity around which to interact. Stereoscopic films have failed to draw the crowds the industry hoped. Omnimax attendance is still good, and some theatres focus instead on the social aspect by serving meals or alcohol. So I suppose one might say \"well, VR could be the draw theatres need!\" But in my opinion HMDs and VR media will succeed as home entertainment only, a theatre venue is impractical. The equipment is costly, would have to be worn by and fitted to each member of the audience, leaving a \"HMD theatre\" operator burdened with maintaining a tremendous number of HMDs, sanitizing them, dealing with fitting and calibrating them multiple times a day and so on.  All so each member of the audience can be transported to an individualized world isolated from other audience members in regards to any physical proximity?  The only way such a business would work would be if the equipment was miles ahead of anything possible for an individual to have at home - currently there are a number of game centers which conform to this kind of VR model, but they struggle as the technology changes so rapidly their capital investments are rapidly made obsolete. Today very impressive HMDs are emerging which are easily affodable by the average consumer. Why bother with the physical venue at all, then? Instead, link up individuals from their home in a VR world, and let them use personal equipment which is familiar to them, already fitted and calibrated, and for which they bear the costs. The only point to a physical VR venue I can see is less along the lines of a theatre model and more akin to a sporting event... I could see VR participants attending a physical venue in which equipment is standardized for the sake of competition and audiences wish to see the individuals participate and compete personally. The audiences would attend not to wear the HMDs themselves, but to see the \"athletes\" compete.  This is a variant of the kind of mass gaming competeitions we see in South Korea for example, where very large audiences flock to watch physical gatherings of virtual competitors do what they do best, turning a normally isolative gaming experience played at home into a large shared event which can draw crowds.
