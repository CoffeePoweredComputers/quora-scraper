            "answer_text": "Automation portends a different industrial environment than there is now. Some precedents have already occurred for personhood and as a board director. It might percolate from the bottom up if vehicles are classified as corporations to cover the regulations and events at arms length, and chatbots are used for official communications most often so it already seems like a systemic interface. The simplest firm could go from being run by an app to a bot and then the latest version like for claiming royalties or doing crypto mining. Machine learning still needs to be able to explain itself. If everyone had a sidekick bot, then so might the leader and its responsibilities, possibly rights, would be on a par. There are are some far-flung scenarios. An exec becomes a cyborg by then. Or someone who had a relationship left everything to it. Or the sovereignty puts all of the inactives under the wing of such a service for a while. Or the platforms offer an exec-level that others can subscribe to as outsource, but these want to avoid manipulation. International shells may want cut outs. Or anyone looking for a new exec can use a default machine in the meantime. Or someone finally uploaded to a virtual domain of such things. The same could be happening for admins in the other sectors. These are more like networks than single actors. The strongest argument would be if someone like the largest value outfit had one because global operations had become so complex that it took more than a single mind and that was equivalent to several orders of magnitude greater capability like a bureaucracy unto itself. Any dependents would then by linked to it by a botnet or something. If one gets knocked out by red tape, then another can take its place. The bots would be able to contract with other parties. Human execs would resist since they might see their competitive rewards drop, but might want to take over if a scenario was unforeseen and had not been trained in yet. Information could be combined from all sources like under climate events. ",

While you could look at baseball stats over a period of time, what ultimately failed was an inability to take into account such influencing factors as illness, home life, and attitudes about the game. Most of the role of a CEO has to do with understanding people. The subtleties of communication and sometimes the indirect way people talk. In some countries, it\u2019s the indirect conversation that matters more than what\u2019s said directly. I sit on the board of a company with a fellow CEO who tells me that his biggest challenge is getting to know his senior team well enough to get them properly, \u201ccalibrated,\u201d as he put it, meaning before he fully understands not just their language, but the intention behind their language. I\u2019m working with a company now that has one employee who\u2019s a political animal and sees the world through the lens of company politics. His view of everything is based on political standing. He does very good work, but he\u2019s forever thinking in terms of how he\u2019s viewed by others. It means that everything he says requires the listener to take all of that into consideration. Something as simple as, \u201cnice shirt\u201d to him expressing it, is meant to suck-up, when we hear it as patronization and we ignore the comment, knowing full well he likely doesn\u2019t mean it. I think there will be a time when those subtleties are taken into consideration in AI, but I think we\u2019re very far from that. AI will have to learn how to sense mood, and us humans have difficulty with that right now. Then we have the whole matter of company strategy which can get extremely complicated for all the same reasons. Having been in embedded systems software, I can\u2019t look inside any electronics device and not see all the relationships and politics that ultimately led to that design and finished product. ",

Even then there would be problems. Let\u2019s think about Elon Musk and Steve Jobs. The ability to motivate and inspire was (is) critical to their success. It is difficult to imagine an AI that could motivate or inspire. I\u2019m not just talking about company employees here - Steve Jobs especially created a \u201creality distortion field\u201d that drove buyers. Elon Musk arguably has a similar skill. ",

How about the lawyers - their stock in trade is following rules and finding loop holes in rules. Prime candidate for AI. You still need somebody to show up in court, but the AI backing that person could be calling the shots. There are others that have similar activity.
