            "answer_text": "It all depends on what you want to do after you learn any of the above. As the above answers suggests, Arduino is definitely easier than Rapi to start with. But when it comes to functionality, both are quite different. Rapi is a pocket-sized Computer where you can install Rasbian (OS) connect it to a display and use as a normal computer (a slow one, of course). Arduino is an open source electronic prototyping platform. It's easier, efficient and effective way for beginners to build/learn electronics and Robotics, interface sensors and displays and have fun. Needless to say that the arduino community is great. Depending on what you want to do, choose either one. If you are looking to start off learning electronics and build some cool stuff, I would suggest Arduino as any other answer here says. All the best! P.S: Feel free to contact me, if you need any help :) ",

            "answer_text": "Well, for starters I would always recommend to go with the Arduino, It\u2019s easy to set up and shields and modules are easily available. Plus, the Arduino IDE is really easy to get started with and sample codes are a plenty. Once you get comfortable working with the hardware or when you feel the need for more power, you can always jump into the Pi , but however starting off with the Pi is an entirely different story. The learning curve is a bit steep and takes some getting used to. And again the programming is done in the form of Python Scripts , you also lack the comfort of an IDE. ",
