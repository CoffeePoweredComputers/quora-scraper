            "answer_text": "In no particular order, certainly not chronological or even interdependent: A wave of disappointment in certain sectors of distance learning as it becomes clear that it will never be as entertaining as gaming or porn.Distributors of educational apps (Apple\u2019s App Store, Google Play) will be told by educators and politicians that they are responsible for the accuracy of \u201cfacts\u201d in their educational apps, as the fake-news crowd moves into educational app production.The third-party review and approval of app content will become increasingly polarized and politicized.Brilliant educational offerings will be created in augmented reality, which will become less cumbersome and intrusive as it blends into routine device use. Imagine being able to invite an edubot into a text conversation as a third party. You mis-use a term like, say, \u201cextremist\u201d and the bot flags it and corrects you, asking, \u201cWould you like to know more about extremism?\u201dI haven\u2019t checked on whether I invented the term \u201cedubot\u201d but if no one owns it yet, consider it a gift.The study of educational technology will begin to wither as it becomes clear that it can\u2019t hope to keep up with the introduction, adoption and abandonment of new technologies.Whole curricula, perhaps whole degrees, will be built on or around TED talks.Parents and/or schools will be successfully prosecuted for making/letting 3rd graders carry backpacks that weigh half as much as the child does.I retain the right to edit this list as I continue to think about it.

            "answer_text": "I think more and more teachers, lecturers and professors will notice the importance of keeping up with the world we live in and adapt to the fact that yes, technology surrounds us everyday and has become a big part of youngsters life. With that fact, the attention span is not the same as students from before and that teachers need to find ways to revive the attention of the students in a way that speaks to them. For that a great way would be to integrate more and more tech tools within the classroom. It doesn\u2019t have to be a drastic change and compulsory for teachers to bring AR in class, (I mean there is still the financial aspect to take into account), but there are steps here and there that can be taken, and are visibly taken by more and more teachers across the world. For instance classroom response systems, such as Wooclap are awesome. It offers a way for teacher to make students live experiences, and that, even in class. By that I mean, teachers can gamify the classroom experience, interact better with students, and feel a certain new type of engagement coming from the students side. Plus it is affordable and super intuitive to use, and used in more than a 100 countries around the world. I think and hope, more and more people form the educational field understand the true benefits that technology can bring to students nowadays. Not only is it speaking to them in terms of their own language ( youngsters nowadays are basically born with a smartphone), but it also make them more active in their learning and helps them retain information in a more immediate and effective way.
