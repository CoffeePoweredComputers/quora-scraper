            "answer_text": "Unlimited Broadband Its benefits are , you can surf , download , also live stream on your pc as well as on your phone. Also , can download and play lots of game & lots of videos in high resolution. But, this will harm your eyes and your mental health . You seems to be mentally disturbed and get separate with your love ones. Most of the benefits goes to the broad brand connection provider as they get a good amount of money every month from you . And , unlimited Broadband is necessary for offices and also for youtubers or live streamers . For normal person , who want to entertain themselves through internet for my point of view unlimited internet /broad brand is not useful . Think About It . ",

            "answer_text": "The question itself resolved it. You said it's unlimited then What else you need as a benefit. One thing to note is the internet speed, if it is fibernet then you don't need to worry about speed. If it normal broadband then you should keep a track of timings when you get good speed and when not. If you are in a rural area the speed and bandwidth may affect the unlimited plans. ",
