            "answer_text": "The answer is 34. There are 34 people left in the garden. How did I arrive at this conclusion? Let\u2019s break the original problem statement down: You state that you enter a garden and follow that with a statement that there are 34 people. The logic flow to this point implies that you enter a garden with 33 people in it and by entering, there are now 34 including yourself.You then go on to say that the reader kills 30 people. Nothing in the narrative requires that any of them are the same 34 people who were in the garden you entered. In fact, because there is no transitional or associative narrative, it is appropriate to assume that it is a completely different group of 30 people and completely unconnected to you or your garden. The temporal progression of the narrative and lack of further descriptive detail suggests that the killing of the 30 happened after you entered the garden and happened nearly instantaneously or at least within a very short period of time such that nobody would have had an opportunity to leave the garden on their own accord. Perhaps the reader is a suicide cult leader or maybe a mass murderer?So now we have two events that can be rephrased as such:\u201cI enter a garden and now there are 34 people including myself.\u201d\u201cYou then kill 30 other people.\u201dLogic now leads the way to the answer which is that somewhere 30 people have met their very tragic and untimely collective end, while 34 people remain unscathed in your garden, likely checking their news feeds which are sure to be filled with trending preliminary reports of this national tragedy.",

You kill\u2026\u201d indicates that the witness (the writer) is talking to the killer (you, the reader). It does not matter whether the 34 people in there include the witness or not, because at the end what matters is the people remaining at the scene. You killed 30 people, and I, the witness, am telling you that you (the reader) have killed 30 people, so you and I are \u201cstill\u201d at the scene, the garden. Therefore, at the end, there are 32 people (30 dead, and you and I alive) at the scene. How did I survive? Why am I talking to you, the killer? Those questions can be answered in many different ways. However, the answer for the original question is 30 dead people and 2 alive at the crime scene. If you like this new perspective, please up vote! ",
