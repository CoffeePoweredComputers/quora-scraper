            "answer_text": "That depends a lot on what you mean. If you mean \u201cblock all the sunlight from hitting you\u201d, then yes. Easy. Go into the shade, done. If you mean \u201cblock all the sunlight from hitting you, and your surroundings at least for an area large enough that it gets dark\u201d, then that\u2019s the magic that happens during a total solar eclipse. If you\u2019re lucky (or dedicated) enough to be in the shadow that the moon casts on the surface of Earth, then you\u2019ll have a couple of minutes where no direct sunlight reaches you, or any other point, some 30km in each direction. That\u2019ll make it dark enough for you to almost think the sun has gone away. (And been replaced by the most beautiful sight you can ever see: The solar corona, faintly visible around the rim of the moon. But I digress\u2026) If you mean \u201cblock all sunlight from striking anywhere on Earth\u201d, then we need to divide the question even further: Do you mean \u201crealistically with the knowledge, technology and material we have at present\u201d, then nope. You\u2019d need something slightly bigger than the entire Earth in order to make that happen. And we might have enough raw material to produce a (very thin) sail with an area of 130000000 square kilometers. But actually making something that big, and much worse, getting it out into space and placing it in the correct spot\u2026 Impossible. If you mean \u201ctheretically, given infinite energy, infinite material, no friction, massless containers, no air resistance, and all those convenient assumptions that physics exercises always have in order to make things simple, then sure. Just pick up Jupiter, remove 99% of its mass, place it in the L1 Lagrange point, and attach rockets to constantly fire in order to keep it inside the unstable equilibrium point. You\u2019ll have night everywhere on Earth forever. :) Finally, if you want to block ALL sunlight from leaving our solar system in ANY direction, then you\u2019ve already guessed the anser to the \u201crealistically\u2026\u201d part: No way. Theoretically, you\u2019re about to imagine something similar to the concept of a Dyson Sphere. Good luck with that. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. You can consume almost all photons from Sun to Earth by creating a layer in the upper atmosphere of Earth. The material that you are going to use is the trump card here. Vantablack (Vertically aligned Carbon Nanotubes arrays) When you are able to create a layer of Vantablack and fix it over the upper atmosphere of Earth, You can block out the most sunlight from the Earth. The material will be able to absorb up to 99.965% of radiation in the visible spectrum. It will also consume all the photons which are being spread by the lights in your home, street and everywhere. The day is going to be the darkest of darkest that you have ever witnessed. You would not be able to see with your eyes, since your eye requires the photons to sense. Some pictures for you to understand the blackness of the material.    I hope this is the better way to block the sun light reaching earth. Image Source : Google Image ",
