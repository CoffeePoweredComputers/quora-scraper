            "answer_text": "The issue Tesla is having is that they\u2019re trying to make lots of cars, but on a much tighter budget then the big car companies. Now, Tesla does have a fair amount of money, but it\u2019s not much compared to the giants, who have worldwide manufacturing and distribution networks, not to mention the advantage of over a century of experience. Tesla is stretching themselves too thin, so Quality Control slips as a result. If they were content to make fewer cars and capitalize on the niche market of upscale EVs, they could slow down a bit and not have as many issues. Their other problem is a lack of dealerships. Yes, I know Tesla touts their way as \u2018the path to the future\u2019, but there\u2019s a reason that the giants use dealership networks. Which is more convenient in your eyes? Taking your car to the local dealer, where the factory warranty will be accepted and your car can be repairedor Having to wait eons for a Tesla Ranger to come to your house, or worse, end up shipping your car back to Tesla for major repair.Just as quality has slipped, so has service as the company has stretched themselves out. More then one Quora user has pointed out that it took weeks if not over a month to get their car back from Tesla. Given their money situation, I almost wonder if the lack of a dealership network is not so much for being \u2018futuristic\u2019, but because they can\u2019t afford one. I have my suspicions that\u2019s also why they don\u2019t like 3rd parties or owners doing their own work: because they absolutely need that money they earn from repairs on their cars to scrape by and stay afloat. There\u2019s some BIG debts coming due for Tesla in 2023\u201324, so I can\u2019t help but wonder if that\u2019s on their mind\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "As Horst answered\u2026 they do not have that reputation, except in the minds of people who are looking for it and see only what they are hoping to find. Let me add my name to the list of answers from actual owners, saying \u201cwhat reliability issues? I haven\u2019t had any\u2026\u201d As some others have pointed out, Tesla has initial quality issues. This is due to them having decades less experience at manufacturing, while also trying to pioneer new processes and technologies, which means that often, off the shelf parts, or off the shelf production machines, can\u2019t be used, when they otherwise would have. Tesla is fighting to overcome this deficiency, while ALSO fighting to overcome the struggle between their operating costs, and excessive demand. In other words, they are growing so fast, and trying so hard to control their costs (otherwise growing so quickly would put them out of business), that they can\u2019t always do a great job of manufacturing, especially on products that have just launched recently. This is a problem, sure. And Tesla is going to have to take a breather and deal with it at some point, ideally before it hurts their reputation enough to harm demand. But given their current demand situation, I don\u2019t think they are concerned about that. And why is their demand situation so positive despite initial quality issues? Because initial quality, as a metric, is not a strong correlation to reliability. Initial quality MIGHT cause reliability issues. But it also might NOT. When looking at reliability, issues caused by engineering often overwhelm issues caused by manufacturing. Every manufacturer makes some percentage of defective cars. Tesla\u2019s percentage is pretty high. But a large number of those are cosmetic, and a large number get noticed and fixed before the car is accepted by the customer. Almost all of the most notorious reliability issues that Tesla\u2019s DO have, have not been manufacturing issues, they\u2019ve been engineering issues. A part that breaks because it was not designed perfectly, and wears out too fast or is under too much stress. But all makes have that kind of issue, and Tesla\u2019s rates on those kinds of issues are actually pretty good - especially on their newer cars. They made a lot of these mistakes early on, but have learned from that and are making much fewer of this kind of mistake these days. My car is heading towards 3 years old. I had two small warranty claims, both for initial quality issues. Both were fixed by Tesla without complaint, long waits, out of pocket costs, or any kind of fuss at all. Since then, the car has not seen any mechanic at all. It has needed literally nothing but a charging plug and an air compressor and a good wash, for two years. In fact, it requires so little, that I\u2019m concerned I will occasionally forget to check up on things I should keep an eye on, like brakes and tires. ",
