            "answer_text": "In the market there are many of the Payment Gateways available. Basically the most trusted one is PayPal. The choice of getting the payment gateway for your technical support depends totally upon  you as you might know that gateway keeps some percentage for the payment that you process via gateway and payment payback time too. Some of the gateways charge about 20-30% of the transaction and payback the amount to merchant in 2-3 weeks or more than that. Some might payback the amount into merchant's account in less that 2 weeks time. So market Survey is much required. Few Major Gateways that I know are :   PaypalCredit Card Processing for Small Business Merchants to Accept Payments Online or Anywhere (Authorize. net )Braintree",
