            "answer_text": "Original question: What's worth collecting today that's reasonably affordable? Collectables are interesting. The noted writer Carl Burns once told me how the cycle of collecting works. 10 years old -> people see the item as junk. 20 years old -> you might pick it up at a yard sale if it\u2019s a good price and if you like it. 30 years old -> hey, I had one of those when I was a kid. WOW! Never thought I\u2019d see one again. People start to pick stuff up. You can keep it or re-sell it, but the important thing is that it is starting to be noticed. 40 years ago -> there\u2019s a hobby starting around this collectable and it\u2019s gaining interest - everyone remembers it and wants one - it\u2019s bound to sell at your yard sale and likely show up at a flea market or antique mall. 50 years ago-> there are clubs that have formed to collect the item - everything sells as people want it - it\u2019s a hot item. 60 years ago -> the hobby has refined - poor condition is frowned upon, premiums are paid for good stuff that is mint or new in the box and there may be auctions devoted to the stuff - good stuff can bring big bucks. 70 years ago -> the good stuff is worth a lot but the collectible has stratified - you can\u2019t find examples anymore so a lot of stuff is simply re-circulating. 80 years ago -> what is that? man it\u2019s from another time! - no one remembers it nor cares about it, it is pretty much past its prime as anyone who remembers it from childhood is likely now in a nursing home and the hobby is no longer being perpetuated. 90 years ago -> YAWN! Judge for yourself from this as to when the best time to buy is. Will you be holding it? Keeping it? Turning it over? Whatever your plans, this will tell you when to buy. ",

            "answer_text": "Collect your present moments, you might have heard this statement a lot rather I would say Live your present moments, don't worry about collecting them. You wish to collect something so that in future you can gift that to your son and he may love you for that. I can tell you what is the problem with that. Problem of Time, Illusion of Future which your mind creates endlessly so that you always live your life in anticipation.Just forget about future, leave the past and live now. Live maximum time with your family, friends and cherish those moments. I am sure those moments are worth a lot and much more in value than any other material collections.I know the answer sounds philosophical but guess that is because we don't experience this daily. Once you experience these moments you no longer live in your future or past, you are here simply here. This answer will not be some philosophy but the only way you will live, not worrying about future, not hung over your past, simply existing now. ",
