            "answer_text": "Essentially it is the same thing. When a device is booked, the same procedures apply as follows: Preserve-Preserve-Preserve! by isolating the device from outside interference; utilizing airplane mode for example or a Faraday box . The items seized must be kept in the state it is found weather it\u2019s a phone, tablet, Blackberry or a gaming laptop. Photos are taken of computer screens and the physical location of each device. Without this preservation, the case is worthless as far as presenting evidence to the courts or a client is concerned. More broadly however is that the evidence you are populating is carried out the same way, first by extracting the data using using Cellebrite machine and then analyzing the extracted data using (for example) Axiom or Belkasoft software. Concluding - any digital device is subject to analysis it\u2019s the methodology that is different. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope these two are different..!! In fact Computer Forensics comes under Digital Forensics. Computer Forensics specifically means the Computing Devices. While Digital Forensics Means all the Devices that works on 0 and 1 it includes Mobile Phones, PDA\u2019s, Smart Watches, Printers, Scanners, Secondary Storage Media, Bio metric Devices. However in practical world most of time when some one says computer forensics he is talking about digital forensics in broad Aspects. ",
