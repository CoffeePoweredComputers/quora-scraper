            "answer_text": "Most likely, that's what happened with 4G LTE. As 5G rolls out, social media platforms will begin to stream higher definition videos (instead of compressing it)\u2026 so increasing data caps will help avoid people from going over their data too quickly. They already have \u201cunlimited data\u201d (not totally unlimited) but the data speeds gets throttled around 35GB or something.. so maybe the data cap for that will also increase. As technology improves, we should get more access to data.. but given the captialist society we live in, maybe they will try to find ways to make money and not increase data caps\u2026 if you want more, you pay more.. just like why Apple's iPhone 11 Pro gives you only 64GB storage as their base model, you need to pay more if you want more space.

            "answer_text": "If you check out Verizon 5G Home Internet Plan, they mention that there is no data limit or data cap for 5G Home Internet service. The 5G Home Internet plan is a data-only plan, separate from other plans on your account. Any device connected to your 5G Home Internet Wi-Fi network will enjoy unlimited data usage. So there are numerous factors and controversies to be taken into account when declaring an increase or decrease in data caps. ",
