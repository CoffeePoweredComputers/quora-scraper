            "answer_text": "Yes, though it probably won\u2019t happen for a long time. This is a small question, but I was actually really interested, so I did a lot more research than I should have. Here\u2019s what I think, now. Technology has a limit. No matter where we go, what we do, or how we invent, we\u2019re stuck with using the particles that we have. The universe is unbelievably complex, but eventually, you still run out of things to invent. Here\u2019s why. Imagine that you are a tiny person in a universe of just a few hundred atoms. There isn\u2019t much that you can invent. You can form thousands of compounds, but there\u2019s still a limit to how much you can create. Our universe, while incredibly complex, still has limit. We can only use certain type of particles. This means that we\u2019ll probably never stop the expansion of the universe, because we\u2019ll probably never be able to perfectly recreate the conditions in which they are created. The universe has rules, and even our technology won\u2019t be able to surpass them. People only create technology when motivated too. This is the most likely way that our tech development will be slowed or stopped. If we really get awesome, paradise-type technology like super-VR that we can live in, then we have no reason to keep creating stuff in the real world. Imagine living in a paradise like Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Instead of spending your days trying to come up with new technology, you\u2019ll be immersed in the game, playing with friends and having fun in-game. Ultimately, you have no need to keep creating tech. An apocalypse-type event wipes out all intelligent life. This is unfortunately a likely scenario. With nuclear weapons, we could pretty easily wipe out all surface life on our planet, making it uninhabitable for humans. For all we know, we\u2019re the only intelligent life in the universe. If we wiped ourselves out, it would be something tragic. Our bright legacy of hope, change, and possibility would be snuffed out in an instant. Because as cool and deep as it is\u2026 The universe won\u2019t innovate itself.  ",

            "answer_text": "In How to Stop a Blade Runner Dystopia, I talked about why we\u2019ll eventually have to stop the technological development of artificial intelligence, genetics, and weaponry.  But your question is\u2026 \u201cIs it even possible to stop technology?\u201d I subconsciously shared this deterministic belief for sometime, which made me depressed, because then nothing matters if we\u2019ll inevitably be replaced by machines (I can be a bit of a drama queen). But then I realized, technology can be stopped because it has been stopped before.  Let\u2019s go back in time\u2026 During the 15th century, the Ming Dynasty shut itself out from the world. The empire then remained largely isolated and technologically stagnant until the 19th century. Why did the Middle Kingdom isolate itself? Well, power was highly centralized into the emperor\u2019s hands. The Middle Kingdom considered itself the middle of the universe and the emperor considered himself the middle of the middle! He therefore lacked interest in outside trade because he felt the kingdom already had all the resources and technology it needed to satisfy his wildest imaginations.  Concubines And like the emperor, we should ask ourselves\u2026 \u201cHow much more do we need to be satisfied?\u201d To reflect on this question, sit on Daddy\u2019s lap, and let me tell you a story about a Chinese farmer and a Western businessman\u2026  The Fisherman and The Businessman A businessman took a short vacation to a small Chinese coastal village. Unable to sleep he walked the pier. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked and inside the boat were several large tuna. \u201cHow long did it take you to catch them?\u201d he asked. \u201cOnly a little while\u201d the Chinese fisherman replied. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay out longer and catch more fish?\u201d he asked. \u201cI have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,\u201d the Chinese fisherman said as he unloaded them into a basket. \u201cBut \u2026. What do you do with the rest of your time?\u201d The fisherman looked up and smiled, \u201cI sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a nap with my wife and stroll into the village, where I sip wine and play guitar with my friends\u201d. The businessman laughed \u201cSir I am an MBA and can help you. You should fish more, and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat. In no time you could have several boats with the increase haul. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Then instead of selling your catch to the middleman, you could sell directly to the consumers. You could control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal village and move to the city to run your expanding empire.\u201d The fisherman asked \u201cBut, sir, how long will all this take?\u201d \u201c15- 20 years, 25 tops\u201d said the businessman. \u201cBut what then?\u201d asked the fisherman. The businessman laughed and said \u201cThat\u2019s the best part, when the time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions\u201d. \u201cMillions? Then what?\u201d asked the fisherman. The businessman replied, \u201cThen you could retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you could sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a nap with your wife, and stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play guitar with your friends.\u201d Where this anecdote can be misleading is it presumes the status quo is an option. But what if the businessman continued by saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t take this deal then I\u2019ll find a fisherman who will and by this time next year the corporation will own this village and you\u2019ll have to work long hours at little pay.\u201d The fisherman must then either adapt or die.  This would make the anecdote more historically accurate. Because if the Chinese fisherman was a metaphor for \u201cImperial China\u201d and the businessman was a metaphor for the \u201cthe West\u201d then in the end the West conquered the East because the East refused to adapt. This is also true for today. If a country or corporation becomes too satisfied then they\u2019ll eventually be conquered by the competition. But what if there was no competition? If there wasn\u2019t a West then Imperial China would likely still exist. Keep in mind a Chinese person of 1400 A.D. lived a remarkably similar life to a person of 1800 A.D and so it\u2019s conceivable to believe that without the West a Chinese person of 1800 A.D. would live a similar life to a person of 2200 A.D.  And life was better for the Chinese when they were stuck in the status quo rather than the two centuries that followed. With colonization, the Chinese were forced to buy drugs from the British in the Opium Wars and when Mao came to power he killed more people than Hitler and Stalin COMBINED. In business when there is no competition (i.e. monopolies)\u2026 we see they get comfortable doing things the way they have always been done (i.e. they\u2019re satisfied) so they stop innovating. In government\u2026 if there was no U.S.S.R. then the U.S. wouldn\u2019t have poured billions of dollars into rockets and computing and so my guess is the world today would look remarkably similar to 1960. Let\u2019s go forward in time\u2026 I believe the pace of change will eventually slow down as global power continues to centralize into fewer and fewer hands. Eventually the global elite will come together under the premise, \u201cYou know what, artificial intelligence threatens our power. Let\u2019s stop developing it.\u201d Now hopefully this decision will be made by some sort of coalition of democratic nations. Because if it doesn\u2019t happen through democratic consensus then it will happen by dictatorial decree. \u201cArtificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind, whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aVladimir Putin Because left unabated the race for better A.I. will eventually lead to someone getting the upper-hand and so, for example, the Chinese could unlock an artificial intelligence so powerful it gives them control over all the global satellites and therefore the globe. And then they would build a metaphorical great wall around any further technological development that could threaten their power, and then who knows, the world could slowly devolve back into something that looks a little like Imperial China.  And as long as there aren\u2019t any alien forces lurking upon the horizon, technology could stay stopped for a long, long time because the only people who could tear down the wall would be the people guarding it. I hope this answer gives you a greater sense of purpose because we can control how the wall is built. Why should we even build a wall around technology? I discuss that more here (no spoilers). ",
