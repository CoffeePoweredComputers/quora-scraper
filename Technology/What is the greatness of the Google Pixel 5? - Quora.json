            "answer_text": "Q : What is the greatness of the Google Pixel 5?  The Google Pixel 5 was announced on September 30, 2020 at Google\u2019s Launch Night In event. This is Google\u2019s top-end phone of 2020 and it\u2019s a great option if you want: A more affordable 5G phone with some flagship-level featuresA great camera experienceA smaller-than-typical sizeQuality software and guaranteed updatesThe Pixel 5 costs $699 in the US, where it\u2019s available in only one size, two colors, and one storage configuration. It competes with the LG Velvet, the OnePlus 8, OnePlus Nord (outside the US), the Samsung Galaxy A71, the Galaxy S20 FE, and a slew of other upper mid-range to flagship 5G phones. You should avoid the Pixel 5 if you want: The best performance possible in a phoneTwo-day battery life with normal useThe best zoom capabilitiesIs the Google Pixel 5 worth buying? The $699 Google Pixel 5 looks like a good phone on paper in North America, with brands like Realme and Xiaomi not a factor on the continent. But it still seems like a good purchase in general if you want a 5G phone with brisk updates and flagship-style features but don\u2019t want to pay 2020 flagship money. In the case of the spec sheet, the pixel 4 was arguably the least impressive flagship of 2019, packing a small battery and lacking a triple rear camera setup seen on rival phones. For the Pixel 5, it looks like Google has beefed things up in some ways, but not in others. Google\u2019s phone shares the same price as the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, and it delivers a few more extras on paper. Things like a 120Hz OLED screen, flagship silicon, triple rear camera, and microSD expansion are all present on Samsung\u2019s phone, making for an arguably more impressive, flexible package. What review about the Google Pixel 5? We\u2019ve only conducted an initial Pixel 5 review, with a more comprehensive rundown coming soon. In saying so, our own David Imel said that he was a \u201chuge fan\u201d of the $699 phone. David specifically praised the phone\u2019s long battery life, image quality, great display, and Google integration in his initial review. He also pointed to things like three years of updates and flagship extras like water resistance and wireless charging. In saying so, he also lamented the slow charging speed compared to rivals, as well as the lack of a telephoto camera and Google\u2019s insistence on using older camera sensors. Our reviewer also noted the Galaxy S20 FE as a great alternative offering more power and a couple more features for the same price. It also bears repeating that Google phones tend to suffer from some hardware issues now and again. So you\u2019ll want to keep this in mind before splashing out, especially if you\u2019re in an unsupported country and buying it on the grey market. The last thing you want is a defective product with no real support in your locale. What is Google Pixel 5 specs : The Google Pixel 5 isn\u2019t going to win any awards for sheer horsepower, but the phone still brings quite a few features to the table anyway. Check out our Google Pixel 5 specs overview below.  Is the Pixel 5 fast enough? One thing that\u2019s a certainty is that the Pixel 5 is weaker than the Pixel 4 and other 2019 flagships (let alone 2020 flagships) when it comes to sheer CPU and graphical power. Our own Robert Triggs compared the Snapdragon 765G to 2020 and 2019 flagship silicon, and the results tell us a lot.  The CPU performance gap is pretty small between the Snapdragon 765G and the Snapdragon 855 when it comes to single-core performance. But the Snapdragon 855 streaks ahead when it comes to multi-core results, owing to it offering more heavyweight CPU cores. We also see a pretty big gap when it comes to graphical performance.  In other words, those wanting to play the most advanced games and emulators at a smooth framerate might want to buy a Snapdragon 865 or Snapdragon 855 phone. But the Pixel 5\u2019s chipset should still deliver great performance in general and in most games. In fact, we noted in our preliminary review that we didn\u2019t notice any lag or slowdown with general usage. ",
