            "answer_text": "For Apple Watch, there are two sources of a notification: An app that exclusively runs on the watch and has no iPhone companion app (e.g. Breathe, Handwashing, Heart, Noise, etc.)An app that exists on the iPhone that can mirror its notification on the watch (e.g. Notes, Health, Home, Numbers, etc.)From within the \u201cWatch\u201d app on iPhone, tap \u201cNotifications\u201d. These settings can be modified (turned on/off) and in some cases, other settings adjusted. While apps falling into the #2 category can be enabled or disabled on either device, apps falling into #1 cannot be redirected to the iPhone, they can only be turned off. If all you want is for your watch to stop notifying you of anything, you can turn off the audible alarm sound only. While not wearing the watch, you will have no idea of any notifications coming through until you put it back on and scroll through them. It\u2019s easy to turn off audible notifications by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, scrolling down, and tapping the alarm bell:  ",
