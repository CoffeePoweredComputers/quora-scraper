            "answer_text": "Our current technology world is riddled with issues and disasters. Here are three that I find the most annoying: Tangled Earphones God, this is probably the most annoying things that I experience on a daily basis, wait never mind, an hourly basis. Listen to music for a bit, take them, put them in your pocket, take them out later, and it\u2019s going to be ten minutes until you can use them again as they are so tangled. Yes, it\u2019s understandable that you can always just curl them up in a neat way, but what a waste of time that is. This issue may not have a solution, so earphone companies, you better get your head in the game, before I switch to headphones entirely. Phone Screens A total catastrophe. New iPhone, goes to the subway, somebody\u2019s arm knocks yours, and that is literally an entire month of savings falling to the ground. When your phone screen cracks, I would say that is probably one of the most painful moments in your life. I mean, why can\u2019t somebody just someday come up with an indestructible phone case which will never let your phone screen be damaged again? Phone screens cracking are getting so bad that I am coming to a conspiracy theory conclusion that phone companies like Apple or Samsung are deliberately making garbage screens so they can earn more money off of fixing the damn screens. A study from SquareTrade\u00ae shows that Americans have spent 10.7 billion dollars on damaged iPhones since they were first released in 2007. 10.7 billion dollars. Billion. Get a grip. Battery Life As phones grow older, their batteries grow older. As the batteries grow older, they last shorter and shorter. And when they last shorter and shorter, that\u2019s when your phone becomes more and more useless. Say your walking in the middle of the mountains in South Dakota, and you get lost, only to find that you are out of battery, never mind finding a phone signal. And now you have nothing to do but wait and end up getting eaten by a bear. Not fun. Humans dream of great technological advances, such as teleportation someday. However, it does not cross my brain how humans that can\u2019t even design a good phone are supposed to teleport things halfway across the world. In fact, it stuns me, it shocks me that humans even managed to build something to help them get to space, when they couldn\u2019t even build a f***ing phone case. ",
