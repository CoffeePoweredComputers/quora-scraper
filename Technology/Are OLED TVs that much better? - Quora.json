            "answer_text": "Yaaaay, somebody asked this question! I have a strage pleasure when talking about display technologies, don\u2019t know why\u2026 Others have correctly pointed out that yes, OLED are THAT much better. But why? And how? And how much better? Let\u2019s start with some suprisig facts: The so called \u201cLED\u201d displays have almost NOTHING IN COMMON with OLED displays. In fact, \u201cLED\u201c displays are actually LCD.OLED is the true successor of the PLASMA display.PLASMA is superior to LED/LCD in all use cases with the exception of showrooms.So let\u2019s address the age old discussion first, PLASMA vs LCD and then vs LED. LCD was the first to arrive. LCD uses a white backlight that is always on and then it employs a layer of so call liquid crystals on top. I won\u2019t get into more details than that, but the takeaway is simple: by changing the properties of the crystals using electricity, they block out the light coming from the always-on backlight. When they are left alone, the crystals allow all the light to pass through, so you get a white. Whey the are at maximum twist, the crystals block all the light, so you get a black. Colors are obtained either using filters or by using multiple layers of liquid crystals. Another important point is that the liquid crystals layer is not independent for each pixel, so what happens to a pixel will kinda influence a bit what happens to the pixel adjacent. So\u2026 this is why: LCDs can be very bright (it easy, just use a strong backlight)LCDs struggle with blacks (because to produce true black they would need to block all the light from the backlight and they can\u2019t obtain 100% blockage)LCDs have poor contrast (if a pixel needs to be white and the one next to it black, because the liquid crystal layer is the same for both pixels, it will twist and do the job, but only barely).On the contrast, PLASMA, a much newer technology, uses idependent pixels, and there is no backlight. Each pixel in a plasma display is a separate circuit and each pixel produces it\u2019s own independent light - no more liquid crystals that need to block light, here we have independent pixels that shine their own. This is why: PLASMA produces better blacks (any pixel can be turned off and it\u2019s black, true black)PLASMA has far superior contrast (perfect contrast, actually, because pixels are independent)PLASMA has worse brightness than LCDs\u2026 But this will only count when watching in bright rooms, such as showrooms. Back at home, looking at a movie, you\u2019ll never ever use the max brightness on any PLASMA display, and you\u2019ll probably be at 10\u201315% for LCDs.The only real downsides to PLASMA are: It\u2019s very bulky, heavy and energy inneficient (because of how PLASMA pixels work)It can have screen burn in, when any pixel will stay in the same state for too long, it will temporarily lose its elasticity, so to speak. So if you pause the same image on a PLASMA display for, say, few hours, a ghost image will remain. However this is ONLY TEMPORARY and methods for prevention (pixel shifting, screen savers) exist and are effective.So\u2026 LCD and PLASMA are totally different technologies, PLASMA being far superior for movies, LCD for showrooms and whenever size & weight are of concern. This is why we never had PLASMA laptop screens :) Now on to LED. LED displays are in fact LCD, is just that the backlight is a wall of LEDs. In LCD the backlight is neon, in LED the backlight is LED. But in the rest they are THE SAME. LCD vs LED are only marketing names. If fact, you could have called them LCD with Neon Backlight VS LCD with LED Backlight. So\u2026 Just to be absolutely clear on this - displays marketed as \u201cLED\u201d are actually LCD displays, but with the backlight coming from LEDs. They have all the pros and cons of LCD: great brightness, terrible blacks, poor contrast. Good for showrooms, bad for movies at home. So, strangely and maybe counter intuitively, PLASMA is better than LED for most use cases. Then why was there such a frenzy with LED and why was PLASMA almost forgot? First off, LED displays could be really thin and lightweight. This made them very attractive, very bling.Secondly, LED displays have impressive brightness and clarity. This really doesn\u2019t count when watching a movie back home, but it counts when looking at TVs in a showroom.Lastly, because of marketing. You see, display manufacturers were aware that LCD sucks, but PLASMA was simply too heavy, too inneficient to produce, to bulky\u2026 But they were also aware that the next big technology must be a followup to the PLASMA, with independent pixels. OLED, the true succesor to PLASMA and already recognized as the next big thing was simply too expensive for mainstream TVs at the time. So LED displays filled in this gap, and allowed manufacturers to push new generation TVs, Smart TVs, 4K resolutions, ultra slim form factors using essentially the same old crappy technology (LCD) but replacing the backlight with LEDs, while investing into making OLED economically feasible.So, finally, OLED! OLED stands for Organic LED, and trully is an impressive technology. OLED is the true succesor of the PLASMA, having individual pixels that shine their own light, and colour - so no more backlighting, like with LCD/LED. Just like PLASMA, OLED has perfect blacks & perfect contrast. Unlike PLASMA, however, the pixels can be small enough, energy efficient, very bright and don\u2019t suffer as much from screen burn-in. OLED can be much more than what we find today on the market, we\u2019re talking about flexible displays, transparent screens, really cool stuff. The downside? Price :) OLED uses materials difficult to source and significantly more expensive than traditional materials. OLED has been used in ultra-premium smartphone displays for a long time, and in recent years it has become mainstream. Nearly all manufacturers today employ OLED. If you switch from an LCD display (which, ironically, is something that TV manufacturers would call LED display, but smartphone manufacturers don\u2019t bother) to an OLED display you\u2019ll instantly know the difference. It is a warmer and smoother experience. It is said that it strains the eye a lot less. Colours are more natural, energy use is better and, as mentioned, perfect blacks & perfect contrast. We do, however, know how much it costs to replace a broken smartphone screen, yes? So\u2026 To cocnlude: \u201cLED\u201d displays have nothing in common with OLED displays\u201cLED\u201d displays are in fact LCD displays, just with LED backlighting instead of neonOLED is the true successor to the PLASMALED/LCD are shit for movies. OLED is greatThe difference is THAT much relevantHope I hepled :) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they are - largely due to their ability to completely shut out any light when meant to be displaying black. There is no bleeding and shadows are clear and deep. A remarkable amount of what we see in movies and TV programming depends on contrast. Some movies contain huge amounts of high contrast images which a black backdrop (any Star Wars movie for a start). The question though asks are they that much better (than other types of TV)? So the answer really depends on the value added by the superior blackness vs the additional price. OLED screens are significantly more expensive than LCD and its derivatives (some of which seem designed to try to fool buyers that they are more OLED like). The price differential is dropping but its hundreds if a couple of thousand dollars extra. But put that into perspective. Manufacturers keep pushing up screen sizes and resolution and the bigger the better, right? In a typical living room, most people sit 6\u201310 feet away from the screen. Any closer and anything bigger than 55\u2033 is overkill (field of vision). People also tend to keep TVs for several years and while the technology does change (and prices keep coming down), the LCD and OLED tech is relatively mature. So, think about whether you\u2019d rather spend the money on an over-sized TV or a slightly smaller but better quality picture. The latter is all a TV should be judged upon. As an aside, many TVs are now 4K resolution and there\u2019s very little content still (some streaming services show some 4K content). There\u2019s essentially no 8K content and little use for 8K at screen sizes less than 75\u2033 or so. They are technically amazing but for most home scenarios are beyond \u201cretina\u201d resolution. Conflict of interest: I own a 65\u2033 4K Panasonic OLED. It replaced a 65\u2033 HD Samsung LCD. Its picture quality is superb over the LCD. Also, for all types of TVs be sure to shut off any motion settings (also known as the soap opera effect) as it\u2019s a gimmick that adds artificial detail at the price of reality (and how the movie was meant to be viewed).

            "answer_text": "Certainly. OLED TVs are far superior to LED TVs including QLED of Samsung. 4K resolution is same - 3840 x 2160 pixels (as is 8K). The difference lies in how well the picture/image is displayed. The main aspect is how many million colours and shades of grey are displayed. Most people don\u2019t know it but black is the most important colour in video. When black is not fully black (ok, pure black is not possible), but greyish, then it means that the picture is that much washed out. When this happens, all colours are washed out - deep red is pinkish, yellow is whitish yellow, and so on. When black is grey, then scenes in dark areas and shadow details are washed out. So what is black colour in video terms? Black is absence of light. Pure black is when there is absolutely no light and that is why it is impossible to produce. OLED panels produce the best blacks. This is because the OLED panel contains pixels made up of OLEDs. Each pixel can be turned ON or OFF. This allows having a black pixel next to a lighted pixel. LED TV panels are actually LCD panels backlit by white LEDs - from the side (which are most common) or rear (which are rare and expensive). The LCDs always bleed light even when turned off. That is why LED TVs are inferior and have washed out colour. QLED and LED TVs with local dimming allow to overcome this lacuna somewhat (too lengthy to explain here) but still cannot completely overcome it. These TVs are also expensive. The plasma TVs of previous generation also allowed deep blacks because each pixel could be controlled there too. The Pioneer Kuro and Panasonic ZT-60 were the best and matched the OLED TV panels of today. Unfortunately, the technology died out.  Next time, go to a TV showroom and watch the same content (note - the same content) on an LED TV and OLED TV and see the difference for yourself. BTW, LED and OLED may sound similar but are as similar as chalk and cheese, LED being the chalk. All said and done \u2026 Black is not so important for TV serials and soaps or programs shot in a studio. Black purity is extremely important for cinema. It is only when watching cinema that OLED TVs will shine. Otherwise, you can save a lot of bucks for yourself. ",

What do we watch TV for? Entertainment and /or information, as far as I can know (I\u2019m deliberately excluding the important function of keeping it on to distract the dog while we are out). But information doesn\u2019t need bright hues and sharp resolution \u2014 we can get it on the radio or from a newspaper through time-honored media dating from town criers and cuneiform script. And as far as visual entertainment it is principally what goes on between the ears, not what is channeled through the optic nerves. Does anyone think \u201cCasablanca\u201d is boring because it\u2019s in black and white? Immersed in the story you forget all about the medium. I have seen movies which have left an indelible impression, but not even a whiff of memory as to whether it was in color or not. And when I went to see a movie (\u201cAvatar\u201d) in modern 3D I forgot all about the new technology about 5 minutes after the gee-whiz initial moment. Last night I watched an episode of \u201cVikings\u201d and in my recollection today it seems that it was entirely done in a noir fashion that might as well have been black and white \u2014 but that didn\u2019t register as significant at all. And of ALL the visual images I have experienced the most realistic and memorable ones are those generated in my own head while reading a great book like \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d and many, many others. No images presented to me in any medium can compare with those from my own imagination. So FIE on your technological wonders. Use your brain to generate the pictures and you will have all the pixels you need and all the resolution and colors you want. OK, rant over and curmudgeon out. Oh, yes\u2026and get off my lawn.

            "answer_text": "If the concern is high contrast ratio, particularly by deep blacks, and is gray uniformity, two issues heightened in a dark room, then yes. Yet if the concern is natural appearance, then maybe no. Every OLED that I\u2019ve seen has, I feel, had the same problem as do the prevailing TVs, which are LCD, type VA, with LED backlight. (\u201cLED TVs\u201d, too, are LCD TVs, usually with VA panels, but with LED backlight, not the original CCFL backlight.) Although I\u2019ve never seen anyone else so complain, once plasma TVs vanished several years ago, whereupon LCD TVs, while adopting LED backlights, became nearly universal, the images of TVs have seemingly all looked cartoonish to me. One day, though, a couple of years ago, casually exiting a Best Buy\u2019s TV section, not even paying attention, I spotted to my side a lone TV that instantly, upon a mere glance, just looked natural to me. After stepping over, eager to see the make and model, I was disappointed to discover it branded LG. As the only bigname TV maker that generally uses, not VA panels, instead IPS panels\u2014which other bigname TV makers use only in select screen sizes of select models\u2014LG is known, accordingly, for wide viewing angles, but the lowest contrast ratio and poorest gray uniformity. (Unlike plasma as well as OLED, both VA and IPS, being types of LCD panels, require backlight, now usually implemented with LED lights.) And yet in photo editing, IPS panels remain choice over VA panels, largely since the wider viewing angle prevents color shift at screen edges from the short viewing distance of a computer monitor. OLED\u2019s viewing angle, actually, is even wider. Still, the sole TV that has impressed me, anytime recently, as looking natural was IPS, not OLED. Meanwhile, although I haven\u2019t seen OLED in a dark room, OLED in a bright room isn\u2019t much different from a good \u201cLED TV\u201d, except, perhaps, for some branded LG, in a bright room. Admittedly, though, I haven\u2019t calibrated a TV\u2019s color. Will you? \u2014 Note added 25 Jan 2020: I\u2019ve edited my above answer to cover the TV market\u2019s transition from plasma versus LCD to\u2014before OLED\u2019s emergence\u2014solely LCD, largely via LCD\u2019s move from CCFL backlight to LED backlight. On a related hunch, I\u2019ve also found the cartoonish look explained. While expanding the LCD contrast ratio, due to deeper blacks, LED crushed the shadow detail, due to poorer grayscale gradient, and imparted a color shift, sometimes unmeasurable technologically but noticeable visually [William Van Winkle, CCFL versus LED: Is there a downside to going green?\u201c, sec \"Wrapping it up\", Tom\u2019s Hardware, 2 May 2011]. Yet in later years, when shopping for monitors, I had read of LED implementations without LED\u2019s traditional shortcomings. Indeed, my present monitor, ViewSonic\u2019s VP2772, IPS with LED, looks just as natural, I\u2019d say, as my prior monitor, NEC\u2019s 2080UX+, IPS with CCFL. ",

I am openly critical of companies continuously pushing up resolution and not looking more at \u2018quality\u2019. I purchased myself an LG OLED TV because it has the most beautiful picture I have ever seen on a TV. I wasn't interested that it was 4K, but I was glad that it supports an excellent array of HDR standards. It also has the blackest black levels of any display I have ever seen, which has to be seen to be believed. I honestly cannot tell if it is on or off in a dark room if the display is black, no LCD TV can do that. There are valid criticisms of OLED TVs, apparently they have had latency issues that affect gamers (not me) and there is a risk of screen burn if you persistently watch channels with static on screen elements as many news channels do (again, not me). There are also brighter LCD based TVs (e.g. including TVs sold as \u2018LED\u2019 which are just LED backlit LCD TVs), but I don't want a TV as bright as the sun. Will microLED be better? Perhaps, but it isn't available, if you're prepared to wait a couple of years for them to be proven, then it might be worth it. Is QLED better? Not for my use case, although it doesn't suffer from screen burn so easily and I think some models are brighter. So, in my opinion, for watching films and TV series, OLED is absolutely the best thing on the market right now. ",

Wow, what a difference Costco displayed many Hdtv sets. One in particular was a 55 in Samsung OLEF UHDTV. IT was using a dvd for super picture. The sets were just released and were priced at $1995 each. Samsung Rep was on hand at store opening and was offering a $500 instant coupon. I couldn\u2019t stomach a bill for $1500 for a TV set! But my wife was simply blown away by the sound and razor sharp picture. We took it home. Set it up. OH MY GOD. It was a gift we still love. This big TV with real great sound and I even tried the fiber optic sound bar. The TV sound alone was excellent. Sound bar went back to other TV. It needed the addition. We purchased a Costco 3 year service plan and did not need it. The TV is a perfect addition and would buy it again. Plus it\u2019s sound has no equal. ",

Amazingly clear and detailed compared to the 60\u2033 1080p CRT rear projector it replaced. A few weeks ago I bought an inexpensive 65\u2033 4K TV, the Sanyo FW65R70F. Walmart Black Friday price only $380. Amazing, beautiful picture. 4K looks fantastic. And even upscaled 1080p looks better than 1080p looked on the old TV, just not as detailed as good native 4K content. Though OLED hadn\u2019t been on my radar because cost, I was curious about how much better it is. I was at Costco recently where they have several big TVs on display. One that was displayed prominently was an LG OLED of similar size to mine. I stood in front of that OLED screen and watched for a few minutes. I was surprised to find that I wasn\u2019t impressed. Blacker blacks, okay. But overall the picture didn\u2019t look better to me than what I had at home. Maybe you have to be in a darkened room for OLED to look better? But that isn\u2019t how I watch TV most of the time. Mine looks great in a normally lit room. ",

I finally retired that for a LG OLED once prices for those came down, although I still spent twice what I could have for a top-of-the-line LED TV. My wife just shrugs. My kids watch their cheap 720p LCD\u2019s and don\u2019t care. It\u2019s akin to an audiophile who thinks vinyl is warmer. To that person it\u2019s important. To everyone else it\u2019s pointless.

I\u2018ll make the answer simple: If you\u2019re going to put your TV in a bright area AND you watch TV during the day, get an LED TV. Preferable with high Nits and high number of Dimming Zones. If you will only be watching at night in a room with low or dimmable lighting, get an OLED. It has the highest contrast and is picture perfect. Don\u2019t worry about the burn in. Everything breaks down over time. Refresh rates and processors between TVs have very little difference unless you\u2019re only watching F1 cars race across your screen everyday. It\u2019s 2020, the standards are very good already. Enjoy your new TV. There\u2019s no wrong choice. ",

That is because each pixel can be turned on/off individually. No backlit TV can do that. Also colors are vibrant and accurate similar to my old Panasonic plasma. If you do not experience it first hand, it is hard to explain. On the flip side they are way more expensive than LCD, has burning effect and other issues which plagued plasma, except weight.

            "answer_text": "Yes, and as some have said an LCD TV can\u2019t get the black that an OLED can. The reason is in their construction. If you look at an LCD TV what they are is a light source (older = fluorescent, newer is LED) behind the LCD that filters and modulates that light coming out of the panel. The LCD then allows a certain amount of light through at each pixel that are combined to make the total picture. The backlight is always on, and how you make \u201cblack\u201d is that you try to turn all of the light off. The problems with this are (1) an LCD is never completely opaque, some light will leak through and (2) you also have leakage around the edge of the pixels no matter how hard you try. Sure you can minimize both of these, but the reasons LCD \u201cblack\u201d is kind of a dark grey is that you have this leakage. Now an OLED is a light emitting device so there is no backlight. At each pixel (or sub pixel) there is a tiny light that is turned on to the proper brightness. And when you turn it off, it\u2019s really off. So when you turn off large sections they really are black, not that little bit of leaking backlight that makes them gray. The other thing that this helps is viewing angle. On LCD\u2019s there tends to be a color shift depending on the angle you the viewer are with respect to the TV. If you\u2019re dead on they look great, 30-degrees off angle and they look worse, 60-degrees even worse. This is typically worse in one direction (say X) and less in another direction (say Y) so manufacturers try to use up-down as the worst and the side-to-side to be the better viewing angle, but it\u2019s an issue. (it\u2019s a geometry problem) Again, when you are an emitter you don\u2019t have this issue. In theory they also use less power so the drivers and other electronics can be smaller. That and not having to have that LCD filter layer allows you to make TV\u2019s that are thinner and lighter. Although at some point the stuff that makes them rigid takes over but we\u2019re not there yet. ",

I loved my panasonic but it was a monster and had no smarts whatsoever including only one HDMI input. My Samsung Plasma not only has a brain but it has technology to reduce burn-in when there is a static picture for a specified time. It does get warm but it is 1/4 the weight of my old Panasonic 50\u2033 monster. I will watch this TV into the ground and hope there is something better when I reach the end of my plasma road. Also the plasma technology can be viewed from any angle in the room unlike LED. Not sure if this is true for OLED? I hope there is a great technology at a reasonable cost when the time comes.
