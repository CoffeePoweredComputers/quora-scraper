            "answer_text": "Computer glasses are usually made for a 26 to 30 inch focal distance. A TV is normally a lot farther than that so proper computer glasses should not work for that distance. Unless what you are calling \u201c computer glasses\u201d are the scam glasses sold on line with no power in them that supposedly cure all kinds of problems but do nothing in reality. Real \u201c computer glasses\u201d are based on your prescription from your regular glasses. ",
