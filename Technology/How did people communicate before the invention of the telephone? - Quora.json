            "answer_text": "Well there are many answers to this, but a lot of the time they just spoke to each other i.e. they\u2019d walk over to near where the other person was and just opened their mouth in a shape that would cause the air expelled over their vocal chords to make words. These words would vary over time and would make up sentences etc. The other person, without really having to do anything would receive the sound wave which would then hit their ear and be funnelled down to their ear drum which would vibrate and then transmitted via nerves to the brain which would decode the nerve signals back to speech and they\u2019d just understand (well \u201chear\u201d) the sentence or words being spoken. When the initial person stopped making word sounds, the other person might repeat the process, so they produced sounds etc. ",
