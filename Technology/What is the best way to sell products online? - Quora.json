            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t sell anything you do not have in your possession. That means no dropshipping and no selling on consignment. Read the website of your national postal system. Read it again. Shipping is the hardest part of selling by mail order. Online selling is mail order. Use Cookie Jar Insurance. This is just using a small amount of every payment as a self-insurance premium against failed transactions. No partial refunds. If it\u2019s good enough to keep, it\u2019s good enough to pay for. Allow for return shipping costs from the Cookie Jar. Accept returns. It\u2019s business, not personal. Did you read the post office website yet? Picture as if you have no words. Describe as if you have no pictures. Buy a tape measure and a digital scale. Offer \u2018free shipping\u2019 wherever possible. This means including the cost of shipping in the asking price for your item. (Not from your profits.) Pickups are more expensive for you than shipping would be for your customer. Some things are not meant for mail order. What is the local minimum wage? Divide that by 60. Every minute of your time is worth that much. Every minute. If it\u2019s flat, it will look better scanned than photographed. Why have you not read the post office website yet? Use catalogue pictures, but include a few more personal ones that show you actually do have the item in your possession. Use an anonymizing payment system like Paypal. Many of your customers will be more comfortable with that than giving you their credit card number. If you can even get a commercial bank account. Send a packing slip with your online name and your postal address with every shipment. If you are using a large venue like eBay or Amazon, include a price list without the 10\u201320% of payment fees you pay them. Try to make their customers, your customers. KISS. It\u2019s business, not personal. Most people are honest, some people are jerks. Shipping. Shipping. Shipping. ",

            "answer_text": "There are ways to sell stuff online and make money. However, it is not as easy as many people would make it out to be. If you are just looking to make a little extra money, selling online might be something to do. But if you are looking to make a full-time income online this will be a very different story. I am not saying it can\u2019t be done, but the odds are increasing of not having success due to the competition and also how many suppliers are now working. Furthermore, many online places to sell like Amazon and eBay are changing and it is often not for the better. Add this to the increasing postage rates for shipping and the profit margins for selling online for a smaller seller are decreasing. One way many people try selling online is to just flip things. It can be done, but the secret is out on this. Try going to garage sales, flea markets, and estate sales to see if you can find things to buy at a discount and then sell them online. You can use local places to sell like using the Offer Up app or a Facebook selling group. To sell online the easiest way is by using eBay or Amazon. eBay you will be able to sell used items on. Amazon you will find most things need to be new, but they do accept some used items. The challenge with trying to flip things for a profit is that the secret is out as I mentioned. It is much more challenging to find things at a good price to still make a good profit. It still does happen, but it is not as easy as it once was. The reason for this is often people will have a garage sale or something and if the things don\u2019t sell they just list the stuff on eBay themselves. Estate sales are the same. Many estate sale companies even hold their own online auction to get the best price. People just generally want to get the most money they can for many things if it something valuable. There are just so many ways to get many buyers to look at stuff you want to get rid of these days. It creates a lot of competition to buy things low and sell them high. Selling new things is also becoming more difficult. For a while, there were some people doing well with something called retail arbitrage. This happens when someone buys something at a low price in a local store and they can sell it for more money online. A lot of Amazon sellers would do this successfully. The issue with this again is the competition. It is not easy to find things that you can make a profit by selling them on Amazon. Also, retailers have caught onto this and many are not receptive to the practice. You can still make money with retail arbitrage, but don\u2019t look to get rich. Setting up your own store online with your own things for sale is also a possibility to make money online. Yet, this can be extremely difficult unless you have something not many other people have. The competition is high for many products. The other problem is getting people to your website to buy the stuff you have. This presents a challenge as well. The other problem with selling your own things online can also be overseas competition. If you are not drop shipping and maybe even if you are, you may not be able to compete in price for what you are selling. Many sellers from China are selling directly through Amazon. They have also now begun to flood eBay. Finding things you can sell for a good profit is very hard. You might be able to find something you can make a little money on for each item, but you will need to sell thousands or hundreds of thousands of them to make a good profit. Larger things to sell online and make a regular high margin on do not exist any longer. You might be able to make a few dollars here and there, but it won\u2019t likely last. If you do find things to sell online either to flip or as new products, the other problems you might face are with the changing dynamics with many online selling places. Amazon and eBay are often not the friendliest to smaller sellers. Getting scammed on eBay or Amazon is a real possibility. Also, they are increasingly making their fees higher to sell with them. The increasing postage costs are also making selling online difficult. With places like eBay and Amazon, you can make the choice to charge the seller for shipping, but it does not really matter. You still need to work this into the sale price of whatever you are selling to make a profit. Online selling places are also now starting to favor sellers that offer free shipping. Amazon has done this for some time, but eBay has followed in recent years as they are trying to be more like Amazon. What this means is that if you do not offer free shipping than your listing items will likely end up lower in search results. Free returns are another thing to consider. Amazon is big on this and eBay again has also recently followed by offering perks for sellers that take free returns from customers. Selling online is possible. Just don\u2019t get the idea that you can easily make a full-time income from it. Some people do, but it is not easy. If you are just looking to make a little extra money, it is something that can be accomplished. But do not count on it to be regular income. Online selling for smaller sellers may become even more difficult as more large retailers move online. It is almost similar to how the large retailers pushed out the mom and pop local retail shops. The same thing is now starting to happen online. Larger retailers are making it more difficult for smaller sellers to make money. ",
