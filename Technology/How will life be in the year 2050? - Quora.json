            "answer_text": "the question seems to be so futuristic and optimistic but its answer is totally opposite of it harsh,bitter,painful and what not so lets have fast preview how we humans (mainly rich) will fuck this world badly 1 pollution this is something we should know that the rate at which the rich people are running factories and plants will result in very poor quality of air i just wish we dont end up with air purifiers fitted on our mouth 2 artificial intelligence the above idea seems really cool and fascinating but it will be too late when you get to know that this thing will eat your life slowly as your body will be fully dependent on this foolish robots first they will help you out in your day to day activities(mobile phones) after that will eat up your job as elon musk is trying to do 3 skycrapers we will be surrounded with tons of huge building which will be made by poor labourers and the rich people will live in their leaving the poor and middle class on the ground under the garbage 4 overpopulation its one of the biggest problems our world would face in future and the people like elon musk are already trying to colonize on mars whose ticket will obviously be purchased by rich class of the society and u can understand what i ma trying to say if u have watched the movie elysium 5 shortage of resources until 2050 we would have hard time with the resources present in earths core and will have to find up a alternative to run our mobiles and car as we are totally dependent on it 6 unemployment machines and robots will give poor class and middle class a tight slap by eating their jobs and ending up either to starve or do something on his own 7 time travel we may feel its a sci fiction it will definately happen in near future where we humans(rich class as they can only afford those machines) will try time travelling and will end up fucking time even 8 no trust we will be living in a world where their will be no name of trust we will be in a trap cycle where rich will be after middle class ,middle class will be after poors and in total we humans will be after animals and plants resulting in total faliure of humanity and humans 9 world war way we fight now we will soon be organizing world war but i am not sure of this because the world would be digital and we wont fight with arms but with minds 10 suscide rates will increase the world will be only habitat for strong people ,weak and emotional people wont have any place in this world as we are gonna play with each others emotion 11 alien life if our fate favors us alien will also invade either helping or rest is the history so thats my opinion on how we will be living in 2050 to conclude i can say that rich class will have a really worth living life middle class will be suffering and poor class will be on the urge of death and if u have any suggestion or want to correct you can add up in comments and i am sorry if u feel really bad after seeing this answer as i know maximum would be from middle and poor class but its ok guys their is a third energy who is controlling all this i hope it helps us thanks and if someone read this answer in 2050 i hope u are making it well with your life dont worry everything will be alright thanks ;( ",

            "answer_text": "Well it is very difficult to predict what life would be in 2050 , but as per the current scenario , one can predict some sort of the life in 2050. Harsh reality: Life will going to be miserable in underdeveloped or even in some developing nations. Let\u2019s take an example of our country , India. 1- The biggest problem with our country which politocians are unable to see is Overpopulation . It will create many problems by 2050 > It leads to deforestation due to colonialisation. > Overpopulation leads to the increasing number of vehicles on the roads. > Diminishing number of trees and increasing number of vehicles causes air pollution, Delhi is a concrete example of this. > It leads to increase in competition causing unemployment spreading its roots in the nation. > Unemployment tends to increase in crime rates. 2- Another major change will be of Technology. I cant predict what kind of technologies people will use in 2050 . There will be a complete change in almost every kind of activities whether it be transportation , communication and entertainment. 3- Mostly developed nations will make their immigration policies very rigid. No country wants migrants from underdeveloped nations enter their home country. 4- The governement sector will outsource most of their departements resulting in the cut in public sector jobs. ",
