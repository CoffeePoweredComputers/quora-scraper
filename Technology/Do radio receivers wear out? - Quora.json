            "answer_text": "Eventually, they do. There are no physical wear-out mechanisms except for moving parts in controls or switches, but a process called \"component ageing\" will ultimately make the receiver stop working. Ageing is accelerated by heat and is dependent on the quality of manufacture in the components. High-grade components such as \"long-life\" capacitors, metal-film resistors and \"MIL-spec\" integrated circuits in ceramic packages will last longer. A reasonable estimate is that consumer grade components have a life expectancy under normal environmental conditions of about 8-10 years, and high-grade components 25-40 years. Plastic packaged transistors and integrated circuits may sometimes eventually be destroyed by the thermal expansion forces caused by heat cycling. The bonding wires can be weakened over time. Designs that conserve power and reduce heat dissipation such as CMOS may produce circuits having an extremely long service life, which usually is limited only by the longevity of the power supply components. One special case is when the receiver is old enough to use vacuum tubes. Tubes usually have a service life which lies in the area of 5000-10000 hours of continuous filament operation. The mechanism behind tube ageing is that the emissive layer of the cathode tends to be depleted reducing cathode emission, and that cathode material can be deposited on the grids, leading to unstable characteristics.

            "answer_text": "The circuitry in a radio receiver doesn't physically wear out, no. Repeated powering-on and powering-off of any device does gently heat electronics up and cool them down, and this can, eventually, cause physical breaks in the technology - particularly in mains power supplies. The physical things - the power button, for example - will wear out eventually, just as anything does. Additionally, volume controls - if they're the older rotary type - can attract dirt and dust inside them, and begin to crackle and misbehave. You can forestall this, a little, by occasionally wiggling the volume control up and down a little to clean it. ",

            "answer_text": "in my experience, the parts of radios that \"wear out\" include:  Power supplies - either through age, voltage spikes or shoddy manufacture ( this is been a recent problem with the Sangean brand of shortwave receivers)Electronic components within the radios failed over time - This is also due to voltage spikes,\" tinning whiskers\" and shoddy manufacture.Speakers - Often wear out due to shoddy manufacture and excessive volume.The accumulation of dust can wreak havoc in many different parts of many different types of radio receivers",
