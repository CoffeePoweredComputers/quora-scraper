            "answer_text": "One of the major advantages of the use of technology in agriculture is that farmers can now farm more acres in one growing season than ever before. This is important because it means that less people have to be farmers, though it does present a distinct disadvantage to small-scale farmers who struggle to compete with farmers who farm hundreds or thousands of acres of land. Another important advantage of tech is the increased efficiency of farming. Each acre of land gets exactly the right amount of seeds, rows are spaced exactly the right amount apart for optimal yield, and fertilizer can be applied without waste. All of this results in lower operating costs for the farmer, which in turn makes the use of this technology feasible for farmers. Finally, the use of technology in agriculture can help to improve the health of the environment. I was at a field day recently where a new edge-of-field monitoring system was displayed. This system monitors phosphorus levels in runoff from fields and updates the farmer when levels are too high and would be harmful if in major waterways. This system and others like it represent a positive shift in agricultural consideration for the health of the surrounding environment. ",

            "answer_text": "Wikipedia has a good definition of \u201ctechnology\u201d, as good as any I have found: Technology (\"science of craft\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives. All human activities have a technology, agriculture among them. Technology is inescapable. There is a technology of breast-feeding. Always has been. since the first mammals appeared 200 million years ago. What are the advantages? Agriculture could not exist without its own technology. Advances in agriculture, since the first seed was intentionally planted, have been changes in agricultural technology. Mistakes in agriculture have been changes in agricultural technology that did not work out as intended, or had harmful side effects. I think the questioner has something else in mind than what is actually asked. I think most people have some particular but unspoken meaning in mind when they use the word \u201ctechnology\u201d. Even at universities. I suspect the question really is about use of modern artificial techniques to change the technology of agriculture. ",
