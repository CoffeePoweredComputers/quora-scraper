            "answer_text": "Wow, this is my favorite question, i am enjoying to answer it. When i saw your question i was unable to stop myself to answer it. I studied in English medium 'Schools'. Yes, 'Schools' because my school changed two times. All those three schools were of English mediums but no use. Because my foundation was not strong. Foundation in the sense, when i was small, ready to get things soon as compared to my elders. My First school was of english medium 'by name' only. Not a single word of English used there in communication over there. That was the time when i could have learn English without struggling like i did since childhood. Then i got admitted to Bal Bhavan School. It was full English medium, if anyone gonna speak in hindi or other language rather than English, then he or she was suspended for few days by giving yellow or red cards in front of whole school.I still remember the day when i got admission there, i was with pappa(my father). I belong to a middle class family so i was nervous to see such a big school and don't knew english. Pappa told me to ask a faculty about the principal chamber. I asked mam in hindi and she responded in English that, \"go there\". I didn't get it and asked pappa that,\"what was she saying?\" Pappa said, \"thats the limit, you don't even know the meaning of 'go there'! \"Days passed on in that school, a girl namely Pooja was like an angel who sent to me for my help. She was so helping nature. Alhamdolillah, she helped me alot. I got admitted in grade 4. i remember so much and i have a lot to tell you but i won't test your patience :).i got a push from that school to learn English. My cousin sister gave that push, she was in the same school.I initially learnt doing conversation and then i learn how to ask questions in different conditions. My father asked me to learn 5-10 word meanings that is english vocabulary. I was not that sincere to learn them everyday due to laziness but i often learnt them. Later on, in few stages in life i met with people who use only english so i got an opportunity to practice it. I am still struggling for it, as i want to clear tests like TOEFL, IELTS and i want to be perfect in my writing and speaking skills. I browse things on google regarding english. I see youtube videos, i subscribed to many channels. I also suggest the channel \"TsMadaan\" for beginners. I downloaded \"Mesmerize\". Sorry i took your precious time but really this question reminded me of those struggling days about which i can't stop myself to write. I have more to tell but its enough for now :)Regards, ",

            "answer_text": "Funny how it's been about 15 years since I learned my first English word, and my response is still the same: \"F*** English\". Let me clarify. When I was still a 7 year old boy playing Pokemon on his Gameboy, I had to keep pestering my sister to show me where to go and what to do to progress in the game. Frustrated, I would go \"F*** English. Who the hell created this stoopid language?!\". Then my Pikachu would \"lepel oop\" (\"level up\", pronounced Indonesian style) and I would be jolly again. Now? It's \"F***! English is amazing! I can learn so many things because I know it.\" Here's what happened in between: My sister wasn't around all the time to serve me as my translator. And me being a profane kid certainly didn't help. So I had to learn the language to continue enjoying the adrenaline rush from pokemon.  I eventually joined English classes (outside school) but ultimately it was the self study that yielded the most improvements. The English classes (school and outside) were useful for solidying the grammar rules in my head though. I went to Indonesian-medium schools from kindergarten to high school (18 year old). Reading:Learned the basic grammars from early days in school but wasn't enough to understand the games. Plus, only basic vocabs were taught (why would a kid need to know 'apple' and 'niece'? I needed 'attack', 'skills', 'buy', 'teleport', thanks). Dictionary was my best friend. I played videogames like it was my religion as a kid so needless to say I had become quite good at reading in English by the time I was a teenager. As I got older and the internet got faster, I also started reading Japanese comic books for free online. Then I expanded to real books. Reading was and still is my strongest area. Listening:Maybe the TV stations wanted to stunt our linguistic learning potential when they had the genius idea to dub some shows. Or maybe they believed we are illiterate and can't read subtitles. Why else would you spend so much more energy and time to dub when you can get the job done by subbing it? Enter the DVD piracy era.  Priced at $0.50 for a piece of original quality DVD and no shampoo commercials, TV was as good as dead to me. In the beginning I couldn't understand anything they said so I had to read the subs in English. After a while, I started watching without subs and would turn on the subs again when I don't understand what they said. Writing:Apparently reading really helped with writing. Thanks to video games and comic books, I had a good arsenal of vocabs and could separate good stories from lame ones. But I didn't like writing because I'm a perfectionist. Everytime I wanted to write a sentence I had to triple check the grammars to make sure it's flawless (or at least I think it is). Google was my best friend.  By the time I entered high school, the longest piece I had ever written by then was probably only a few paragraphs long. I only really learned how to write properly when I was about to finish high school when I had to take IELTS (an accredited English test).   Speaking:This was the hardest component of the language for me. I didn't practice on daily basis because everyone I knew was Indonesian. It seemed pompous to speak English when you can speak Indonesian to them. By the time I was in high school I was crap at conversational English, although I had grasped grammars by its balls quite firmly in my head.  Also, knowing what proper pronounciation sounds like doesn't mean you can speak well. I could say a string of 4-5 words before pausing to think about what the next 4-5 words are. I didn't think I would be very pleasant to talk to, so I talked to myself like an insane man in shower. I would talk about anything that comes to my mind and sometimes gibberish when I didn't have anything to say. I also tried joining a few speech competition in English although I've never won a single goddamn one. Good practice for public speaking though. Here's another problem: I used to think I got a cool accent... Until I recorded it. I didn't like it at all. So I started shadowing people on TV shows and movies. 'Shadowing' is quickly repeating what the natives said while attempting to replicate their intonation and accent. It helped me soften my accent, although it's still there.  Shadowing Sheldon Cooper (Big Bang Theory) or any fast speaker is also a big no no because they speak like machine gun. Unless you want nobody to understand you. How my English at that point (2009) fared in Australia:Decent. I was definitely above average in the midst of other fresh-off the boat (FOB) kids, but quite some distance away from natives in terms of spoken English and listening -- Aussies speak really fast!  I've lepeled ooped since then. ",
