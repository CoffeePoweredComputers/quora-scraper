However, companies claim \u201cclass\u201d of monitor size (19\u2033, 22\u2033, 24\u2033, 27\u2033, 32\u2033) now. Slightly different aspect ratios make the measurements slightly off and it would confuse consumers with yet another spec detail. ",

You can expect the diagonal measurement to be approximate, they are a category more than a specification. If you want to know the exact size you should check the product specification which will tell you the exact dimensions horizontally and vertically. ",
