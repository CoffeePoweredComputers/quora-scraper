            "answer_text": "If your phone was the best one yet you would admit your mistake in trusting that and upgrade without real need. Save your money & replace when you really need. The 1st iteration of new major features (5G) might not be the best strategy & better to wait for refinements (eg. battery) & other major improvements, eg 120Hz refresh, mmWave outside USA, hopefully USB-C, etc, which is dictated by the Asian inventive companies.They will also dictate lower price as this time Apple cut the accessories to save, but next time it will be stupid to ask more for less hardware - they must provide the next charger & earphones as they ware & need to come as package, not from last 5 years. Waiting & listening to our needs makes us smarter. Apple\u2019s wants are wrong strategy.Imagine if Apple acted the same way impatiently & applied all the new iPhone 13 features on iPhone11 you would have been completely happy :) ",

            "answer_text": "If you can wait, wait. We don\u2019t know you and your needs, but for the most part (ie. majority of people), the upgrades are cosmetic and inconsequential. As someone who has upgraded my phones almost yearly I just want a phone that would last me for the next 3 years without ever thinking about upgrading. I barely use the camera so Newer phones are so powerful I would be quite happy with mid-range phones even though most of my older phones have been Samsung flagships - back when a S6 was a notable difference from the mid-range offerings. Give me a A51 or A71 now and I believe it ticks most of my boxes - large and vibrant screen, waterproofing (I lost my Note 5 because I dropped it in soup), decent processor. If you have an iPhone 11 or even the X, I doubt you\u2019ll see much difference in your day-to-day with the 12. ",
