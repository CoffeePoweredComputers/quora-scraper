            "answer_text": "In terms of money, most subscriptions are not that much \u2014 between $4.99-$52.99 per month, depending on your plan. But in terms of time, opportunity, mental health, and physical health? Netflix can be incredibly expensive. As James BPL wrote in How to Be Happy, Even When You\u2019re Programmed Not to Be: You and I were hardwired to conserve energy in this way because that\u2019s what was needed thousands and thousands of years ago. Do you think your ancestors long ago played recreational sports? When they were done running miles on end to hunt down food, do you suppose they started a kickball league?  Everything was for fight, for flight, for food or for sex. Those were the times to expend energy, so we developed an \u201cinstinct for idleness.\u201d There was significant evolutionary pressure, because idleness was useful for survival, and we passed this instinct on. Read more > If you\u2019ve got a Netflix subscription, idleness becomes easy. All you need to avoid boredom is to stream something on your computer or TV. But, as I wrote in Netflix Shows Are Getting Offensively Bad. You Should Find Live Entertainment, Instead: There is so much free or cheap live entertainment tht would have been so much more fulfilling -- and could have led to new friendships, new professional connections, or just an experience worth having. \u200bFor example, last month, I attended a free improv show, put on by SImps, the Stanford Improv group. Yeah, it was \"amateur\" -- it was a bunch of college students, not, like, professional\u200b improvisers. But it was still super hilarious. The students were incredibly imaginative, generating chemistry, complex characters, and elaborate love stories out of thin air..  The post continued: Later that month, I attended a Hot Sardines concert -- I hadn't heard of the band, but when I heard there was going to be a dance floor, I thought I would at least check them out on Youtube.  That night ended up going more amazingly than I ever could have anticipated. First of all, I was soon sweating from dancing so hard in a gorgeous concert hall. Second, everything is always better and more energizing when it's live. Anything can happen -- including your date getting heckled! It's true -- lead singer Elizabeth Bougerol made fun of my date's shirt, in front of a thousand people! All in good fun, of course. And then! After the show was over, I ran into one of the band members in the hall. \"Where's the bar?\" he asked. \"I don't think there is one... but we're going to the Rose and Crown, if you want to join.\" \"Where's that?\" Next thing I knew, my date and I were hanging out with the band!  I loved hearing about their crazy (and exhausting) lives on the road and sharing stories about life in Silicon Valley -- from ridiculous startup parties to when the bubble is going to pop. I even got some advice about my own songwriting. They said they're going to check out the songs I've posted on Youtube and get back to me with some brutal and honest feedback... which is actual an incredible opportunity. Read more > If you\u2019re someone who gets sucked into Netflix shows and unlimited streaming services, the cost of a subscription is tremendous. Not to mention that sitting is one of the worst things in the world for you \u2014 many doctors have even said, \u201cSitting is the new smoking.\u201d As I wrote in If You Want to Read ONE Book That Will Change Your Life FOREVER, This Is It: We were designed to sit \u2013 occasionally. Like, as a break from our other activities: hunting, gathering, collecting water, tending children, building shelter, grinding acorns into meal, farming, etc. But today, we sit continuously. Our muscles, our cells, our digestive tracts \u2013 they weren\u2019t designed to be sedentary all the time. Read more > So, again, if you are prone to Netflix marathons and getting \u201csucked in\u201d to shows, Netflix could be super expensive for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Netflix offers two types of subscription services; 1) DVD/Blu-ray (available only in the US) and 2) Streaming. DVD/Blu-ray Plan: The DVD plan priced based upon how many discs you can have at any given time. There is an option to add Blu-ray, which involves an upcharge. Please note that there may not always be a Blu-ray option available on all its product offerings, but if this is the case, they will sent you the DVD version if you are on the Blu-ray plan. Additionally, there is a limited plan and an unlimited plan. The limited plan is one DVD at a time with no more than two DVDs per month. The unlimited plan is self explanatory. Prices start are $4.99 per month for the limited plan and range between $7.99 and $52.99 for the unlimited plan, depending upon how many discs you want at any given time and if you choose the Blu-ray option. This service is only available in the United States. Here is a chart for you (click to enlarge).  Streaming Plan: Netflix streaming plan allows you to watch a different library of older and less well-known films than the DVD plan for $8.99 per month on any internet-connected device. If you had been a subscriber to this plan prior to a $1 per month price increase in May of 2014, you were grandfathered into a $7.99 per month fee. For $4 more per month, you can enjoy this plan on up to four different devices simultaneously, almost like having four accounts. This allows different members of your family (or group of friends) to basically share one account.  Prices above are based on the level of services provided in the US and are subject to change. Streaming plans may differ from country to country, where the service is offered. Outside of the US, Netflix streaming plans range from the equivalent of $5 to $20 per month. I hope this is helpful.
