            "answer_text": "Not even close with the current state of technology. Lidar currently has major problems in bad weather. Fog, rain, cloud, airborne dust or even just a day with high humidity shorten its range and the range isn\u2019t impressive to begin with. Lidar is currently best suited to applications that need a range of less than a mile or two OR low detail applications like ground mapping. Since the human eye can see fighter planes further away than two miles on a moonlit night it isn\u2019t currently useful to overcome stealth. Lidar systems currently either give very high detail at short range or very low detail at longer ranges. Low frequency ground radars coupled to a data-linking system to pass information on to a fighter or missile is a far better option, though it would take years to develop such a system. Low frequency radars usually only give very rough images with imprecise positioning of a target, but using modern AESA techniques combined with low frequencies could give a much better solution. Stealth is a temporary advantage because of this, though it will still have applications for some time to come. In future I believe stealth combined with jamming will be needed as stealth alone will not suffice once low frequency AESA radars are coupled with robust datalinks to fighter aircraft and SAMs. ",

Too much attenuation, too much scattering from atmospheric crud \u2014 which is always present, too many clouds, no wide-area search capability (if you know where it is so that you can hit it with a laser, you don\u2019t need the laser). More nopes, but what is the point \u2014 it\u2019s nope. ",
