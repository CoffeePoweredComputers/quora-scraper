            "answer_text": "Of course. For over 6 million years more people were born than survived to adulthood and reproduced. That is the essential condition for natural selection. We can see in the fossil record the gradual changing of traits for adaptations: for bipedalism, teeth for a changing diet, hands for finer manipulation of objects, etc. Natural selection at work. Within the past 1,000 years or so, we have a situation where technology is providing resources (food, shelter, etc) so that \u2014 especially in the First World \u2014 nearly every person born survives to adulthood and has children. This means that technology has removed many of the selection pressures. For humans, most of the selection happened in infancy. Humans have had a very high infant mortality rate. Microbes, lack of food, lack of warmth, etc. all work to kill infants. Human technology has improved that, at least in the West. However, go to the Sudan or Syria or Bangladesh or other places in the world that have an absence of technology and modern medical care, and lack of birth control, and natural selection is still active. Infant mortality is high. People starve. People succumb to HIV/AIDS. All these are natural selection at work. More babies are born today than survive to reach adulthood. Infants with modifications that allow them to resist microbes, survive on less food, survive when cold, etc. are going to live while their unfortunate siblings die. ",

            "answer_text": "This term, natural selection, refers to the phenomenon where the individuals with the best survivor skills tend to survive best, and so, after a period of time, you find the descendants of this group doing a bit better than others in terms of survival. Mind you, we are talking about solid characteristics which are passed to all descendants, not something that just pops up every so often. The differences we are talking about are generally not apparent to the observer, but only express themselves after many generations to the extent that you can actually discern a significant difference. The process of natural selection is an ongoing one. It tends to reduce those traits which do not survive quite so well. However, if all individuals are pretty much the same, then there will not be any changes; all descendants would tend to procreate at the same rate, and survive at the same rate. If you think of natural selection as the process of slowly eliminating those traits that compete less effectively, then you could say that natural selection is not going on with human beings today. The reason I would say this is that due to our social constraints and our medical knowledge, we have short-circuited the process whereby individuals get culled from the herd. Everyone who possibly can survive is generally accorded the opportunity to survive. Thus, there are no real significant differences from generation to generation, and hence no process of natural selection. If you say that natural selection is that process whereby individuals compete against one another, then you can say that natural selection still in going on, even though no differences are registering and no changes are resulting. The process is still operating just as much today as it ever did. Natural selection is not contingent upon any theory of evolution or whatever; it is the simple fact that if one individual is less capable of competing than another, then over time, the descendants of that strain will be less likely to procreate, and after a time they will vanish. The actual evolutionary process appears to be much more complex, however, since it\u2019s not a live or die scenario, but that one strain does better than another. This can easily result in a split between two types. One environment slightly favors one while another environment subtly favors the other. Eventually, you see two different species in those two environments. Humans are arguably not evolving right now, since there is no culling of the individuals who compete less effectively. However, evolution is a process that takes place over millions of years, so the time humankind has been discussing this matter is a tiny droplet in the bucket of time. ",
