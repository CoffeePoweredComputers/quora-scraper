Take a look at the Samsung Galaxy S6 phone (16 MP ) compared to the Nikon D750 (24 MP) full frame camera. At this size, the differences are hardly noticeable. Samsung on the left. ISO 100.  Even at ISO 800, the phone holds up quite well at this resolution.  A closer look and the differences are very apparent. The small phone sensor just can\u2019t compete (and we wouldn\u2019t expect it to). ISO 800    ISO 100  Man this phone seems to be doing an awesome job. Pretty crazy when you consider the difference in sensor size. Samsung in green. Nikon in blue.  Pixel size comparison: Samsung: 1.12 \u00b5m | Nikon 5.9\u00b5m Don\u2019t forget that this comparison was done under ideal conditions, in decent light, on a still subject, in a controlled environment. I\u2019m certainly not going to use my iPhone for any serious work, but I have no doubt that one can take great photos with a phone camera. . Test images: Digital Cameras, Digital Camera Reviews . ",

But we can also see that smartphone results are much less consistent, and therefore it isn't possible right now to trust our smartphones to always provide a quality image. Smartphones will never supersede cameras, but they'll remain powerful tools that you can carry in your pocket at all times, to use as a compact option that compliments the quality and control offered by your DSLR or mirrorless camera. While DSLRs seem to be losing ground to mirrorless cameras as the years go on, they are still the go-to tools of many photographers because they are often the best for the job. The recent spate of announcements from Nikon and Canon make it clear: It's probably the best time ever to buy a DSLR. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Photography material there... ",

I can\u2019t go into the details of what DSLR can do on top of what phone camera can do, this would require a comprehensive photography course, but trust me when I say that whilst phone cameras can be really great you won\u2019t see proper journalist taking pictures of the president with their phones or someone serious about a safari in Africa going with just their iPhone.
