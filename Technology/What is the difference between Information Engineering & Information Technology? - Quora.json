            "answer_text": "A lot of people might confuse Information Technology (IT) and Information Engineering (IE), however, they are very different to each other. Information Engineering Some of the world leading universities offering degrees and conducting research in IE are the following: MEng Electronic and Information Engineering - Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London Information Engineering - Department of Engineering Sciences, University of Oxford Information Engineering - Department of Engineering , University of Cambridge Also, some departments in Asia and South Africa are named after IE: Department of Electronic and Information Engineering - The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Department of Information Engineering - The Chinese University of Hong Kong Information Engineering - Wits University So, IE can be defined according to what it is included in it: Robotics, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, Machine LearningSpeech and Signal Processing, Communications, Information TheoryControl Engineering, Control TheorySometimes, the term \u2018Information Engineering\u2019 can be used in UK universities instead of the term \u2018Computer Engineering\u2019 usually used in US universities. The reason is that in some British universities they might that have two distinct departments, i.e. Engineering and Computer Science (CS), so, due to politics the CS department might be restricting any use of world \u2018computer\u2019 in degrees and divisions of the Engineering department. Moreover, please note that in UK, the term \u2018Engineer\u2019 might have two meanings. Apart from the usual one, it can also be used to mean a \u2018Technician\u2019 or \u2018Mechanic\u2019 (or other tradespeople), so someone who fixes your toilet or car, for example. For more info, check Engineer - Wikipedia. The term \u2018Engineering\u2019 might also be used incorrectly for other meanings too. So, IE is an academic discipline closely related to specific topics in Electronic Engineering and Computer Science. If you are checking a particular university course, you should better check their programme of study (i.e. list of modules). Also, the reputation of the university (in your country of future employment) always matters. The usual career path of someone with a degree in Information Engineering is highly unlikely to be in the IT sector, but in sectors that other Scientists and Engineers usually follow, such as Research and Development (R&D), Secondary and Higher Education, Consulting, Software Engineering, Hardware Engineering, etc. Information Technology IT might have several meanings. Usually, when someone refers to the IT department, he usually refers to the people responsible mainly for infrastructure and they are vital to the success of a business or organization. Typical job responsibilities include: Install and maintain computer network systemsEnable network back up quickly or allow it to switch over to an alternate system during network contingenciesFacilitate communication through phones calls, video, phone or web conference calls, network drives, email, secure servers, etcProvide technical support, including installing new software or hardware, repairing hardware that has become faulty, troubleshooting problems with the system or with an individual's computer, etc.The whole IT department reports to the Chief Information Officer (CIO)Typical names of IT stuff include: ICT Support Technician, IT Technician, Help Desk Officer, PC Support, Technical Support, Network Support TechnicianThe level of academic qualifications of the IT stuff can vary from just secondary education (e.g. high school) to PhD in High Performance Computing, for example. It really depends on the duty of each role and the needs of the organization. Usually, those with roles such as Software Engineers or Software Developers would have different qualifications than that of IT stuff and will be based at either the Research and Development (R&D) department or the Technology department and not the IT department. So they will report to the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). The role of the Technology department is different than that of the IT, though both departments are very important, but for different reasons. Also, nowadays almost all of the employees in a modern company will be working in front of a computer, so the use of computer cannot imply what is their department. However, if their phone, computer software or hardware is broken, then they usually call the IT, not the Technology department. IT might also have other meanings in different contexts, however, the above meaning is the prevalent one. ",
