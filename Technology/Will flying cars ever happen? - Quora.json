            "answer_text": "For flying cars to be possible, you have to solve the following problems: Air traffic control. It\u2019s bad enough with just relatively few aircraft, can you imagine if everyone had a flying machine? You\u2019d need an ATC system that\u2019s completely automated and run exclusively by computers (not humans) to handle it, which leads me onto my next point -Driving licenses. The standards of a pilot license are much, much higher than for a driving license. Many car drivers barely know how an engine works, whereas a pilot is examined on most of the technical aspects of aircraft before they ever get to fly one. Therefore, the majority of people, while they are adequate drivers, would be poor pilots. You would need to have the car be self-flying (again, more fully computerised systems) for it to be accessible to the average driver. Your average driver is not going to enjoy sitting for dozens of exams and having to pass a more stringent medical every few years to get their pilot\u2019s license. Once you have self-driving/flying cars, you just need to solve problem #3:Equipment. Again, the standards for cars are much more relaxed than they are for aircraft, because naturally if something fails on your car you can usually escape with minimal injuries, but on an aircraft even something as minor as a shorted electrical connector can turn into an emergency. That\u2019s why, on commercial aircraft, maintenance has to be done by qualified staff at tightly-regulated facilities with impeccable documentation. For small aircraft, under certain conditions, it is possible for the owner/pilot to do some of the work himself, but remember this is someone who passed his pilot\u2019s license and thus has a certain level of technical know-how and, hopefully, the right attitude of not taking-on tasks that are beyond their capability. Now, imagine you have a flying car in the hands of an average driver. What\u2019s to stop them from making a modification on their car that causes it to fall out of the sky? Even with regular cars, where we have all sorts of rules, like exhaust loudness limits, and emissions controls, and speed limiters, people still break the law every day. Having a flying car just compounds the problem. Adding a roof rack to a normal car just adds a bit of drag; doing the same on a flying car could change the aerodynamics enough to make it dangerous. Putting a big weight in the boot of a normal car is no big deal (at worst the suspension might bottom-out). Doing the same in a flying car might move the center of gravity so far backwards that it becomes impossible to recover from a stall, causing it to plummet to the ground. So flying cars would need security measures to keep them from being tampered with, and systems to detect such tampering and refuse to fly until it\u2019s been rectified. You also need foolproofing to counteract situations like the overloading-the-boot one I just mentioned. Problem is, no matter how good your foolproofing system gets, they always build a better fool! ;)So perhaps in light of this, flying cars would best be implemented as \u201cflying taxis\u201d, where you don\u2019t own or drive them, but rather call them using an app like you do with uber, and ride them to your destination. That way, the company operating the cars would take care of all the maintenance and other tricky issues, and the high cost of buying one is borne by them (and reflected in a slightly higher ticket price), rather than you having to cough up several tens of thousands of extra dollars over the cost of a regular one to buy one.

            "answer_text": "There are several of them now and have been for decades. The main problems aren\u2019t technological, as you might think, but rather human-based. The most promising flying cars now are more like roadable airplanes and they don\u2019t do particularly well in traffic and don\u2019t hover.   Others kind of give up on the whole wheeled vehicle thing and try to be the equivalent of an automobile but only useful in the air.   So there\u2019s a lot of experimentation going on and we have several kinds of flying cars right now. But there are reasons we don\u2019t see them anywhere, even though people have been dreaming about them for 100 years. Some of the reasons can be addressed but others can\u2019t. Lifting something into the air takes enormous amounts of energy, especially if it has no wings and is expected to hover. This would make a flying car fantastically expensive to operate. Making them lighter would help.A flying vehicle is complex to operate and poses many safety risks. People need many hours of special training to do it and there are only a few places where they\u2019re allowed to land and take off, so they\u2019re not convenient to use. Software might help with this and basically fly the thing for you and allow it to land on skyscraper rooftops like a helicopter.The last issue can\u2019t be resolved. A flying car is as LOUD AS HELL. The noise, dust, wind and spectacle will make them unwelcome in any neighborhood or urban area. No one will want a flying car anywhere near them, unless they are in it. No cities would ever approve them for use in residential areas. No one ever thinks about this, but they will when they are near one landing or taking off.The most promising design, I think, is something like this, a flying jitney (minibus) that would be used able to land and take off in far more places than an airplane. A dozen people or so would crowd into it and it could go from skyscraper to skyscraper in or between crowded cities, quickly picking up and dropping off passengers. Many paying passengers could offset the cost and no one lives on skyscraper roofs anyway, so it wouldn\u2019t bother people. Software could safely operate it.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but... 1) They will be really expensive - over $300,000 in 2015 US Dollars, maybe $800,000. 2) You will probably need to have a private pilot's license and more than 200 hours before the you can buy one.  There will be extensive type training, almost as much as float plane / sea plane training.  The manufacturers will not want the aircraft to get a bad reputation by selling to low-time or risky pilots.  I would not be surprised if the manufacturer requires 500 hours and an instrument rating. 3) There will be restrictions on where they can be used.  While places like Alaska and very rural parts of Western States like Nevada, Utah, Idaho, etc.Will be favorable, and MIGHT even allow take off from selected rural roads, the rest of the nation will be much more restrictive.Some of those states did have provisions for some people to land and take off from public roads years ago. See Steve's answer here : Steve Blumenkranz's answer to Will flying cars ever happen?They aren't going to flying in Connecticut, but no one will care much if youcrash in some potato field in Idaho. 4) It is very likely that \"flying cars\" / \"roadable aircraft\" will not be able to handle adverse weather as well as conventional aircraft.   So this will limit where and when these vehicles can be used.  Late afternoon turbulence may mean no flying.  Same with snow or icing conditions. 5)  The range and speed will tend to be limited, compared to conventional aircraft.  A Cessna 172 will do 140 mph and 600+ miles. Expect something like 110-125 mph and as little as 250 -300 miles, while using more fuel. 6)  The NHTSA has been exempting \"flying cars\" / \"roadable aircraft\" from the crash safety regulations, to help keep the weight down. 7)  And no, there won't be an automated self-flying car for a long time, maybe around 40 years.  And there will still need to be a competent pilot in command. Terrafugia Transition ",

            "answer_text": "Flying cars suffer from multiple problems that no one has yet solved. 1 Need a pilot\u2019s license. Going rate is typically $10,000. And that only covers flying single engine aircraft in good weather. Add Instrument rating (bad weather) and the cost goes to like $20,000. People seem to think that you buy a flying car, and anyone with a drivers license can fly it. Nope. Not gonna happen. 2 Weight. Aircraft MUST be light to fly. Cars need to be strong to pass mandatory crash tests. Those requirements are contradictory. A Cessna 172, about the smallest 4-passenger aircraft, weighs 1,691 pounds empty. By comparison, a Toyota Corolla, a small 4-passenger car, weighs 2,870 pounds. And the Corolla has no wings, no rudder, no horizontal stabilizer, etc. 3 If you think auto insurance is expensive now, wait until a flying car is made and the first one gets into a fender bender. Since ONLY FAA certified mechanics are allowed to work on aircraft, the price of a \u2018fender bender\u2019 will be HUGE, think 4-8 TIMES the current rate. What will that do to the cost of insurance, for everyone! 4 Confusion. Two complete sets of controls, gauges, dials, indicators, etc. are needed. In addition, all the exterior aircraft lights must be there, as well as the auto exterior lights. More complications and more weight. Note that LCD panels help here for instrument panels. 5 Costs. Even inexpensive aircraft are expensive, and trying to make one that will be both a car AND a aircraft will require fancy, expensive materials, like carbon fiber, to help make #2 above work. In essence, it would cost more than Rolls-Royce. Can YOU afford a brand new Rolls-Royce? If not, then you cannot afford a flying car. 6 More costs. All maintenance, beyond an oil change or changing a light bulb, must, by law, be performed by an FAA licensed mechanic. Parts must come from FAA certified vendors. All this add up to higher and higher costs, many times the cost of auto maintenance. And in an aircraft, it must be done, by law, and the aircraft must be inspected, by law, including detailed paperwork, annually. 7. Airports. Unless the flying car is a helicopter, it needs runways at both ends of the flight. That takes space, which is costly, meaning landing fees will be high. Do YOU own a house on a runway? If not, where are you going to take off? And airports charge for every landing you make-it\u2019s their prime source of income. Think of paying a tax every time you drive. 8. Air traffic control. ATC is difficult now, then think about adding hundreds of small aircraft to the mix, all wanting to go to just a few destinations. Nightmare-collisions all over the skies! There is a simple solution. 1 Drive in your car to the airport. 2 Get in you existing aircraft, and fly to your destination 3 After landing, rent a car. Which sounds cheaper and easier? ",

            "answer_text": "In engineering terms a lot of things are possible. However, to make a flying car will involve the mixing of two differing technological requirements. The legal and necessary requirements for road vehicles involve crash resistance in various types if impact scenarios. The current ones in most countries mean that the structure needed is very robust and hence quite heavy. A flight vehicle must be light and well-powered in order to get off the ground. These are really quite conflicting, so a flying car will be the worst of both technologies, inefficient and expensive to operate. That is without the requirements for the pilot training of the \u2018drivers\u2019 who will need pilot\u2019s licences with night and instrument ratings. The flight vehicles will be subject to maintenance and inspections as for all light aeroplanes and there is no way such inspection regimes will be reduced as the safety of those not only in the air, but on the ground will need to be considered. Then there is the market price of the product to be considered. The sales volumes would be low in view of the requirements and the purchase price would be astronomical compared to a top-end luxury car. How convenient would it then be to use a \u2018flying car\u2019. It would be noisy to take off and land, so it would need to be flown from airfields or approved sites only. For journeys in or near controlled airspace a flight plane would need to be filed for each flying journey. That is not very convenient. The ability of the pilots of these vehicles to safely navigate the skies, even with a high degree of computer control is also a factor. There would be accidents and crashes from the flight element of journeys and restrictions would be demanded by citizens after a few fatal crashes. So yes, it is possible in time, but not particularly feasible or practical. Such flight vehicles would be for the very few rich people who could afford the huge purchase, maintenance and inspection requirements. The move to cleaner, quieter and more fuel efficient will reduce the practicality of \u2018flying cars\u2019 still further. ",

            "answer_text": "Self-flying human carrying drones are coming to urban areas with pay-per-use trip costs lower than ground vehicles but reduced cargo capacity. Uber Elevate should be one service operating them. We\u2019re already moving to non personally owned vehicles because parking is too expensive and time consuming in large cities. While those currently use human drivers, they\u2019ll be automated as soon as technology allows because people are the most expensive part of services like Uber and Lyft. Self-flying vehicles are also coming because Ground traffic is already too congested.City planners are adding office space for thousands more people (like the 1070 foot Salesforce Tower in San Francisco with room for 7000+) without improving surface transportation capacity.Hundreds of thousands of dollars in capital costs are affordable when amortized over years of many users\u2019 trips, not the twice-daily commutes plus errands of today\u2019s personally owned cars costing tens of thousands.Trip costs will eventually beat ground vehicles because quantities of scale will bring down production costs and without waiting in traffic, flying vehicles will have a higher trip per hour rate. Uber published a white paper producing the same conclusion 18 months ago in October, 2016: https://www.uber.com/elevate.pdf Our analysis shows that in the long-term autonomous case, direct costs per vehicle mile will approach 50 cents per mile (equivalent to 35 cents per ground mile). We can expect that the price for a 45-mile pool VTOL, which would replace a 60-mile automobile trip, could approach as low as $21 for the 15 minute journey. I expect the first passenger operations before we have fully autonomous ground vehicles because fewer surprises are possible in open air than on the roads. Prototypes are already making manned flights  although I expect we\u2019ll use vehicles like the tilt-wing A-cubed Vahana for acceptable efficiency and battery life. They\u2019re aiming to start sales in 2020.

            "answer_text": "The type of flying car that exists today are planes that can be folded in ways that allow them to drive on roads. They are very expensive, inefficient, and they aren\u2019t very good at being either planes or cars.   If you are talking about \u201cblade runner\u201d style flying cars, then we have several problems to work out before they can be practical. We need a massive upgrade in energy storage or propulsion technology. You need to have a significant range flying a vehicle that doesn\u2019t generate much lift with the body. That takes a lot of power. Which means a lot of electric charge or fuel. You don\u2019t want to run out of juice with this one.We need a massive upgrade with vehicle control systems. Right now, it\u2019s difficult to learn how to pilot an aircraft, and that\u2019s in a much emptier sky. Learning how to pilot in a city with buildings and other flying cars around is going to be incredibly difficult. I don\u2019t expect that these will be automated systems for the most part.We need a massive upgrade in airspace control systems. When flying cars start becoming commonplace then there is going to need to be ways to ensure that they don\u2019t become a threat to each other. Our current systems are not designed for urban environments and many small vehicles.We need a massive upgrade in terms of reliability. Aircraft require significant maintenance. This is because when there\u2019s a problem, you can\u2019t just pull to the side of the road. You risk falling out of the sky. This is a much more serious problem with non-lift bodies. A Cessna can glide without power. These designs cannot.Once we\u2019ve solved these four huge technical issues, then we need to work on the regulatory issues to create a legal framework for these new vehicles.With all of these problems, it puts practical flying cars beyond the predictable future.

            "answer_text": "Some such vehicles are available now. To a degree, the long, long effort at flying cars is a waste of time because to be a good car, it wouldn\u2019t be a good aircraft and to be a good aircraft, it wouldn\u2019t be a good car. With the heavy development of drones with four or more propellers, is there hope for an electric drone/car? What would you do with the propellers between flights? With fixed wing, you have the problem of the engine and those long wings, which make for a very awkward car. More than likely, sometime in the next 10 to 50 years (probably sooner than later), you will be able to hop in an electric quadcopter and go on short trips without a pilot. I say this because a quadcopter is much less complicated, in the flying portion, than a traditional helicopter because it doesn\u2019t need the highly complex gearing system necessary for helicopters. Quad drones literally fly themselves right now, the pilot on the ground simply directs them. I have a preliminary design for something I am calling an \u201cair car\u201d which would be a partially flying, guided system above the ground with no engine. No engine. There is no prototype at present and, frankly, I am not sure if my design will work, but that is what R&D is for, isn\u2019t it? If it works, it would take you 200 to 300 miles in an hour to an hour and a half. The goal is to have a functional system by 2019 or, at the very minimum, a large scale, operating model. We need to explore all kinds of new alternatives. Railroads are essentially 19th century technology and mag-lev trains have proven very expensive, to say the least. With the need for long runways, aircraft become self defeating landing outside cities when the distance is less than 300 or 400 miles. (I can drive from my house in Maryland to the airport in Newark, just outside NYC, in about the same time span as flying, three hours, taking into account clearing security, the plane taxing and then meeting up with some sort of local transportation once there. In fact, if you bother to get a rental car, the total trip time would like be an hour longer than driving.) I am not a believer in the hyperloop hype. For one thing, it is another system that would be damned expensive to build. We need simpler, faster and overall better. ",

From the Federal Aviation Administrations\u2019 (FAA) viewpoint \u201cFlying Cars\u201d will undoubtedly be essentially treated as airplanes that can also drive on the road. The only thing that will likely govern the widespread adoption of flying cars is that: A Flying Car \u201cDriver\u201d will have to have a Pilots License, periodic medical examination, periodic flight reviews, etc. when the vehicle is operated in the Federal Airspace System. In other words, the \u201cpilot\u201d will have to operate under he same regulations and costs as \u201cnormal\u201d pilots.When operating as an aircraft, it will be subject to the same airspace regulations that aircraft are. Which means that there are some places \u2014 notably congested airspace like Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, etc. \u2014 that will require specific approval to fly within. That approval isn\u2019t guaranteed.When transitioning from Flying Car to Airplane and visa versa, the vehicle will have to operate from an existing (or yet to be created) \u201cAirport.\u201dThe \u201cFlying Car\u201d will be treated as an airplane and as such will be subject to very thorough \u201cAnnual Inspections\u201d as well as at least a couple of other inspections.The acquisition costs of both the vehicle, pilots license, etc as outlined above will undoubtedly be the key criteria that governs how widespread the adoption of \u201cFlying Cars\u201d will be.Here is some additional information on the potential adoption of Flying Cars: Joe Shelton's answer to Will flying cars on Earth ever make sense?

From aggregator behemoth Uber and Aircraft Giant Airbus to startups like Aeromobil, Terrafugia, Ehang, kitty Hawk and a dozen others, all are hustling hard to make this science fiction dream a reality. Just a few months ago, we saw the Lilium jet, what I think is the most feasible design of Flying cars that the world has seen for a while, which the company affirmed with a successful test flight later.  There are hurdles, obviously. Aside from all the development ones, there are questions of safety both of passengers and pedestrians, the Noise factor (From the propulsion and wind force) and a long list of other thresholds that flying cars need to overcome to get anywhere close to see a mass adoption. Much of the development depends on the advancement in batteries which is happening at a slow and steady rate. Even after our Flying car has cleared all its hurdles, it has to go one on one with the elephant in the room which is the Regulations. However, it is clear that the Flywheel has began to turn. The next couple of years is where the momentum starts to compound with friction points to hinder the progress. We need to remember that whenever there has been sufficient desire from the consumer side, there always have been enough smart engineers working to realize the technology, no matter how far-fetched it initially sounds. As more and more companies join the bandwagon and more investment goes in, the dream of flying a car will inevitably be realized.

            "answer_text": "Doubt it. There\u2019s four major obstacles. One\u2019s engineering. Either you are making a car or an aircraft. If you\u2019re making an aircraft you need a bigger, fatter engine in there and lots of aerofoils and some means of controlling them. If you\u2019re making a car you need a smaller engine and means of steering and control, as well as a gearbox and all the other paraphernalia. Where are you going to put it all and what will it weigh? Two is where you\u2019re going to drive/take off/land. You could conceivably put it on a road with wings folded but you\u2019d have a huge protuberance sticking up that may contravene height regulations and cause an enormous drag, and in high winds you\u2019d be blowing over. You can\u2019t get up to take-off speed on a normal road and as soon as you land you\u2019ll be breaking the speed limit. Your local constabulary will be on your case constantly. Three is legal. Are you a driver or a pilot? Will you have to take both tests? What will your insurance be? Will you have to file a flight plan before you take to the skies? How will it be controlled whilst you\u2019re in flight? Will you have to have take-off and landing permissions? What airspace can and cannot you use? Four is commercial. What will it cost in R&D and manufacturing and can the money be recouped with profit? How will we service them? Is there a big enough demand, and given the legal above, can the demand be reduced by restriction on persons qualified or suitability of intended location of use? It\u2019s likely that these problems, especially the second, are going to be insurmountable. I doubt we\u2019ll ever see a car made by a major manufacturer that can act as an aircraft or vice-versa, at least not as anything other than a concept. ",

But I wondered, because the Terrafugia Transition had to get waivers from the FAA in order to meet all of the NHTSA requirements as a car. So, I did what any aerospace engineer would do, and I contacted the NHTSA and a very nice agent called me and we had a long discussion. Take a look at the Dutch PAL V. It only has three-wheels\u2026\u2026. Therefore it is Not a car, but a Motorcycle. And as we all know, motorcycles in the USA do Not have seat belts nor air bags nor crash resistant bumpers, etc. Therefore, the PAL-V could meet the regulations as a motorcycle (you will need a motorcycle addition on your drivers license in most US states) and still remain below the weight limits for a FAA Light Sport Aircraft. Whereas the Transition, as a four wheel Car, had to meet the plethora of NHTSA regulations for safety which drove up the basic weight and therefore the FAA had to issue a waiver to allow the additional weight and the higher minimum landing speed and still be classified as a light sport aircraft. Neither will be inexpensive. Are they practical\u2026.. The owner will be the judge of that. There are sufficient numbers of people who will spend upwards of $300,000 or more to have one. Enjoy your flight and occasional drive. And may you Not get hit by a car or a grocery cart while parked in a parking lot\u2026.. ",

Drunk, driving is bad enough now... add flying cars to the mix, and you WILL have \"drunk flying\" in addition... and hitting the ground from any reasonable altitude is not a pleasant experience. Additionally, the skies are already filled with commercial jets, military aviation, pleasure flying with small planes, not to mention birds, and potentially, someday, airships. With all this, adding thousands of flying cars to the mix would create massive problems in control and collison avoidence. Imagine... if you will, a driver with his flying car accidentally hitting a large commercial jet, causing it to crash, killing hundreds of people, probably including himself! Flying cars have been a staple of science fiction stories for decades... but when you consider the many problems that would arise if you actually had such vehicles... it is quite clear that such an idea is really not a practical one... and should be left to science fiction novels and movies... where they can't hurt anyone. After all, if flying cars were really that good of an idea... they would have been in common use already! ",

            "answer_text": "There are a couple flying prototypes and even commercially available models, Terrafugia, Welcome | Terrafugia has an option to reserve their initial model.  Like a lot of transitional products, it's going to take a while before we get the one that's both a good airplane and a good car.  The swimming car wasn't a very good car or a very good boat.  There are other products like that, I'm sure we could name dozens.   There is already a \"road\" system in the air, they're called \"routes\" and these would have to be expanded and there would have to be more control agencies to keep it safe.  Right now those routes are determined by altitude and headings and navigation points and the use of spacing.  \"See and avoid\" works pretty well when you have a \"big sky\" and \"little airplane\" but as you put more vehicles in the sky, the sky gets smaller and if you go above 10,000 you need oxygen and/or a pressurized cabin.  No brakes (not really), no stop signs and a fender bender is a really big deal up in the sky.   It'll happen and hopefully with some of the modern and evolving technology like Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) which will keep getting more sophisticated, it'll happen safely. ",

            "answer_text": "I am an aerospace engineer. I have in the past worked on both AWACS and UK ATC in fact they share the same core systems. Whilst the engineering and tech is getting better and better and at some point its going g to be a reality to be able to make there are massive practical issues that people ignore. Take off and landing needs space even for a fan lift and it has to accentuate and accelerate into ground and air traffic. Thus the idea of just driving in normal traffic a d taking off does not work. And that ignores things things like bridges buildings and people. That means you need some form of dedicated take off and landing areas. That means a very distinctive mode and use. It's a car that can be driven to a landing and take off point ONLY ! Next you have regulation. To fly your have to have a type approval for the plane just like you do in fact for a car. Flying say even in helicopters is complex and highly regulated even if you ignore pilot training! Then yes there is pilot training and pilot medical requitenents all of which are regulated. And now there is cost and efficency. Most helicoptets use gas turbines as they are light and powerful. These cost a lot of money and ise a lot of fuel. And electrical alternative has yet to he deveopted as the energy density of battries is no way nealy as good as cars. My guess on current battery te\u00e7h is that any flyobg car will be a fanlift hybrid I would also say that it would be height and speed restricted and would be limited in flight duration. ",

            "answer_text": "I doubt it. There have been any number of attempts dating back longer than I have been alive. I recall being aware, in the early 1960s, of failed attempts dating from the 1950s. Just the other day a friend posted a video to Facebook of a report by a major news organization announcing the availability of the \u201cfirst commercially available flying car\u201d and that it was being shown at the Geneva Auto Show. The catch is that I have seen the same sort of announcement probably six times\u2026at least once for every decade I have been alive. Every last one of them has been a technical or commercial failure\u2026or both. This latest one is basically a gyrocopter with folding rotor blades and mast. It\u2019s a two seat, three wheel vehicle that sells for $599,000 and, being a gyrocopter, it\u2019s not going to be fast.  I will admit, it looks like a pretty cool machine but, for that amount of money I could buy a car and an airplane, both of which would perform better in the separate roles than this compromise vehicle, and I would have money left over. Because of how it works you\u2019ll still need a pilot\u2019s licence and you\u2019ll have to operate it from an airport. It\u2019s hard to say, just looking at photos, but I do wonder how well it meets modern crash standards for cars. The fundamental problem is that the term \u201cflying car\u201d is misleading. It\u2019s a great name, in terms of marketing, but the reality is that every one of these projects is really an aircraft you can drive on the road, and that involves so many compromises that it\u2019s not worth doing. Perhaps some day, but not yet. ",

There are already some flying cars that look like foldable planes in a sense but they cost too much. What you are asking for is the \u201cModel T\u201d of flying cars and because roads are not meant for causal landing strips and many people out there would want to use one as a daily driver if no landing strip, it seems to be a niche still that would only benefit people who are taking trips or assuming you stick to landing at airports when flying and landing/taking off. There would probably be strict rules and regulations for a mass market product for flying and landing. I doubt the wings with the car fit in a lane folded out. Right now there isn\u2019t any regulations specifically for them because they are fancy toys for the rich and few and far seen in existence. I doubt anyone would want one for a daily driver if they weren\u2019t able to fly it daily in their circumstances and if they can\u2019t fly it they might as well drive a more comfortable normal vehicle.

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a lot of talk about flying cars. Many refer to self-driving flying cars, so as to remove the dangers of the human factor so brilliantly summarized by Jacque Scott in his answer. I want to add a few more things. A \u201cflying vehicle\u201d is a very different thing from a car. First of all lightness is paramount. So much that a flying vehicle is an exxtremely delicate thing. If you punch strong enough the sheet metal of the wing of a little airplane, your fist will go right through it. You may have noticed that above the wings of jet liners, there are areas marked with thick lines and the words: \u201cdon\u2019t step beyond this line\u201d this means that even the largest, sturdiest airplanes are built so lightly that in some parts they will not stand the weight of a person standing. For the same reasons, flying vehicles can\u2019t have bumpers, rubber door protections or anti-crash cages. Not only they will never pass any crash test, but a person that cannot park properly may damage your flying vehicle so much that it won\u2019t be able to fly. Secondly, flying requires that the vehicle is supported by something that generates lift. Either a wing, which requires a continuous, substantial airspeed, or a rotor. Both require mechanical energy. The rotor requires A LOT OF mechanical energy. Mechanical energy is generated by a motor. The motor requires some kind of energy that comes from a fuel or from batteries. Stop producing energy and the flying machine will fall to the ground, while your ordinary car will simply stop at the shoulder. This means two things: the first is that your motor can\u2019t fail and you can\u2019t run out of fuel. The second is that it will consume a lot more energy than a car, whose weight is simply supported by a solid surface. And since weight is paramount (see point #1) you will have to choose between range and payload. Sorry mother-in-law, you will travel without luggage or we won\u2019t be able to load enough fuel to reach destination. Third: talks have it that flying cars will free us from congestion, because we will be able to occupy a three-dimensional space, instead of two dimensional roads. But sooner or later all flying vehicles will need to get back to the two-dimensional ground below them, possibly at designated points of landing. This means that a good share of this ideal three-dimensional space will be occupied by descent and ascend corridors. Moreover, the distance between one flying vehicle and the next, in the direction of travel, but also sideways, above and under,will be much greater than the diastance between cars on a road. So the density of vehicles will be extremely low, mimimizing the advantage of having a multi-layered three-dimensional space where to travel. ",

As you can see from you tube , they ARE a reality, but not in the way you are asking, like the Jettsons. One of the big problems , people most people are not prepared to become pilots but , autonomous vehicles and the traffic handled by computers, mean maybe. I think it is sad and scary we as people need computers to do it but , yes that starts to make it more possible . Inherently though, a dirt bike , is not a road bike, and the compromise means it is not as good at either perhaps. So a car being heavier can be good, to handle the road, to have bigger brakes, better shocks, but an airplane needs to be lighter these are going in the opposite direction. The issue of traffic with cars now, should make you very afraid, what that would be like with flying cars. I fly a little airplane in the San Francisco area, and LA airplane traffic is worse but if there was lots more, like flying cars, that seems very difficult , scary , unpleasant so i am not sure i would wish for that future.

Drastic repair for aircraft. Operating an airplane takes a lot of skill. Especially if you want to operate it as transportation. This requires the ability to operate in all weather. This implies the need for an instrument rating, and an aircraft that can be flown into known icing conditions. FIKI. When you start thinking about these things, you are starting to rule out some large percentage of pilots, some large percentage of airframes. A flying car is likely both a bad car and a bad airplane. I own both a car and and an airplane, got a lot of hours in both. They are two very different machines, each one is highly optimized. Compromise? Leads to bad performance. ",

It takes enormous amounts of energy to suspend a given weight in the air without airflow over a fixed wing. Even if you had enough power the noise and violence of propellers beating the air would make them a bad neighbor. So maybe use a runway? There goes most of the advantage of a flying car , you are tethered to airports. Now when you land that car and drive it you subject it to all kinds of road stress airplanes are not designed for. To make it more robust requires more weight to what already by necessity is a very limited payload. Add to that FAA\u2019s stringent maintenance requirements for aircraft and I just don\u2019t see it holding up. Compared to a car most personal aircraft are subject to a fraction of the wear and tear a car is and airplanes are relatively fragile compared to cars. Even if you could pull it off the liability of a few accidents spread over what would almost certainly be a limited market would make it financially unfeasible not to mention the certainly exorbitant cost of the machine its self.

A flying car would need fairly large wings - where would they be stored while in ground mode? Most automobiles move by a relatively efficient means - the friction of the wheels against the surface - compact, safe, efficient. Retaining this capability would require an elaborate power transmission system - propeller or jet in flight, tires on the ground - or single power supply that is compatible in the air, and moving enough air to propel an automobile would endanger pedestrians and other traffic. A possible compromise could be a hovercraft, but hovercraft do generate considerable air disturbances around them as well. Usually multiple role vehicles like an amphibian or flying car can\u2019t do either as efficiently or comfortably as a dedicated-purpose design. A flying car could be a fun novelty toy for someone who could afford it, but I doubt the market would make such a product viable to the public. ",

By definition, a flying car operates in 3 dimensions as opposed to the road vehicle which operates in only 2. When you see the lack of road discipline as exercised by drivers in cars operating in only 2 dimensions, can you imagine how it would be, were they to be allowed to have the freedom of 3 dimensions? Would you want also to be in a commercial aeroplane on short finals into Chicago O\u2019Hare or London Heathrow with cars popping up into your glideslope from the freeway just short of the runway threshold? For the foreseeable future, I can tell you that to be able to operate a flying car is nothing more than just a pipedream. The CAA, The FAA and their equivalents around the world would regulate these things right back into the ground. Have no doubt about that. ",

The problem is, they cost as much as houses, and are decidedly unsexy, regardless of whether you\u2019re looking at them as a car or as a plane. Oh, and, you\u2019ll need a pilot\u2019s license (roughly $10,000 in training) as well as a driver\u2019s license. Here\u2019s the Terrafugia Transition; they\u2019re accepting $10k deposits to reserve a copy\u2014if it ever sees production. It\u2019s reasonable to expect the final price to be in the mid-six-figures.  A little more down to earth would be the I-Tec Maverick:  Expect to bring $94,000 and a powered-parachute license. In the aviation world, this is a total steal. You won\u2019t be setting any speed records in the air, though. If you\u2019re expecting something that the average driver can get in and fly without any additional training, that costs as little as a regular car . . . not gonna happen in our lifetime. ",

Then take into account night time and bad weather if you are allowed to drive then you can leave into your car and drive at night or when it's howling with rain or snow however pilots spend thousands of hours and probably an equal amount of money trying to perfect the art of flying in these conditions and sometimes they still don't get it right you asked a pilotabout a weather bomb. Where a sudden down burst of air in throw the biggest of aircrafts on to the ground killing all on board and those underneath it just imagine that happening to somebody who's not that savvy not been trained in the middle of a city during a rush hour it is for that reason my biggest concerns lie with the flying car the Nexus security you got issues with border control drugs running and people smuggling ",

            "answer_text": "There is a conceptual difference between flying cars and roadable aircraft. The latter are something that a pilot can keep in his garage, then drive to the nearest airport to fly, then drive to his destination from there. Flying cars, on the other hand, presume operation by the average motorist. Which presents a couple of problems. As long as commercial airlines are available, why would the average motorist want a flying car (at additional cost and with inferior road performance) if he is not a pilot? And if he is not a pilot, how would he be able to fly it? The latter is the easier to solve. Flying cars could be made to fly autonomously. Just key in a GPS destination and the onboard AI takes over to fly there. Once flying cars become autonomous and do not require a pilot to operate, then the difference between them and roadable aircraft disappears. If the flying can be made autonomous, why not make the driving autonomous also? Then the passenger does not even have to drive himself to the airport or heliport. And if he does not have to know how to drive, why does he need to pay a premium price to buy his own inferior-performing road vehicle at all? So the flying car/roadable aircraft) evolves into a flying taxi service. When will this happen? We are nearly there with regard to autonomous vehicles and aircraft, but what we really need is a breakthrough in battery technology which will give us cheap electric vehicles/aircraft with a decent power-to-weight ratio and long range.

            "answer_text": "Not likely, because desirable design characteristics of an automobile are different than desirable design characteristics of an an aircraft. When you talk about flying cars I assume you mean that a car that is also a conventional aircraft that takes off and lands on a conventional runway, not something like the Moller Skycar which is a VTOL craft that can be driven short distances (and is mostly a figment of the imagination). Cars generally need 4 large wheels for stability and stopping power. Tires and wheels are heavy, never a good thing for an aircraft.Light (2\u20136 person) aircraft are generally cramped and somewhat uncomfortable to sit in. There would be some that wouldn\u2019t mind this, but in general people that would have the resources to purchase an aircraft are interested in creature comforts.Safety features that are desirable or required in a car are mostly worthless in an aircraft (air bags, anti lock brakes, collapsible steering columns, crumple zones) These add weight which is the kiss of death for aircraft.Any flying car would have significant design restrictions in order to fold and/or store the wings. Flying cars would be ugly.Removing or folding the wings would be a pain, particularly in the rain.It is possible that personal air transportation may become feasible and popular with quadcopter technology, but they will be point to point transportation more like helicopters. It is not beyond belief that a computer controlled quadcopter could be safe enough to fly and land in a conventional parking lot but I\u2019m not holding my breath. ",

            "answer_text": "Not in the way you think of it, but yes. Most people will not be licensed to fly one on manual control. Nor will you be driving one around on the ground. But there will be flying taxis one day, and you\u2019ll be able to use them to get places. This requires a couple more generations of battery development, and some work on the air traffic control system. Both of these things are already happening anyway. They\u2019ll be electric, probably an octocopter configuration (because there\u2019s no way to make a motor, speed controller or prop failure in a quad sufficiently survivable). They will also have airframe parachutes, and they\u2019ll be fully autonomous (see, most people will not have a license), with navigation from a dispatch facility. There will also be a variety of more conventional helicopters and gyrocopters available for longer trips, as the aircraft I just described aren\u2019t going to have a long range nor be particularly fast as aircraft go; the gyrocopters, especially, will win if you have a hundred miles or so to go. Autonomous aircraft are much, much easier than autonomous ground vehicles, so this isn\u2019t even a challenge at this point. Air traffic control is incompatible with the current system, so there\u2019s an interesting operational problem to solve in getting them to coexist, but that is doable and will probably have good consequences for other small aircraft too; the effectively unavailable zones around major airports will get smaller if everyone has precision navigation.

            "answer_text": "The very current proposed rule-making by the FAA for managing drone traffic, aka Remote Id, is to put together a network where autonomous and piloted drones may be safely operated beyond VLOS-Visual Line of Sight and share the airspace with hundreds of other drones and piloted aircraft operating in an urban area, and also with commercial spaceports, where Elon Musk or Richard Branson is in your area. Many or most of the working delivery drones in the US, like ZipLine, and prototypes by Google Wing are operating with waivers under FAA Part 107 regulations for small drones, 55 pounds and less. They\u2019re limited to 400 feet max altitude and have been granted limited waivers to operate autonomously, beyond VLOS, safely. The UPS early entries, carrying medical samples and supplies among fixed delivery points, are with waivers from FAA Part 135 for commercial aircraft up to 12,500 pounds and larger. They propose operating larger drones that can operate in the air traffic control system, above 500 feet and up to jet routes, along with general aviation and other air carriers. One of the sketches I\u2019ve seen is a turbine-powered drone that can carry a pickup-truck load, a couple of pallets. I can sit at my desk and plan a mission with DroneDeploy or FlyLitchi right now and take a drone out to fly it. With today\u2019s laws, I\u2019ve got to keep my eye on the drone for the entire flight. After Remote Id is worked out, I can send my drone anywhere that\u2019s not restricted airspace. Skydio 2, DJI enterprise and professional drones, Autel, and others are waiting for the tech and protocols to be decided, and they\u2019ll build drones with the tech to fly from point-to-point. They\u2019ve got charging boxes that pop up and launch a drone from a first-responder\u2019s vehicle, or slide out from a construction manager\u2019s trailer. All we\u2019re missing is the standards. Currently we\u2019re responding to the FAA\u2019s proposed regulations: Press Release - U.S. Department of Transportation Issues Proposed Rule on Remote ID for Drones I\u2019m entirely supportive of what they propose, but hope I can continue operating my drones within VLOS as I do now, and hope the RC community isn\u2019t shut down. RC hobbyists and droners have been operating safely for lots of decades and I see no reason flight within VLOS should be obsolete. My DJI drones already broadcast everything I do to any authority with an AeroScop within range, and that\u2019s fine with me. We\u2019ve obviously got the tech to pick up a 5 pound package or half ton of cargo and take it from one place to another. A drone with a Pratt & Whitney or Rolls Royce turbine could easily be rigged to carry people. Google \u2018passenger drones\u2019 and check out the images. What\u2019s missing for you \u2018flying car\u2019 are designs that could get an airworthiness certificate under the current FAA regulations. Airplanes can glide to a safe landing if there\u2019s a problem with power, helicopters can auto-rotate, but the ordinary multi-rotor just drops like a rock if something affects all the power, or tumble in a mass or flesh-eating props if one or a couple motors fail. I don\u2019t want to fly or ride in an aircraft that can\u2019t glide and doesn\u2019t have a pilot to pick the best spot and the FAA won\u2019t let me. Military and Experimental aircraft don\u2019t have to get a Standard Airworthiness Certificate, but any manufactured aircraft does. I believe we\u2019ll see the small cargo drones that can operate between fixed locations rigged for safe operations are certified before anything that can carry passengers. Maybe if stuff is carried 100% safely or nearly, people will be too? Meanwhile, helicopters can\u2019t be operated except from heliports, planes need runways, and flying cars aren\u2019t going to be landing in your neighborhood soon. It takes a pilot\u2019s certificate, an instrument rating, and proficiency to operate in today\u2019s air traffic control system. In a couple years, a drone can do it\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The problem with flying cars is that they suck.  They use way more fuel than an equivalent car just to keep themselves in the air. And in order to keep that fuel penalty down, they have sparse interiors without many of the things we consider mandatory. So you pay $300,000 for your flying car, and find it has the amenities and furnishings of a 1962 VW Beetle. No fancy stereo, the seats are thin and uncomfortable, the sound insulation is non-existent, and you probably don't have air conditioning. Oh, and you have to weigh yourself, your passengers and their luggage before every flight to make sure you haven't exceeded the weight and balance limits. Can you imagine telling your wife she needs to reduce the weight if her suitcase by forty pounds, or telling your biggish friend he has to sit in the back to put the center of gravity in the right place? And the other way it sucks is the weather. Pilots spend a lot of their time learning to read the weather and make sensible weather decisions. Can you imagine your average city driver saying \"sorry, I can't fly today because there is a thunderstorm within 30 miles\" or \"because the clouds are likely to form ice\"? Most of them can't be trusted not to look at their damn phones in situations where it's dangerous to do so. ",

They have passed many of the hurdles set forth by the government, but I have since lost track of them. Because of progress, I am sure many other companies are doing the same thing and, in time, one of them will market a flying car. My guess is that it will look somewhat like a car with wings, similar to what the Skycar looked. You might want to lookup Moller Skycar on the Internet. This company started with a flying saucer and evolved their design from that point. I found it amazing how they kept hammering away at it after all the road blocks put up by our government. I understand that the government is watching out for our best interests, but on something this important to progress, I would think the government would be working a little bit more than they are to help this and other companies bring a flying car to market.

That might make sense on very long trips but as a way to get around to places relatively close by it probably would add to the time the trip requires. It\u2019s likely that - unless you live in a small town - the airport will be a good drive from where you start. Same deal for the airport at the end of your journey. All that, landing and taking off and then changing over to car mode will take a bit of time. And if it\u2019s a relatively long trip it would make more sense, and be faster, to own a regular airplane and drive to the airport the old-fashioned way \u2026 in your car. ",

Now they're turning driverless cars loose on the streets and trying to do away with privately owned vehicles. The laws of physics haven't changed. What goes up must come down. There's enough carnage on the highway without cars falling out of the sky. There are cool little ultralight aircraft that can take off and land on a residential street if you don't have power lines or trees in the way. They're loud uncomfortable and need perfect weather. You can't lift air conditioning heaters and stereo and the wife and kids and the family dog. You need a real airplane and real runway to fly a minivan. Getting something like that in the air really cuts down on your gas mileage. ",

Conventional fixed wing aircraft are reasonably energy efficient, but they don\u2019t really fit the description of a \u2018flying car\u2019. Aircraft capable of hovering and moving slowly, operating without a runway, based on any technology that I know, while technically possible (scaled up \u2018drones\u2019 might do it), would be very energy hungry! Not what we want in large numbers until we\u2019ve got an abundant supply of environmentally friendly, low carbon energy! So for that reason, if no other, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have flying cars any time soon. Except perhaps for some specific, specialist, low-volume applications.

And they\u2019re obscenely expensive - just getting a license costs as much as buying a new car. And they\u2019re noisy, hazardous to operate, and guzzle gas like a fish guzzles water. Gee, I wonder why there isn\u2019t one in every home yet! My late father was a fan of small, personal aircraft. He owned a Cessna (the best way to fly!) and one of his least favorite nuisances around the tiny podunk air strip where he kept the beast were the \u201cultra-light\u201d aircraft the locals would fly around in.  Or flying lawnmowers, as the pilots would jokingly refer to them as. This is the problem with flying cars - we are dangerous enough with the grounded vehicles we terrorize wildlife and pedestrians with. Now let\u2019s make these death machines defy gravity! That will go well! Needless to say, some Cessna owners ran - and still run - a \u201cflying taxi\u201d service between these small airports, and they wanted to be able to operate a shuttle to the big airports so their clientele could connect to airlines for longer distances. The FAA refused. Guess who\u2019s stealing that idea?! Of course they are. Uber Elevate | The Future Of Urban Air Transport I don\u2019t know how to describe the horrible gridlocked clusterf#c% that is traffic to the airports, especially dropping off at LaGuardia. But once you\u2019ve faced the horror that is that absolute transit disaster\u2026imagine it, but with tiny helicopters swarming in to a given terminal with no coordination, no regard for each other, and no real safety rules because you know they won\u2019t have any. So no, we\u2019re not going to have flying cars in the near future. Because it\u2019s not a good solution to the transit problems we have - in fact, it looks to be just another transit problem in the making. ",

The automobile was very much a product of it's time and benefited greatly from the lack of a robust liability industry, lack of environmental regulations and general lack of the kinds of laws that make regularly flying around the city a virtual impossibility today. If you crashed your model-T into someone's barn -- well you both had to settle it yourselves, maybe take it to the local court to collect damages if you couldn't work it out with the sheriff.  Today, frankly, you'd get sued if your oil dripped on someone's roof.

There is also one that I think is called the Maverick that is like a high powered UTV (Utility Terrain Vehicle) that uses a para-foil like wing to become airborne. It only does about 75MPH in the air but can fly. I see at least three things that will probably keep flying cars from ever becoming a success. First, you\u2019ll need a pilot\u2019s license which today will cost more than $5000 unless you have access to an aircraft at super bargain rates. Second, the manufacture will have trouble getting it road worthy enough to drive it on public roads (it will probably fly under the Experimental category that limits some usage). And last is cost. The couple units I have seen as near ready for sale will be nearly a million dollars. For that you can get a new 4 to 6 place high performance plane and pay a lot of taxi fares to/from airports. If they do come on the market they will probably be the plaything of people who can afford Bugatti or McClaren cars. ",

Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA.  Designed by Robert Fulton Jr., the Airphibian in December 1950 became the first roadable aircraft approved by the Civil Aviation Administration. It could fly to an airport and then, after disengaging wings, tail, and propeller, become a car. Other roadable aircraft, such as Waldo Waterman's Arrow/Aerobile and William Stout's Skycar (both in the Museum's collection), had been built but none earned certification. While a technical success as a flying car, the Airphibian did not become a marketable design due to the inherent compromises of air and car technologies and financial difficulties. A former company officer donated the Airphibian in 1960 and Robert Fulton III restored it in 1998. Every one of the 100 or so flying cars designed had a fate like this; America was never short of technical ingenuity. ",

And you can\u2019t just turn a corner with a flying car. It will take defined takeoff and landing areas, and defined pathways between locations. And it will also likely require either fully autonomous vehicles or remote piloted vehicles. These vehicles will require extensive maintenance, insurance, and are not likely to be user-owned. It takes a lot of energy with current technology to keep a \u2018flying car\u2019 up in the air, and when it comes down it will have a huge amount of kinetic energy, taking out everything below it in its path. That means other flying cars, buildings, and people. ",

They will NEVER be allowed to take off and land on a road or motorway. The nearest thing to flying cars that I can envisage is personal anti-gravity transport. If we can develop personal levitation, that might be allowed and would be very convenient (no runway required) but at present it\u2019s impossible.

That is, incidentally, when the Cessna 172 came to be, with a steering wheel like cars and even, astray in the doors. However, flying a car poses a real problem: Going from two dimensions to three. How would you organize the airspace? And to what profit? If the traffic is so great that roads are not enough, the air will certainly be jammed too because distances between each vehicle will need to be greater. I think that flying cars are a pipe dream that will always remain as \u2026 a dream. ",

A flying car will blow down a lot of air. More than enough to lift a skirt. You can\u2019t fly underneath another flying object, because the down-wash from the higher one will blow the lower one straight into the ground. Cross roads in the sky? I don\u2019t think so. You can\u2019t just stop whenever you want to. You have to find a landing spot. That landing spot has to be resistant to the wind your car blows down as it lands. When something goes wrong, you fall out of the sky. Maintenance and flight planning is expensive. It takes a lot of power to stay aloft even without forward motion. Unless we find a new incredibly cheap source of power, it won\u2019t happen. There are too many factors against mass market flying cars. ",

People never look where they are going on the road and the vast majority of people I know have no aviation knowledge at all. I don\u2019t want to have to worry about people texting and all other things crashing into my house. That can be very bad since not everyone has $250,000 or the equivalent in sellable assets to rebuild my house. It would be similar to getting in an accident with someone who does not have insurance. If we ever do see flying cars commonly available, we will have to completely relearn everything. It is that or stick to the traditional cars we are familiar with. Even if we do get flying cars you will need a different license for those and that would be more like a pilot\u2019s license and not interchangeable with a license for a motor vehicle on a roadway. You want to own both? You will need a license that shows you are able to operate both. ",

Your car is only doing the work of moving on one direction. The tires and suspension hold it up. After you get past rolling resistance, which is minimal, it's all pushing air out of the way. A flying car had to do the work of staying in the air, which is hard. It also has to push air out of the way. All that work is done by the engines. Ever see the gas mileage of something like a Cessna 2 seater? About 18mpg. That's awful. So, no. I don't think they will ever be workable. That totally leaves aside the huge issue of air traffic control over a mess like that. Planes HAVE to keep moving. They can't stop like a car and they can't hover in place like a car at a stop light. Not without sucking down a ton of fuel. So traffic control, while complex but doable on the ground, will be a bear. The only way to handle it would be completely autonomous vehicles controlled by ground computers that know where EVERYONE is and can do the pathing. That may be a while. ",

One problem I see is maintenance. There are so many people who fail to have their car maintained properly, that I fear for the consequences if these flying cars would become available to the general public. If you fail to have your engine checked when something's clearly wrong, the worst that can happen is that it fails and that you're stuck and have to be towed away. If something goes wrong with the engine of the plane, it might be the end of the story for all the passengers onboard. Very tight regulations would have to be set in place in order to avoid these kinds of accidents; perhaps the software can be used to monitor the condition of the hardware and if something's seriously wrong or if scheduled maintenance has been neglected, fail to take off until a mechanic resolves the issue.

As Rhajan Bhavnani has already written, the ability to make a small flying personal transport is not the issue, but traffic control and the avoidance of collisions is. On top of that, there are the consequences of collision or malfunction of the vehicle to consider. On the ground, a terminally malfuctional car will simply stop. That leaves you at the mercy of the surrounding traffic, but does not, of itself, harm you. In a flying vehicle, terminal malfunction converts your flight into a plummet, killing you and anyone you hit on the way down. This is why air traffic control and safety of flight is so much more important than ground traffic control and good driving. So we\u2019re left with satire. I see the question is now about flying cars \u201chappening\u201d. So, we\u2019re back with the \u201860\u2019s again :)  ",

Essentially, the discussion goes along the lines of: The reason why most people would want a flying car would most likely be traffic.

As a result, restrictions will be applied and we\u2019d either have air traffic controllers everywhere or motorways in the air as opposed to the ground. Which defeats the entire purpose of flying cars. As a form of entertainment and as a cool toy that people can show off? Probably. As an actual form of transportation. Probably not. ",

In the beginning there were horse carriages and bullock carts and they didn\u2019t had a concrete road to use and they were narrow usually a single lane in modern terms. Then came the revolution of the cars and more people started buying thanks to Henry Ford\u2019s Model T and people started realizing the need of the wider roads and they started making wider roads. As technology evolved and cities grew we started making highways and interstate. Even with biggest roads as on today we still have problem of congestion. So basically when we need more roads we add another lane essentially we can another dimension to it. The biggest traffic jam was China National Highway 110 traffic jam , which lasted around 2 weeks over a 100 kms many drivers were able to move just 1 km meter per day. So flying cars are basically another dimension and imagine getting stuck in this dimension for 1 day , what happens if you run out of fuel or you just want to get out and stretch legs you can\u2019t. Not to mention we have build this dimension in between airplane traffic and buildings anything other than that would be a mess. I\u2019m not saying its going to be impossible but if we want a sustainable transport network we have to look at improving public transport and ride sharing services which is more useful. ",

Lots of redundancies (8 independent propellers) and possibly a small chute at the C of G means that they could be safer than terrestrial vehicles (unlike helicopters, which should have been banned years ago).

However, self driving cars definitely seem to be on the horizon, and may be far more common (or even mandated) within the next couple of decades.  Once that point is reached, taking them to the air is a realistic scenario, but certainty not easy to implement. You can expect it would likely take 25-50 years after self driving cars become common before the technology to produce reliable self flying cars will be available to the general public. ",
