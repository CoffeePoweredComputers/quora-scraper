            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re asking whether to choose between an electric or a hybrid or whether to choose one of those over a conventional gas powered car. I\u2019ll start by saying I\u2019m a huge fan of electric cars. I have a Ford Ranger that I turned into a lithium powered electric vehicle. I drove an electric Smart car for 3 1/2 years. I now drive a Chevy Bolt EV. My wife drives a Ford C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid. For me the argument is electric vs anything else. The two main factors influencing whether you can drive an electric car are a place to charge it and how much you drive every day. If you live in a house there\u2019s no issue about charging. An apartment or condo is more complicated. Ideally you want to charge where you live because the best situation is that you come home, plug it in, and it\u2019s fully charged in the morning. Second best is that you can charge at work but then you may have issues on the weekend. The worst is using public charging because you can\u2019t usually leave the car there for long periods and you have to figure out what to while it\u2019s charging. Even if there\u2019s one close to your house or work you\u2019re still slogging through the rain to get to or from the car. I live in a house and I have 3 charge stations installed. Plugging into a regular outlet works fine for overnight charging but I found that on the weekends\u2014with frequent trips\u2014it wasn\u2019t fast enough. 240v charge stations solved that problem completely. The second question is how much you drive every day. Forget this nonsense about needing a car that can go 400 miles. How much gas would your car need to carry if it was magically full every morning like my electric car? My Smart Car had a 75 mile range and in 3 1/2 years I used more than 80% of that only three times. I used a public charge station once. If you have a 25 mile or less one-way commute every day then 75 mile range gives you plenty of excess for running lunchtime errands, going out to dinner after, and for the cold weather penalty (less range in cold weather). The range is improving and most of the current crop of electrics are getting a little over 100 miles. My Bolt EV has a 238 mile range which I figure will cover 98% of all my driving needs. If you can live with the lower range, used EVs are very inexpensive. Battery life is mostly a non-issue. I\u2019m surprised by the vitriol below against hybrids. Yes they are mechanically more complex (by a little bit) than conventional gas-powered cars but I\u2019ve never heard that they have a statistically higher repair rate. They do get better gas mileage and one of the reasons for even asking this question is the desire to spend less money on gas. I think the \u201cperfect\u201d car for someone who\u2019s on the fence is a plug-in hybrid. As I said, my wife drives a Ford C-Max Energi. When fully charged it can drive 25 miles as an electric vehicle. After that it turns into a 43mpg hybrid. Her commute is 21 miles round-trip so most days she doesn\u2019t use any gas at all. Last year we filled the tank 6 times (the tank holds 12 gallons). That\u2019s the car we use when we have to drive to Maine to visit our parents. That\u2019s the car I used to use to drive to the airport because it\u2019s 50 miles away. The Smart would make it but I\u2019d have to find a parking lot with charging. Plus the Smart wasn\u2019t a great highway car. (I use the Bolt EV now). If we only wanted one vehicle I would look at the number of times we need to take long trips. If we do it fairly often, then keeping the plug-in hybrid would be the smart move. Less often, then keeping the straight EV and either renting a car or using Uber for the occasional long trip would be smarter. After all, I can rent a car for a week-long trip to Maine for about the same amount as a month\u2019s payment on the car I own. For other plug-in options: For makes a Fusion Energi as well. The Chevy Volt goes about 58 miles before it turns into a hybrid. The Prius plug-in is only about 15 miles but they get 60mph as a hybrid. The BMW i3 with range extender is a 75 mile electric vehicle with a small gas-powered generator to drive the car beyond that. So should you buy an electric or a hybrid? I say Yes! There are SO many things wrong with burning gasoline that the less you use the better off we all are. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: It depends. There are many many factors that determine what type of car to buy. Even basic choices like a hatchback vs. sedan vs. SUV. ask yourself why are choosing NOT to purchase an ICE vehicle? Are you looking to save the world? To save money? or are a tech geek and need the newest technological gadget.can you afford a hybrid or an EV. In general both types of cars are more expensive than their ICE counterparts - upfront cost or loan considerations may keep you from purchasing what you want. While long term expenses on an EV are usually less, if you only own a car for 3\u20135 years, those saving probably won\u2019t be realized compared the higher purchase cost.Are EV\u2019s even sold in your state? For instance you can not buy a new Tesla in Texas. For Texas residents you have to order it online, have it shipped to a different state, go to that state to pickup and then return to Texas and reregister the car. Several other states have this issue. Other EV\u2019s are simply not offered in non-CARB states - Why some EVs are only available in a few states. ICE and hybrids don\u2019t have this problem as most dealers either have them on the lots or can order them and have them shipped to the dealership.Are you setup or can invest in home charging for plug in hybrids and EV\u2019s? Charging is a major part of EV ownership and if you are in a location where you can\u2019t conveniently charge at home (apartment, streeet parking only, rental location that won\u2019t allow installation of a charger etc.) then a hybrid may be a better choice.What are your driving habits? People who drive more than 100 miles per day, but less than 200 would probably benefit from a high efficiency EV. People who drive less than 50 miles per day can use a plug in hybrid to good effect. If you drive less than 20 miles per day, then just about any vehicle will do you.Are you buying new or used? Some vehicles like Tesla\u2019s are hard to find used at any reasonable price. Other vehicles like Nissan Leaf, Toyota Prius, Chevy Bolt can be found in reasonable numbers on used car lists. This can help offset some of the purchase cost. Alternatively, some car makers are still eligible for the $7500 Federal Tax credit and many states also offer tax credits for the purchase of a new EV, or plug in hybrid, which may make buying new more attractive.There are many other factors, so pretty much you have to ask yourself a ton of questions, such as money, range, charging, tax implications, availability and such and make a decision yourself. There are several online sites that can help provide comparisons such as range, cost and expenses for various makes of cars, hybrid and EV. ",
