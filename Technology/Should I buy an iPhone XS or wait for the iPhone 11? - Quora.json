            "answer_text": "There are several significant differences between the iPhone Xs and the iPhone 11. In some areas, the iPhone Xs is still much better and in some, the latter one just beats the hell out of its predecessor. But, to be perfectly clear, the iPhone 11 isn\u2019t exactly the iPhone Xs\u2019s descendant: it\u2019s more of a successor of the iPhone Xr, while the iPhone 11 Pro continues the Xs lineup. So, with genealogy out of the way, let\u2019s see how these two phones compare and what makes them differ from each other. The first obvious difference is the chipset: 11 uses A13 Bionic chip while Xs is running on A12 Bionic. Now, despite the fact that the newest chipsets are always more powerful and fast, you\u2019re not going to notice any significant difference between these phones in terms of performance. They\u2019re both very - and I mean, VERY - powerful smartphones. There is nothing - no game, no app, no task - that they cannot perform without a single glitch or a bug. So, the A13 is better but at that level of mastery, it\u2019s not too significant. Next up, the RAM. Here, again, do we come to a dissonance: the iPhone Xs has 3GB memory while the iPhone 11 - 4GB. Of course, one additional gigabyte is always beneficial to the performance, however, when it comes to iOS devices, they\u2019ve always been very well optimized. The numbers on a sheet don\u2019t really make much difference because both of these phones are, still, very powerful. However, there\u2019s one particular area where the iPhone 11 gets a massive upgrade: the camera department. While the iPhone Xs\u2019 camera was already one of the best with its 12mp f/1.8 main lens and a 12mp f/2.4 2x zoom lens, the new iPhone gets the same resolution, however, the zoom lens is replaced with the ultra-wide lens which is so much more usable. Besides, the iPhone 11 has a staggering Night Mode which is basically a slow-shutter mode which is super-handy for night shots and astrophotography. On top of that, there\u2019s a Deep Fusion mode which is automatically turned on when you get into not-too-dark but not-too-bright environments. The software does the whole job, capturing several photos before you even press the button and one additional one after the fact. The image that comes out of this whole process is such a high quality that you\u2019ll be blown away. Now, the area where the iPhone Xs shines is the screen. It has an OLED display with 1440p resolution while the iPhone 11 has a same-old LCD display with a bit more than a 720p resolution. While you can quickly adjust to the iPhone 11\u2019s low-resolution display, it\u2019s nowhere near that 2K miracle that\u2019s also one of the top-rated on the market right now. So, these are some of the most prominent differences with the iPhone 11 and the iPhone Xs. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's compare iPhone XS and iPhone 11 from five aspects: 1. The A13 processor of the iPhone 11 is stronger than the A12 processor of the iPhoneXS. The iPhone 11 is better than the iPhone XS in terms of the fluency of the mobile phone.  2. iPhone 11 has six colors, but it still continues the narrow feature of the previous generation frame, not as good as the iPhone XS, but it has more colors and more selectivity. In addition, the iPhone 11 uses an LCD screen, and the iPhone XS uses an OLED screen with a higher rear resolution, but in reality LCD and OLED screens do not have much impact in everyday use.  3. iPhone XS\u2019 battery life is ordinary, iPhone 11 battery capacity is much larger than the iPhone XS, the overall battery life is two hours higher than iPhone XS.  4. The camera experience, the performance of the iPhone 11 is quite good. Especially when recording video, the front and rear cameras work at the same time. The iPhone XS feature a 12-megapixel wide-angle+12 megapixel telephoto dual-camera solution. And wide-angle lens aperture F/1.8, telephoto lens aperture F/2.4, support dual OIS anti-shake.  5. iPhone XS does not support dual card dual standby. iPhone 11 supports dual card dual standby. You can choose one of the iPhones according to your own calculations. In fact, iPhone 11 is more expensive than iPhone XS. And are you going to get one 5G iPhone? It is not wise to buy a new iPhone now, so a second hand iPhone is your best choice. The reason is that second hand iPhone is cheaper, and you can get a newer model. If you really want to buy an iPhone XS, you can go to some second hand websites like Amazon, Ebay, CellphoneAge. Or some professional wholesale platform like Merkandi, Wakephone. ",
