            "answer_text": "Peace processes aimed at crime reduction. We have managed to dramatically reduce rape, for example, in a few months. How do we do it? We analyze data on certain city or state in Mexico. We create a statistical rape profile with the data and proactively inform the population at risk through by different means (media, social media, schools, community groups, etc). Although some rapes (30%) are committed by strangers, most rapes (70%) are committed by family members, neighbors or family friends. The victims are usually pre-puberty boys and girls or teenage girls. We also give out some specific advice to reduce risk. This creates awareness among potential victims and in general, in the community. The system reacts positively to this intent and this information. A new order emerges and rape is reduced in the order of 40 to 70% in a few months. We also prevent other crimes: Domestic violence, assault, robberies, car-thefts, etc. Some crimes are easier to prevent and reduce than others. We have developed this simple methodology of crime prevention over 25 years process of trial and error. It is simple, yet it involves a dramatic new mind set; our obstacles are usually old paradigms within government agencies and in the community. In our theoretical conception, you can positively impact complex social systems with the correct intent and the proper information. Notice, for example, that our focus is on peace and prevention, not prosecution and punishment. It also involves data and reason, and of course, acceptance both of the problem and of the proposed solutions. We don\u2019t focus on changing rules, we focus on changing the level of consciousness and aligning the proper information to support the emergence of peace. Homicide as you may imagine is the toughest to reduce. 80% of homicides in Mexico are drug-gang related. This has dramatically increase since 2008 when Mexico began a military approach following the USA\u2019s insistence. Therefore unless we embrace drug-regulation in Mexico, homicides will remain high. If you are interested in the subject we have two brief books on the subject: How does order emerge in social systems? Information: The key to understanding Complexity. There are available at Amazon.
