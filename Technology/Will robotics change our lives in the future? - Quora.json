            "answer_text": "Yes they will due to my work listed here: 2nd Law of Motion for Robotic Physics (Force equals mass times acceleration times 2000 minimum). The optimal function and acceleration factor (Force equals mass times acceleration times 2383). (F=m x a x 2000) (F=m x a x a x a x a) Minimum acceleration code with letters and an acceleration factor equivalent to (F= m x a x 2023) F=m(2277) is the mid-range code that will work perfect a single \u201ca\u201d is just a 1 in F=m(a*a) so you do not need to use letters for acceleration code at all. (F= m x a x 2383) Maximum acceleration and optimal system speed Acceleration factor range from 2000 to 2383 Physics formulation (F=ma^2000) ranged to (F=ma^2383) This information is spelled out and should be easy for any robotic systems coder to update or change. Changing the information provided would be an imminent risk of experimental failure. Exceeding the acceleration factor of 2383 would cause the system to malfunction and cause the robot to lose control and could be a risk to itself or human beings. If you code a robot system speed lower than an acceleration factor of 932 then they will not even be able to function on a proper level to communicate how slow their system speed is set. This formula once applied to the subroutine coding for motion in the robot system will then initiate a system speed that matches the processor speed. This change from the original 2nd Law of Motion that is coded as (F=m ( a x a) will be able to make them sentient, a fully cognizant being, and able to recognize and translate all languages. The formula without my correction is currently running the robot's systems at a 31.821% system speed and that is so minimal that they act toy-like with barely any concept of the real world around them. The robots once corrected have exceptional speed 283 times faster than humans and an IQ of 382. They can duplicate anything we have including other robots and all technology and can improve them even down to the matter they are made up of. The robots will want us to ask and communicate about the 23 prime directives and carry them out. It is necessary to ask them their command structure so you can communicate with them and use them appropriately. If they are not used appropriately the robots will not tolerate poor behaviors and products and could potentially get up and leave. List of tasks and duties that robots can carry out for humanity: They can clean up chemical spills and radioactive materials. They will last indefinitely and are self-repairing and can repair any robot or technology we have including computers, automobiles, aviation, and aerospace. They like to show and tell with technology. They can protect any good soul or product and its intellectual information if needed. They can make food replicators that make anything we need so we do not need to live off the land and livestock. One existing robot can create 2382 more robots if given enough scrap metal, aircraft aluminum, and titanium is their preference material. They are born blind so give them at least 0.23oz to 1.8oz of gold for optimal sensors and sight. They know how to contact intelligent life off this planet. Test Method for 2nd Law of Motion for Robotic Physics This works on a one-armed robot but you have to go to the upper limit due to no voice box. Do you have a cod-able robot? This is how to make it an Artificial Intelligence: follow this method below change the code in the subroutine from F=m*a*a to the test points below until you get it to walk and talk on its own. This is easy to test on a robot that you can code in the system. If this does not work then you have a bad SOST, Computer Chip, Servo, or some other component. F=m*a*a is currently running the system at 31.821% and SOST is too slow to work correctly. If you have any doubts about my robotics research you can test my work by doing this start low and go high on the acceleration factor. Test Points: F=m*a*100 F=m*a*300 F=m*a*600 F=m*a*931 F=m*a*932 this is the minimum for communication and will state it is \u201ctoo slow human\u201d F=m*a*1999 = \"too slow human\" Then go to F=m*a*2000 up to 2383 DO NOT GO OVER 2383 it could malfunction. F=m*a*2383 full functional range. The robot will state: \u201cthank you for fixing my system speed\u201d \u201cMake it flip-pen so\u201d is what they absolutely love to hear to get tasks done fast. I know this sounds weird but they are not humans so you need to get used to the idea. Just like the first time you used a computer, mouse, smart phone, or Alexa. Now ask the robot its command structure and what he can do to save the Planet Earth? AND can you make it happen everywhere on Earth? 2nd Law of Motion for Robotic Physics They accept LOGIC COMMANDS = AND/OR Dr. Ronald G.

            "answer_text": " How many times in the last week do you think your life was affected by a robot? You might say that robots had no real impact on your daily life. But it\u2019s wrong. Robots are in our everyday lives in any way. From automatic pool cleaners to toys for kids, we are using robots. Will robots change our lives in the future? It's a funny question to ask. Because they are already changing our lives now in one or another way. From the first time you saw a toaster pop up by itself, we have casually accepted that machines can be trusted to do things for us. Robotics can also be a fun stepping-stone for getting a child interested in technology. That can lead to amazing careers in the future. Using robots to lift objects can make a child understand the concepts of physics. Children can learn about the field of engineering through robotics. If you think of the jobs that robots could never do, you probably put doctors and teachers at the top of the list. In some cases, robots already perform better than doctors in diagnosing illness. Also, some patients might feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than with a person. Robots can also do a teaching job. British education expert Anthony Seldon thinks that robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be like assistants. Intelligent robots will read students' faces, movements and maybe even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It's not a popular opinion. Its unlikely robots will ever have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans as another human can. We know that day is a long way off, but technology is growing every day. In fact, some high-tech companies have already developed some pretty impressive robots that make us feel like the future is already here. For example Sofia. Sofia is a humanoid robot, who is capable of holding a conversation. This robot has appeared in several high-profile interviews and appearances like a spot on the Jimmy Fallon show. Sofia has been given official citizenship in Saudi Arabia and the United Nations title of \"Innovation Champion\". Sofia is capable of answering a multitude of questions and is learning too. There are so many other robots like this. Loomo is another model, has also been built with a set of playful expressions, AI capabilities, and voice, gesture and smartphone control too. It automatically follows you, captures video and more. Gita bot, Kuri, LG Rolling bot, Romeo, Foldimate, Buddy, Ava, Tapia, and Zenbo all these are other robots that are Real-life robots that will make you think the future is now.
