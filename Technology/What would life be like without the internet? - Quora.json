            "answer_text": "I had access to the internet earlier than most people (around 1989 or so\u2026.the Internet wasn\u2019t really accessible for the general public until around 1995\u2026) Let\u2019s say I wanted to do any of the following: Send a message to someone. Pre-Internet, my choices were US mail, the telephone, or perhaps leaving a note on their door/desk/car/wherever. (Long distance phone calls in particular were very expensive, and usually reserved for business use, or special family occasions such as weddings and funerals). Radio geeks might have access to ham radio or CB for this purpose.Plan a trip. That meant using a paper map, either the folding maps that the AAA or gas stations provided, or a map book like the Thomas Guide. While driving, listen to traffic reports on the radio to avoid traffic jams, accidents, etc.Buy an airline ticket. Either call the airline directly, or a travel agentNeed to look something up? If not in the dictionary or encyclopedia at home, visit or call the public library.Access news from around the world? Again the public library or a well stocked newsstand would have foreign newspapers and magazines.Want to listen to music? Turn on the radio or Go visit the record store. Folks (kids mostly) wanting to save a buck would use a cassette recorder tape songs of the radio or albums borrowed from friends, the library, etc.How about a music video? Hope your cable has MTV (which actually played videos back then!)Purchase something: Either visit a store, or use a mail-order catalog (Sears, Wards, JC Penny\u2019s. etc)Looking for a job, house, etc: Peruse the \u201cwant ads\u201d in the local newspaper, or obtain an out-of-area paper (library, newsstand, etc.) for searching farther afield.Get together with other people sharing a special interest, hobby, etc: Either find (or form) a local club and have meetings, or join an out-of-area club and have newsletters mailed to you.",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Moses Maraga gave a very good list: Moses's answer to What would life be like without the internet? But the primary difference would be in the institutions. For example, people get news now from almost anywhere. Donald Trump said that if she is elected, Hillary would let 600,000,000 immigrants into the US in the first week. Never-mind that it would triple the population of the country, people believed it. He just made it up. Without the internet, news would come from the large credible institutions like the New York Times, CBS news\u2026 They used to fact check and expose the lying in elections. News used to be a loss leader for the networks. They could afford it because they had a monopoly and were fat and happy. Now it has to make a profit because there are so many competing outlets for entertainment. So integrity in many cases is down the drain. Medicine would change. Doctors wouldn\u2019t be able to review x-rays from remote locations. We would do all of our shopping in retail stores. No Amazon. We would go out to movies. No Netflix. We would play outside. No online video games. We would have to spend time in the library. No Google. While email existed before the internet, it was limited to large corporations that could build their own large-scale networks. Texting is technically not an internet service, but media sharing is. You would send a lot of letters. Maybe occasional packages with videos. They would take days to get to their destination and days for a reply to get back. Life would be slower - more deliberate. No instant (often wrong) answers. I lived 2/3 of my life like that and I was a technology guy. Today\u2019s world is faster paced but often less interesting. Nothing in depth. I wouldn\u2019t trade the internet for a past era, but there are lessons to be learned from some of the limitations we lived with. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember ordering things out of magazine-like catalogs. Back then, if you didn\u2019t have a mag for it or couldn\u2019t find a mag for your niche, you were shit out of luck. So if my friends and I ever were fortunate enough to get one that suited our interests, it got passed amongst us for months. This was as much news as we got on our favorite comic artists (Wizard,) bands (Metal Edge/Metal Maniacs,) or even games (GamePro) because, when you\u2019re living in a tiny town, at the height of the \u201csatanic panic\u201d scare, anything the adults deemed \u201charmful\u201d basically created a little black market in town. If we ordered anything, it took six to eight weeks to arrive. You read that right, six to eight weeks. You think that two-day wait for Amazon Prime is agony or a few-day delay over the holidays is a pain, we had to watch our mail like hawks during the final countdown and intercept before anyone could suspect. Then the contraband music, comics or games would have to be swapped around, sold and generally hidden from view. School was more like a smuggler\u2019s bazaar and any Solos (a term of endearment earned by anyone who could trawl magazines and find sources for obscure stuff that was worth double what you\u2019d pay for it; e.g. Han Solo) would have to conduct cash transactions in the halls, in the bathrooms, at lockers and often ran the risk of teachers or school administration confiscating the item. You didn\u2019t have it sent to the intended person. You had to get paid for your find. If you wanted information, you had to know someone. If you knew someone, you never gave up your source to a third party. If you were a friend of a friend, chances are you were paying big for that Dark Funeral CD. I might double my price on it, but best believe the guy buying it from me and selling to you was going to double his and rake in huge. If you were a really good friend to the friend that I knew, you may not get charged the \u201cfinder\u2019s fee.\u201d The internet didn\u2019t really destroy our black market outright. It eroded it. That black market died over time. Shipping times were faster, paypal accounts were easier to set up and the town\u2026well\u2026it never seemed to notice because, by that time, most of the metalheads had sense enough to move out before we were all accused of burning the bodies of sacrificed children in portable crematoriums.

            "answer_text": "An interesting question in an age where the Internet plays an integral part of everyday life, business and society! So what are the implications of a life without the internet? Well firstly we should ask the question in a more specific circumstance. What would life be like with no Internet if the 'plug' was pulled today? We'll be looking at this topic from this angle, rather than trying to imagine the world without the Internet had it never been invented. Life without Internet - Pulling the Plug on the Internet. How exactly the Internet Plug could ever get pulled is a complicated question, due to the expansive infrastructure that makes up the Internet. It would probably require the shutting down of every server and local DNS around the world. Some people have spoken about a major virus infection spreading through all servers and computers, rendering them / the Internet in a paralyzed state. There is also another wild theory where by the wind generated by huge solar flares will disrupt anything that carries current, from telegraph wires, anything metal, computers, servers etc. You can read about this theory if you Google \"Carrington Event of 1959\" This theory is said to be predicted by Nasa. Life with no Internet - Personal Users How would having no Internet affect the general personal user? Well apart from every teenager screaming because they can't log on to Facebook, it all comes down to how much we personally use the Internet and what for. Some of us hardly use the Internet, where others pretty much live their life around it! Equally some actually live a completely New Life within the Internet like those who use Second Life. I asked a few people their initial feelings towards not having the Internet, here's what they said; \"So many people use the Internet that if whoever banned it from the world everyone would complain that much and so many people would sue them that they would be forced to put it back on to regain all their money, or everyone should just move to the planet mars.\" Charlotte - 16 \"Well, people would have to start talking to each other more, like they used to, and the whole morning chat at the post office will return. Kids would have to used the library to find stuff out instead of using Google, which will get them out of the house and learning to do things for themselves. People will receive letters instead of emails.\" Melanie - 28 \"It would affect me greatly in work because of our regional offices that relay information, policies and procedures to one another quickly. Personally I don't have the time to go out as much as I'd like to and without the Internet I'd loose valuable socialising networks and access to friends and family far away.\" Debbie - 45 \"Boring life! We would not be able to shop online, which helps a lot of people like me who find it hard to get around\" Sylvia - 60+ Socialising - Can our Youth Socialise without the Internet? Many of us use the Internet to communicate, especially those in the lower age brackets above 10 years. From email to chat forums, social networks, dating sites and even virtual worlds our demands on the Internet for social communication and networking are huge. So it's easy to anticipate that a life without the internet would force people to turn back to grass roots and socialise and communicate on a very basic level. My worry with this though, specifically within the lower age brackets is will the people who've grown up with the Internet around them be able to embrace social engagement on a grass roots level and know how to socialise? Would this better enhance communication skills and language in relation to studies on how 'Internet slang' has merged into our language skills? Would our ability to meet new people outside our immediate area be severed and thus affecting who we meet, socialise and interact with and above all whom we spend our lives with? How did you meet your partner? Was the Internet involved in the process? Life without Internet - Communication We use the Internet to communicate more than ever and it's become an integral part of any standard means of communication. So with no Internet our means of communication would have to adapt. I very much doubt we'll be sending smoke signals, but letters would fulfil the hole e-mails left and phones would fulfil the gaps that instant messaging, chat and social media created. An increase in posted mail and phone calls would surely benefit our local postal services and telephone network providers, but what we loved about the Internet was that communication was free! So it's a possible exaggeration to assume we'd all crack out the pens and paper, start licking stamps and calling everyone we know. Further more we would probably resort to basics, that remain free and simply go 'talk' to friends and family. Life Speed not Broadband Speed! The Slow Down It's a simple observation that the Internet sped up the world and lives we live. We communicated quicker, we could buy and sell quicker and we could find information quicker. So with the dilemma of having no Internet we'd surely expect the world to slow down, in business, society and communication. Coping with this huge decrease in processing speed would have extended impact throughout the business and society worlds to a point we'd wonder how we ever coped without it. Life without the Internet - Effects on Business Almost all businesses nowadays have some relationship with the Internet whether it's a simple business listing or an online store. What implications would be put upon businesses across the world with the loss of the Internet? Perhaps world wide recession, stock markets would collapse, millions of businesses go bust and millions of people loose their jobs? The impact on businesses that utilise the Internet would be massive and the make or break factor would be if they could survive without it? But there may be some advantages amongst this devastation; as consumers we'd probably start buying locally, enriching our local towns and shops. We'd look for local services and sustain local economies by trading within our immediate areas. The loss of jobs that relate to Internet Business would be hard to digest. Jobs at our local super market working the tills would suddenly be in high demand as well as many other jobs that don't directly relate to the Internet. What Businesses might survive? Many older businesses 'embraced' the Internet and didn't solely found their existence around it, so we'd find a good number of businesses still in a position to trade. They merely used the Internet as an advertising medium or extra virtual shop. As long as they had diversity and a strong customer base they'd adapt in whatever ways necessary to keep trading. Access to Information & Resources cut We all know the Internet is a massive resource directory, full of useful and useless information, all beautifully at our finger tips. So without it where would we find out the chemical compound of silver, or the world record time for eating After eights? Books! Quite simply, we'd resort back to the old school principle of reading books from libraries. It would definitely be harder finding the equivalent information that the Internet can provide in your local library but if you think about it the Internet basically took the concept of a library and expanded it by about a million times!. Life without the Internet - Conclusion Above all we have to remember we got to where we are today without the Internet. The Internet was a technological advancement that excelled us into the 21st century and changed the way we socialised, did business and purchased goods. It paved the way to the future and still has many exciting advancements ahead of it's self. Witnessing the loss of the Internet is probably very unlikely, but either way I'm quite sure as a human race we'd adapt and persevere as we have done for thousands of years. Those who grew up with the Internet well established around them simply can't comprehend life without it. There are however many of us who practiced life before it's time and have experienced a life without the Internet. ",

If I can\u2019t find it on Google, I ask it on Quora or Wishfie, if I want to know something in detail, I browse through wikipedia, if I want to watch a tutorial or a documentary on a topic, I go to Youtube, if I want to get entertained, I log into Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or Snapchat, if I am missing someone, I Whatsapp them, if I am on a vacation, I upload the memories to Google Photos\u2026and so on Life without internet would be dull, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do. In fact, my job depends upon internet. I learn from internet and I connect using internet. I know there are a lot of cons of internet, but it\u2019s like a lifeline. However, some positive things would happen too: I\u2019ll become a little more patientMy eyes, neck and head would hurt a little lessI\u2019d experience the real world a little moreI\u2019ll meet more peopleI\u2019ll have more time in my dayI won\u2019t become a couch patatoMy fingers would be little less tired at the end of the day (because I\u2019d be typing and swiping less\u2026don\u2019t get wrong ideas in your head :)I brain will become a little sharper as I\u2019d have to use it instead of apps :)I wouldn\u2019t be able to find out how many upvotes I got for this answer :(So please\u2026don\u2019t take my internet away!!!

Not some cheap lines from one of those filthy sites.People would put more effort on finding things themselves rather than putting questions on quora. How to get into IITs?Photos would make more meaning then just for the sake of getting likes on Instagram.People would actually want to move their asses rather than surfing online for everything. Amazon,Naukri,Shaadi,Ola.People would be more genuine and real with others,rather then being fake and jerk on Social Media.People would be more valued person,rather than the 3g or 4g network coverage.Lastly,people would have a real life with priorities rather than having virtual life with dual standards.Without Internet there would be demerits too.We all know that-: I wouldn't be posting this answer here.Life would have been difficult.Jobs,School,assignment would have been a tough load of job.Basically we would be reduced to 1/10 of our current efficiency.But \"With great powers comes great responsibilities\" and the bitter truth is we are misusing this power of Internet.

But I was of the view that every one should spend atleast such a day once in a while without the net connectivity, and feel what it\u2019s like. I had never tried it. But yesterday the government of my state made me have that experience. The internet connectivity was banned in our state for 24 hours for certain law and order issues. All the internet service providers such as BSNL, Airtel, Jio and Vodafone suddenly switched off their services.  And here is my experience for a day without net connectivity: Newspaper: I read the newspaper for the first time in many days. I was compelled, because the lack of connectivity did not allow me to have the access to the news online. I was always habituated to surf the website and app of newspapers to see the latest news, while the actual newspaper delivered by the newspaper boy at my door step remained neglected without even being opened. But not today.Sound sleep: I was early to bed and had a sound sleep at night. It was because that day I couldn\u2019t follow my usual habit of exploring my smart phone while lying in my bed and reading the social media for atleast an hour before going to sleep. A break from that habit that day kept my mind calm, in turn assisting me in a sound sleep.Silence: It was almost a soundless day at home; because my wife could not take up her usual hour-long video talk with our one-year old grand daughter staying abroad (even as the little one has yet to learn how to talk).Radiation free: It was a radiation free day; because I did not need to carry my mobile phone close to my chest where ever I went.Read a book: The boredom caused by the lack of connectivity, made me finish the reading of a whole chapter of the book Heaven on Earth which I had purchased many long time back, but which I believed I won\u2019t be able to find the time to read till the day of my retirement from job.Rest to the eyes: My eyes got a break from their burden of gazing at the glaring screen of the mobile phone. The poor eyes badly needed such a rest, which they got that day.I wish the govt. could impose such a ban on the internet services atleast for a day every month. Note: This piece was written by me in the month of March 2018, when I was at Ludhiana in the state of Punjab, and the internet shutdown was imposed at that time by the state govt as a precautionary measure in view of a call for Bharat Bandh given by certain organizations.

I am happy that I grew up without the internet. I feel that it allowed me to have a much more educational, creative, imaginative, healthy, fun and active childhood. Had the internet always existed I do not know that we would have had all of the beautiful monuments, museums, books, stories, pieces of arts, the quality music etc that we have all over the world today. This is just my opinion and I could be very wrong, but I feel that the Internet takes away creativity, imagination and to some extent productivity. Having lived in both worlds, I do not feel that life without the internet would be any worst. Other than Quora I do not have or want social media so it would not impact my social life either. I admit that the internet does bring some practicalities that I do enjoy although they are not necessary such as online banking/paying bills, browsing/shopping and email. ",

If two computers can network, they are capable of being part of the internet, so they would have to fail. If this applied worldwide... industry would stop. All facets of modern life would be over, and government infrastructure would collapse. Honestly, I would be quite content to regain my freedom.I am fortunate in that my family has a farm of approximately 100 acres within a two hour's drive. Even if our vehicles failed, I could get there in a couple days with what supplies I have gathered. At that point, I would conscript my extended family to begin fortifying our familial land and laying out plans for a self-sustaining, subsistence community.Once construction begins and order has been restored to our little area, recruitment begins with the local residents. Screening for useful skills is a must, along with an acceptance of the newly established governmental body. Oath of fealty may not be necessary, but could be considered.Pre-screened individuals should arrive within a few days, possibly within a week or two. At this point, most amenities should be available for enjoyment again, sans computers.This is also handy for zombie apocalypse scenarios and some other 'doomsday' occurrences. Due to the short amount of time available to me for internet usage, this is not the established plan in full, merely a general outline. ",

We conquered the peak after 16 hours of strenuous trek -  Though internet is a boon, sometimes I think life would be more peaceful without it. You ask me how your life would be without internet?

I only have Company Phone which has 2 GB LTE, which ends in like 5 days, then even accessing Quora is slow, and can't really play videos. But i was able to put my phone in hotspot mode and set up his laptop, as i still had the initial fast 2 GB. So, there are people living without regular internet. Dont feel pity for i believe i have already seen enough internet for a lifetime. But yes 3 out of last 5 years have been without Internet. What happens when you live like this is that sometimes you know only after couple days who won World Cup or Wimbledon.(and so on) Nor have i ever had cable and haven't read any news in long time. Its latest in series of 'experiments' i am doing. ",

At present words have turned to text ,memories to selfies and conversations to calls.Ask urself are u really satisfied with this ? I feel all are delight of its usage but no one is happy And the relationships are losing its importance .Every random moment the other person seems to be fascinating and The people prioritise their mood based on the feeds found on their pages .Is this life ? Is this the change which had joined wings to our thinking. But ya internet is vitable and had seved us to its maximum extent but life is natural process not a computer programming which needs internet for it access . Be Smart enough internet is invention of man not a man is an invention of internet ",

Expressions were not limited to response buttons. Had a variety of laughter and myriad ways of saying things that mattered. Cards.. those little envelopes mattered a lot. One could actually cuddle on them. Hobbies created tangible masterpieces. Now it\u2019s just screenshots. However, I have had the power to connect with people worldwide and have some cherished friendships built over internet. So many wonderful people who I have never met in person but those who have been adding a lot to my education, happiness, and personal growth met me over different online platforms from yahoo chat boxes to Quora. More to come. Strike a balance between online and offline life. Everything is good, bad and ugly. You are the one to decide what good you can drive and how much you can let it affect you. ",

With the Internet gone, our convenience would definitely take a dive, we are too used to ordering things online than actually walking to a supermarket. Also without email, professional life would take a hit. But, on the positive side, at least it'd revive our social life. People would \"actually\" meet someone and enjoy a vacation than sharing it on social media. Nobody can really predict what the situation will be like until the scenario actually arrives which itself has a very remote possibility. ",

I think my life would be more productive everyday because internet is one the the reasons why I ended up laying in bed for the whole day, before. Now that I am a Mom already, internet somehow helps me because I am able to search tips about motherhood since I am a first time mom. But I realize when your job is being a mom there\u2019s no manual book because everyday you will discover new things about motherhood. I became more hands- on because i depend on my own experience everyday with my daughter. Internet is such a distraction for me because sometimes when I use internet I miss playing with my daughter. i have to reduce using internet everyday. Actually now, I am not active in some social media accounts like facebook, snapchat and etc,. ",

Same as it's been for thousands of years, and will be for thousands more.    Sure, the way we communicate and get information would be different. The main difference would be speed.  The Internet makes communcation and information much faster. But fundamentally, you are still doing the same stuff.  Facebook isnt enabling you to do anything you weren't doing already.  But now it's easier and faster to maintain relationships, so you can do more of it.  Go to moviefone to check movie times?  It's the same thing we used to do before the Internet except we used to make a phone call or check the newspaper. ",

Or, if you could wait, you could write letters, and send physical photographs by normal mail, which would take weeks or more. If something was urgent and did not have a telephone, you had to send a telegram. Most everything else was done personally by going physically. And that\u2019s it. The internet has accelerated our communications and the distribution of information. Information did exist, but it was a lot more cumbersome to get at it! ",
