            "answer_text": "Pomodoro thoroughly coveredtrying to speak directly into water, I will touch on speaking into air while underwater. The short answer is still no, unless at a shallow depth. Imaging going underwater with something that keeps your head surrounded by air, say a Kirby Morgan dive hat. Air is being supplied to you at a pressure greater than ambient, which increases with depth. As you go deeper and there is more pressure, the air you are breathing is denser. Much denser than the air you normally breathe, and that which vibrates your vocal chords. Now this doesn't effect the ability to speak but rather raises the tone of your voice. This can be noticed as shallow as 10 feet deep and gets more pronounced with greater depths to the point the you will start to sound like Donald duck, or even higher. So no, you cannot talk normally underwater but yes talking is possible. ",
