            "answer_text": "Well well well this is the most common question rumbling in our minds after coming to the final year or during internship. This is the phase I passed too where I have done lot of research in the pursue of this question. I got lot of answers and suggestions from the seniors,professors,well wishers etc., Unfortunately in india for a dentist in the beginning it is not a cakewalk(off course same in other professions also). We need to struggle to get a good position aftermath. This is because of various reasons lack of awareness among the people,lot of investment for setting up of clinic,lot of practitioners giving a good competition etc., But there is a good scope for us to excel in this field where it demands our passion,enthusiasm in learning daily,skill of motivating patients. Now coming to the topic what to do after BDS, there are many ways to shape your career as listed below:- Setting up a Clinic : Yes its good to set up a clinic if you are confident in dealing the patients. If not work under a senior practitioner until u get a good experience. Its better to do diploma courses on endo or implants. Get a consultant for critical cases where you cant handle. But setting up a clinic takes time for you earn.Pursuing MDS:- This is the traditional way. This has better aspects than BDS and PG helps you to fetch you a job in a college if you are strong in academics and have a passion to teach. This adds extra beauty if you setup a clinic you can also become a consultant(Only in certain Depts. like OMFS,ENDO,ORTHO etc.,)Write NBDE exams:- This is bit tough But you can clear it with Determination, needs a good financial background. You can pursue DDS Abroad by clearing it. Very good option to Practice Abroad.Follow the link National Board Guides .Practice in Middle East:- Yes practice in middle east countries like Saudi arabia, Dubai and Singapore etc., But for this You need to have preferably MDS and minimum 3 years exp.,and you need to clear their Dental council exam to practice there follow this link Pages - Dentist .Government Jobs:- you get a job in Government Hospitals as a general dentist in state govt Hospitals and also in Army, Navy, Railways etc., But These are very less and you have lots of competition.Study MBA:-For this you need to Appear for CAT Exams and score well. Follow this Question for Doubts Regarding MBA. Is an MBA a good decision after BDS? I want to leave my core field. This is a good option if you are not interested in continuing dentistry.Study Masters in Public Health:- For this you need to clear GRE exam and get selected for the best universities abroad. by this way you can also prepare for DDS. If you want to settle abroad.This Method is financially Hectic.Prepare for Govt. exams:- Yes Prepare for most privileged exam like UPSC to gain entrance into Civil Services and other services. You can also prepare for SSC,SBI PO, IBPS PO etc.,Become an entrepreneur :- Yes Start a Dental Chain with the help of Your friends And well wishers. But this requires lot of Hard work And vigilance.Conclusion:- Now Concluding there is No Certain Way like \u201cBest Option\u201d after Bds. It depends on your interest and priorities. Think for your Future and talk to yourself for what you want to be. Select a way and act accordingly without loss in Hope. So one Day you Succeed. But don\u2019t Regret for your choice later. Hope this helps You\u2026\u2026\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, here goes a glimpse of my life in a few lines: I did my BDS from Bangalore - batch of 2007, RGUHS (supposed to be 2005, but Pharma in my 2nd year and Community in the 4th were never my favourites - ended up loving Pharma by the time I cleared it though - but that's a story for another day. Still have a very distinct hatred towards Community - no offence to anyone here but that's my thing.) Now, I was never attracted to the idea of being a doctor - never. But\u2026 the usual - family stuff happened - all being in the medical profession and one thing after another - I joined the course, fainted in my first Anatomy lab, loved my Conservative fillings, got giddy during my first extraction, almost puked during Perio clinicals, cleared my final year and eventually completed my internship - successfully. I was happy I didn't let my family down. I was unhappy I let myself down. This was something I could not share with anyone - from day one. Don't get me wrong - my carvings and Restorative work was one of the best in the batch, but hey ho - not my cup of tea. So, what did I do? I joined Hewlett Packard - yes the IT company, in 2004. I joined as a Technical Engineer (Networking). I loved IT. I met a lot of amazing people and made some of my best friends there. I went to college during the day time, as a Dental Student, and worked as an Engineer by the nights. This went on for a few years. After college, I practiced for a while. Ran a clinic during the day and became a vampire through the nights! All that through classes, clinicals, exams and vivas. Slept for about 3 hours every day in between the 2. It was not easy, but I loved it. It drove me crazy at times, but I enjoyed what I did in the nights. Plus back then, while studying, I was earning quite a smile-bringing-pay cheque. Not many people around me - at dental school - could say that :) Then in 2009, I decided to push the steam ahead and pursue a career in IT seriously. Got myself a partial scholarship approved for an executive MBA programme at a certain university in the U.K. There was a lot of convincing that needed to be done - both at home and at the Home Office but a year and a half later, I graduated with an MBA in Information Management. Guess what - the 1st job I worked in the U.K., after my MBA, as a Business Analyst - was to deliver a huge Dental Software package to a US based client. I was actively involved from the design to the delivery. Loved every second of it. I am now a Business Intelligence Analyst working for a very reputed sports organisation. I work on cloud based technologies and Big Data. Awesome stuff through my eyes. My point of all this is to tell you to simply follow what your passion is. No joke. Whatever you want to do, in today\u2019s world, is only as far or near as you would want it to be. Oh and before you ask, why I didn't give up on BDS - my parents wanted this somuch from me that they got me a Management Seat back then. I\u2019m not sure what this is called nowadays, but essentially they paid a lot for my admission - both financially and emotionally. It was their dream - you could say. I did not want to let them down. Since my convocation, I am and always will be a doctor, wherever I go. At the end of the day, they are happy and now, so am I. I do wish you all the best in whatever you decide to do. You never know what you can achieve until you push past what you think you are limited by. Take some time to figure this out. I almost forgot - it's really okay to get stuff wrong once in a while. That includes your thoughts or decisions. Smile. Relax. You will be fine. EDIT: For those who were asking about how I got into hp - there was open invite for the public in the form of a newspaper advert. It was an screening exam - a theoretical one. For the candidates shortlisted from this test, there was a group interview. Once this was cleared, 2 more rounds of personal interviews - concluding with the HR round where they presented the offer letter. I was upfront of the fact that I was attending dental school. I explained to them that this is what I wanted to do. That, why it was important for me to complete my course. I also assured them that me pursuing my education - full time - would not have an adverse impact on my day to day delivery. They believed me. They trusted me. Not only did they give me a really good offer, by those days\u2019 standards, they also allowed me to work from home 2 days every fortnight. As a matter of integrity, the company and my department earned my dedication. I worked hard and gave them everything they expected off of me and more. The downside to joining the organisation without an undergrad qualification was that my \u201creally good offer\u201d was about 40 or so percent lower than my \u201cqualified\u201d colleagues. I wasn\u2019t in it for the money at that time - this was more of a \u201csecond chance\u201d to get my career straight. I held on to it with dear life! Having said that, I grinned, the most wicked grin, on payday every month :D. Thank you for showing the interest and taking the time to read. ",
