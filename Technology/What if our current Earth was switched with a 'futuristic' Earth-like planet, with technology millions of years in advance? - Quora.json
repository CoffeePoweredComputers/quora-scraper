            "answer_text": "Chances are we would be unable to eat any of the food on an alien planet.  So hopefully this \"prank\" would be pretty short.   If it is an \"April Fools\" joke, then I would assume 1 day.   That should be enough so we wouldn't starve to death.   More likely than not the alien deceases would not cross species boundries in this time.   But if any did, we could expect a pandemic event which would continue after being switched back. Even the water could be dangerious, as species that would be considered harmless to the natives could be very dangerious for us to injest. Most of us would not phantom how to use even the simpliest of the advance technologies.   However, if the aliens had pets, we could probably use the more passive technologies designed for thier pets to interact with.   We could also probably use their technologies that don't require activation or such.  e.g. Automatic doors, escalators, etc.   I would expect even there elevators would have advanced beyond simple buttons.   The first time I went to Red Hat Towers, the elevators their where incomprehensible to me.   I just stepped in an elevator and then stared at the blank walls looking for a button to indicate the floor I wanted to go to.   I ended up getting off at a near by floor where someone explained to me how to use the elevator.   The only way the average person would use a futuristic elevator is if it was designed to allow pets to use them. Overal, I would say we would fair much worse than the civilation moved to the less advanced technology.   It is much easier for me to swing a club than it would be for a caveman to use a taser. ",
