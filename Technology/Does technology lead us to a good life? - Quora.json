            "answer_text": "Hm, it is really a long debate topic. It seems like an essay topic. I would like to try my shot. It leads to a good life and it doesn\u2019t lead to a good life either at the same time. It entirely depends on how an individual defines a good life. I personally believe that technology is just a tool, and people use that tool to build a good life. A car shortens your 10 hours long way to 20 minutes long way, and internet makes searching, learning and communicating much and damn much easier than it used to be. Laundry machines in your house help your cleaning clothes a lot. I can\u2019t imagine an single American locking themselves in the bathroom and washing their clothes in the sink with their hands. No way, right!! All of them bring you productivity, comfort and much easier way of living that is defined as a good life by some people. Personally, I would prefer the presence of advanced techs as in our current life than not in many decades ago. However, there are also some people that define a good life in different way such as living in mountains in harmony with nature, and bhla bhla, and some people think that people are becoming extremely lazy and that laziness is causing many health problems in society. As the coin has two sides, every single thing in the world has pros and cons. So once again it entirely depends on your definition of a good life. And I believe that people at the moment is entirely un-separable part of technologies, and no going back to non-existing technologies era. And accepting technologies as a way to make your life good is also actually another way to make your life good. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all to give a little reference, I am currently a college-going student who uses phones and laptops (basically technology) quite a large amount of my time. Coming back to your question Does technology lead us to a good life? Here \u201cgood life\u201d can have many interpretations. ( like someone having an acute ailment might consider being healthy a good life, someone working 24*7 but not getting enough recognition might consider having it to be a good life..etc.,) In general, technology does make things quite simple. You need something and in the blink of an eye you get it, thats technology. In Education- Technology helps in Education. It helps to learn further and explore and research things apart from what is being taught. These days, there are a variety of mobile phone applications that give us answers within a touch of a button. The Internet is extremely helpful to one to prepare for competitive exams like the SAT, CAT, etc.In Healthcare- Although using technology detoriates health conditions but it works as a tool of education. Anyone and everyone can gather knowledge about health.There could be many more other points that could be delved deeper. As a whole, technology does play a part in having a \u201cgood life\u201d as it nurtures the two basic fundamentals of human life namely education and health.. And that's the reason why\u2026  The answer got a little big. But hope it helps!! ",
