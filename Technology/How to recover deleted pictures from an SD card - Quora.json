            "answer_text": "SD cards play a significant role in enlarging the storage capacity of your phone. You can easily switch sd cards when one gets full. This small device comprises a large number of pictures and videos. If you want to recover a picture or a certain file from the SD card then here are two simple ways to do so. Method 1: Recover by using ZAR (for Windows users): The first thing you must do is stop accessing the SD card. If the files have been erased accidentally, there is still a chance that the data is there and has not been overwritten. As soon as you stop accessing the SD card, higher the chances that the data is still there.Download the ZAR demo version from the developer's website.On the ZAR's website, there is an option of \"image recovery\" at the bottom of the page. Doing so will enable you to download the demo version.Through an SD card reader insert the SD card in your PC. Or you can insert SD card in your camera and connect your camera to PC through USB cableLaunch the ZAR software and tap on the \"image recovery (free)\" option.Under the heading of \"Disks and partitions\" click on your SD card. Tap \"Next\".The next page will display a list of images that the software found on your SD card. Select the images that you want to recover, or you can also select \"All\" to restore all the lost images. You may not get the option to preview them, and the filenames will probably be different.Create a new folder on your computer and start copying the pictures.Note: you might not be able to retrieve some pictures as they may be partially or fully damaged. Method 2: Recover using Data Rescue 3 (for Mac users) The first thing you must do is stop accessing the SD card. If the files have been erased accidentally, there is still a chance that the data is there and has not been overwritten. As soon as you stop accessing the SD card, higher the chances that the data is still thereDownload the Data Rescue 3 software and run it on your Mac.Insert the USB card in your Mac, however, in case your Mac does not have a USB slot, then use an external USB card reader to insert USB into Mac.From the main homepage of the software, select the option of \"Start Recovering Files\".The next window will exhibit a list of drivers. Look out for your SD card and tap on it.After that, you will be asked to select the scan method. Select the option of \"Deleted Files scan\". And click the \"Start button\".If this method does not produce any results, you can come back and try a \"Quick Scan\" followed by a \"Deep Scan\".Once the scan is completed, your screen will display the files that you can recover. Tick the boxes next to the file's name. Select those files that you want to recover.Quick or Deep Scan files can be discovered in the \"Found Files\" section, while the Deleted Files or Deep Scan files can be discovered in the \"Reconstructed Files\" section.You can also preview files. Some damaged files might not be available for previewAfter you have made your selection, simply click on the Recover button and choose a location on your Mac where you want to save the files. Click Open after finding an appropriate location for your files.",

For the record, in-camera format is nearly always a quick format \u2014 there rarely any reason to fully format an SD card, and it wears it out faster. I have heard of situations in which Windows wouldn\u2019t recognize an SD card at all, but Linux would. PhotoRec runs on Linux, Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD, etc. It works at the device driver level, below the file system, so it doesn\u2019t actually care if your SD card can be recognize by the OS.

How to undelete a file for file system [file system name]. You should get search results and links to a utility which will enable you to do an undelete.However, if you have deleted the photo, and subsequently taken photos afterwards, it is possible the file has been overwritten, and therefore you would no longer be able to access the the photo in the file system. In that case the fuller the memory card, the higher the probability you will be unable to recover your photo. ",
