So, you would develop a code involving (on/off) patterns with precise durations for each state. For example, 3 second ON2 seconds OFF4 seconds ONThis would be \"read\" by your rereceiver and decoded to do something specific. How fast you can flash your led and still decode it would decide how much data you can transmit per unit time. ",
