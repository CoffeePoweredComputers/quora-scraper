            "answer_text": "This question has nothing to do with the politically induced scam and hysteria relating to CO2 emissions. (morphed into climate change) LISTEN to their concerns and deal with them in an honest and pragmatic way and avoid at all costs bringing the above hysteria into the conversation. Most of the concerns about the environment are to do with local or specific issues. The main message being that as individuals we all need to attempt to put more into the environment etc. than we individually take from it. There are endless examples of where a simple change in mindset towards that end will contribute. ",

Don\u2019t tell them how much it will benefit someone else. Don\u2019t tell them that their posterity demands it. Don\u2019t tell them that it is their civic duty. Show them - prove to them - that as they move in that direction there is a measurable benefit to them (not just warm fuzzy feelings.) ",
