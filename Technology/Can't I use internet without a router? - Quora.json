            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to make sure of your meaning with this question. Here\u2019s an answer that is technically correct: It is possible, but probably not with modern equipment. To get on the internet, you need a contract with a service provider, a modem, and a computer. You will need to connect your computer to the modem. A router is usually included with the modem, because it allows more than one device to share the internet connection. But it is not required if you don\u2019t need to share the connection. If you want to connect with a phone, you will need WiFi. The router/modem usually has a WiFi access point. WiFi requires a router, because there is a built-in assumption that the WiFi signal will be available to more than one device. So, you can connect without a router provided you have a service contract, a modem, an Ethernet cable, and a computer. This is how dial-up connections used to work. The modem either was inside the computer, or connected with a serial cable. *However*, modern computers all use Ethernet, and assume a router will be available to set important Ethernet parameters. I\u2019m not sure how one would get around this. Connecting without a router using modern equipment would be difficult at best, and maybe not possible. I don\u2019t know of any Ethernet modem that doesn\u2019t include a router. If that doesn\u2019t answer your question, here\u2019s an alternate answer. In the US, you can get on the internet for free at most public libraries, many stores, and some restaurants. Just connect your device to their public or guests WiFi. Sometimes their WiFi will require a password. Sometimes you will have to go to their site and accept their terms and conditions. Retail outlets sometimes limit the amount of time you can be connected. In this case, the library or store provides everything you need except the computer or phone (including a router). If you don\u2019t have a computer, libraries will usually also make the computer available for free. None of these options will be fast enough for gaming, but it doesn\u2019t get any more free than that. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: How do I get a WiFi/broadband connection at home without routers? You can get an Internet connection over DSL/Cable/Fibre cabled connections or satellite or cellular wireless delivery. In some locations there are ISPs that offer very localised WiFi, but these are not common. With cabled and satellite connections you need a modem to convert the ISP signal into a digital signal for connection to a device or a router. Generally, without a router you can connect only one device to the modem. You could have a wireless access point, but it would support only a single device. Remember, WiFi is an alternative to an Ethernet connection, and with the exception of the localised ISP provided WiFi I mentioned above, WiFi does not come from the ISP but is produced by your router or access point. I suspect you should reconsider your \u201cwithout routers\u201d requirement. ",

            "answer_text": "You simply cannot get WiFi (a wireless network connection technology) without a router. Without a router, your wireless devices would have nothing to communicate with. However, the modem which your Internet Service Provider gives you may contain a built-in router. If you want a wired Internet connection for only one device, and you don\u2019t care at all about security, you can live without a router[1]. A router is responsible for linking multiple devices together and for protecting you. It has a firewall which can protect your home Internet from cyberattacks. You can plug your computer directly into your modem using an Ethernet cable and get a working Internet connection, but you would be directly exposing it to the Internet. Anyone with some skills could hack into it and use it to host content for an illegal website. Footnotes[1] Do I Need a Router if I Only Have One Computer?",

            "answer_text": "OK this will be extremely hard to do with out a SITE router but there are routers everywhere. Buy a Switch Buy, a WIFI Access Point (this is different from a WIFI Router). Get yourself Static IPs from your PROVIDER, each device MUST have its own unique address. This is Known as a POOL of IPs. you can get 1, 5, and there are others depending on package. A POOL of 5 will have 7 IPs one for the Gateway and one for the Modem leaving 5 usable IPs in the Subnet provided by the Provider. Have the modem put in \u201cBRIDGE\u201d mode this turns OFF the Routing capability of the Modem it can also turn off the WIFI that is built in (that\u2019s why you buy the WIFI Access Point). Also good so you do not need to change the SSID (WIFI name) each time the Modem gets swapped out our you change providers. Program the TCPIP stack in each device to one of these IPs in your Pool. I was thinking you might could use a Switch with DHCP turned on inside but then you would still need a router to use the Internal non-routable IPs and route those onto the Internet. Ok you may now BOW to my greatness and kiss the ring. LOL I make 120.00 per hour and get paid 300.00 to start my truck before driving to a customers site. This was a fun exercise. ",

All other stuff like nat, dhcp, and routing or connecting multiple devices does router. It is possible to connect to the internet with only modem but just one device remember the number 255.255.255.255 that means only one device on the net and that is possible only with modem modem doesn't have wifi has only one port for router which does the rest and don't mix up router with csu-dsu device which is actually switch/router/modem combo. So router is a device which allows multiple devices to communicate on lan. Just for it self without modem router is not capable to connect to WAN. And you can always use free net interfaces. If you don't have any you can install program on your own phone break wifi password connect over USB cable and use breakable Wi-Fi access not disturbing anyone because any password is priceless and keep it as a secret as it is yours.

Or Russia. Or South Africa. Or France.

Just sit and picture that for a minute or so. And then another minute. And a minute after that. Because that would be pretty much all you could do for the rest of time if there were no routers throughout the entire world. So - to sum up - no. The internet can\u2019t work without routers because the computers would not know where to send the data. And we would be (not to put too fine a point on it) monumentally fucked.
