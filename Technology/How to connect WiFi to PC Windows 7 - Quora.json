            "answer_text": "First, you need to make sure that your PC can actually connect to WiFi. Most laptops should be able to but some desktop PCs may not be able to because of the lack of a wireless internet card or WiFi extender. Another way to connect to the internet too is by using an Ethernet cable for faster internet speeds. If you have one of these, you should find a little Wireless icon in the bottom right corner of the screen on the taskbar once logged in. Click here, and select the connection you want to use. PS: I suggest not using Windows 7 anymore because it recently lost support by Microsoft and may be unsafe to use ",
