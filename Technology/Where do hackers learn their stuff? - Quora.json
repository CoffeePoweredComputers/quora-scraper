            "answer_text": "It's been a long time for me to write an answer in Quora, this question dragged me in here. Let me answer this question a bit practically. Where did you learn to speak? Is it from the encyclopedia? Or Wikipedia? Absolutely not!You\u2019ve just seen the people around you and learned to speak out. The same applies here. Hackers will do the attacks and do spend a lot of time on research of attacks on how they can be implemented in order to achieve their intention of attack. In simple, Books or Conference videos, more overly the hacker in their brains make them learn all security things without boundary limits. Maybe this sounds funny, but this is the truth! Happy Hack :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Hackers generally practice using books and online sites and are active on deep web which provides a lot of stuff required by them. Deep web is a part on the internet which is not accessible to common internet users ,you can only access it by using certain especial browsers like \u201cTOR BROWSER\u201d.All hackers operate on deep web with their hidden identity and learn their stuff\u2026 All we see as a internet is only a very small part of web . Another one is a dark web which is a part of deep web mainly used for all illegal activities.  Hope u liked it\u2026 ",
