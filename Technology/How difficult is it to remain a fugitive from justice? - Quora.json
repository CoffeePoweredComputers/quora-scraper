            "answer_text": "One of my jobs in anti-money laundering compliance.  Money laundering is a process where people try to hide their financial transactions for various reasons, such as avoiding taxes on cash income, getting illegal money into the banking system, or using illegal money for legal purchases. There are various ways used by financial institutions, other regulated financial businesses, and law enforcement, to detect patterns that could be suspicious and therefore money laundering.  Some of the computer programs used by banks, money transmitters and casinos are very sophisticated.  There are requirements to report certain transactions to the feds, and compliance is enforced through exams conducted by regulators.            While there were laws and regulations to prevent money laundering prior to 9/11, the legal requirements were substantially increased under the Patriot Act for money service businesses (i.e. Western Union and similar businesses).  Recently the regulations were amended to cover certain types of prepaid credit cards. Check cashing stores and \"cash for gold\" businesses are also regulated.  Let's presume for this question that you are on the run and need money to live.  To avoid being detected you have to avoid all regulated financial transactions or those where you have to give ID.  This includes having a job where taxes are withheld under your real name, having a bank account, using a credit card opened in your name, buying a car and renting an apartment.  You would have to live entirely on cash, and it will probably be illegal cash that you either steal or get under the table at an off the books job.  Just getting money increases the potential for getting caught.   In the United States it would be extremely difficult to live even a moderately comfortable life in these circumstances. The best way would be to have someone help you, which is probably why law enforcement concentrates on friends and relatives when they look for fugitives.  This means risking exposure if the person turned against you, talked to the wrong person, or had their own financial transactions pop up on someone's radar as suspicious.  Or you would have to live entirely off the grid in a physical way, for which most people don't have the skills.   Other countries have similar laws and regulations to prevent money laundering and detect criminal activity.  Leaving the U.S. isn't necessarily going to help a criminal avoid detection if he or she has to live on funds received and spent outside a traditional financial system.         Living the high life \"on the lam\" or assuming a new identity is the stuff of thriller fiction books for the most part.  I think it would be extremely difficult to do  successfully and long term in real life. ",

Laws, regulatory requirements and best practices now require actions that will insure a fugitive will eventually show up in a trace. ",
