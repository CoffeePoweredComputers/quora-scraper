            "answer_text": "Charging is best at times when the phone is not being used. Using your phone whilst charging is suggested to result in fatiguing the battery, but more importantly makes it hard for your phone to work out what power is in the battery. Your phone has a way of measuring the charge in the battery and converting that to a gauge on the screen. This can become unsyncronized. There is one reason why some phones appear to suddenly start losing charge, and new batteries seem to make minimal impact. However, charging at night is also bad for the life of the battery as it is overcharging, as well as a fire risk. The best time depends on your lifestyle, but when you are available to unplug your phone once charged up, but not needing to use your phone. Also, best and fastest charging is achieved when the phone is turned off. And it means that you have to take a couple of hours away from your phone\u2026 if you can cope feeling like you are back in the 90\u2019s in the dark ages pre-smartphones ",

            "answer_text": "According to me for long life of battery you should never let it go below 20%. Always take care of your battery percentage and charge your phone whenever you think your percentage is going down. You could also carry a power bank with you if you are going for long tours. Now-a-days very handy power banks are available in market. You should never leave your mobile in charging mode whole night it damages battery a lot. As soon as you get up in morning put your phone in charging mode, so that when you are getting ready for your daily routine your mobile is also getting its part of food... This will help you whole day to keep your mobile as well as you active.So this was my piece of advice.As well as my first answer on quora...Hope you understood... ",

Lithium ion batteries also work more efficiently when it is warm. The best time to charge your phone would be when you wake up in the morning. Leave it alone at night and let it discharge down to 20% or less then charge it to 90% or over. This is the optimal threshold for efficiency and longevity of the battery. ",
