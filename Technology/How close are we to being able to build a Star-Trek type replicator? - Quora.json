            "answer_text": "3D Printing is a pretty decent start. The ability to take a computerised schematic of something physical and \u201cprint\u201d a copy of it would have seemed unfathomable a few decades ago. Metal 3D printing is maturing as a technology, and is set to take industry by storm in the coming years. 4D printing is next; the creation of dynamic products which can be materially programmed; i.e. a part which can be inserted into a narrow opening and 'unfolded' once exposed to a stimulus such as heat. Beyond that? 3D printing of pharmaceuticals is currently being explored. One of many potential use cases of a concept called additive manufacturing. Proper Star Trek replicators, where I can ask for any imaginable food or drink, and it instantly appears, are a long, long way off though. Printing with plastics or metal is one thing, but organic material is something else entirely. Even getting the schematic of something like an apple, an understanding the precise location of each different type of molecule in the shape is a herculean challenge. Even if you manage it, you would need the source chemicals. We can print plastic or metal shapes because we can feed liquid plastic or metal into the machine. But would you have, for example, a source of Vitamin C molecules to feed into your apple printing machine? Star Trek gets around this because their replicators are not additive manufacturing machines, rather they are based on the same technology as their transporters. There are effectively compact energy-to- matter converters. And this is where it, unfortunately, starts to stray into realms of pure fantasy. At least for the foreseeable future. ",

            "answer_text": "(Edit, I got lost in the answer and was talking more about transporters, but at least half of these issues still apply) In brief, the Star Trek conception of a replicator requires the ability to instantly scan and record the exact location and velocity of every particle of a desired target (breaking Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle), harmlessly disassemble that target (nearly unfathomable that this could be done painlessly and without damaging the subject), transmit as close to 100% of those particles across a distance as possible (practically impossible), then reassemble them harmlessly according to the recording you took at the beginning (we don't have a clue of how to do this) and \u201chope\u201d it's the same thing (or person) you took apart at location One. The mere idea of the technology is full of so many holes we don't even know where to begin. ",
