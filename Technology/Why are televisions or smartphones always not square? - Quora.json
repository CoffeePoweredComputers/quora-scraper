            "answer_text": "Square screens are not as aesthetically pleasing to the human eye or as utilitarian as a rectangle. Original TVs were round, then as technology advanced, rectangular tubes became possible. However, as far back as the ancient Greeks, the \u2018golden rectangle\u2019 was recognized as more pleasing to the eye, and was used for proportioning many buildings, including the Parthenon. The ratio of 1:1.62 also has the unique characteristic of scaling sequentially. By adding the previous 2 values, you get the next: 1.00 + 1.62 = 2.62; 1.62 + 2.62 = 4.24; and 4.24/2.63=1.62. The old 4:3 proportions of pre-HD TVs were a technical limitation. 16:9 was much closer to the ideal, and more easily scaled \u2014 16:9 = (4\u00d74) : (3\u00d73) from existing sources. The rest of the story is here: 16:9 aspect ratio - Wikipedia ",
