            "answer_text": "No, for one very simple reason: amateurs want to play the same game as professionals do, within reason. Instant replays also aren\u2019t instant. Cricket has a Decision Review system which takes about a minute to complete. Each team has a limited amount of reviews, and a very limited amount of time to use them if they disagree with the decision. If the original decision was correct, then a review is lost; otherwise the decision is overturned and the review can be used again. Similarly Rugby reviews take a long time, sometimes needing multiple angles and several minutes. They are only used for major decisions, such as scores and foul play. Only the referee can call for them, although their two assistants and also the Television Match Official can call the ref\u2019s attention. I suppose a case could be made that coaches should also be able to ask for a limited number of reviews, but now that the technology is available it gets used. A stronger case could be made that for dangerous play warranting a red card that is missed by all four officials that a manager is aware of could be asked to be brought to the attention of the TMO, but frankly there is already a citing commissioner for that kind of stuff. I don\u2019t follow motorsports much, but apparently there was a review by the stewards that took no less than three hours at the Austrian Grand Prix last weekend - everybody had already left the circuit by the time the winner was officially announced, which is farcical. Would the situation have been improved if a manager had challenged? Not really. At the professional level it is understandable that everybody wants the right decisions made, but oddly enough in sports where multiple people or teams compete the players and their staff often disagree on what those decisions should be. As a referee I\u2019ve had plenty of players respectfully disagree with my decisions, but not once has a player or staff member ever suggested that I should change a decision in their favour! Part of the fun is watching sports is seeing top level athletes force each other to make mistakes. Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cheer, sometimes we groan. Referees and umpires need to be the best that are available, that is to say in many cases top level athletes too, that have sufficient experience to have risen past all the other potentials just as the players have. But they won\u2019t have any experience of using instant replays until they rise to the level where that is used. Top officials are quite capable of realising when they may have missed something and need an instant replay, and yet still keeping tempo in the game. As a rugby man, I can appreciate the skills needed for American Football at the highest level, but having once tried to stay up to watch the Superbowl, I found myself bored to bits before the half-time show due to the number of interruptions. I am given to understand that high-school matches don\u2019t last nearly as long and can understand why they get so many viewers. ",
