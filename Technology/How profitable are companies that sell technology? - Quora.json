            "answer_text": "You're question is a difficult one to answer. I would say that in general it kind of depends upon whether it's a start up or 1 that's already established but in general it's pretty much I think even though I am doing well within my own company as The owner but I would say also that it is probably more competitive than most industries that I am a where of. But to give you an example I live in Austin Texas and I have work for Dell for Cisco for other Japanese but that was when I was in employee am no longer an employee E sometimes I help them out with my consulting skills that that's far different I know in these large companies they hire pretty much every year let they lay off people every year also so it can be a challenge.
