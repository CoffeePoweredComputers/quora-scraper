            "answer_text": "Maybe. Do it yourselfers tend to not get permits\u2026 and sometimes the regulating authority will not say anything. Siding and re-roofing are areas where this is common even if you are supposed to get a permit. But, its still best to get the permit. Many cities now want you to get a building permit for anything other than paint that costs above $250. Ask the city clerk where to go to ask about permits. (it might be the clerk) and then you ask the actual permitting office if you need a permit. The local inspector had me fill out the forms for a permit in order to do one project\u2026 came and checked a few times and gave advice and never charged the fees\u2026 because what I was doing didn\u2019t really need a permit. Overall a nice guy who just wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t wasting my time and money by doing it wrong...And now he is easy to get along with when I have an idea for another project. ",
