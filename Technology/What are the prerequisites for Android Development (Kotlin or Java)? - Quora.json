            "answer_text": "Even though you can do Android Development with either Kotlin or Java with equal ease, I personally feel Java is more suited to get initiated in to Android Development. The main reason is Java as programming language is all purvasive. Pretty much all universities have Java in their curriculum if they have programming in their curriculum. I am yet to meet a developer who says that I don't know Java. So Java is minimum prerequisite to get started with Android Development. But once you are good at Java, it's kind of good to be familiar with Kotlin. To understand why Kotlin is important for Android you may have look at this answer which I had answered some time back : Anil V Deshpande's answer to How is the Kotlin language important for Android?
