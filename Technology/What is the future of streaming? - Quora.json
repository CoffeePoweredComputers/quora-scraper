            "answer_text": "What is the future of streaming?  Mike Rice \u00b7 Add Credential Answered 3m ago It will replace using bandwidth which takes up major space in Cable\u2019s fiber optics delivery system. I would estimate there are 200 or more companies offering streaming variations on the cable line up as we speak. A friend in Cali told me he was getting streaming from Hulu which duplicated a pretty large group of cable only services. Hulu, to me, was a streamer, which carried reruns from cable and on air television, along with the miniseries The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. I went online though and discovered Hulu is one of the few streaming cable alternatives offering Turner Classic Movies. So I went deeper, found Hulu is offering that package of programming for $44.95. All the cable companies are quietly sending junk mail to their internet only, internet-phone only, customers who have dropped cable television, offering a lower cost streaming service. Their customers who have cable service never hear about this cheaper streaming service. There\u2019s some confusion even with my friend. Since I\u2019ve been dealing with streaming that looks fine with slower, simpler telephone company internet that provides 10 megabytes per second internet speed, I know that is enough for smooth un-jittery pictures. Cable customers are worried that if they shift to streaming, the cable company will bump up their cable internet price as a penance for dropping their cable service. A phone company near me charges $45 plus five bucks plus, worth of idiot state taxes, for internet service that is 10 times faster at 100 megs, for a little under $70 including tax. But one only needs 10 to stream perfectly. Once streaming becomes the new cable distribution method, I expect new variations on the internet will spring up to go mano a mano against the now all powerful cable company internet. On the one hand, there is already enormous streaming cable competition nationwide in the US. But there are sometimes very few competitive rural area internet services available to run it over. The Big Four (soon to be three) cellular companies are in the process of melding into cable systems, while tradish cable is now offering wireless (I.e. cellphone) service in the areas Cable has wired. Mostly its the famished big cell operations that want desperately into the cash-laden cable business. Ten years from now there may be little difference between the two systems, all depending on how the government regulation and the competing system history, shake down and play out, over time. ",

            "answer_text": "There are already more than 300 streaming services available. And that doesn\u2019t even include planned launches from media and tech giants like Disney, Apple, Warner Media, Viacom, and NBC Universal in the months ahead. As these services come online, the already crowded streaming landscape is going to get even more complex and confusing. And while choice can be a good thing, it\u2019s also a big consumer challenge. According to Deloitte, 47% of people feel that there are already too many streaming services, and people are 10x less likely to find a satisfactory result when presented with more choice. This emphasizes the need for a solution that helps consumers navigate the journey of what to watch and where to find it. And while streaming services are eager to provide recommendations to their customers, those recommendations only take into account what that individual service knows about that consumer\u2019s viewing history. At Likewise we make it easy for people to recommend the things they enjoy across all of these services, share what services they subscribe to, and get great recommendations for other shows and movies they will love. And it also lets them share these recommendations with their friends, which is not only a lot of fun, but leads to much better recommendations. ",
