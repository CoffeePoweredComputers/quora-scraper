            "answer_text": "He\u2019s a problem solver par excellence so he would be doing that in many fields. He would not be an artist first. Even though he brought the sensibility of an artist as well as a designer to all he did. I could see him studying physics because the underlying nature of things consumed him. He had the urge & capacity to stare at a small waterfall, see & sketch exactly what happened to the water when it landed. To anyone else it just disappears into the water it falls into. To Leonardo it became evident it went to all sides & underneath & up again in various patterns, currents & rhythms. Which he sketched to what degree & force it did these things (not all to the same extent he showed). He also wanted to know everything about aerodynamics which he discovered many centuries (at least 4) before the rest of the world, inventing the airplane (in all but the power source, the engine) & an equally correct helicopter. Therefore like many physicists I don\u2019t see him staying in that field, consumed as he was, to work with, design & create powerfully effective things to channel these forces. He was ever mindful of commercial success as well, even if he didn\u2019t let it compromise his passion for Art. When he was looking for work he presented the most ingenious weaponry designs to ingratiate himself with royalty he wished to have hire him. The tank was one such invention he thus presented. He did some remarkable mechanical engineering for the church to raise parts of a stage allied with strategically created smoke to create a magical effect & much else. I could see him doing engineering work for some corporation & eventually going freelance and/or having his own start up. He\u2019d be extremely inventive in channelling some fundamental, scientific principles into work that would manifest in society in the most dramatically, powerful ways. Luck of the draw as to where he would start. Medical devices, nuclear energy, environmental solutions in terms of alternative power sources or maximizing efficiency in current ones, applying quantum physics to computing or elsewhere - he could do it all in terms of the fundamentals & to some meaningful extent, would likely try & then work towards manifesting them in real time. He was one the highest paid artists in the world once offering one of his works he wanted to move at a significant discount to a Duke, who still turned it down because it was still so fabulously expensive. He liked making money & certainly would\u2019ve been a wealthy man today by leveraging his talents in the tech & related world. As for making Art, he\u2019d do that too - on the side (perhaps owning a gallery) & when/if he retired. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly? He'd probably be flipping burgers for a living. The reason I say that is that Da Vinci was infamous during his lifetime as a serial procrastinator. He would often start works and never finish them. In fact, very few of his works were ever finished. The Mona Lisa took him a decade and a half to complete, and some say he was never truly satisfied with it. In 67 years he finished a whopping 15 paintings in total. Many of the \"great works\" attributed to him, like the Vitruvian Man or his flying machines, are actually nothing but notebook doodles he made in his spare time. Da Vinci was able to survive as an artist because the few works he was able to finish were so spectacular and because artists were very much glorified during the Renaissance. Being a patron to a famous artist was very fashionable then, so patrons were willing to overlook his, well let's not mince words, his laziness. But today artists are nowhere near as venerated, and extreme procrastination is not tolerated. ",

As a boy in the public education system, he'd be more readily diagnosed with the ADHD he probably had. The medication he received would allow him to work more efficiently, completing projects on time and so forth. His insatiable curiosity would be satisfied by public libraries and the internet. All of the above would result in a stellar academic performance that would open every university's doors to him. And whether by scholarships, student loans, or the rich father who might decide he wants the prestige of his son's accomplishments, he'd go to the best of the best, probably majoring in engineering and minoring in fine arts, accomplishing much the same as he did during his actual lifetime. Except probably not as an anatomist. ",

If he had the money then he could get away with living the same type of life he did in the Renaissance. Basically, being a brilliant but somewhat lazy, yet obsessive, perfectionist.  But with no money.... in these days he would have had to struggle his way through to college, being pushed towards something secure. He's probably end up a High School Math teacher slowly working through his many and varied creative pursuits in his spare time. ",

He would be founder and CEO of \"Custom printing of ART on dresses\", his art would be compelling to buy \"today\" as his art was compelling in \"his time\". His 3D art on dresses would be like living in a 4D world :DHis ideas would make that company more famous than any social networking site in today's life. Note: These \"ideas\" do not exist now :D A BILLIONAIRE basically I guess :P Example site: Custom T-Shirt Printing Edit: Another thing if he would be in today's world is 2. He would be the founder of \"World Space Research Center\" similar to NASA but way more advanced in technology, exploration and more.Technologies in Men in Black, Iron Man, Back to the future etc would have been a reality. :D ",

Leverage in terms of putting together a staff to implement his designs and 2.) drawing on others work to incorporate into his newer designs. 3.) addressing problems that were waiting for solutions funded by \"patrons\". I assume that if he were alive today those skills would benefit him greatly. he would go looking for problems to be solved that would give him visibility and would pay him enough to continue his work. Finding those areas today is difficult, but I imagine it was 1500 also. ",

He made discoveries, and invented, and was rather well-rounded. In today's world, we are usually much more specialized in our endeavors, so I would think da Vinci would gravitate to something very interdisciplinary. Perhaps a professor at a research university, doing something along the lines of engineering, pushing the boundaries.  He would have multiple graduate degrees in disparate fields. ",

Both of them are brilliant, but, after a while, I realised that I can\u2019t see other similarities apart from brilliance. Da Vinci was a polymath. He was a scientist, artist, architect, historian etc. But, he rarely ever finished what he started. Honestly, I have no idea what would he be doing if he was born in today\u2019s world. Maybe, with our technology, he would come up with something extraordinary, any field given. Or maybe, just beacuse he \u2018rerely ever finished what he started\u2019, he would be like everybody else, a normal human. ",

            "answer_text": "Da Vinci is romanticized as a prolific inventor and genius, yet as many others have commented most of his work was conceptual and unfinished. It was very common for the rich of his era to support artists, it was the thing to do, but not so much today. I suspect Leonardo would have difficulty making a living with his conceptual work as the business world of the 21st century is result oriented. However in today's world wealthy patronage has been replaced to some degree with government assistance, so maybe Da Vinci might live on the dole while he painted and played with conceptual ideas. The good news for Leo is that in today's world he could come out of the closet without any fears of social or financial reprisal. ",

The Swiss historian Jakob Burkhard said that Leonardo Da Vinci was the clearest and most explanatory example of the concept of Man of the Renaissance, precisely because of the multiplicity and complexity of his interests. In today's hyper-technological society, where specialization and fragmentation of the field of study are everything, a man like Leonardo would find it very difficult to adapt. Perhaps he would be a passable theoretical physicist, or a mathematician with a tenure somewhere ... but he would not be a happy and accomplished man as he was in the Renaissance. ",
