            "answer_text": "This question has a few caveats and answering it properly requires some modifications to the question. First: is it possible? Yes, theoretically, well, most things are possible in the broad sense of the word, but it could still make no sense to do something. It is also possible for me to win Olympic gold medal running (jumping) the Marathon on one leg. But saying that it is theoretically possible gives us no useful information. Many things are possible in this sense. For example, the most straightforward way to do this Full RE100% would be for most of the people to die suddenly, leaving only a handful living somewhere with no access to other energy than what is classified as Renewable. So there would be a \u201ccost\u201d in human lives, and since the question was \u201cregardless of cost\u201d this meets the criteria. Almost the same end result would be achieved if there was some sort of mass-psychosis where people just stopped using everything else but RE. A lot of people would die inside a few months, since their lives are more or less completely dependent on fossil fuels and modern energy and the technologies that use these energy sources. This makes such mass-psychosis unlikely to last for long. But of course, all of this makes no sense in the real world, as these things are not likely to happen even if they are possible. Cost, and not just monetary, but cost in a broader sense, is probably the most important metric for evaluating \u201chow\u201d possible (or probable, or feasible, or desirable) something would be. To answer the original question shortly with some added criteria: Is it practically or politically possible in a reasonable time-frame? No. Too many people (almost all of us) get enormous value and their lives depend on using fossil fuels for the time being. Ramping up alternative energy sources takes time and energy (which is currently 85 % fossil fuels so for a long time we would be doing the transition with fossil fuels powering it). Does RE100% make sense as a goal? Not really. What we want to move towards is a low-carbon, low-environmental-impact, high net-energy and low cost energy supply as fast as possible (meaning, with as little negative disruption to people\u2019s lives as possible, since that is a prerequisite for political feasibility as well). I\u2019m simplifying a lot here to save space (I have written a couple books on the subject in English and Finnish so I could use a lot more space here, believe me :)). This would exclude some renewable energy sources and include nuclear energy in its various forms. Perhaps even some Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) here and there. The best mix of these would depend on local circumstances. As a final note, I want to include the fact that electricity is only about a fifth of global energy use. Decarbonizing industrial process heat and household/commercial sector heat, transportation fuels and other lesser uses of energy and fuel uses will be a huge undertaking, one that we have not yet even started talking about.

Once we get past the irrational subsidy panic of solar energy production and put it back on a more competitive and sustainable business model, then it may well become a very common design element in nearly every single family home built. Solar technology is already capable of powering single family homes. That will only improve in the future. It also is NOT capable of powering grid level loads and won\u2019t be able to do that until we resolve the technical problem of grid level load storage capacity. It is likely that we will find other renewable energy sources to be more effective, efficient and cost-effective before we resolve that storage problem. These other sources might include hydrogen, fuel cells, MHD, and newer designs for nuclear reactors. Of course, there will be those that argue that nuclear can never be \u201crenewable\u201d but it is more likely that we will reconsider what \u201crenewable\u201d means. If you fill up the fuel tank of an energy production facility once every 40 years, then for all practical purposes, that is a renewable energy source. Such is the nature of the newest nuclear reactor designs. We will eventually outgrow the irrational fear of nuclear energy as the general public (very slowly) learns to ignore the fear mongers and the sensationalist news media in favor of hard core statistics and scientific facts. Fission and breeder reactors in a 5th Gen reactor designs are almost certainly inevitable simply out of the pure economics and practically of their production capability. It comes down to \u201cenergy density\u201d. In the future, our demand for electrical power will grow very large and it is unlikely that wind and solar will be a practical solution. Yes, it might be capable but not practical as compared with much more compact and efficient nuclear plants - like molten salt or pebble bed reactors. One nuclear plant can produce 500+ MW peak or over 12,000 MWh per year on about 15 acres of land. By comparison, the largest solar PV farm (in India) covers 247 acres with 120,000 panels and is rated at peak power to produce 20 MW or about 480 MWh per year (when you apply the industry accepted Capacity Utilisation Factors (CUF)). Most of the hype about solar is unfounded, exaggerated or only applies under ideal (laboratory) conditions. Real world experience is much different than the industry and advocate describe\u2026.

            "answer_text": "Is 100% renewable energy possible? It\u2019s the ONLY energy system that is viable long term. Solar, and wind plus a day of pumped hydro and battery storage can provide 99% or so of total grid electrical demand. Waste recycling for hydrocarbon fuels allows existing reserve generators to backup the grid as necessary, provide the long haul air and sea transport fuels and the chemical feedstocks we need. It also eliminates dumping which pollutes including 5% of GHG from humans. This is not incineration or \u201cwaste to energy\u201d, this is closed chamber thermal pyrolysis type processing to convert wastes to salable hydrocarbon gases, liquids, charcoal. plus scrap ready metals and glasses. No exhaust, no emissions. Electrically powered so it can make good use of excess solar and wind. Using the charcoal as a soil amendment can double the productivity of poor soils and will sequester the carbon for hundreds of years: waste recycling can be carbon negative. (Biochar) Along the way we will convert near 100% of ground vehicles to electrics and most short haul air and sea transport. For short range air and sea transport, electric versions cost 80% less to operate. The long haul air and sea use the hydrocarbons from recycling our wastes. Everything we can will be electrified. For instance steel is now being made without coke using hydrogen instead, created electrically. There are no technical nor market barriers to going 100% renewable in 10 years if we push. The world is on track, based on historical growth rates, to be 100% renewable in a decade or two. 2030 to 2040, not 2050. Renewable is now cheaper for most people in most places. Meanwhile fossils pollution is killing millions of people per year and driving the climate irreversibly into new and less human friendly climates. Remember renewable has become cheaper without government subsidies or breaks in just the last few years. We need to do this ASAP. Going renewable will save millions of lives and trillions of dollars per year.  Brian Donovan's answer to Can solar power become a major power source in the coming 20 years? If so, why?

            "answer_text": "Q: Regardless of cost and interest, is it possible for all countries to use 100% renewable energy? Short answer: No. Questions involving absolute terms like none, all, or 100% simply stunt progress. It\u2019s about balance and a path forward  Sure it\u2019s possible in one context.  So barring the end of what we call civilization and the economy, I must take exception to the 100% premise proposed by the OP. How is one building electrical generation infrastructure or batteries without chemicals and material derived from the petrol chemical industry? Once built, nothing is 100% recyclable. There would need to be new material added to the stream. This question would need to be modified to include some form or allowance for carbon offsets or carbon buy-back. One cannot put windmills and transmission lines in place without cranes and bulldozers and as yet they require fuel. Consider the modern basis of our technology and manufacturing sector. Given modern technology and manufacturing, so much from medicine to agriculture would need to be \u201creinvented\u201d. We often forget the \u201coil/energy\u201d sector is really the \u201cpetrol-chemical\u201d sector. Every electrical device I have had experience with has been constructed with or made use of materials derived from the petrol-chemical sector. Given the process of extracting many of these chemicals, there are byproducts which are best used or disposed of as energy products. If we have electric cars, where is one getting the asphalt for the roads? Again, many things would need to be innovated and many others reinvented. As yet, the most efficient form of harnessing solar power is photosynthesis. Many talk of bio-plastic alternatives. The late Dr. Albert Bartlett defined modern agriculture as the process of converting fossil fuel into food. If we were to transition to manufacturing products derived and or synthesized from \u201cgrown material\u201d then the silviculture industry would have to ramp up to significant levels and much of agriculture, aquaculture effort would need to be diverted. That could have devastating consequences. I live in an area where a wood stove in the neighborhood gives a smell of days gone by. If everyone in the neighborhood had a wood-stove, the particulate alone would be hazardous. While I have seen some of the \u201cold ways\u201d practiced as a hobby; pitch, tar, and coal was still part of their construction. Applied today scrubbers can get the ash and sulfur emissions down. The old ways weren't always so grand. I still occasionally want my BBQ (is charcoal carbon-negative, I believe it is). Questions involving absolute terms like all or 100% simply stunt progress. It\u2019s about balance and a path forward given the current state as a starting point. There are no black and white answers in this world. Progress is one step at a time. ",

            "answer_text": "If we don't consider cost or the time to manufacture and install equipment , we can fully transition to 100% renewable energy tomorrow! Ok, enough hyperbole. In reality, it would take a bit longer since production capacity needs to be expanded and this takes time. If the entire world were involved, this could perhaps be carried out in as little as 10 years. Regardless of time, the most important point is that today\u2019s technology doesn't need any fundamental advances to take the world renewable - 100% renewable energy is 100% possible. The biggest challenge we face over the next 30 years, or until 2050 arrives, is how to transition legacy systems to renewables in a manner that (1) doesn't interrupt peoples\u2019 lives and that (2) doesn't break the bank. Incidentally, some argue that breaking the bank is exactly what should be done. Investing in new technology, production methods and advanced systems will give rise to new industries far exceeding the losses made in the decline of the fossil fuel industry. At the core of energy management today, it is not a question of \u201cwhether the technology is ready\u201d but rather \u201cwhich measures should be implemented first\u201d, \u201cwho are the key decision makers\u201d and \u201cwhich transition path will generate the least emissions.\u201d Thanks for reading!

If you have a grid that wraps all the way around the world, it would always be possible to send energy from the sunlit parts to the dark parts, 24/7. Not that long ago, I read that it\u2019s currently economical to transmit power up to 6000 miles (unfortunately, I no longer seem to have the link to that paper), so with few technical improvements, we could send solar power anywhere on the globe. You wouldn\u2019t even need batteries. Just a grid that would function over borders (probably the biggest hurdle to overcome). Would we \u201cthrive?\u201d. I don\u2019t see how we couldn\u2019t. Nobody would be fighting over oil, at least. If you wanted to limit your distribution to a few thousand miles, then you could always use battery back-up to compensate for weather in certain parts of the country. But batteries are polluters, though there have been major improvements in that area. They also considerably increase the cost of the installation, vs a pure solar full-Earth-grid.

Bonaire houses 12 wind turbines that generate almost all of its power. The country is also developing a system that would use local algae to create biofuel. Costa Rica: Costa Rica\u2019s president announced that the country had been running on 100 percent renewable energy since the start of 2015 and is working on plans to become carbon neutral within the next six years. They\u2019re investing in hydropower and geothermal power (volcanoes!) and considering wind and solar options as well.

            "answer_text": "If you skip the constraints of economics then it is completely possible. However, we should keep in mind that the production capacity should be very high than the actual demand (load). This is because of the curse attached to renewable: uncertainty and unreliability. For example, in a region close to equator, hourse of operation of PV plants is ~4000 hours/year. This means that we should incorporate some storage units which further costs money (here we don't care about) and efficiency losses. This eventually would force to increase renewable energy capacity further. If we mix various sources of renewable energy, say, wind with PV panels, then also we would require some storage units as they do not perfectly overlay each other. However, it would improve as the daily peaks for solar appear in day time when typically wind suffers production troughs. For getting an idea, if we talk about a standalone microgrid to have 99% renewable penetration we would have to waste ~67% of energy production. This means we need huge capacity as compared to actual demands. This is just an example and actual figures may vary depending on many factors like geographical location, demand-supply etc. Therefore, in order to have a 100% renewable system we need many infrastructural changes which could be much higher generation capacities, ample amount of storage system or super-grid which could have connectivity across the globe to attain a balance of frequency (signifies demand-generation proportion) by handling energy peaks and troughs.

The snag in a pure renewable economy is that you can have stretches of time in which there\u2019s not much wind and it\u2019s cloudy. Now what? Some uses of electricity require a continuous supply. If you\u2019re smelting aluminum, you need to keep going. A long power interruption can lead to the ruin of expensive equipment. Hospitals need uninterruptible power. Airports. Flood control pumps. And there is more. Now in principle one might build banks of batteries, but batteries are expensive. Their natural use is as short-term storage. The last few percent of \u201c100%\u201d will be extra expensive. You\u2019ll have to make jet fuel from scratch, for example, with chemicals derived from biological processes or reactions driven by electricity. A 90% carbon-free economy would perhaps suffice to stabilize the climate. There are, after all, natural processes which take CO2 out of the atmosphere. The white cliffs of Dover are made of calcium carbonate. So we don\u2019t have to get to absolute zero emissions to get to stability. And at 90%, even ignoring those natural processes, we\u2019ll have ten times as long to come up with technology that bridges the last 10% gap. Now the good news is that nuclear power need not be all that expensive. France has already built and maintained for decades a largely nuclear infrastructure. The other good news is that wind and solar need not be all that expensive. Costs have been plummeting. Some free market deals have been struck (Chile, India, UAE) for solar electricity at wholesale rates of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. Wind, too, is becoming more economical. It is also possible to move electricity from where it is generated to where it will be used with much less transmission loss than now is usual. Use direct current high voltage lines. So we can harvest the wind and the sun in the plains and deserts, and transmit the resulting electricity to cities several hundred miles, or 1000 miles, away. It\u2019s doable. And the larger the scale of our networks, the less the problem of interruptions in supply. The desert is reliably sunny most of the year. The high plains are reliably windy. And if all else fails, most users can be put on short rations for a while and priority users can carry on, their electricity drawn from nuclear power plants. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you classify renewable energy as, and if you\u2019re talking about total energy or just electricity. It\u2019s important to note that renewable energy has been classified in a variety of ways that either include or remove sources of energy. For example, according to US Renewable Portfolio Standards, hydroelectric is not considered renewable, but according to the Solutions-Project by Mark Jacobson hydroelectric is renewable. This is important to recognize, because there are some countries that do not have preferable access to forms of solar, or do not have enough resources to physically produce enough units for wind or solar production in their particular countries. Now if you\u2019re including the possibility that all countries would trade resources regardless of economics to provide these technologies to other countries, then you would resolve part of \\ this issue. The second and greater question is whether or not you mean total energy or electrical energy generation. This distinction determines if you are talking about solely covering electricity consumption for a country, or if you are talking about all industries that use energy. If you are talking about the latter, and thus total energy then 100% renewable is impossible. This is because there are fundamental industries that require products, which renewables can never produce. For example slag from coal is an aggregate used in cement production. This use of coal is counted in total energy, but not in electricity generation. There is no renewable technology that can replace slag. There are many substitutes for petrochemical commodities, but some materials cannot be replaced with adequate substitutes. There is currently no known substitute that can replace 100% of hydrocarbons in asphalt; therefore, the energy product needed to produce this material is not going to be a \u201crenewable energy product\u201d.

The lion share of the difficulties up to 99% can be overcome with batteries and other storage technology. The cost of storage is coming down and will reach the inflection point in the next few years. As progress on renewables is behind in most locations there is no gap to talk about. The final 1% is not an issue for about 50 years because there will still be Nuclear power stations which have yet to be decommissioned at that point. Whether we build more Nuclear to carry the 1% going forward or whether another solution arises is hard to say at this point (my preference would be tidal, but it is a tough argument at this point). Note: I notice that your comment is very narrow and excludes many options. Excluding hydro in particular, makes this problem very hard and perhaps impossible in some locations. BTW the best renewable energy is energy which is not wasted. Addressing wasteful energy usage pulls percentages up much faster than alternative spending. ",

However, the price of energy storage is still too high, and the approach is only viable in countries where electricity from the power grid is very expensive. Many things need to happen for the world to use 100% renewable energy: Combined renewable generation + energy storage has to become cheaper than coal-based generation. Hydroelectricity can help, since it can provide energy on demand just like fossil fuel power plants, but site conditions limit hydroelectricity.Electric vehicles have to become more affordable than gas cars.Airplanes still rely on fossil fuels. Mankind will have to develop an aircraft that can use renewable energy somehow.",
