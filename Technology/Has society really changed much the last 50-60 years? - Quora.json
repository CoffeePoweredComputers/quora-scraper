            "answer_text": "Quite a bit; but mostly by making things better that were already here. Computers of all sorts everywhere and their applications and ramifications are the single biggest, exponential, one time outside the envelope jump in the last 50 years. Television supplanted radio. Man walked on the moon. African-Americans finally got a shot at human rights (although implementation of that ideal today still has a way to go.) Pretty much everything else is re-purposing and improving and expanding upon what was already here. For a short while, the joke was that the biggest benefit from the space program was the instant orange drink powder, Tang. Computers put that joke to bed. Now look at happened 50\u2013100 years ago. My mother (1918\u20131999), her mother (189x-1985), and my father (1913\u20131980) all got to experience for the first time in human history and within their lifetimes by 1950: ubiquitous indoor plumbing, hot and cold running water on demand; electricity spread across the country and was wired into the homes they lived in; the telephone; climate controlled living and working environments\u2014heating at least; an automobile in everyone\u2019s backyard instead of a horse. Woman got the vote. Antibiotics. Immunization (e.g. polio in 1955. Historic Dates and Events Related to Vaccines and Immunization) Of those two scenarios, which one could you more easily do without and throw away? The one you keep is where the really big changes happened. Diet, public sanitation, immunization jumped the average life span from 47 in 1900 to 68 in 1950\u2014a 44.6% increase. Average life span moved from 68 in 1950 to 76 in 2010 \u2014 an 11.76% increase. (The life expectancy numbers are hastily cobbled together and are close, but no cigar; which is why they are down here. But the 3.8x difference is real.) That is a mostly technological over view. Sociologically and politically: that\u2019s a whole different answer. But basically, people just keep on living and dying in mostly the same ways with changes happening mostly on the margins. No one has figured out yet how to do away with stupidity, bigotry, hatred, greed or any of the other things that make us go to war or kill each other. I wonder what the next 50 years will bring . . . . :-D ",

            "answer_text": "I was born in 1952 so I can answer this question a little better than someone thirty years younger, oalthough not a lot better. Things have changed enough that I frequently notice things being done differently than I was used to years ago . My guess is that the period 1900 to 1960 was even more disorienting. Technological and related economic changes are the most obvious. But in the 1920s and 1960s and probably several other decades or shorter periods, changes in clothing fashions, popular music and dance, courting customs (some associated with the automobile) , and cultural changes associated with cross pollination among various immigrant groups- all these have enriched our society, but they also have complicated inter-generational relations, never easy, even when the general society is changing slowly.

Techno gizmos galore didn\u2019t exist 60 years ago; the personal computer didn\u2019t even exist when I was in junior high school and no I use it hours every day. When I was born my parents were one of the few people who could afford a TV; now people in the US have several large color ones that hang on the wall. Most people with cancer just died; now most live for years. Smoking rates have collapsed, The average house is twice as large. Etc. Human nature hasn\u2019t changed if that is what you mean. ",
