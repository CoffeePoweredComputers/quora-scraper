            "answer_text": "The latest I\u2019ve seen was that about 4000 exoplanets have been identified. This number will continue to grow, because there are still projects looking at them. I did hear an interview with one of the pioneers of this subject who said last year that this expansion might slow because the focus is changing. The activity is likely to be concentrating on collecting and analyzing details about exoplanets rather than trying to establish large numbers of planets. One point that is pertinent. The techniques we use to identify exoplanets require the planet to be oriented so that it passes between us and its parent star. This means that we will never even be able to detect even a sizable proportion of them. This means that the best we can do is to obtain a statistically significant amount of observations and estimate how many others there are. ",

            "answer_text": "According to NASA, there are currently over 2,500 stars confirmed to have at least one planet. There are thousands more awaiting confirmation. The expert consensus now is that there\u2019s an average of one planet per star in our galaxy. Some, like ours, have eight or even more and some don\u2019t have any, but that\u2019s the current guesstimate for the average. Based on that, there would be several hundred billion planets in the galaxy. Only a tiny fraction of those have the right kind of star to support life and are in their star\u2019s habitable zone. One estimate is that there are only about 36 planets in the galaxy hosting intelligent life and that these are an average of 17,000 light years from Earth. That\u2019s frustrating because it means we\u2019ll probably never be able to find out. ",
