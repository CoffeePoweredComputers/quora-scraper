            "answer_text": "The classic answer to the question \u2018How many guitars do I need?\u2019 is N + 1, where N= the number of guitars you already have. (This also applies to guns, bicycles, and many other things). Realistically? When I was gigging I made a deal with myself, not to carry so much kit I couldn\u2019t get it from the car to the stage in one trip all by myself. So, 2 versatile guitars and a reliable amp. You gotta have a backup. Some years ago I was part of a house power trio, playing this big icehouse near a beach. My bass player owned the place, so, yeah. Play Friday night, leave stuff onstage, play Saturday, tear down. So I went by around 1500h to check it out, and my Strat feels funny. The bartender had let someone play it. During what was a bad spank-the-whammy routine, that motherfucker had split the body of my Strat from the bridge to the rear pickup routing! I pulled the rake and the springs from the tremolo routing, found a hardware store and picked up a box of water putty. Mixed it up, poured it in, and was good to go for the night, and many nights thereafter. I recount this tale of averted disaster not just to brag on my resourcefulness but to point out that you just gotta have backup. As it happens, my deal with myself was not exactly complete. At the time, I would also carry a spare amp, but I\u2019d leave it in the trunk, in case a friend or idol came along and asked to play. (My loadout was 1 Strat -own build, 1 James Burton rigged Tele - standard bridge, small humbucker neck, 1 Mesa Boogie .50 Caliber, and 1 weird thing which had started as a Fender Super 6 Reverb, but cut down and hot rodded. I do my own stunts) ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the situation, but I would aim for every guitar to have some versatility - I mostly use 2 super-strats with humbuckers, but have them wired so I can get decent coil-split sounds. That said, I enjoy picking up my strat with overwound single coils (think Hendrix and SRV tones) - it has it\u2019s own thing, but there is plenty of crossover (in fact it sounds \u201clouder\u201d than my super strats). Similarly, I could pick up my Les Paul for the fat rock sound but get in the region of stratty tones by dialing back the volumes (though this wouldn\u2019t be my preference - the feel is massively different). Where things differ is with altered/drop tunings, baritone and extented range - I have a 7 string fan fret, tuned as a bass+guitar hybrid, EAADGBe. This is where it\u2019s not so much about versatility, but providing something different - I pick up that guitar and it forces me to approach music differently. So my recommendation would be to have 2 similar guitars that are versatile, but consider another option for something to take you in a different direction. Just bear in mind that the more guitars you have, the more you have to restring and maintain! Hope this helps, Rob ",
