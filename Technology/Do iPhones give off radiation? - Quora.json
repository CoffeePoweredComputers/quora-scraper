            "answer_text": "Electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) are invisible areas of energy, often referred to as radiation, that are associated with the use of electrical power and various forms of natural and man-made lighting. Ionizing, high-level radiation has the potential for cellular and DNA damage. All mobile electronic devices, including cell phones, emit a form of energy called Electromagnetic Field radiation, or EMF radiation. Cell phones emit a form of radio frequency radiation at the lower end of the non-ionizing radiation spectrum. Like most cell phones, iPhone models have several transmitters that can simultaneously emit microwave radiation, which includes cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth radiation. When all these transmitters are turned on, the SAR value is 1.58 for the iPhone 6 and 1.59 for the iPhone 6 Plus. SAR Value is a measure of the maximum energy absorbed by a unit of mass of exposed tissue of a person using a mobile phone, over a given time or more simply the power absorbed per unit mass. SAR values are usually expressed in units of watts per kilogram (W/kg) in either 1g or 10g of tissue. iPhone radiation, especially newer models, is the highest among all smartphones\u2014just barely under the legal limit. The Federal Communication Commission (FCC), USA limit for public exposure from cellular telephones is an SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg). The radiation emitted by mobile phones falls into the category of non-ionising radiation \u2013 lower energy radiation that doesn't have enough energy to damage our cells. But even then, excessive exposure to ionising radiation can damage our cells and DNA, potentially causing burns, sickness or cancer. ",

Microwave radiation\u2014sandwiched between infrared light and radio energy on the electromagnetic spectrum. Microwave photons cannot break chemical bonds, so cannot damage living things except by heating them up and cooking them or making it easier than maybe it ought to be to feed that porn addiction in the office. Radiation is a 19th century catch-all term. The only radiation you need to be worried about it ionizing radiation, gamma rays, x-rays, or nuclear radiation. If any of that is coming out of your iPhone, you have seriously pissed someone off in the Russian intelligence community. ",

So heat you feel from a fire or the Sun is \u201cradiation\u201d And ALL radios emit electromagnetic waves that \u201cradiate\u201d from the radio\u2019s antenna. That includes your AM/FM radio transmitter and also even radio receivers. All radars running since WW2 have been bathing you with radio \u201cradiation\u201d your entire life! Your WiFi in both your access point/router and your PC and Phone are also emitting radio \u201cradiation\u201d. The problem with your question is it\u2019s fundamentally \u201cbroken\u201d - you don\u2019t understand what \u201cradiation\u201d is - it\u2019s a boogie man word that simply scares you. It\u2019s no different than being afraid of all dogs, or all black people or any other irrational fear. It\u2019s ignorant and make you look stupid to say such things. ",
