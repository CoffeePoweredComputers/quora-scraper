            "answer_text": "Hard to say. Certainly, self-sufficiency is possible although this is more difficult within the context of a globalised economy where trade has allowed and encouraged specialisations within different sectors. New Zealand, for example, is an efficient producer of quality foodstuffs, however, oil-based motor vehicles are all imported after local assembly stopped years ago. There is the technology to build hi-tech electrical vehicles but, we are talking about economies of scale and needing to build capacity. Because of high local costs, things like medical equipment and appliances, once manufactured here were moved offshore. Then there is the matter of machinery required for manufacturing, which tends to be imported from countries with specialisations in those areas. Access to raw materials - such as iron ore, for example - is another factor. Nations such as France, Germany, US, UK, Spain, Italy, China, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, Russia come to mind as , however, all currently import certain things, drawing on shared, globally-based specialisations and the needs for raw materials. I think New Zealand could do this well as it has many advantages. If it means going back to simpler things, then so be it. ",
