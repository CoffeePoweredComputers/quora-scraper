            "answer_text": "Basically, choose one, buy it, and assemble it. Another answer here suggested going from the ground up, but I think you would do better an actual kit that comes complete with all parts. There are some good ones that are made out of extruded aluminum and bolt together like an erector set that are a good value and easy to put together. For about half that, you could get an Anet A8, which is a \u201creal\u201d kit of parts that will require a bit more actual assembly. I suggest the A8 with some caution since they have burned down a few houses. But with proper attention to detail in the construction, and a precautionary change to its firmware to turn on some disabled safety features, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Some of those extruded aluminum kits had the same disabled-the-safety-settings issue. Also, you don\u2019t have to buy a kit. There are some low cost fully assembled 3d printers out there that get decent reviews. They might have a small unheated bed, but if you get to the point where that\u2019s an issue\u2014You\u2019ll know exactly what you want in your next printer. ",
