            "answer_text": "This question is a bit subjective. Not every tech carries the same tools or equipment because techs usually specialize in different tasks.

Knowing what you will be dealing with will determine this quickly. As a basic set of tools that I carried a small set of screw driver and small socket assortments and a small electric screw driver, pen light, ESD band, various thumb drives with tools, utilities and OS images loaded on them. I also had various types of ram, a few expansion cards and a hard drive with adapters to swap between interfaces. ",
