            "answer_text": "Well, it\u2019s funny you should ask that question here, on a website, through the internet. It\u2019s honestly too much to write in one quora answer, but I\u2019ll try: Greatly facilitates exchange of ideas, data, and collaboration on all kinds of projects. Thus making intellectual and creative endeavours much easier. Giving us more power to realise more of our potential. Even if a person themselves isn\u2019t part of any of those endeavours, they are directly or indirectly benefited by it. For example you can have different medical teams in different continents working on a cure for the same disease (say cancer for example), they can share their research data almost instantaniously now. And even for individuals, it as never been easier to seek information, you can learn about almost anything from the comfort of your bedroom thanks to ICT.On a more personal level, it helps connect friends and family who are far away from each other. You don\u2019t have to send a letter that takes ages to get there, you can pick up your phone or tablet and actually hear and see your loved ones. Having lived away from home for 2 years I can tell you that\u2019s really something. It also helps you meet new people, form new friendships, and expose yourself to different cultures much more easily.It contributes to the financial and economic growth of a soceity. ICT has created a whole new market, and a whole new way of dealing with the old market. And also back to the personal level, ICT makes everything easier and less time consuming for both service providers and customers. And in that I am including governments also as service providers, ICT makes any official \u2018paperwork\u2019 you need done a much easier task.In cases of emergency, both personal and otherwise, it greatly reduces the response time, thus probably saving many lives. Official announcements can be dessimated more efficiently, thoroughly, and quickly. And important news can also spread much more quickly (so can rumours, hoaxes, and fake news, but alas, that is a price that we must pay I believe).With the upcoming rise of IoT (hopefully coupled with the rise of IPv6) where eventually almost any device will be connected to the internet, it will make many more things easier and less time consuming. Your fridge can stock itself, you can check from wherever you are whether you have turned off the oven, or locked the door, and do turn off the oven and lock the door remotely if you haven\u2019t already.A little bonus: it helped get us to the moon. You know the line \u201cHouston, we got a problem\u201d? They would have had to deal with that problem all on their own without any help from Houston without ICT.",
