            "answer_text": "The short answer is: the Scientific Method, Peer Review Process, and an Institutional Review Board approval process. I don\u2019t have the time to provide as thorough of an answer as I\u2019d like, though I do plan on writing more on this as a series of articles/blog posts on Medium starting in the near future. Science, and in particular Social Science learned these lessons the hard way over the course of the last century. Let me name a few examples to go off of: The Stanford Prison Experiment, Laud Humphrey\u2019s Tearoom Trade, Milgram\u2019s Obedience \u201cShock\u201d Experiment, the Tuskegee Syphillis Study, and of course Project MKULTRA, just to name a few. To to points I raised of things being ignored, the Big Tech companies would likely attempt to highlight how they do follow the Scientific Method because they hypothesize, create study conditions, conduct the study, analyze data, and often publish their findings in white papers or other formats. That\u2019s great, but some still ignore the reasons why and it becomes more of a process than a purposeful structure. Recently, I saw a relatively new company who was touting a famous scientist\u2019s work for being the basis for their new personality and emotion analyzing computer vision software for use in the Hiring and Recruitment Process. That scientist, Dr. Paul Ekman (the inspiration for the short lived show Lie to Me, and a consultant for the movie Inside Out) was interviewed about this and stated that it\u2019s an interesting idea but it hasn\u2019t been scientifically proven that this is even reliably possible and that more thorough studies need to be done. He also hypothesized (my summarizes interpretation) that the present state of Machine Learning and AI likely isn\u2019t capable of doing this without having a human also interpret each conclusion drawn by such a program. Whether or not it happens to render some correlative data to what hiring managers want is not science, it\u2019s confirmation bias. This company I mentioned isn\u2019t the sole offender, Google has been working on similar technologies and much of their AI has shown a huge biases, such as interpreting the phrase \u201cI\u2019m homosexual\u201d as negative in regards to sentiment analysis. Ekman\u2019s analysis of the product created with his realm of study is similar to what you would expect in a Peer Review process, ultimately determining if the work he/she was reviewing is adequate and worthy of being published, or in this case, put into production. Think of it as QA, but by an established cohort of experts in the field who ensure you\u2019re not tainting the field or harming people with garbage you\u2019ve produced. I\u2019ll try to come back to this answer and provide links if I get time. Now, those studies I mentioned earlier where lessons were learned the hard way? I recommend reading up on each one and the controversy surrounding them. In doing so, it should be clear why the US Government put into place the Institutional Review Board Process. Probably the least known of the ones I mentioned is Laud Humphrey\u2019s Tearoom Trade, but it is probably the most important. To summarize, Humphrey\u2019s dissertation was a ground breaking study, one of the very first attempting to understand homosexuality in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was celebrated for his work. This was until people began looking closer at what he had published and how he collected the data and used it in such a way that made the individuals identifiable, massively violating their privacy. I shouldn\u2019t have to explain how this directly aligns with What Facebook and Google have been caught doing and how they mishandle it. Actually, what they do is even more appalling. Humphrey\u2019s intent was to observe, describe, and understand. Big Tech observes, describes, understands, and then armed with this knowledge, attempts to manipulate. This is why I mentioned the other studies such as the Stanford Prison Experiment, Milgram\u2019s Shock Experiment, and Project MKULTRA. All of these actively altered the psychology of the individual, the thing being studied. Which is exactly what Big Tech is doing, in order to keep us using their products more and for longer and to buy more things. It\u2019s one massive psychological manipulation experiment in a cycle of perpetual iteration. In the realm of academic and publicly funded science, things got out of hand before public outrage finally demanded regulations be put in place to prevent these atrocities. Given the presence of the libertarian mindset in today\u2019s America, I highly doubt we\u2019ll see the private Big Tech companies being forced to reconcile with the consequences of their actions and resigned to adhere to an IRB and peer review process. They stand to lose the business value in rapid deployments and will argue it would endanger their intellectual property. Google is among the top spenders in government lobbying in the United States and they are just one of those companies, so I wouldn\u2019t expect public outrage to apply enough pressure for any meaningful change to happen. That said, as someone aspiring to a leadership role in tech, I still plan to stress the importance of these concepts within my own circle of influence, and write on it when I can. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there is common problem that most tech companies are inadvertently applying to their companies with serious consequences. It\u2019s in their hiring process. 3 HR mistakes that ruin tech companies 1. Failing at values-driven recruiting Recruiting is important. In fact, it's a clich\u00e9: Great recruiting is key to a company's success. What is less obvious is that scaling recruitment will be either one of the easiest or hardest things a fast-growing company will do. This ease or difficulty will depend on how well the company has defined its mission and values. It will also depend on how well the company has woven these in to its recruiting. Formally defining the purpose and values of the company \u2014 so they can be communicated as part of the recruiting process \u2014 is critical. There's been plenty written about both the market and non-market value of purpose-driven companies. \"For a company to thrive, it needs to infuse its purpose in all that it does,\" argues Sherry Hakimi, CEO of Sparktures. \"It's an unseen-yet-ever-present element that drives an organization.\" There are key steps to developing a successful purpose-driven recruiting process, starting with defining the company values. A one-size-fits-all approach will not work well, so be creative and inclusive in working to define what it really means to work at your company. 2. Failing to build and maintain a strong culture with managerial decisions One mistake companies make is confusing organizational culture with the publicized benefits or perks they are offering (e.g., office games, fancy meals, elaborate events). Those are nice \u2014 but they are not the same as company culture. \"Organizational culture consists of shared beliefs and values established by the organization's leaders and then communicated and reinforced through various methods,\" writes the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM). 3. Getting stuck in silos As companies grow and start adding employees and bureaucracy, they develop departmental silos. This problem exists at large, mid-sized and even emerging growth companies. \"Departmental silos are seen as a growing pain for most organizations of all sizes,\" write Brent Gleeson and Megan Rozo. \"It is the duty of the executive leaders and management to prepare and equip their teams with the proper mind-set to break down this destructive organizational barrier.\" So, how do you eliminate silos in fast-growing companies that are forced to add organizational structure? The standard answers include enhanced interdepartmental communication as well as more effective cross-functional meetings and groups.
