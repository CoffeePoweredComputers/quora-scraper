            "answer_text": "From a discharge point, Lead Acid battery have 2 main types: Automotive batteries(SLI Batteries): These batteries are capable of producing 100s of Amperes for a few seconds. These batteries, however, don\u2019t have a long cycle life.Motive Power and Stationary power backup batteries(Deep Cycle Batteries): These batteries are commonly called \u201cDeep Cycle\u201d or \u201cDeep Discharge\u201d batteries. Their job is to provide low amperage for a longer period of time. So that you get a very long working life from the battery (i.e. 500 to 700 cycles). The life cycle of these batteries depend on how deep you are discharging them on a daily basis. DoD of 50% ensures a long battery service life. UPS and inverter companies set up charge control circuit in the power inverter such that the battery disconnects once it is approximately 50% discharged.Now coming to the plate composition: There is plenty of information present on wikipedia. The problem is: procuring the high quality metals, chemicals and following the expensive manufacturing process in order to make the Starter plate or Deep Cycle Plate. ",

            "answer_text": "C10 ratings are meant for the stationary batteries while C20 ratings are meant for automotive batteries.Therefore, the difference in the working and requirements of these batteries need to be considered.The batteries meant for stationary purposes need to be having good cycle lives with ample discharge capacity whereas the automotive batteries should possess a higher cranking ability particularly at lower temperatures.The batteries need to start the engine in fraction of time.   To have this, the pastes of automotove should be more porous and should be more open so that the acid should be able to percolate through the paste mass and vice-versa. ",
