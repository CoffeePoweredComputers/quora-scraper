            "answer_text": "Argh\u2026 OK here is the deal: Every electric vehicle that\u2019s ACTUALLY \u201cbased upon\u201d some ICE vehicle has been terrible. If you don\u2019t design it from the ground up to be electric you\u2019ll be trying to wedge batteries into places where the gasoline engine and fuel tank used to be - botching an electric motor onto a transmission designed for the lower torque of a gasoline engine - struggling to make an electric air conditioner and heater that are efficient - and the result will be HORRIBLE. I\u2019m thinking of the electric MINI Cooper, the electric KIA Soul, etc.Every electric vehicle that\u2019s properly designed to be electric from the ground up won\u2019t look like an ICE vehicle (think \u201cCyberTruck\u201d). Drag is a VITAL consideration in electric vehicles. Hummers are somewhat less streamlined than a brick - roughly like a brick with a parachute tied behind it. No sane EV designer begins with a Hummer as their starting point!Companies who are suddenly aware that EV\u2019s are cool now - and DESPERATE to get into the EV market without being destroyed by Tesla - will rush out some piece of junk and stick a well-known badge onto it in the hope that people will go \u201cOh! WOW! An Electric XYZ!!\u201d and hopefully won\u2019t notice the horrible engineering. I\u2019m thinking \u201cThe Electric Mustang SUV\u201d\u2026which has NOTHING to do with an actual sexxy Mustang muscle car - apart from the the little picture of a horse on the front. I feel bad for members of the Mustang owners club who\u2019ll have crappy Ford SUV\u2019s parked in line with their gorgeously restored muscle cars at antique car shows.Companies who are losing sales NOW find it easy to announce something that is no more than an artists 3D model on a computer screen in the hope that it\u2019ll stop people buying actually available vehicles while they scrabble to build an actual production vehicle of their own.Odds are good that the all-electric Hummer fits all four categories of bad. CONCLUSION: My guess is that this will appeal to the people who bought the Hummer H3 \u201cbecause it\u2019s derived from the amazing AMG HMMWV\u201d. Well, \u2026sorry - but the H3 is actually a really boring Chevy Colorado with a boxy body shell bolted onto it. People who are that gullible will probably be suckered into buying this thing because they think they can go on driving these hideous cars without being a laughing stock because it\u2019s no longer the worst imaginable gas guzzler. I can\u2019t imagine Hummer H1 enthusiasts giving it the time of day unless it comes with an all electric Coal-Rolling option! :-) But - I could be wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "An electric Hummer could ultimately be more successful than the gasoline version, but it will take time. The EV market in the U.S. is still only 2% of new vehicle sales. Once perspective owners get a taste of electric motor torque, they will realize that electric drive is superior, even when used in a truck. After all, diesel locomotives also use electric motors to drive the wheels. An electric Hummer would offer a substantial improvement in efficiency over the gasoline version. For such a vehicle to be successful, it will need to have a range of at least 350 miles. This would require a battery in the 150 to 200 kWh range, and that alone will make the electric Hummer an expensive vehicle. But then it always was. Even so, I am optimistic about the long term prospects for an electric Hummer for one simple reason: People bought gasoline Hummers in spite of their terrible efficiency and environmental impact. People would buy electric Hummers because of their efficiency and environmental impact. ",
