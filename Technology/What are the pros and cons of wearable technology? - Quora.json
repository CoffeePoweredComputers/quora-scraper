            "answer_text": "According to research, one in six consumers currently owns and uses wearable technology. It\u2019s why the sight of people paying for goods with their smartwatches and tracking calorie burns on the treadmill with flicks of the wrist are becoming every-day sights.Wearable technology hasn\u2019t enjoyed the healthiest of upbringings, either, which makes their growing prevalence in society even more surprising.Remember Google Glass? The search giant\u2019s take on facial wearable technology was announced in 2012, but despite the inevitable fan fare it received, Glass was subjected to a great deal of criticism and ultimately Google announced that it would stop producing the on-going prototype in 2015.Despite Google Glass\u2019 failure, wearable technology has continued to spark the public\u2019s interest. However, while its benefits at home, while travelling and during gym visits are compelling, what about the workplace?In this blog, we take a look at the pros and cons of wearable technology in business.The advantages of wearable technology in the workplace 1. It can increase productivityThe best wearable technology is designed to make every day tasks easier and more convenient. In the workplace, such technology can be put to use in a variety of ways. For example, in the healthcare industry, doctors can use wearable tech to look inside a patient\u2019s veins there and then, without having to wait for scans or X-rays.In construction, emerging wearables are enabling workers to take a peek inside piping hidden behind walls, thus removing the need to undertake expensive repair work.Wearable technology in business should help us solve problems quicker and in ways that significantly benefit both the company and its clients.2. It may increase employee satisfactionThere\u2019s no escaping the fact that injections of new technology within workplaces that have used the same processes and systems for many years can be rather disruptive and dent employee satisfaction, but the right technology can raise their spirits considerably.Think about the first time you were able use WiFi at work, or when you were given access to a smartphone app that made your job twenty percent easier. When that kind of thing happens, you feel far more satisfied at work, and your productivity levels will usually increase at the same rate.Pick the right wearable technology for your business, and there\u2019s a strong chance that you\u2019ll see a significant uplift in employee satisfaction and engagement, which alone makes the investment more than worth it.3. It could create fitter employeesA big part of wrist-born wearable technology such as smartwatches and fitness trackers is the health benefits they offer.As any HR professional will tell you, fit employees are productive employees, and if the introduction of a company smartwatch as a perk of working for the business results in staff spending more time in the gym their performance at work should step up several gears.4. It\u2019ll help you make the most of other tech investmentsOne of the most important aspects of wearables is their ability to connect to other systems. In fact, many devices of this kind will need some form of integration with a larger platform in order to provide real benefit.If you\u2019ve spent big on a new CRM, production system or project management tool, it pays to suss out whether or not it has wearable support. If so, investing in said wearables will extend the effectiveness of your investment and ensure you\u2019re getting the most bang for your buck.The disadvantages of wearable technology in the workplace 5. It can be a distractionJust like smartphones, wearable technology offers up plenty of distractions. For example, a smartwatch is an undoubtedly cool piece of kit, and the many features included by manufacturers (and increasing number of updates) means there\u2019s always something new to play with.Their size can be a particular issue, too, because most wearable tech is pretty small, and small stuff is easy to play with discussion ",

            "answer_text": "I would say there is no good in it.. maybe things like the constant blood sugar monitors or if you have some medical condition that can be better managed by tech. Other than that wearable tech is just a deeper entrenchment into your privacy and personal life. There's no question of if info that is collected will be misused , only a matter of when. Tech is taking away the humanity of people in a lot of cases (I didnt say all) but ALOT. ",
