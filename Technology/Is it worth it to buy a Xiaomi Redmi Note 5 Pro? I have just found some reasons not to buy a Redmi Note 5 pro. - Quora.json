            "answer_text": "This site states that Redmi Note 5 Pro does not have Gorrilla glass protection, but it actually has one. It has Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The site says it doesn\u2019t have USB Type-C. Well, most of the phones released in Feb 2018 were having microUSB. It's only now that some phones are having USB Type C. But during Feb 2018, only Mi A1 had USB Type C, so the writer is wrong about this one. No NFC- What rubbish is this? Who uses NFC payments in India? The site says RN5Pro doesn\u2019t have fast charging. It does have fast charging. Its just that the fast charger is not shipped with the phone. You can buy a Mi Fast Charger for RN5Pro just for Rs. 500. iPhone X has fast charging, but Apple refuses to give a fast charger in the box. The writer of this article didn\u2019t say a word to Apple huh? Poor dual cameras- It has camera equivalent to Mi A1. See any youtube review about RN5Pro, and you will find out that it has camera equivalent to Mi A1. Dual Camera Bump- again it looks a deal breaking issue to them. iPhone X has a big camera bump, but this guy again, didn\u2019t say a word to Apple. Considering that iPhone X cost Rs. 1,00,000 and above, any camera bump is unacceptable right? No 4K recording support- again, the hardware supports 4K recording, but its not implemented in the camera app. Xiaomi will be releasing an update to address this issue, although you can do 4K recording via 3rd party camera apps like Open Camera. The writer is just partially right about this one. Don\u2019t read blogs from anywhere any make decisions. I have proved by the above points that how less that person knows about technology and he is writing articles to misguide the consumers. RN5Pro is a very good phone, I would recommend buying it (if you can really order it through the flash sales).",

            "answer_text": " I Just bought this set. I was quite confused between MI A2 and Redmi Note 5 pro..finally I settled for Note 5 pro. If you are a MI fan then you should buy this phone if your targeting a device with a budget of 15k Pros -Camera is best in this budget of 15 k of Redmi Note 5 pro..it competes the MI A2..whose back camera is 20 MP it's just 19\u201320 difference in camera performance between these two devices -Software is good if you like MIUI then it's the definite choice for you -RAM Management of the phone is awesome -I will suggest that you buy the 64 GB 4 GB version it's best deal under this price -Battery is outstanding. With normal usage of the phone with data and WiFi the battery lasts for the whole day. -Speaker is loud and clear.. -Though fast charger is not available with the box this phone supports fast charging.. -Build Quality, Fingerprint Sensor are all good Cons -No stock Android -Mono speaker though it is quite loud So I will say if you don't want stock Android and your budget is fixed around 15k then you should definitely give this device a try.. This device has been updated to Oreo..and is scheduled to receive Android Pie update by 2019 as it takes time to update MIUI customized OS ",
