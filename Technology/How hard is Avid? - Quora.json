            "answer_text": "It's not any more difficult than any other NLE, with the possible exception being Final Cut X. I write this only because I've read that many people new to editing, and some converts to the program write that it is easier and faster than traditional NLEs. Your mileage may vary. I've used Final Cut X on at least 10 projects and personally find it MORE difficult to edit on FCX but that is more because I have over a decade of muscle memory dedicated to Avid. With that in mind - Adobe Premiere CC, Grass valley Edius and Davinci Resolve all borrow heavily from Avid Media Composer's editing metaphors, so if you decide to stick with the older NLE styles, the learning curve for other NLEs witll be flatter.
