            "answer_text": "Are we talking disasters that happened that could\u2019ve been prevented or disasters that could happen that are preventable? Don\u2019t answer that because it doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 Every man-made disaster is preventable, even if we haven\u2019t found a way to prevent it yet. Nuclear Wars can be prevented by getting rid of the nukes or maintaining good healthy relationships all around the world. Global Warming can supposedly be prevented by making Carbon Dioxide the world\u2019s number 1 enemy. Every physical war can be prevented by using our words rather than guns and violence to fight. Literally every disaster created by mankind and every disaster that mankind could possibly cause/create can be prevented. ",
