            "answer_text": "Automotive technology and computer science are going hand in hand since a long time. Engine:  First innovation was replacement of carburetor to fuel injection, which was done with the help of ECU i.e. Engine Control Unit, its a microcontroller. Now a lot of modification is done as the technology is improving. Supplying fuel to engine, monitoring exhaust gases and combustion cycle and modifying the quantity of fuel to be supplied is monitored with the help of embedded system only. Transmission: Automatic transmission, torque converter, automatic clutch,etc is a combination of hydraulics to actuate the clutches and bands and hydraulic circuit is controlled by an electric solenoid. Again, embedded systems. The electronic shift-on-the-fly only takes a switch or dial movement controlled by the driver. You can go from A4WD to 4x4L or 4x4H without stopping the vehicle and making outside manual adjustments. The shift and the adjustment done on the go is with the help of embedded systems and sensors only. Safety Features: Anti-lock breaking system, electronic breaking system, airbags, adaptive damping system, intelligent lighting, its all about the CS and automotive technology link. List goes on and on, unable to describe each feature with the technology involved. :) You name the part if the car and I can tell you the LINK of CS in that part. This is just a brief description and there is a lot of mechatronics, robotics and embedded system involved in advancement of automotive technology nowadays. So whenever you see any new feature in a car, 99% times it is achieved with the mix and match of computer science, embedded systems, mechanical engineering. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a link between them. Embedded systems technology is used in a lot of cars today. For example, when you're driving in reverse and a beeper goes off because the rear sensors detected that you're too close to an object and if you move further, you will bump into it. Another example is the self-parking cars which rely on using the car sensors and computer algorithms to be able to park itself. Of course one has to mention Google's self-driving cars, although not widely in use yet. The company that I know of that specializes in automotive embedded systems is Valeo, maybe you can apply there if you're interested in what they do. ",
