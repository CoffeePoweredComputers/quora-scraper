            "answer_text": "Mobile phone is very important for everybody nowadays. I can\u2019t imagine how can we communicate without a mobile phone. If the world has not mobile phone any more, people have a lot of ways to communicate together, I think. We can write a letter that is so easy and cheap to send. Another way to get in touch with others people is requested to meet around town at your favorite locations. I guess you will feel relaxing to talk and enjoy the atmosphere. Finally, you can connect to the others by using your computer which has many apps like video chat or snap chat. Life would be better without mobile phone. ",
