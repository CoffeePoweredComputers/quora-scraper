            "answer_text": "Native text messaging offered by wireless carriers is mobile to mobile only with no delivery to a third party. Years ago marketing had tried to get this as a service but was rejected for legal reasons which included subscriber privacy and liability to the carrier. Now an over the top messaging service may have this as a feature but I am not aware of any that does this. The caveat in what you want is that your messages and those from others can be forwarded to third parties without their knowledge or consent creating privacy concerns. This was the basis for legal rejecting the service. Several use cases were suggested which included subscriber opt-in/out, enterprise owned handsets and service related messaging but we're all rejected for the reasons given above. So the short answer no you cannot see your text messages online. ",

            "answer_text": "I use Google Hangouts - Android Apps on Google Play, I can access messages on any device as well as send messages from any device, there is no messaging cost, for anyone that still has a limit on messages. Hangouts can also be used for VoIP calls without using minutes for anyone that still has a limit on minutes. And one can do video chat, similar to Facetime, from any device.  I love Google Hangouts, and when I get a new device, the messages are not all gone.  But the best part of Hangouts, is that I can use multiple accounts, I have both personal and business Google Voice numbers, so I can choose whether to send a message from my Verizon cellular number or either Google number, which is awesome for messaging business clients. And the best part of that, is in managing numbers, it will by default reply to the number a message was received on, so if a business client texts my business number, my business number will respond, not my personal number.  AND I also have a free App called SMS Backup + - Android Apps on Google Play  SMS Backup + free from the Play Store that will back up all of your messages into your GMail. As I need a permanent record for work communications, this is the perfect and easiest solution, I can simply forward received SMS/MMS messages as an email or print them.  ",
