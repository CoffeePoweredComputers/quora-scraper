            "answer_text": "Smoking, not sure. Edibles might help. Okay below is the process of how a virus reproduces inside the host cells: DNA inside the nucli is responsible for creating RNA which is the \u201cleaked\u201d from the nucleus into the cytoplasm of cell, where the ribosome modifies the RNA and create proteins (we need those to survive). Now when a covid virus releases its RNA into the cytoplasm, the ribosome does it work on RNA) it does not distinguish between RNA released by nucleus and the one delivered by virus. The ribosome translates the virus RNA and creates Rna-dependent RNA polymerase, which will create copies of virus RNA ready to go out and create havoc in other cells. How do we prevent this, Zinc. Zinc is known to stop the creation of Rna-dependent RNA polymerase by ribosome. (proved in case of Sars, there are lot of research papers on that). So In order to help the body fight against the virus intake of zinc is necessary. How does Marijuana helps, it's rich in zinc,alongwith other products. Here is the list of items which are rich in zinc. Shellfish Oyeater Marijuana(hemp) Spinach Dark chocolate Whole grains Cashew Lagume Nuts Egg Beef Meat Chicken Cheddar cheese Oat Pumpkin seed Greek yogurt Wheat gram oil Hope this clears the doubts.

            "answer_text": "No. It weakens your lungs and you are more likely to develop pneumonia and perhaps even die. The problem with covid-19 is that our body has an inflammatory response to the virus in our lungs. Fluid builds up and we slowly suffocate, and our organs die because we cannot get adequate oxygen to them. How does smoking ANYTHING fit into this? All smoke kills the cilia in our lungs .. those little hair-like projections that wiggle and move foreign objects and phelgm OUT of our lungs .. so we are significantly LESS likely to develop pneumonia and to recover from a covid-19 infection.
