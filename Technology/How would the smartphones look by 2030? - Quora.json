            "answer_text": "Hi there! The growing popularity of smartphones owes much to the technology that underpins them, of course, as this has advanced at a truly incredible and incremental rate during the last decade. There is simply no comparison between the feature phones that dominated the market in 2006 and the premium smartphones now manufactured by Apple and Samsung, with design, functionality and capabilities having evolved significantly since the dawn of the iPhone.  Given the strides that have been made during the last 10 years (and the proliferation of smartphones across the globe), it\u2019s worth considering how further innovation will shape the handsets of the future? The Rise of Superior Battery Technology While smartphone battery life has improved incrementally as 3,000 and 4,000mAh units have been developed, the level of innovation within this space remains relatively restricted. The current generation of batteries can be significantly drained by specific apps and tools, for example, while it\u2019s fair to surmise that battery technology has not evolved to keep pace with the capabilities of modern handsets. This is likely to have changed by 2030, however, with battery technology already on the verge of several, seminal breakthroughs. So-called nanobatteries offer a relevant case in point, as they have evolved from the current generation of rechargeable units to become smaller and far more efficient. These batteries, which feature minute tower structures that are hundreds of times smaller that the components found in current power packs, will allow manufacturers to create increasingly compact designs without compromising the longevity of the battery. Similarly, developers are also experimenting with innovative and diverse materials such as lithium metal foil, which are known to deliver a quicker and more efficient charge that traditional battery units. Beyond this, Samsung has also been experimenting with hydrogen fuel cells since 2008, which would in theory create a smartphone battery that is powered by water as it reacts to a metal element within the handset. This technology remains fanciful for now, but in 20 years time it could be commonplace in premium handset designs. Increased Network Speed and Capacity While most of us may have just gotten to grips with the improved network speed and capabilities of 4G, however, there\u2019s no doubt that this will be a thing of the past by the time that 2030 swings around. In fact, handsets with 5G capacity are already expected to hit the market in 2020, with these smartphones likely to revolutionise usage and offer network speeds that are 70-times faster than what\u2019s currently available. With a 5G connection, it\u2019s conceivable that you\u2019ll be able to download a movie or an entire album from Spotify in less than three seconds, while streaming console-grade games will also be a quick, efficient and ultimately satisfying process. Buffering will also become a thing of the past with 5G, particularly once smartphones have been developed to fully leverage this technology. This will make a huge difference to users, while it will also enable manufacturers to consider integrating even greater functionality into their handsets. With this in mind, mobile data connections will soon be able to serve as high-speed Wi-Fi networks, and this technology is likely to improve incrementally over time. Folding and Curved Smartphone Displays While Google may have pioneered the concept of a modular smartphone, the brand\u2019s notorious struggles with hardware have prohibited it from launching this concept successfully. The highly-anticipated Galaxy X by Samsung is poised to become the first folding smartphone, however, although the launch of such a handset remains some way off for now. Still, this is a key focus for manufacturers across the globe, who want to develop increasingly compact designs without compromising on (and potentially increasing) the screen size. This, along with the proposed development of holographic displays,  will surely shape the future of smartphone design over the course of the next 20 years. ",

            "answer_text": "In 2030, I would predict that smartphones in 2030 would just be foldable phones done right, with more features and upgraded hardware. We have only just seen the first foldable phones and it\u2019s safe to day that they are more interesting and experimental than practical. However, as the foldable technology matures, foldable phones will probably become the norm because of the many benefits. So a smartphone in 2030 would probably just be a foldable one with some extra features like a projector maybe? ",
