            "answer_text": "I worked for a \u2018maharatna\u2019 PSU for around two years and then quit. That makes me qualified to answer this. Monotonic/Stagnant work - If you are a person who likes dynamism, challenges and wish to learn something new with your job, a PSU job will be your worst nightmare. There are strong chances that you will do the same job (with successive higher responsibility with promotion) for your entire career. There were many people (where I worked) who retired from the same department they joined in and did more or less the same job for 40 years. Scary. Isn\u2019t it?Your talents will never be recognized (no matter what) - You may be the upcoming \u2018Mark Zuckerberg\u2019 when it comes to knowledge in computers but if you are posted at water department, that\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna f**king be doing! Even when a computer department exists, you\u2019ll never get an opportunity to work there. (Meanwhile people in computer/ IT department MAY call you for help/ advice and take credit for themselves when they use your advice to solve their problem). Work culture & talent recognition is that pathetic in PSUs!Working out of domain - You got a double digit rank in GATE and have impeccable domain knowledge. Never mind, you\u2019re pushing files in HR department (or worse).Fixed promotion - There are loads of \u2018sarkari\u2019 type of people in PSUs who hardly work. Government cannot fire them. Not only you\u2019ll do their share of work, but will receive promotions equally with them. Forget recognition for your efforts, people will remember you only when they have a job to be done.Skewed workload/responsibilities - Some departments are severely understaffed compared to the workload and people work their arse off, there are multiple departments where people find it difficult to pass their time. This is true not only for PSUs but also for Centre & State government departments. Both these people receive equal remuneration.Nepotism - Nepotism is not rampant but quite common nonetheless. A \u2018proper\u2019 contact in \u2018proper\u2019 places will guarantee your transfer to a department of your liking with minimal workload. Whereas, a person with medical/other cause, who genuinely needs a transfer will never get it. Management is sure to \u2018find\u2019 reasons why \u2018a transfer at this moment is inconvenient\u2019.Since this question asks about disadvantages of working at PSUs, I have covered only that. I mention this because there are several advantages of working in PSUs as well that are not covered in this answer. ",

            "answer_text": "PSUs are okay, but not really workplaces where you can expect a lot of growth, career wise. It is because of our government practices,  which allow people who are in line to be promoted before people who deserve it and are really good workers.Add to this the 'reservation' which is done for promotions and bonuses (yes for the SCs/STs/OBCs) this just sort of ,doesn't play well with not only IITians but with any sane self respecting, hardworking, individual. I do not for one moment say that there is no good work to be done in PSUs, of course that is not true. Good work is independent of position and rank, but the feedback, advantages and incentives you get for doing  good work is very less when you work for these companies.   When a situation like this develops, and entrepreneurial people are not rewarded for candor and quality of their work, they tend to leave. After sometime the organisation is filled with lazy , unmotivated people, working for salary's sake. Again I do not say that all good people have left PSUs, but yes, certainly they are an acute minority. ",
