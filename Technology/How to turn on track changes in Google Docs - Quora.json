            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not the same as Microsoft Word. You don\u2019t toggle Track Changes on and off. What you do is change your mode from \u201cEditing\u201d to \u201cSuggesting\u201d. The drop-down to select the mode is on the far right of the Google Docs menu bar. When you are in Suggesting mode, all edits you make to the document are suggested edits, and you\u2019ll get automatic comments added for each of your edits/suggestions.  After your comments are added, you can even assign the comment as a task for someone to resolve by putting in their email address and then clicking \u201cAssign to\u2026\u201d. That person will get an email with a link to take them straight to this document. Clicking the checkmark on the comment \u201cAccepts\u201d the edit and closes the comment. Guess what clicking the X does? It \u201cRejects\u201d the edit. ",
