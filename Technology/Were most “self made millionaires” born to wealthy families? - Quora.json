            "answer_text": "Throughout my lifetime I have met a few \u201cself-made millionaires\u201d, none of them came from wealthy families. Here is an example of one. His name is Paul Patz. He came from a poor farming family in Wisconsin and his job was to \u201cmuck out\u201d the 40 head dairy barn (a relatively small farm). It was a terrible job especially in the winter when the floors froze. So he decided to try to come up with an easier way. He tried a scraper attached to a chain but the frozen cow poop kept breaking the chain. Eventually, he invented a new type of chain that solved the problem. He patented the chain design and the track inside the barn floor and eventually became a multimillionaire selling barn cleaners, but he always remained a very down to earth guy. I have another friend who was a Doctor who spent years making house calls and delivering babies in one of the poorest rural counties in Virginia. He died a millionaire because he invested his money wisely in rural land and timber. He had a bunch of kids, two got together and formed a small highway construction company while \u201cDoc\u201d was still alive (so they didn\u2019t inherit any money and even if they had it would have been divided 8 ways) and eventually it became a multimillion-dollar company (but a lot of that money is tied up in equipment). Three well-known examples from the food industry are: Truett Cathey (founder of Chick-fil-a) started very poor, as did Ray Kroc founder of McDonald's and Colonel Sanders was dead broke at the age of 65 when he started his first chicken stand. If you read the book \u201cThe Millionaire Next Door\u201d you will find that this is actually very typical of the vast majority of millionaires. Most either founded a small business, were exceptional salespeople or professionals like Doctors, Lawyers or Engineers. A lot of their keys to success were to work hard and spend less than they earned. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Most people who are self-made millionaires were born into poor or middle-class families; In some parts of the world, that have developed only recently, close to 100% are self-made, whereas in Europe there is still more `old wealth` like the US:  I would make another point. Being born into wealthy is an advantage in many ways. However, that doesn\u2019t mean most people take advantage of that initial `leg up`. I will give you just one example. A study was done which compared thousands of lawyers and accountant. Most were mid or upper-mid income, and it was a large study to avoid small outliers to affect the data. What did they find? Those who inherited wealth, had less wealth than those lawyers or accountants who had nothing. So even though they have similar incomes, and were similar ages, the group who were given $100,000-$2M in inheritance had less wealth than the group that got given close to $0. So paying for a kids education and other non-monetary gifts might be a better way, if you have money, than direct money handouts.
