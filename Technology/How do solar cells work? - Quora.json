            "answer_text": "Photovoltaic (PV) solar cells are the technology behind a solar panel that creates energy from the sun. Solar PV cells turn sunlight into usable energy in 3 steps: Light is absorbed and knocks electrons loose: First, light strikes a PV cell and is absorbed by the semiconducting material it is made from (usually silicon). This incoming light energy causes electrons in the silicon to be knocked loose, which will eventually become the solar electricity you\u2019ll use to power things like your home or business.Loose electrons flow, creating a current: There are two layers of silicon used in PV cells, and each one is specially treated, or \u201cdoped\u201d, to create an electric field, meaning one side has a net positive charge and one has a net negative charge. This electric field causes loose electrons to flow in one direction through the solar cell, generating an electrical current.The current is captured and transferred to wires: Once an electrical current is generated by loose electrons, metal plates on the sides of each solar cell collect those electrons and transfer them to wires. At this point, electrons can flow as electricity through the wiring to a solar inverter and then throughout your home or business.A PV cell on its own cannot produce enough usable electricity for more than a small electronic gadget. In order to produce the amount of energy a home might need, solar cells are wired together to create solar panels, which are installed in groups to form a solar energy system. A residential solar panel system will likely include several hundred solar PV cells working together to generate an electrical current.

            "answer_text": "I am going to stay away from a math/physics based answer because Wikipedia already gives a great answer in that regard, and I will use layman\u2019s terms to explain the operation. I will also make the assumption that diodes have a perfect 0.7V forward voltage drop. To start with, the basic solar cell is a PN junction, also known as a PN diode. A PN diode will block current from flowing in the reverse direction, but it will allow it to flow in the forward direction if you apply a bit of force to get over the PN junction barrier. I like to view the PN barrier as a 0.7V step, inside the diode you can be at ground level, or you can be at 0.7V level, but not in between (anyone who responds to nitpick that statement will be ignored. Look elsewhere if you want an in depth answer). I won\u2019t go into the reverse direction current flow blocking because the reverse direction doesn\u2019t play a part in the solar cell\u2019s operation (anyone who responds to nitpick that statement will be ignored. Look elsewhere if you want an in depth answer). But I will focus on the forward direction which is where solar cells operate. With a solar cell, when light energy strikes the junction, a small portion of the light energy will transform into electrical energy by lifting the charge that was at ground level up to the top of the 0.7V step. The diode is now biased in its forward direction. If the solar cell is not connected to anything else, then the charge that the light energy just lifted to the top of the 0.7V step will fall back down to ground. However, if you wire your solar cell up to a circuit designed to harvest the newly generated charge from the cell before it can fall back through the barrier to ground, then that electrical energy can be used to power other electronics.
