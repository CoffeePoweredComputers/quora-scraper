Example on a B450 motherboard:  And how it\u2019s connected:  In older computers (up to the late 90s), the network controller was not integrated so people had to use network interface cards which were plugged into an ISA or PCI slot. Example:  Nowadays, NICs are only used if: You need more Ethernet portsYou need faster Ethernet (most consumer grade boards are limited to Gigabit Ethernet).Here is an example of a 100 Gigabit NIC with dual SFP connectors, this is typically used in servers:  A regular 10 Gigabit Ethernet card:  The controllers used in those cards are quite expensive which is why the industry has settled on 1 Gigabit for the mainstream market. Some vendors are only now pushing 2.5 and 5 Gigabit into consumer hardware. If you\u2019re using WiFi, the hardware will be the: WiFi card (in laptops and desktops)WiFi adapter (if using a USB dongle)WiFi IC (sometimes integrated on-board)",
