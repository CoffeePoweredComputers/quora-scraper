            "answer_text": "If you just type \u201csoftware\u201d in to a Google Patent search, you will gets screens full of patents that are at least related to software. There will be many others outside of this search that don\u2019t use the word \u201csoftware\u201d but are still about software, but let\u2019s start with this set. A simple (but not all-inclusive) way to determine whether the patent is on software, is to read the \u201cmethod\u201d claims, which describe a series of actions to produce a result. For example, a method claim may include an action such as \u201c\u2026 generating data representing an aggregated dependency graph for a plurality of nodes of a hierarchy graph of software elements in the project \u2026\u201d. While that does not specify a computer program, you know that it must be. Who is going to hand-assemble a dependency graph of software elements? What this will not tell you is whether this software is commercially available, or whether it even has a name. ",
