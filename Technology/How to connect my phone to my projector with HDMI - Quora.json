            "answer_text": "Both your phone and your projector needs to support MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link), check their manuals or tech specs (usually TVs and Projectors that are compatible will have a special HDMI port for MHL connection so make sure you connect to that specific port), then, just buy a micro-usb to HDMI cable and hook it right up. If one or two of the devices don\u2019t support MHL, you\u2019re gonna need to stream it via Wi-fi, some newer projectors already have wi-fi and Intel\u2019s WiDi/Miracast built in so you can stream right up to it from your phone, just enable those features in the projector\u2019s menu. And then choose \u201cconnect\u201d on your phone. Others will need a something like a Chromecast so you can stream your phone\u2019s screen to it. ",
