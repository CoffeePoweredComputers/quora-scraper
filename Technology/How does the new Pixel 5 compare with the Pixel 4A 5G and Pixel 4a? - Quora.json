            "answer_text": "Obviously better. But not coming to India. Otherwise I like the idea of 765G, instead of top of the line SoC. Because 90% of people never needed so powerful processor.Even 730G is enough for most task. Customized battery saver option is good and should be in every smartphone.But charging is just 18W, very slow when we compare to other brandsThe main camera is of 12 MP , But i am very sure it can beat a lot of PHONEY FLAGSHIPS To shame, because Google's software for processing images is wonderful.
