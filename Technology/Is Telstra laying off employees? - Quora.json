            "answer_text": "Technically speaking, YES, Telstra Australia is laying off employees but it doesn\u2019t mean those people will lose their jobs permanently. Maybe some struggle but within some time only they can easily find another job in other Telco. There is a new government company called NBN which has generated a lot of jobs which can fulfill the job market for those who are leaving Telstra. Also Telco market in Australia is growing rapidly which in turn give employment to those people easily. ",
