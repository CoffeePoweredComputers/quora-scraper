            "answer_text": "For starters, gasoline (petrol). Gasoline: It's true. Gasoline is cheaper than water. UAE primarily exports oil (However, it is Abu Dhabi that does the exporting. Oil isn't among Dubai's primary export products, but it is still subsidised for the general public).Electronic goods: Not as cheap as it used to be. But you can get good deals if you look in the right place and in the right season.Gold: Every Indian lady's fantasy :p. Yes, gold is cheaper here than it is in India. But, there is only upto a certain quantity you can carry back. Customs officials at airports won't go easy on you if you have more than the prescribed limit.",
