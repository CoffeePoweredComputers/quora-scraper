This indicates the interest of people towards \"technology\" being used in education. When teachers implement technology in classroom, like, collaborating with students with various examples shared on devices like tablets/iPads or Digital Signage Displays, there's no doubt that students wont enjoy technology. To have a smooth flow in teaching and learning, teachers can implement a kiosk lockdown software that provides an optimistic use for every scenario, such as: Publish only those apps on devices that are useful & keep the device for single or multi-app purpose.Whitelist only those websites that are essential & avoid accessing unnecessary websites.Collaborate over the air with an in-house communication app rather than over WhatsApp or any other popular app.Teachers can broadcast messages or use a digital signage display to convey any information.All these can be done without any technical knowledge and requires just credentials to access a web-based solution.
