            "answer_text": "Technology has several impacts in our everyday life, which are both Positive and Negative. Let\u2019s not beat around the bush and understand only about Teenagers dependency on technology. You must have probably seen this advertisement of Google Duo-  If you have not watched it then You can watch it here. This advertisement sums up the major problem which the teenagers these days are facing\u2026 Lack of real world or personal interaction in daily lives. We have a big issue of people using technology for anything and everything, and especially teenagers majorly reliant on online shopping. This may sound as mainstream point but when we analyse in depth, we realize it is indeed a bigger problem. I do not belong to the early 90\u2019s generation but still technology was not as popular as it is today. Buying any product be it a football, or groceries or any commodity, required efforts, be it hiring the auto and then reaching the market and then visiting various shops in the market and comparing and analyzing the best price. But what is more important is the process of bargaining or dealing or simply communication. From having a debate over the appropriate auto fare to convincing the shopkeeper to sell you at the least amount possible. This may sound lame but it is definitely an inadvertent learning in the process. This process is non-existent in the online platform, every thing is done by AI and you just have to select the best price. Now when we look at the video from a different perspective, we see that the guy who\u2019s a teenager+ is unable to negotiate with the vegetable vendor and his mom has to help him out.  Its Obvious, we cannot conclude as to why the guy is unable to negotiate but in between we know that because of over dependence on the technology, people especially teenagers have lost the medium to engage with others and lost the opportunity of learning. Some might say its time saving for them and its better but everyone knows that no teenager will ever have time in future to learn all this. To conclude, i would request you, if you are a parent or sibling, insist your younger ones to go out and buy stuff offline. It is not that they will be spared off from those shopkeepers who want to mint extra money from children but they will learn something which they will never learn from books or classes but only from experiences. Thanks for the read. ",

            "answer_text": "Both. More dependent than independent.  Most of us depend on it to basically stay connected to others. And in big cities, technology seems like the only way to stay connected to others. Being in school right now, its hard to meet up at a coffee shop and chat. So phones help us with that.   I say dependent because like me, most of my peers wont be able to go for more than a day without a phone or a computer. And with so much happening around the world within seconds, you feel like you stopped in time without technology.   And you can argue that, there is so much to do out there. But from my point of view, I don't really see much to do, specially in cities. And then most of us teenagers being in school all day and then coming back home with mountains of homework, you don't really feel like leaving your blanket after a tired day. So I guess our only form of entertainment is Technology.  Now independent because again, we reply on the internet for everything. Want to get from point A to B? Your phone has a map of the world. Need pictures to be taken? Sure, a smartphone is always there(that is if you own a phone). Need to make videos or songs? There are hundreds of software's to download and make content. Now this isn't bad at all, considering many teenagers have their own youtube or Instagram pages making big bucks, thus being more independent.  ",

What about children - there can be no doubt that children nowadays become more and more addicted to devices and technological innovations, but their lives also improved significantly by adding technologies, because they become more used to fast changes and them not so dependent on old technologies than elder generation.
