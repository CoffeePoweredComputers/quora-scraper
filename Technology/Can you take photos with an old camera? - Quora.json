            "answer_text": "So when you say old camera what do you mean by that ? Are you talking about an old DSLR or do you mean a film camera So if you have an old DSLR and it works, I don't see any harm in using it. It can't be used professionally but you can take photos of family outing or any event. You can also give that camera to your children or younger siblings so they can explore photography and as the camera is old you won't be stress about them breaking it. If the camera is not working then you can use it as a show piece or any decorative item. Now if you have a old film camera in working condition then I suggest you start shooting with it, now you can also make digital copies of a film camera or print copies of the film and make a photo wall. If it's not working then the same you can use it as a show piece. Hope your question was answered ",
