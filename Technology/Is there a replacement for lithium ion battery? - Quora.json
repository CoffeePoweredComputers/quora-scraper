            "answer_text": "Just buy another Lithium Ion battery. It\u2019s the most common, supported, safest way to go. Almost every rechargeable device on the market uses Li-on because it holds a better charge and lasts longer- if not, you could just go with: Alkaline. These are your typical TV remote batteries that you can buy a forty pack of at Fry\u2019s. You WILL eventually run out, and you\u2019ll be left with a bunch of dead unrechargeable batteries. They\u2019re not exactly environmentally friendly, either.Nickel Cadmium. Probably the most end-of-the-line, aged, unsupported type of battery. They suffer from the memory effect (which is where if you charge them up to 50% too many times, they wont hold a charge higher than 50% in the future). They are extremely harmful to the environment as they are very hard to recycle.Nickel Metal Hydride. Don\u2019t even bother trying to find batteries like these that support your device. They basically look like a bunch of AA batteries wrapped in colored plastic with a finicky little charge cord sticking out. These are very rarely used in the electronics market anymore.If you can\u2019t find the type of battery you\u2019re looking for on the internet, visit your local tech store (any local tech store would do) and you\u2019ll be directed and possibly even sold a replacement on the spot. Good luck with your battery. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Not a fair question! its vagueness of context begs to be explored. every battery, every chemistry has applications that can overlap other batteries. some chemistries are better suited than others. In battery research and development, there are literally constant ideas being conceived and studied to improve current materials and process and to explore new horizons in material science. At its fundamental (short-sighted) marketing approach, nothing will be better than what we have now. The latest and greatest have not emerged from research labs into production. \u2022You want longer life? we are working on it \u2022Want a new exotic chemistry or \u2018hybrid\u2019? we are on it! \u2022want to keep it affordable for you and profitable for me? We are doing over-time on that too. Paradoxically, yes, we want to get our hands on some magical box that would store energy in huge quantities and deliver it to almost endless stretches. But enjoy the ride as we all get there. You know, better yet. Let that anxiety be constructive to learn how the present day systems work \u2014their demands and applications, their materials and processes. Some times it is not wise to scape and jump into something new, without exploring what we have now and how we can make it better. I did not mean to philosophize or diminished your question. But I close in a plea for common sense \u2014energy storage takes (well\u2026) energy and materials. Please recycle spent batteries, they are not trash. ",
