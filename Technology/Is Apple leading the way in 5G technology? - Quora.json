            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Apple rarely leads the way in anything except design. When it comes to technology, Apple tends to wait to see what other people do with it, and they then figure out how to do it better. So no, Apple is not currently leading the way in 5G technology. Many other companies have 5G phones. Also, Apple is not a carrier. Apple can\u2019t actually lead the way when it comes to deploying a 5G network. But Apple may lead the way in 5G technology when it comes to implementing and supporting it. Apple purchased Intel\u2019s modem business and it is widely believed they will put their own modems in their devices starting in 2021. ",

            "answer_text": "Apple\u2019s role in 5G is at the handset level. They aren\u2019t a provider of the service nor do they produce 5G radios to install on top of towers to transmit this technology. For the company, they\u2019ll produce an iPhone, iPad or any other mobile device that needs this. By no means are they leading anything in the evolution of 5G. Once they release their 5G iPhone, they\u2019ll play a role in bringing this to the masses. That won\u2019t happen until later this year. Until then, look at Samsung and others who already have 5G devices on the market. ",
