            "answer_text": "The satellite system is essentially a 3-part network, not just the spacecrafts in orbit. There's 1) the earth stations, 2) spacecrafts in orbit, 3) the customer premises equipment (CPE). Satellite broadband works through the transmission of signals between the customer premises equipment and the earth stations, via the satellite.  The earth stations are the equivalent of mobile base stations. At these sites, there are multiple large dishes or antennas that are pointed to the satellites. These enable the uplink between the ground and the satellite. The dishes are supported by active electronics on the ground, which aggregate data into the terrestrial (backhaul) network. Earth stations are located in remote areas where there is very little population to minimise interference.  The satellites in orbit receive the signals from the earth stations and send it on to all the premises covered. It covers a large number of premises by casting beams over a set area. Satellites can be configured with many small spot beams, each covering a different geographic area (http://www.wildblue.cc/wb1.jpg) or a single large broad beam covering an entire nation. A single satellite can have up to 50-60 spot beams. Multiple satellites can be designed with the same beam configuration (i.e. overlapping) to increase the total bandwidth or cover non-overlapping areas. A single satellite can have between 30-100 Gbps of throughput, depending on its size. Any premises that lies in the range of a beam will be able to receive satellite broadband services if it has the right customer premises equipment. A technician installs the external dish and points it at the right angle to communicate with a satellite. The antenna is then wired to an indoor modem.   Rough numbers on bandwidth - not sure about the USA but in Australia, Telstra offers up to 800 kbps plans at A$500/month. The entry level service is 256 kbps at A$100/month. Government provides a subsidy to satellite subscribers through the Australian Broadband Guarantee. ",

            "answer_text": "Satellites share bandwidth between all users. A typical communications satellite has 24 transponders (i.e. reciever/transmitters) that can each handle 500MHz of bandwidth. Using a process called \"Multiplexing\", they allow many, many users to share that same bandwidth at the same time.  If you are referring to satellite Internet service, the available bandwidth comes down to what you are willing to pay for, but it is expensive compared to land based internet. If you have no other option for broadband than satellite, then it is a great solution, but it has some problems that make it a last choice among the common broadband services.  Pros:  Satellite is available pretty much anywhere on the globe (except maybe the extreme poles).  It is a lot faster than dial-up. Its kind of cool when you think about it.  Cons: Susceptible to bad weather outages. Since satellite relies on radio waves traveling through the atmosphere twice (up and down), bad weather at either the hub or the remote station can cause slow or completely dropped communications. Snow is particularly bad on satellite signals.  Latency. This refers to the time it takes for the radio waves to travel 22,500 into space and then back down. Although this takes less than half a second, those half seconds add up to extremely long waits in certain situations. Those situations are anything that uses secure communications such as HTTPS (SSL) pages such as online payment pages (with the little lock icon showing at the bottom of the browser), or VPN connections that are commonly used for coporate remote access. Any time you are using secure communications such as these, it is typically slower than dial-up for technical reasons that are affected by the travel delay.  Cost. Equipment cost is high, and subscription cost is high.  Mideocre service. Although the technology is capable of providing consistent high bandwidth communications, the companies that sell broadband internet cram way too many users on the same satellites which causes everyone's service to slow down. Wnen you are pushing everything through a 500 Mhz pipe, the more you add, the less time there is to be allotted to each users. Getting the higher priced plans will keep you off the most crowded transponders and give your data priority over other data, but unless you have a bundle of money to throw at it, this is not a viable option for most people.  Bottom line: Satellite technology is great and is wonderful for certain uses. However, if you have any other broadband option such as DSL or cable, I wouldn't even consider satellite. I say this from experience. I was on Hughes Net for several years and the week that DSL became available in my area, I switched and have never regretted it. ",
