            "answer_text": "Maybe. It depends on how long the phone is turned off and the carrier\u2019s specific policies on this. SMS is a store-and-forward messaging protocol. The sender sends the message to their carrier, where it is stored and then forwarded to the recipient\u2019s carrier. If the recipient\u2019s carrier cannot be reached, the message is retried for a period of time - hours at least and perhaps days. When the recipient\u2019s carrier gets the message, it is stored and attempted to be sent in a low priority fashion. Because of the low priority, it may take a while (minutes) before it is even attempted to be sent. If the phone cannot be reached, it is queued up to be resent usually for a number of days. It keeps getting tried to be sent until this time elapses. Both the sender and recipient carrier will store the message for at least 30 days even if they aren\u2019t trying to send it all that time. So, if you turn your phone off for a couple of hours, messages will queue up and they will be received. If you turn your phone off for a week, almost certainly you will lose messages. I suggest that for most carriers the time they keep trying to send messages to the recipient\u2019s phone is 2\u20135 days. but if you are concerned you should check with them. Once the recipient carrier stops trying to send the message to the recipient\u2019s phone, the message cannot be retrieved very easily. The sender could resend it from their phone, but that is about it. ",

The problem being the text message that was sent when my phone was turned off may come in a few hours later or a few days. The down side being that the text will not have the date or time when it was originally sent it will have the date and time that I received the text. So my advice if you turn your phone off, then be prepared not to receive any text as soon as you turn it back on. ",
