            "answer_text": "It\u2019s all about copyright. E-book copyrights provide the sole rights of it to only the author or the creator of the E-book. The law strictly states that it does not provide any rights to any individuals who physically possess the E-book. So the purchasing or the downloading of an E-book does not include any copyright rights. This is similar to printed books or works. There is a chance to get profit from the book once you are not using it. This option falls under the \u201cFair Use\u201d terms which grant specific privileges to the purchaser of the material. What this means for E-books is that once an individual has finished using the E-book or no longer has use for it, he/she may put it up for sale or can simply just give it away. In both cases, therefore, selling or sharing books for profit (not for domestic use) it is not legal. However, in the case of the E-book it is easier for the author to take control of what it is done with the book. ",
