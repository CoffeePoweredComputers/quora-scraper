            "answer_text": "Follow credible tech blogs or Google / use keyword research tools to find what types of blogs are ranking highest. Social media is also a good source. You can follow relevant hashtags, keywords, handles, groups, and pages to see what people are reacting to most at any given moment. Or, you can ask your followers or members of relevant online groups what types of blogs they want to see. I also use flipboard.com and the \u201cnews\u201d tab on Google to find recent posts around particular topics. If you\u2019re writing for a company, ask your sales and customer experience teams what kinds of questions they receive while talking to prospects and clients. You can use your blog as a place for answering those frequently asked questions in depth and in different ways. ",
