            "answer_text": "Well, contrary to some of the answers here, I use a soft haired brush to disturb the dust and a vacuum cleaner with a small nozzel to suck it up. Also, I will use air from an oil-less compressor, with a moisture trap, if I think it will help. I\u2019m very careful not to bump the small capacitors or any of the other components.I will even rest the nozzel, at an angle, on the larger IC\u2019s, which really cleans the IC and everything around it.To clean fans, I use the soft haired brush on each of the blades, along with the vacuum cleaner. It can be a bit awkward.NOTE: Over 30 years, I\u2019ve cleaned easily 10 a year = 300 computers, without a single problem. I had no idea that there was an issue with using a vacuum cleaner and static electricity! The type of vacuum cleaner I use, is mains powered and has a cloth bag that can be emptied when full.But if you have a $400+ motherboard, maybe its better to err on the side of caution, and not use the vacuum cleaner!",

            "answer_text": "You can vacuum clean (with a brush) the fan enclosures and the dusty exterior holes, but the critical areas will need some dismantling. The processor cooling fan is the most important to clean, and usually vacuuming is not enough. You have to rub the blades with a damp cloth, one by one, then vacuum up the muck. Same for the graphics card if you have one with a fan. While you are there, if you can remove the CPU cooling fan, it is worthwhile cleaning off (paper towel) the old heatsink paste and applying a better sort like Arctic Silver or Thermal Grizzly. Just make sure you pull the computer power plug and keep one hand (or part of your arm) touching the metal parts of the case to stop static electricity from causing damage. ",
