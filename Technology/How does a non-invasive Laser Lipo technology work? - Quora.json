            "answer_text": "Laser lipolysis is a minimally invasive procedure that uses the heat of fiber optic lasers at various wavelengths to dissolve body fat. This is a different process for liposuction, which consists in the elimination of fat from the body by vacuum aspiration. The added benefit of laser lipolysis is that it stimulates the production of protein collagen, which makes the skin tighter. During each session of Lipo, the brand of the laser-lipo device used by Advanced Laser Body Care, a technician places pads equipped with laser diodes directly on the skin, allowing the laser energy to penetrate into fat cells and temporarily perforating the membranes. This causes the fat cells to release their stored fatty acids, glycerol and water into the body and then reduce, which can cause loss of inches. Thus, the body removes the contents of fat cells expelled through the lymphatic system or burns them to obtain energy. ",
