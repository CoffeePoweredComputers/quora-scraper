            "answer_text": "Then we\u2019d live in a very different world than we live in currently. Disney has a market cap of 230B with able 23B cash on hold, neither are anything to sneeze at. However Apple is entirely different beast, with a market cap over 2T (trillion) and cash on hand of just under 200B. If you would have reversed the question it would have been something discuss but there is no way in the world we currently live in that Disney could buy Apple, at best they could spend all their cash and buy a little over a percent and would still be 6% behind Vanguard for the largest institutional investor, but at least they\u2019d be ahead of the chairmen of Apple\u2019s board.

            "answer_text": "It will also likely need to take on additional debt to close the deal, which would boost its current liabilities of $102.2 billion. Buying Disney in its entirety would boost Apple's annual revenue by nearly 30%. As a percentage of the combined company's 2019 revenue, Apple's iPhone sales would drop from 55% to 43%.

            "answer_text": "As if DIsney has money to buy a company that\u2019s bigger than them. Disney would suffer with one trillion dollars of debt, and DIsney can\u2019t afford that. Apple has wayyy more money than Disney by a landslide, it\u2019s not even close. It would make a lot more sence if it is the other way around, Apple buys Disney. Disney is not even the most valuable company in the world, that title belongs to Apple ",
