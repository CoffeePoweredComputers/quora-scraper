            "answer_text": "Yes you can be tracked via GPS or via a triangulation of cell towers and/or WiFi networks. Usually tracking applications will use a mix of these. Now when the phone is disconnected, either turned off or in airplane, the assumed answer is no the device can no longer be tracked. However, if the device has not moved while in this disconnected state, then its last known location will in fact be accurate. Also important to note that on some devices, such as Apple iOS devices, you can have airplane mode and WiFi on at the same time which will enable tracking through WiFi triangulation. ",
