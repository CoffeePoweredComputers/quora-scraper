All we can do is point out the differences so you can decide for yourself. I answered a similar question where a person wanted to know the difference besides the obvious, which is improved cameras. Is photography important to you? If so, you should lean toward the 12 Pro. There is a LiDAR sensor on the Pro also, which also improves auto-focus speed, but it also can be very helpful in site survey work as you will be able to accurately measure out a room and its contents, plus get very accurate AR object placement. Read my other answer to learn about the basic differences between these phones. In general, if you don\u2019t care about photography or the perceived higher quality of the stainless steel case, and you do prefer having a choice of colors, get the \u201cvanilla\u201d 12. In that case, I recommend upgrading the storage to 128GB for $50US more. If photography and AR matter to you, get the Pro.
