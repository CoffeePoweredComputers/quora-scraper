            "answer_text": "In a strict sense, without a doubt, automation will lead to loss of jobs. However, it is fruitless to debate how many jobs will be lost by automation vs. how many will be created. For instance, to argue over how many jobs the invention and implementation of the Internet created or destroyed is pointless. Nobody can do anything but speculate on strict numbers. The real issue is what kind of jobs are created in the wake of the job loss due to automation, and also what the secondary effects of the job loss are. One example to explore these concepts is the production of burgers in retail restaurants and fast food places. There are a couple million people employed in the U.S. making hamburgers in food establishments. Right now there is a machine being tested that supposedly can make a few hundred burgers per hour at the same quality or even better than the burgers made by people. If these machines are implemented on a mass scale and everyone making burgers by hand is put out of work, it is interesting to think about the effects of that. There would indeed be jobs created by the fact that the burger machines must be manufactured and distributed to the retail food establishments. But what kind of jobs are those? There is probably going to be a small team of engineers to design the machines, another team of people to manufacture the machines and then yet another team to distribute the machines and operate/maintain them. Then, of course, there are managers to oversee the business activities. The total number of people employed in these capacities is probably going to be a lot less than a couple million. And not only that but the education requirements for these workers is going to be a lot higher. It appears that automation raises the bar in terms of educational requirements for participation in the workplace. Sure, automation creates jobs as well, but in theory those jobs are going to have steeper requirements in order to operate the machines and software that have been implemented. There are secondary effects as well, though, and those are probably a lot more difficult to quantify. In theory, the lower cost of the burgers produced by the machines will free up resources in the economy. If I can buy a burger for $1 instead of $6, that's $5 I can spend elsewhere. Will those freed up resources end up creating other jobs for the people who were once employed making burgers? One possibility is I decide I can spend that $5 on better food and I stop eating burgers. Then, those who lost their jobs might be employed making better food. But then, once again, it is more likely than not that those jobs will require more education. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, for sure. There will be massive job loss. But not yet. Machines can do a lot, but they can\u2019t do everything we can do. We don\u2019t have AI CEOs and entrepreneurs yet. This gap is what keeps us employed. As jobs are lost, we just find something else for the workers to do. But this gap is closing fast. Within a few decades, the gap will close. The machines will have general intelligence beyond our own. Our machines will be able to do everything a human can do, and then it only becomes a matter of cost. Once machines have the general intelligence of humans, no job will be safe from automation, and there won\u2019t be anything a human can do that a custom-designed AI couldn\u2019t do better. A custom smart AI can work 24 hours a day. No need to sleep or deal with other issues. So even if it's expensive it will replace at least 3 humans that only work about 8 hours a day. AIs can save their memory and reload from a different saved file. So if an AI trains for 10 years to learn a new skill and knowledge, its memory and personality can by cloned into 100,000 copies of its hardware with a simple download. We can\u2019t do that with humans. We have to send each one of them to school to learn the same lessons. So it\u2019s not just the fact that a machine has the same intelligence we have, it will have powers like memory sharing that humans can\u2019t that will make them far more valuable in the economy. We don\u2019t have the technology yet. But once we have general AI it will still take decades for the new technology to evolve and be implemented and for our industries to transform. Just as we are now in the 3rd decade of the public internet, and we are still seeing business models transforming to take advantage of the internet, the social transformations created by the rise of the internet are still unfolding. The transformation of the workforce due to the rise of general AI will take many decades after we have the technology to make it happen. No one knows for sure when we will have the needed technology, but most/many people working in the field believe we are very close. Every year new records are broken on getting machines to do things they couldn\u2019t do before. And there is now the massive investment in this technology because everyone knows we are close. There is a huge gold rush about to unfold. Today, it\u2019s a gold rush mostly in research. But soon, it will be a gold rush of deployment. By the end of this century, our economy will be a vending machine, not a place for human employment. There will be no way for your average person to make a living in a job. There will be ways for humans to sell their time, such as people that become famous will still be able to sell their time just so people can meet them. Whether it\u2019s because they are a sports star or a political star, or YouTube celebrity. If you become famous at something, you will still be able to cash in on your fame. But only a very small number of people will get that option. There will be jobs that pay people for their time, but think of them as volunteer work. The jobs people want to do, like maybe take care of dogs at a dog shelter, teach kids. They will be what we choose to do because we enjoy it, and many may be totally voluntary, but many may also offer some pay. But none will pay enough to live on. In this new feature, we will have to learn to share the output of the machine economy, not expect people to contribute to it with their labor, our labor will nearly worthless. The money will all go to the people who OWN the machines\u2014the capitalists. Whereas today\u2019s economy is about 60% labor and 40% capital rents, once machines become smarter than humans, the labor share of the economy will drop like a rock, for the first time in history. By the end of the century, it might 10% labor and 90% capital. Those that own the capital, will receive that 90% of all economic output if we don\u2019t learn to share that capital wealth. We will share the capital wealth with a Basic Income system. Everyone just gets cash every month. They get to spend in our big automated vending machine economy. We can, and should, already be sharing a large share of our economy's capital wealth with a Basic Income. If we shared half of the capital wealth, that would be 20% of the entire economy, which in the US works out to be a Basic Income of about $1000 a month for everyone. We should be doing that now as a way to share the capital wealth which then also gets us ready for this fast-approaching day when the labor share will drop like a rock. But if people don\u2019t understand or believe this will happen then we will just wait until the labor share drops like a rock, and then they will understand and scream for their share of the lost wages as a Basic Income.

            "answer_text": "Yes. In the future (Will have a greater effect from 2050 onwards at least), actual jobs that people would do is checking the robots and programming them; offering services in special areas that require more than textbook knowledge. There will be a need for the labour force but some place else, in different functions. There will be no need for translators, factory workers, lorry drivers, etc. The transformation process will not be sudden but it already started. Lets recap where are automation solutions currently: Amazon now has more than 100,000 robots in action around the world, and it has plans to add many more to the mix. The robots make warehouse work less tedious and physically taxing, while also enabling the kinds of efficiency gains that let a customer order dental floss after breakfast and receive it before dinner. SourceThe first Amazon Go shops opened recently that allow people to walk in the store, pick up groceries and simply walk out the store without queuing at the cashiers. The system would deduct the value of their \u2018cart\u2019 from their bank account. This helps to make shopping less problematic. Currently, it is not taking away jobs because they need to test the new system with real customers and fine-tune their software in order to cope with little kids running around with candy and chocolate bars in their hands, placing them at different places. But essentially, the goal of the system is to eliminate waiting. Having said that, there will be always people required to maintain the store, but less people than before.Self-serving cashiers at Tesco or Ikea (etc.) is also something that was introduced a few years back that still needs some getting used to from the customer. The result of having self-checkout counters is that they reduced the number of cashiers at a ratio from 4 to 1 person. That one person is there helping people if they got stuck during the checkout process.Would a self-checkout option be integrated to common fashion stores?Maybe. Would they be introduced to high-end stores? I don\u2019t think so, because those stores have the customer services that is best from a human being who is kind and helpful to a customer.A robot that helps users appeal parking tickets for free in the UK and US. The bot has helped strike down 375,000 parking tickets in the last two years. As artificial intelligence technology progresses, fewer lawyers will do mundane tasks. SourceMore than 10 major law firms have \u201chired\u201d Ross, a robotic attorney powered in part by IBM\u2019s Watson artificial intelligence, to perform legal research. SourceThe car manufacturing process will be much shorter than current. Tesla is creating one of the most advanced robot technology to assemble a car. Much less people are needed in their factories to put together a car than in any other. Their goal, is to make their cars the best possible, in the shortest period of time. This is one of the reason their production time is so bad, because at first, they need to create a harmonized process for robots to work together. But when they will achieve that, probably this year, they will fulfill all the Model 3 preorders (~400,000) quicker than it would take for any other company. Crushing all the other manufacturers. Because it does not matter if the other players will have a competing product to Tesla but how quickly can they make it if there is a market for it. They are not investing as heavily into the automation process as Tesla does, and in some point in the future, they will realize that you can\u2019t scale a production if there are humans checking the paint quality and welding. That is part of the reason why Tesla is currently not turning a profit because their R&D invest two times higher than a conventional automakers. Are these sort of automation solutions a good thing for the people? In my opinion, yes. I say that, even though I know my job will be replaced as an accountant in the corporate sector by a robot, because to be honest, it can be. How do I know that? We already created an auto-posing system for incoming invoices because it is faster, more reliable and more controllable for a system to book 2000 invoices a month than doing it one-by-one manually. What am I currently doing in order not to be replaced by a robot? I simplify accounting processes and checking, fine-tuning these sort of automatic processes. Why do I think it is good if even my job will be replaced at some point? I believe, people have a higher purpose than doing repetitive work (i.e.: putting boxes from one place to another) in their entire life. ",

            "answer_text": "I disagree with this whole statement of \"automation => loss of jobs\". If it was the case than globalization would be also implying loss of jobs, ... We know it is not the case for these. They definitely drastically changed what jobs are available in a given country but the number of jobs did not really decrease. As an illustration one can look at this graph from Wikipedia about US Labor participation for 1948 to 2011 (Unemployment in the United States (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_in_the_United_States#mediaviewer/File:US_Labor_Participation_Rate_1948-2011_by_gender.svg)):  As you can see despite having the globalization of the economy during this period the overall trend (black line is both male and female) is relatively flat if not trending upward. Sure less american works on factory now than it was in the 50's, and of course some people did lose their job as their enterprise relocates in cheaper country; but globally the US job market did rebalance itself and the same thing did happen in most countries. You see indeed that in the US (from the same Wikipedia article again) unemployment rate is related to level of education and this just amplified as we went to these evolutions:  But yet as I said earlier these job crisis tend to regulate themselves after the society have time to adapt to the deficit of jobs in a given sector: should this deficit been generate by cheaper human labor or automation reducing the need for humans.  It is actually a problem that has been studied by economists and opinion is divided (see the section about is the same wikipedia page Unemployment in the United States). All agree though that automatic both create and destroy jobs they just disagree on which is the strongest and if it will continue one way or another.  On my end, I tend to trust the self-regulatory nature of your economic systems. I am not necessarily fully agreeing with this system but cannot deny its ability to adapt using the simple principle of offer vs demand. Reducing cost using automation -- or relocalisation or any other mean -- is good for the enterprise as it reduce its costs and potentially increase its profits. But again this would work this way only if they are able to maintain the same demand for the same demanding price. If they weaken the demand by suppressing all the jobs and nobody is here to compensate this loss they come then to a problem: their product may be very cheap to produce but nobody can afford it even at this cheap price. Hence the need of a balancing act surprising jobs altogether makes automation meaningless as nobody will buy what you produce. It works only if on, average, the global population with buying power still remains relatively constant. There is definitely people that will be left out as \"irrelevant\" due to automation of certain tasks/jobs but eventually there has to be either new type of jobs emerging to compensate for this deficit or a slow down of automation so enterprises can maintain a profit.  And this balancing is true since the early ages and I do not see it challenged any time soon. ",

            "answer_text": "YES Automation will eventually end the need for most if not all humans having to work. So in the long run automation will help the workforce because the need to work for a living will become optional for all humans without exception. This is an unstoppable process that is changing human destiny as we will eventually not work for a living as that is what ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines will do for all of us. Faster, better and cheaper. Then maybe humans can seek out their true destiny. Basic income is the path forward. Basic income is an unconditional yearly income provided by the state to all citizens with no means testing or similar state bureaucratic overhead. Universal Basic income will replace the existing means-tested costly welfare programs eliminating the inefficiency of government overhead and enforcement. The Minimum wage will be frozen or ideally eliminated as it destroys jobs for human workers by making ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines even more profitable than the increasingly expensive human workers they permanently replace. Please read on for the discussion of what is happening and why Universal Basic income is a credible solution. The reality is that every profession without exception is being increasingly automated. The automation of work performed by human workers is the most profitable business on the planet. Those humans that are fortunate to still have work will be typically be compensated less. For instance, the Artificial intelligence automation of existing human workers today fuels the current trend of growing wealth inequality with an ever-decreasing number of well-paying jobs available for human workers. The first step is the reality check of rechecking if past assumptions are still valid such as most humans can work for a decent living. assume = to make an 'ass' out of 'u nd 'me' The reality is the past is gone forever as things have changed whether people accept this or not. Just as people resisted the notion of the Earth going around the Sun because it was \u201cobvious\u201d for all of history that the Sun goes around the Earth as the Earth was the center of existence. \"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself \u2014 and you are the easiest person to fool.\" Richard Feynman The current reality is that ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines make more economically productive workers than an increasingly large number of human workers. The cost of retraining workers is economically pointless as the enormous cost greatly outweighs the total value of their future work. Ever cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines are educated and trained at zero cost. No sick time, no vacations, no health care costs as the work 24 hours a day without complaint of error. The simple unavoidable fact is that era of most humans working for a decent living has ended forever. I realize that I was fortunate that I made great living permanently replacing human workers with ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines. I feel that it is my personal responsibility to raise awareness that this time it is different. History demonstrates that most people live in the past, live in denial and fail to adapt to change and new concepts. The upside is that the requirement of humans working for a living is ending in the foreseeable future. The robot revolution is irreversibly changing the world for all human workers permanently replacing them with ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines. The reality is * the first step in fixing a problem is realizing that you have a problem * the second step in fixing the problem is correctly identifying what the problem is The first step is by and large complete as we know we have a problem with growing wealth inequality. The second step is a failure as we incorrectly blame illegal immigrants, rich elites, government bureaucrats, etc \u2026 for the growing wealth inequality, This ignores the true reality that as a society we do not acknowledge and accept the unavoidable fact that the vast majority of humanity will no longer be able to work for a decent living. The only thing certain is that the last job standing will be the job of automating other jobs. What is key is that automation killing all jobs is only a matter of when not if. The core issue is an ever-increasing majority of human workers will become permanently unemployed as ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines inevitably replace more expensive human workers. Economic growth now and in the future requires that fewer jobs are created for human workers. This is the desirable inevitable consequence of the capitalist system So as a global society we need to have a plan to deal with this inevitable change. Automation has been, is and will always be a friend to human society if human society on a global basis is prepared to deal with the inevitable consequences. I spent my working career increasing automation and increasing efficiency. This consequently reduces the hours worked by humans while increasing the output economic goods and services at an ever-decreasing price. Why not have ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines create the vast majority of required economic goods and services as opposed to human workers? Why not have most human workers working less and retiring earlier? There is much more to life than working forever. Fortunately, automation has been going on for decades and will continue as an irreversible process as ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines permanently replace more costly human workers. I write this answer for the people that have an open mind and are not living in the past this is what I feel most effectively deals with the tractable issues that automation creates. The question at hand is how we deal with automation going forward as a society. Automation is only a threat because society has yet to acknowledge automation is happening let alone effectively having a plan to address it. This short video describes the future.  Investment capital is deployed to reduce the number of increasingly expensive human workers with ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines to permanently replace these workers. The most profitable businesses succeed in the marketplace which are those businesses with ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines and fewer increasingly expensive human workers. The contradiction is that rising wages leads to widespread pervasive job destruction. Most jobs if not all jobs, in the end, will become automated. This is only a question of when not if. Furthermore, while many people can recognize the problem of growing global wealth inequality they incorrectly assess blame and propose counterproductive solutions such as living wages and an ever-higher Minimum wage in fact only increases the growing global wealth inequality. Higher wages only accelerates the rate at which Capital Investment is used to replace human jobs with ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines. A higher minimum wage and an expected future minimum higher wage increase the expected return for the Capital Investment making it more profitable and lower risk. The economic goal for Venture capital in Silicon Valley is to use Capital Investment to replace human jobs. I greatly prefer the following which I will extensively argue is inevitable 1. the elimination of most government means-tested welfare 2. the implementation of a substantial level of Universal Basic Income that starts at a level that equals existing welfare benefits and minimum wage levels Universal Basic Income is a conservative-libertarian free-market idea where individuals choose what economic goods and services are produced in the free market as the free market supply will respond to free-market demand. This is not a centrally planned communist economy. Universal Basic income is funded by the taxing the corporations that increasingly employ less human workers rationally preferring the more profitable ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines. Ever cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines have no healthcare costs, no sick leave, no vacations, no employee turnover, no employee dissatisfaction, far fewer errors than humans, declining costs over time as these machines become cheaper, etc \u2026 I could easily list over 100 reasons why ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines will always be vastly superior to human workers for the vast majority of jobs. The key point is that in the past machines automated human muscles. We are now well underway in the process of automating the human brain and the human senses. Ever cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines have senses that are superior to humans in many respects, as they can see, touch and hear in multiple directions simultaneously - as well as to detect infrared radiation (heat), ultrasonic energy, etc \u2026 These machines are and will be superior to human workers in the long run in almost every aspect. When was the last time any human answered more questions correctly than Google? Intelligent automated machines are now essentially automating the human brain as these machines learn faster and more precisely than most humans with regard to required job skills for performing work in a growing number of fields. Furthermore, these intelligent automated machines are less prone to error and far cheaper than their human counterparts. These intelligent automated machines simply represent more efficient and economic workers with regards to producing less costly economic goods and services compared to the vast majority of human workers. The incremental cost of growing a business is very low as the incremental cost of replicating a machine is very low. Adding an additional human worker is very high in comparison involving training costs and the uncertainty of employee retention. While many incorrectly argue that automation has been going on for centuries and humans have and will always find other means of making a living by creating new jobs in new fields, these same people also incorrectly argue that nothing ever changes. This is known as the Luddite Fallacy which is Technological unemployment has now been proven false. The STEM Fallacy is a sound refutation of the Luddite Fallacy. For instance, automated systems will self diagnose, self-correct and self-repair at least 90% of the time trending well above that over time. It is a fairytale myth that human workers in any substantial number will be required to run these systems. The design and implementation goal of these automated systems is to remove as many error-prone costly human workers from the process. The end goal is always fewer human workers not more human workers. So we have a permanent growing excess of displaced human workers that are increasingly not economically competitive. This means fewer jobs and declining wages for the median human worker as time progresses. As a person that has made a very good living in Silicon Valley by permanently eliminating the jobs of others for 32 years, this issue is real for me. Silicon Valley employs and will always employ a small minority of humans. The specific intellectual demands required only suit a minority of humans. It is analogous to the issue of why the majority of humans will never win a Nobel Prize. All humans are equal in value but have vastly different skills and intrinsic abilities. So here we are as ever-increasing levels of economic goods and services are produced by ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines coupled with permanently declining human jobs and declining wages. What is likely required is that universal Basic Income needs to be phased in gradually over the coming decades at ever-increasing levels as an ever-increasing share of economic goods and services are produced by ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines. This creates a permanent growing excess of human workers with a sustained permanent deflationary trend in the inflation-adjusted median wage for all human workers. As intelligent automated machines get more proficient and cheaper by the year, businesses that replace human workers with ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines are the inevitable longterm economic winners. The naive wishful thinking that humans can economically compete with this ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines is just that wishful thinking not grounded in reality. Any new jobs created will be also automated at an ever-increasing rate. The upside in the future is that in that humans are not predestined to work for a living as that is precisely why we have ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines. Technology will continue to advance at an increasing rate but the real change is that an increasing fraction of humans will no longer need and/or be able to work for a decent living. The economic details and rationale of why this will happen are as follows: There is and will continue to be fewer well-paying jobs and rising wealth inequality as positive GDP growth occurs with declining employment as the rate of worker productivity increases exceeds the underlying rates of business and GDP growth. The existing economic framework of exponentially rising worker productivity creates rising wealth inequality as ever cheaper, ever more capable intelligent automated machines continue to inevitably replace the majority of low and medium skill workers. The majority of remaining jobs are lower-paying service jobs which may keep unemployment temporarily low but only increases the issue of rising wealth inequality and underemployment. Capital Investment seeks the greatest Return on investment. The greatest return on capital investment is achieved by investing in ever cheaper, ever more capable intelligent automated machines as opposed to creating jobs for ever more expensive humans. As time passes human workers have rising costs whereas these intelligent automated machines that replace them have decreasing costs. What Silicon Valley has been, is, and will be doing in the future is reducing the cost of and increasing the supply of an ever-increasing array of economic goods and services. The most efficient use of Venture capital is to use Capital Investment to replace human jobs with ever-cheaper ever more intelligent automated machines. Society should learn to accept this inevitable economic process as the vast majority of jobs, in the end, will be automated over time. This automation process has been well underway for over 3 decades. This is the business model of Silicon Valley, the home of the largest most profitable corporations on Earth, where the goal is more profits, more sales, more productive employees and fewer employees. Amazon now has 45,000 robots in its warehouses. Wal-Mart's new robots scan shelves to restock items faster) as \"Walmart Replaced Me with a Robot\". This scenario of permanently replacing human workers plays out on Sand Hill Road where Venture capital is deployed to fund Startup companies with the goal of replacing workers with intelligent automated machines to increase economic efficiency. There is a growing ocean of Venture capital that seeks this destination as the future earnings are safely protected by United States patent law which reduces investment risk. Higher rewards coupled with reduced capital risk is optimal. Estimating potential future cash flow is always uncertain to a degree, but the United States patent law is deliberately constructed to precisely mitigate this economic obstacle by protecting Intellectual property rights which are the sole property of the Startup company. As a Silicon Valley worker at many early-stage startups, I am quite familiar with this process. The venture capitalists understand this as well so the risk is quite manageable now and indefinitely into the future which is why I am positive that many diverse industries will be increasingly automated within a few decades. The first jobs to be replaced are the jobs with the greatest Return on investment that are low skilled, reasonably paid and repetitive. For instance, manufacturing and transportation will likely be fully automated over the next few decades. As time progresses, all higher-paying jobs with a lower degree of difficulty will be partially automated and then fully automated. The last jobs to be automated in the end will be the jobs that create the automation process. As far as whether Universal Basic income is adopted it is only a question of when - not if - for the USA. The advent of ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines will likely force the world to adopt a Universal Basic Income in the coming decades as many of the existing assumptions of Capitalism will no longer hold as the vast majority of people can no longer work for a living without government assistance. In a global economy, there is no way to stop the increasing use of ever-cheaper, ever more capable intelligent automated machines replacing a growing number of human workers. On a global basis, corporations that use humans lose while corporations that use ever cheaper, ever more capable intelligent automated machines win. In the end, increasing economic efficiency is unstoppable. Universal Basic income is a free market idea where citizens and consumers can decide how to spend their money in the Free Market Definition of economic goods and services. It is far better than the government picking economic winners and losers, or worse yet, directly providing economic goods and services. Economic liberalism is a better model than government-directed Socialism. Universal Basic income will allow consumers to purchase ever-cheaper goods and services as most humans will be either unemployed or working in jobs with ever-decreasing wages. Again raising the minimum wage is a spectacularly bad idea as it only accelerates the rate at whichever cheaper intelligent automated machines permanently replace human workers as investment capital is focused on replacing the ever more expensive human workers. We need to transition to a society where work is optional as most people likely do not work to sustain themselves and instead rely on universal Basic income. Europe is waking up to this new reality and the rest of the world needs to do the same. Universal Basic income is unconditional in that it is received by all citizens at the same amount regardless of income, wealth or assets. It does not depend on employment, lack thereof or age. The level/amount of Universal Basic income will likely be phased in over many decades increasing as time passes. The initial level will be minimal at best. Universal Basic income replaces most existing public assistance programs such as the existing regrettable welfare program that reduces benefits as income rises (an absurd negative economic incentive). Universal Basic income is funded by taxing corporations which indirectly taxes the work of the ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines that work autonomously 24 x 7. Humans workers will be the exception going forward as the vast majority of economic goods and services will be produced by ever-cheaper ever more capable intelligent automated machines that work autonomously 24 x 7. These robotic workers do not care if their work is taxed by the way. As time marches on, an ever-decreasing fraction of human workers will be highly economically productive. This fact is independent of whether or not universal Basic income is implemented. This is pretty obvious from observing Silicon Valley where the most highly valued successful companies focus on employee productivity, intentionally not hiring more workers and instead only hiring the absolute best workers. The median human worker simply will never be valuable enough to contribute meaningfully to the required innovation that is Silicon Valley. I have worked over 30 years at over 20 companies making a great living permanently destroying the jobs of others thru automation and productivity software. Often times it comes in the form of productivity software which allows 1 worker to do the job of what previously would require N workers to do, reducing the number of jobs by (N-1). It's time for most to wake up and intellectually digest what has been, is and will be happening in Silicon Valley. Positive economic growth requires fewer human workers not more human workers as these ever cheaper, intelligent automated machines are essentially unpaid slave labor. Unfortunately, there will be a growing excess of human labor which will cause the wages for the remaining jobs (nannies, painters, musicians, artists, etc \u2026) to plummet as the supply of workers greatly exceeds demand. This makes the idea of Universal Basic income an attractive solution to this issue because the possibility of working for a decent living is disappearing rapidly for the vast majority of human workers. This is the direct result of the unstoppable inevitable rise of ever-cheaper, ever more capable intelligent automated machines. The companies using robots to produce economic goods and services will win in the marketplace while the companies using human workers will lose. This is an optimal desirable economic result. These ever-cheaper intelligent automated machines are more economically productive than the average low-to-medium skilled human worker. The long-term economic race has already been lost forever for all these low to medium skill workers despite the fact that most humans are in denial, for obvious reasons, as losing to a machine is embarrassing. The key issue to resolve is the political-economic transition as machines, not humans, increasingly generate the majority of economic output. The economic gains will not be distributed evenly causing a growing wealth disparity. Intellectual property holders will reap a growing share of wealth as is happening today. On the whole, the world will get richer, but the average worker will likely get poorer as the wage deflation rate will exceed the deflation rate of produced economic goods and services. Traditionally the wages of human workers have been taxed to fund governments. Going forward, the robotic workers will need to be increasingly taxed somehow to account for this revenue shortfall. So much for the wisdom of reducing corporate tax rates since taxing corporations is likely the only way to tax robotic workers. What is happening, and will happen, is a massive deflationary continuous event both in terms of human wages and produced economic goods and services. Ironically any minimum wage, or even worse, a rising minimum wage, will ensure that the vast majority of human workers will lose at a faster rate as the intelligent automated machine becomes ever cheaper while the human worker becomes more expensive. A sample of current articles documents that this process has been well underway for years. This is not news to anyone who has been paying attention in the last several decades.

While aid donors embrace transformation, India mulls a universal basic income What universal basic income could mean for the future of work - Marketplace iPhone manufacturer Foxconn plans to replace almost every human worker with robots Amazon is Launching a Fleet of Delivery Robots Called Amazon Scouts Amazon now has more than 100,000 warehouse robots on its payroll ",

            "answer_text": "Of course technology, automation, and/or software change the job landscape. At one point humans spent most of their time gathering, growing, or hunting food. Machines have incrementally made food production more efficient, allowing small numbers of people to produce all the food we need. Some industries do not typically see reduction in workforce because of technology. For example, healthcare workers are not generally replaced by technology, and in some cases healthcare technology expands the number employed. We also seem to have an insatiable appetite for entertainment. However, I suspect this question is trying to ask if we are headed for technological unemployment \u2014 a day where automation has taken so many jobs, that there are simply not enough jobs left for people. There is only one answer to this \u2014 nobody knows. Some claim we\u2019ll never have technological unemployment \u2014 that machines only bring efficiency and that jobs lost are replaced by new opportunities. Some of the evidence they cite includes the many other times in history where people feared machines would create unemployment. They did change the job landscape, but they didn\u2019t create widespread unemployment. However, just because it didn\u2019t happen in the past doesn\u2019t mean it can never happen. Some claim we\u2019ll absolutely have technological unemployment \u2014 that machines and software will eventually do so much of the work that we won\u2019t have enough jobs for people. Their debate is not about if this will happen, but when. Some of this argument is tied up in the debate about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and when it will occur. Even before AGI, we seem at most two decades away from widespread automated driving cars \u2014 which will displace substantial workforce. Will there be enough jobs created to employ these people in other ways? We don\u2019t know yet. Perhaps more fruitful than debating whether or when this will happen or not (hint: nobody knows) is to look at the problems our society will experience if technological unemployment does happen. For one, the US tax system will need to be substantially reformed. Currently a bulk of taxes are collected as payroll income taxes. As machines take human jobs, corporate profits go up, but net taxes collected go down. If technological unemployment does happen, this will create a decrease in net tax revenue at the same time that there is a strain on social programs to support the growing unemployed workforce. Expect to see \u201cthe new new deal\u201d to rebalance the tax system around this new reality. Technology also exaggerates wealth disparity. Those who own businesses growing more profitable because of technological unemployment grow richer, while those losing their jobs grow poorer. In some cases standard of living goes up, but because intelligent machines are expensive to develop and produce, most of their net benefit goes to their inventors and the rich, not the poor. Another interesting topic is which jobs are safest from technological unemployment. The answer is, jobs with \u201cmessy\u201d interfaces and/or requiring higher intelligence. It\u2019s possible to make an automated factory, or even an automated driving car, because the interface between the computer and the world is very structured. An automated driver merely needs to control the gas, brake, and steering wheel. Further, roads are very structured, and can be methodically mapped and navigated with GPS. It is substantially more difficult to automate folding arbitrary home laundry than to automate driving. Laundry comes in too many forms, and takes too much dexterity to manipulate to be automated soon. The same is true of higher intelligence. The creation of entertainment, software, contracts, law, and other forms of complex intellectual property will be some of the last things to be handled by machines. In fact we will need to reach Artificial General Intelligence for these things to be automated, and at that point everything will be so much different it\u2019s not clear what our problems will be.

            "answer_text": "I can't believe that so many people consider technology as an evil menace trying to take away jobs leading to the end of humanity. Yes, technology will take away jobs, but ultimately with technology none of us will need jobs. To understand this, one needs to understand the concept of money. Money is the reason everyone needs a job. As humans, we all need services to lead our life. We need a bus driver's service to get to work, a tailors service to stitch our clothes, a doctor's service to treat our illness and so on. Everyone who provides service to you also needs service in return. This is exactly what one does during their jobs. Humans are both service providers and consumers. One provides service which is represented in the form of money they get paid. Then they pay for the service they consume using this money. Money in itself does not have value, but it represents the service you have offered to the society and hence represents how much service you can get back in return. Now, imagine a future world where everything is automated through technology. All the services you need for your life is provided through machines. An automated bus helps you travel, machines stitch you clothes, advanced softwares will diagnose your illness and treat you. All the machines you need are in turn manufactured by machines so there is absolutely no work left for humans to do. In such a scenario every service you need is provided by machines and you do not have to pay for it. Since machines don't need any service in return, money is useless to machines.Machines are only service providers and not consumers. This will create a world where money loses its importance. Since no money is required you do not need a job. This is however an ideal future scenario. In the real world, there will always be services that machines cannot provide. However, machines will still provide most of the services hence making a large portion of human population jobless. These jobless will not be able to afford only the services provided by humans but will get everything that is done by machines for free. So, more the services offered by machines, more services you can get without working. Hence progress in technology is really essential if future humans want to spend their entire life as a vacation!

            "answer_text": "Yes, automation leads to loss of jobs. That\u2019s the main purpose of automation. Automation is expensive, if it didn\u2019t make more money than it costs, they wouldn\u2019t do it. For example, we\u2019ve seen that in manufacturing employment since 1980 and especially since the turn of the 21st century.  Note that despite the loss of more than 1/3 of manufacturing jobs, production kept up it\u2019s steady upwards trajectory. So much for the idea that even if machines replace workers, increases in production will necessarily maintain employment. What happens, instead, is that the reduced cost of production, combined with competition, drives down prices, and lower prices gradually lead to greater sales to those who haven\u2019t lost their jobs. And that greater demand for greater production means more workers are needed, so employment rises again. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve always seen: massive job losses over time followed by massive job creation. This chart shows the employment rate of 25\u201354 year old Americans since WWII.  Of course, female employment was fairly low in the early post-war years, but rose steadily over the following 40 or 50 years, so we need to interpret this chart carefully. In fact, if we consider only male employment, to exclude this effect, we see a very different picture (the orange line below).  Male employment declined 15% from its peak around 1950 to its trough in 2010, and was still 10% below that peak before the Covid-19 collapse. But the interesting thing to note in both of those charts is the trend toward increasingly erratic swings in employment: with each crash, more jobs are lost and it takes longer for them to be regained. What if the problem here is that the jobs that are lost are less skilled, and the jobs that are introduced require more skill? This would be leaving behind workers who are unable to attain the skills needed for the \u201cjobs of the future\u201d, leaving more and more workers behind. And that seems to be what\u2019s happening: labor force participation of less educated prime-age men has declined more than 13% since 1964, while participation of more educated men has fallen much less.  (This is labor force participation, which counts both those in jobs and those looking for jobs, so the fall reflects both those who don\u2019t want to work and those who have given up looking for work.) To date, most of the jobs that have been eliminated by automation have been simple, repetitive jobs, but we need to consider what will happen as AI technology starts displacing larger numbers of more skilled workers, such as Robot Radiologists, Artificial Intelligence Will Revolutionize eDiscovery, and AI Is Impacting Journalism. Consider this: what happens when AI comes to dominate shipping, delivering cargo using self-driving trucks? The cost of shipping products falls, making online shopping cheaper. That displaces a lot of retail workers, while increasing online demand, which is more heavily automated and requires fewer workers. Then we may see talking machines taking call centre jobs; again it\u2019s unclear how those jobs would be replaced by new employment made possible by increased productivity. But before closing I must make one more point: we\u2019re focusing on the wrong problem. Everyone talks about how we must make more jobs, but it\u2019s not jobs we need. What we need is production and income with which to buy that production. We\u2019re assuming the only way to achieve that is through employment, but If we have robots and AI giving us the production we want without the need for human labor, then all we still need is income. So let\u2019s not fixate on jobs; if we don\u2019t need labor to produce what we want, there won\u2019t be jobs. Rather than trying to create make-work and Bullshit Jobs to underpin employment, let\u2019s recognize that the problem is not lack of jobs, it\u2019s the need for a new mechanism to distribute all that production that no longer needs human labor.

            "answer_text": "Surviving & Thriving In The Age Of Alt-Carbon  Heard the term Engineering Shelf Life? Perhaps I\u2019m the first to coin the term. Essentially, it means that every software undergoes a constant upgrade faster than we can wipe our asses with hot selling Donald Trump Toilet papers. The objective of this article is to convince you of the squeezing of the Middle Class in terms of wealth and what we should do about it. The end is more relieving than the beginning.  To understand the impact of Automation and how we can truly create meaning in our lives as well as contribute significantly to society and our personal wealth, we must first understand the economics of Technology and Labor Cost arbitrage. Increased Productivity Is Not Equal To Increase In Wages Decoupling of Wages and Productivity All the way back in 1950, Alan Turing proposed an interesting question after breaking the famous Enigma Code\u200a\u2014\u200acan machines think? Fast forward to 2017 when Japanese employees of Fokoku Mutual Life Insurance Company were the first people on Earth who lost their jobs to artificial intelligence software. And we\u2019re only going to see more of that. As you all probably know, 5% of the richest people in the world hold more than a half of the world\u2019s wealth. But although people in that top 5% have a very large income, most of them are still very dependent on their jobs and income. Even those high-income households are in danger due to automation.  Image from the Book \u201cThe Rise Of The Robots\u201d by Martin Ford So what do you think happens with the remaining 95% of people? They will face even more challenges in the coming years, primarily driven due to increased adoption of automation technologies by enterprises, for enterprises. Another thing that\u2019s highly concerning is the decoupling of wages and productivity. Since labor productivity has been increasing during the last couple of decades and continues to do so due to technological innovations, you would think that the worker\u2019s wages would go up accordingly. But that\u2019s not the case anymore and there\u2019s a big gap between labor productivity and worker\u2019s wages. The image below illustrates the extent to which wealth is accruing almost entirely to business owners and investors rather than to workers.  Image from the Book \u201cThe Rise Of The Robots\u201d by Martin Ford Hence, the belief (in capitalistic economies) that anyone can succeed and create generational wealth through ONLY hard work and perseverance\u200a\u2014\u200areally has little basis in statistical reality. Simply put\u200a\u2014\u200ayour frustration about your inability to keep up with the Joneses is justified. Why is that? Well, it\u2019s business owners and investors who are benefiting from innovations the most, instead of the workers whose wages have actually gone down since the 70s in the US. You can\u2019 have the best of both worlds\u200a\u2014\u200aSignificant wage growth with the security of employment. Either you settle for slow growth in your salary (especially if you are a regular employee) or become a net producer (that is start creating value rather than consuming). More on that in a bit. The World Is An Hourglass  When it comes to wealth, the inequality between the richest people in the world and the poorest people is astronomical. It is well known that only a couple of those richest people like Jeff Bezos or Amancio Ortega hold 50% of the world\u2019s wealth. The actual number is 8. Eight of the worlds richest people hold 50% of the planet\u2019s wealth. So imagine that the world is an hourglass. One half (Ahem! Not half exactly) of the hourglass represents 8 richest people on the planet, and the rest of the world, including you and me, sorry, is the other half of the hourglass.  Image from the Book \u201cThe Rise Of The Robots\u201d by Martin Ford The divide between the rich and the poor has been growing since the 1970s. Things have only gotten worse\u200a\u2014\u200aAn Analysis published in Sep\u201913 economist Enammuel Saez found that an astonishing 95% of total income gains between 2009\u20132012 were hoovered up by the wealthiest 1%. Hello World\u2026 Where does the wealth of those 8 richest people come from? They have extracted it from the poor, making wealth inequality even more pronounced. That\u2019s true across the world which makes us all equally unequal. Don\u2019t agree? Well, try explaining your POV to French economist Thomas Piketty who believes that selling to the rich and poor spheres of the hourglass is merely a by-product of inequality: the underlying process that drives its perpetuation is wealth extraction from the poorest to the wealthiest. What Can Be Automated Will Be Automated  Imagine this scenario: You are driving in your car at 5 mph. After you drive for one minute, you accelerate to 10 mph, then after another minute, you accelerate to 15 mph and so on. So every minute you accelerate by double. What\u2019s astonishing is how much you would travel after a while. In the first minute, you would cover about 440 feet. In the fifth minute, you would accelerate to 80 mph and would travel more than a mile. In the sixth minute, you would go so fast that you would need a really fast car and a racetrack. How fast do you think you would travel in the 28th minute if the speed of your car was increasing exponentially each minute? You would be going 671 million mph! Just to put it in perspective, that would get you to Mars in 5 minutes. This is the perfect analogy for the pace of innovation and IT\u200a\u2014\u200ait is growing exponentially. Here is a graph that shows that with Aircraft Technology as an example (because I couldn't find a better one)  Image from the Book \u201cThe Rise Of The Robots\u201d by Martin Ford The takeaway is that the pace of technology and jumping S Curves is far ahead of its adoption and economic viability (until it becomes at scale) and is faster than you can imagine. When you think about technological innovations, you would hope that its main role is to increase productivity (and questionably wages) of the employees and workers. Enterprises and scientists invent powerful machines and that enable people to get more work done efficiently. But unfortunately, that\u2019s not really the case. What actually happens is that the machines are starting to replace human workers. Let me explain through a simple chart below:  Let me first explain 4X4 Matrix of Human-Automation and Power Laws of Technology. Think of a matrix that has two axes\u200a\u2014\u200amanual/cognitive and routine/non-routine. Then we could arrange all jobs in four different categories: manual routine, manual non-routine, cognitive routine, and cognitive non-routine. So for example, menial jobs like working at an assembly line would be manual routine jobs while creative jobs would fall into the cognitive non-routine jobs. During the first Industrial Revolution, machines replaced a lot of manual routine jobs so we adapted by becoming engineers or managers. But now, machines are slowly starting to take away those jobs as well and soon a robot may become your boss. What\u2019s even scarier is that this time, we might not simply end up jobless because we\u2019ve been replaced by automation, but stuck with routine and non-routine manual jobs that are low-paid because you\u2019ll be happy to work for anything. When intelligence can be replicated, the concept of opportunity cost is upended. Economists who reject the idea that machines could someday make a large fraction of our workforce essentially unemployable often base their argument on one of the biggest ideas of economics\u200a\u2014\u200athe theory of comparative advantage. Simply put, if I clone you, and your job can be, to a high degree - predictably and accurately replicated by an Altered Carbon - then the probability that you might be replaced by an algorithm is very high and can be really soon. With the increase in collection of all kinds of data, a very advanced algorithm (Thanks to processing power and ML and Deep Learning) might essentially \u201clearn\u201d how to do your job with human-level accuracy. Progress in the human economy has resulted largely from occupational specialization. Adam Smith would say \u201cthe division of labor\u201d. One of the paradoxes of progress in the IT age is that as work becomes even more specialized, it may become more susceptible to Automation. So how do we, as a collectively intelligent species, ensure our existence as meaningful? We\u2019ll get to that in a bit. The real question is\u200a\u2014\u200awill robots steal our jobs? Being reasonably unreasonable, Definitely. Why would companies have workers if they can have robots that can work continuously, never get sick or injured, and don\u2019t require any rights, wages, or vacation days? Not to mention\u200a\u2014\u200aNo Unions. Phew! Should you worry? Yes, as of yesterday. The thing is that robots had been mostly replacing mechanical jobs, but what will happen when they start stealing cognitive jobs? Will us humans become completely replaceable as robots become smarter or even conscious? That seems so far out in the future, but if you are convinced of the power of \u201cPower Law\u201d, it might come sooner than we think. To Summarize Although productivity will increase, wage growth and income will be finite with the growth rate stagnant or declining even further.Tech lords know that there is money to be made BOP (Bottom Of The Pyramid)\u200a\u2014\u200aPeople at BOP are the product for Top 5%From Augmenting humans to Substituting Humans is the game now. The Feudal Lords: Tech-Feudalism War is a continuation of politics by other means\u200a\u2014\u200aVon Clausewitz Politics is a continuation of economics by other means\u200a\u2014\u200aMichael Ruppert Excerpt of Michael Ruppert from Collapse\u200a\u2014\u200aDocumentary We live in an infinite growth paradigm which requires growth forever. The whole economy is a pyramid scheme\u2026 Infinite growth collides with finite energy. The financial paradigm demands infinite growth\u200a\u2014\u200aWe are at a point in history where infinite growth collides with something that is more powerful than money is. So if businesses cannot win against finite energy and you are convinced that one cannot mine 100% of aggregate efficiency (Please understand and embrace the Laws of Thermodynamics), how do businesses squeeze economic value for their shareholders? Understanding this is very important\u200a\u2014\u200aHow decision makers really make decisions.  Businesses look to maintain their bottom line not only by increasing market share (which is a very hard thing to do, infinitely) but by adopting tech which in the mid to long term generates significant savings. That\u2019s the squeezing of the OPEX in Financial Statements. Tech companies want to create game-changing homo-sapiens displacing technology and generate billions in revenue through long term contracts, maintenance services and upgrade of software every year. Heard the term \u201cEngineering Shelf Life\u201d? Perhaps I\u2019m the first to coin the term. Essentially, it means that every software undergoes a constant upgrade (usually faster than what organizations can adopt internally) and thereby version 1.0, which was not vastly different from version 2.0, is killed. Version 2.1 becomes the new expectation faster than we can wipe our asses with hot-selling Donald Trump Toilet papers. Why do you think smartphones are launched at the same time every year? Do you feel the itch to get a new one every year? That happens with software as well, just not every year, but rather every 4\u20136 months. I personally have been in many C-Suite meetings where the bulk of the conversations on 5 Year Growth Roadmap & Business strategy was not digital transformation but cost reduction and optimization, preferably through the adoption of technology. Make no mistake, consulting firms leverage on technology as the tool when advising major corporations (guilty as charged, I personally have led these meetings on many occasions). Consultants find it sexy to drop hot names like RPA, Drone Led Imaging, and WFA (Google Fuck It). It\u2019s just a fancy way of telling corporations\u200a\u2014\u200aYour workforce can\u2019t compete at scale with these technologies. Either you come on board or you will be left behind. Fear tactics and fear selling always works. Let me give you a real-life example of conversations, without naming any clients I have advised and how it drives decision-making to the cliff of human sacrifice. Business (C-Suite): Let\u2019s forecast our 5-year growth strategy (because growth is infinite, I guess) and tell me where should I efficiently allocate my budget. CTO / Consultant: While we keep exploring opportunities for inorganic growth (read\u200a\u2014\u200aacquisitions), we have some quick wins we can share with you which will help drive down operational cost between 8%-25% over the next 24 months (Consultants love to give a wide range estimate). Business: Hmm\u200a\u2014\u200aWe love Quick wins. The board will be happy if we either re-invest dividends from cost savings or pass on the buck to shareholder\u2019s pockets. What can u tell me about Low Hanging Fruits (Since we humans are all lemons, to begin with)? CTO: I came across this technology by <Drop Huge TECH company name> that can automate inbound calling to our contact center up to 30% of that of our workforce. We can achieve cost savings between X Million and Y Million within the next 12\u201318 months. (It has to be in millions or billions). Consultant: I concur with the CTO (That\u2019s 60% of $3000 they are paid every day to agree with Management and provide numbers that are in agreement with the C-Suite). C-Suite (CEO): Alright. Let\u2019s evaluate the potential savings on a quarterly basis. But when we present it to the media and analyst calls, we will drive home the point that we are investing in technology to adapt to emerging trends. There goes 3000 jobs\u200a\u2014\u200aAlmost 70% of contact center jobs. 30% is re-skilled and moved to other departments with almost zero growth income but 3X increase in productivity. Also, note that those 3000 jobs contribute to only 2\u20133% of Operational cost (known as support functions OPEX) yet income of top management (not to mention bonuses) keep increasing every financial year (as reported in unaudited financial statements). The point I\u2019m making is not to attack the income growth of Senior Management but the investment in reskilling the workforce. At least a surety of employment rather than the net absolute increase in wages (which I hope I have convincingly presented my case above).  In Short Technology is the preferred tool to bottom-line economics. And sure\u200a\u2014\u200ajobs for the STEM\u2019s will keep growing\u200a\u2014\u200abut upskilling a farmer and explaining the benefits in the adoption of RPA is not going to happen. Heck\u200a\u2014\u200atry getting that labor force into STEM. Do you think AI and RPA is for everybody? Fuck no. \u201cArtificial Intelligence is not a revolution, it\u2019s a global risk\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMichael Spencer The Middle Class is nothing but just a conjured up social class to keep the low-income class out to Top 5% reach (Ask me\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m a statistician and I know how to segment and stratify economic classes based on numbers.) But not for long. The Middle class will become the other 95% as well and they will struggle to make ends meet. While the top 5% will be enjoying their yachts and private jets, the other 95% will be getting loans and credits to try to still live as a middle class while they\u2019re barely paying their rent. Why do you think there is enormous funding for startups by financial companies on short-term pay-day loans, apps for usage-based credit card points, EMI\u2019s, loans at astronomical interest rates for starting businesses etc.? There is money to be made lending to the bottom of the hourglass. I call it \u201cBorrower-led Consumerism\u201d. Do you think that corporations care? Well, not really. They actually hate you. You might think that being excelling at your job (and by that I mean exceeding your bosses\u2019 expectations on a questionable performance scale) is a good thing and that the company you work for will appreciate that, but that\u2019s not the case. They (not all) don\u2019t want to invest in re-skilling you (hence the growth of self-invested digital online courses) to be better and really excel at what you do. Corporations want you to do a mediocre job (meet expectations) so that they can have you on a tight leash and remind you that your lifestyle revolves around a single paycheck. Viola\u200a\u2014\u200aThe burgeoning middle class. That\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t be at the mercy of your boss or some corporation who really has no vested interests in you and let them control your destiny and wealth creation. Try to become skilled at other things as well and diversify what you do. You need to create many opportunities for yourself so that you\u2019re not dependent on your current job or career. Become a social brand. More on that later. By the way, let me remind you that wealth accumulation is left-skewed. Hence 95% of the working poor- middle-class fall along the long tails. Hence the popularism behind populist governments\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ll probably write a separate post on \u201cFeeding the Base\u201d politics and \u201cFinger In The Air\u201d economics later. Not so short after all...  Stay Relevant or Be Divergent? Both \u201cPlease try to convince you partner that their job is automatable\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMichael Osborne Let\u2019s get back to the Cognitive-Routine Matrix. Here are the industries (and thousands of jobs) getting automated as we speak. This may not come as a surprise, but Google has started developing a completely automated call center called Contact Center AI. Thousands of people who work at call centers will lose their jobs. I have been the very person evangelizing cognitive BLP AIML technologies ( of a company that ends with SOFT) to corporates with a ruthless focus on reducing headcount. Retail, Sales, and Service Jobs A study has shown that people don\u2019t really trust people who work in sales and retail and think they or their friends know much more about the products they\u2019re buying. Not only that, more and more people buy everything online without even going to the store, so it\u2019s not hard to imagine that retail, sales, and customer service will become automated. Clerical Work This type of work has been done by secretaries and office assistants. It consists mostly of word processing, typing, bookkeeping, and sorting and filing. That\u2019s something that can easily be automated so clerical work may also be overtaken by robots who are more productive. Accounting Do you think that your job is safe if you\u2019re an accountant? Think again. A smart software will be replacing you really soon. Logistics This industry is already highly automated by smart robotics and it\u2019s only going to increase. And so many more \u2026 I would have to write a lengthy report every quarter to mention every single industry getting a middle finger from Automation Technologies. TBH, I don\u2019t give a shit about UBI (Universal Basic Income) or UBJ\u2019s. There is a cheap joke to be made here but I\u2019ll move on. If you think the issue of people losing their jobs due to automation will be solved by a universal basic income or basic jobs, don\u2019t be so certain. I strongly advocate reskilling yourself (thanks to internet, marginal cost of reskilling is tending to zero\u200a\u2014\u200ahence it\u2019s easier than ever) in the cognitive-non routine areas like creative endeavors, complex decision making, leadership idea generation and originality or focusing on jumping on the entrepreneurship bandwagon to become a net producer rather than a net consumer laden with debt.  6 Value Compounding Approaches You Should Embrace, Yesterday \u201cNo great man ever complains of want of opportunity.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aRalph Waldo Emerson So here is what I strongly feel we should do\u200a\u2014\u200aas fast as possible. Time is of the essence. 1. Develop a Creative Led Deep Expertise (And Preferably Some Tech Specialized Knowledge)  Get your FREE Copy Here\u200a\u2014\u200aNo Email Required Not all of us cannot be music artists or scriptwriters. But we get creative with ideas, remarkable design and complex reasoning backed with sound leadership principles and ethics. The only area where us humans still have the advantage over machines is creativity and advanced cognitive skills. These are the skills that cannot be automated: judgment and decision making, fluency of ideas, active learning, systems evaluation, originality, learning strategies, deductive reasoning, complex problem solving, and system analysis. So I suggest that you focus on developing these type of skills and deep expertise in these areas. My expertise lies in evaluating potential business investments (will touch on that later in the post) and Sales & Marketing. Almost 90% of my time is focused on consuming and ideating ways to delight customers and strengthen my brand\u2019s position in their mind. Good luck \u2018PETE\u2019 - The Algo doing that. We are good friends, Pete. Side Note: Get your FREE materials on being productive, thought leadership and strategic business principles HERE! (No Email Required) 2. Thinking Slow And Thinking Deep You need to learn how to think good and slow and avoid fast and rushed decisions. Do you know what separates truly smart people from the average? They perceive reality in a different way from average people and use effective mental models for thinking, making decisions, and coming up with the solutions. A definition of mental models is \u201cPsychological representations of real, hypothetical, or imaginary situations.\u201d You can imagine mental models like apps for your smartphone, the more effective, conscious and proactive they are, the greater the results are. Here are the 7 Mental Models you need master ASAP:  Get Your FREE Copy Here (No Email Required) 1. Pareto Principle\u200a\u2014\u200aPareto Principle states that a small amount of some phenomenon causes a disproportionately large effect. 2. First Principles Thinking\u200a\u2014\u200aBasically, the practice of actively questioning every assumption you think you \u2018know\u2019 about a given problem or scenario 3. Confirmation Bias\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cThe normal mind is moved, among others, by 2 basic drives\u200a\u2014\u200aSelf-regard & Least Effort\u201d H.A. Overstreet, \u201cInfluencing Human Behavior, 1925 4. Opportunity Cost\u200a\u2014\u200aThe \u2018cost\u2019 incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would have been had by taking the second best available choice 5. Reciprocity\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cIf one individual acts on another, the action will tend to be reciprocated in kind. And of course, human beings act with intense reciprocity demonstrated as well.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aShane Parrish 6. Illusion of Control\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cThe illusion of control is the tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control events; for example, it occurs when someone feels a sense of control over outcomes that they demonstrably do not influence.\u201d Wikipedia 7. Inversion Technique\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cOften by considering what we want to avoid rather than what we want to get, we come up with better solutions.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aShane Parrish I spend time to think through the consequences of my decisions and the risk. There is no glory in making fast decisions. The company\u2019s future rides on making Sound Decisions. And good decisions require Integrative Thinking\u200a\u2014\u200aEvaluating both the Pro\u2019s and Con\u2019s, Potential risk and Expected reward. I allocate 80% of my time thinking about the problems rather than the solutions. And that\u2019s what companies will really value in you\u200a\u2014\u200aThe ability to make good high-value decisions. 3. Be Bold and Nurture Courage \u201cThere is more opportunity than ability\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aEinstein. Well, There is more ability than there is courage. Remember that nothing lasts forever, both good and the bad times. So be bold and courageous and take every opportunity that you can. Work hard, stop being lazy, and focus on the journey ahead of you. Remember\u200a\u2014\u200aMediocrity, Laziness and Ego will kill you sooner than a Robot. It\u2019s the main goal that matters, but the process of achieving that goal. Don\u2019t crumble when faced with fear, harness that power and use it to your benefit! \u201c\u2026and finally how to build communities\u200a\u2014\u200aarmies of exponentially enabled individuals willing and able to help today\u2019s entrepreneurs make their boldest dreams come true.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aBold by Steven Kotler In my earlier post A Year Older, A Year Closer, Wisdom From My Older Self, I expanded on the truth that we are living on borrowed time. Without the realization that time is a perishable liability, one cannot truly achieve their objectives. I remind myself of that every single day and that is the kernel of fire that pushes my limits beyond boundaries. 4. Learn Integrative Thinking: Connecting The Dots \u201cRandom connections drive serendipitous discoveries. Dreams, for example, are the primordial soup of innovation, where ideas connect seemingly at random.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aSteven Johnson  Knowledge is becoming less and less important as everybody has access to it, freely and cheaply. So you won\u2019t win by simply knowing more than other people. Innovations and good ideas are what\u2019s going to save you because you should know what to do with knowledge and how to use to come up with new things. But where do great ideas and innovations come from? Ideas don\u2019t come as sudden breakthroughs, but more as subtle hunches that need to be cultivated and they evolve over time. Collaboration and competition are also important components of innovation which happens when ideas connect. How do I learn and apply Integrative Thinking? Simple. I moved on from being a new corporate-driven slave consumer to being a meaningful net producer. I adopted the long-tail hedge against security and comfort. I am creating more wealth for myself in the last 7 months compared to a decade in corporate. I\u2019m in control of the rate of growth of my personal wealth and satisfaction. 5. (H)elp (O)thers (W)in To Lead And Succeed \u201cYou can have everything in life you want if you will just help other people get what they want.\u201d Zig Ziglar  Accenture Report We have established earlier in the article that lower-skilled workers are in most danger of losing their jobs due to automation. That\u2019s why we need to identify those vulnerable groups and focus on skill learning. Education and lifelong learning are the only ways to close the skills gap. Another important point to make here is that we MUST improve the lives of others. The ability to empower and help others succeed is perhaps the most underrated qualities. It's not only Self-Improvement. Its influencing others to grow\u200a\u2014\u200atogether. Do I have to remind you of an African proverb? If you wish to go fast, go alone. If you wish to go far, go together. 6. Jump curves\u200a\u2014\u200aIdea Sex \u201cA great book begins with an idea; a great life, with a determination.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aLouis L\u2019Amour Coming up with great ideas is not only about making a lot of money but making yourself a better person. And don\u2019t expect that all of your ideas will be awesome and revolutionary. There will be a lot of mediocre ideas, weird ideas, impossible idea, and simply stupid ideas. But, all of that is useful because you\u2019re training your idea muscle, and yes, it\u2019s just like any other muscle in your body. When you have a lot of ideas, it\u2019s almost like they have sex with each other and what do you get? More ideas. You have to constantly challenge yourself to come up with new and exciting ideas because that leads to innovation. And remember, innovation is not about improving something slightly, it\u2019s about making it ten times better! So write all your ideas down constantly (no matter how stupid you think they are) work on them, read about them, research them, and great things will happen! Summary Focus on building Deep Expertise with Specialized Knowledge to be a Thought LeaderThere is a lot one can achieve in 24 hours. There is no need to rush into things. Step back and think with clarity. Don\u2019t sacrifice clarity for cleverness.Remind yourself that time and tide wait for no one. Have a strong desire to succeed with the motivation to put it into action. You are just 3 feet away from gold.Have a broad view of what\u2019s happening in the world. Allocate some time every week to update yourself on emerging technologies and creative pursuits. There is no saying how the neurons in your brain will fire to find novel ideas and solutions.\u201cYou can have everything in life you want if you will just help other people get what they want.\u201d Zig Ziglar\u200a\u2014\u200aEnd of story. (\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn if you believe it or not\u201d Arnold Schwarzenegger)Creativity is not magic. It\u2019s a muscle. Own a diary and write down all the stupid ideas you might have or come up with. It\u2019s exercising the muscle that matters, not the idea itself. Make it a habit. After all, we are nothing but an aggregate system of our habits.

            "answer_text": "Yes, automation will lead some jobs to be obsolete. In fact, according to experts, automation could replace 40% of jobs in 15 years. However, automation will also lead to newer jobs, specifically in the digital area. Jobs that will definitely get affected the most by automation are those which include repetitive and simple tasks, as well as blue collar jobs. However, there\u2019s an article from BBC that says automation may also affect middle-income jobs, like clerks, chefs, office workers, junior lawyers, and inspectors.  To give you an idea, here are some jobs which are highly susceptible to automation: Data Entry Keyers, whose basic job description is the operation of data entry services, data compilation, analysis, and verification. This job will be easily lost to automation, as the job involves simple and repetitive tasks. More than this, the increasingly fast pace of businesses today require faster processing of data, which software can easily do. Software instantly sorts, stores, and analyses big quantities of data.Library Technicians, who are tasked with reserving, circulating, renewing, and discharging books and other materials. Scandinavian countries have started replacing human staff in libraries with a self-service system to keep them from shutting down. However, this doesn\u2019t indicate an impending end for library technicians in the near future.New Accounts Clerks, whose job description includes entertaining customers\u2019 questions on available services, as well as compiling information about new accounts and entering account information into computers. Similar to Data Entry Keyers, jobs like Accounts Clerks are highly susceptible to automation because of the repetitive nature of the job.Telemarketers, who are tasked to deliver prepared scripts and persuade potential customers to purchase a product or service over the phone. Today, sales calls from computerised systems are everywhere, slowly replacing human telemarketers.Insurance Underwriters help clients decide which insurance to receive and how they should pay for it. Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance in Japan has replaced 30 medical insurance claims representative with an AI system based on IBM\u2019s Watson Explore, significantly reducing the time needed to calculate payouts.Construction Workers, which are manual labor jobs, are also susceptible to automation. Technology Review reports on robotic bricklayers which can lay up to 1,200 bricks a day (human workers can lay 300 to 500 bricks a day). Soon, robotic bricklayers like this will be introduced to construction sites, replacing two to three human workers each.This does not mean that unemployment will immediately spike up and people will be left jobless. As automation \u201ckills\u201d jobs, it also creates others. However, we\u2019re posed with a new challenge as humans: we have to continuously improve our skills to build a better portfolio. We have to remain competitive.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll quote an interview from Inc Magazine: Mark Cuban Says This Will Soon Be the Most Sought-After Job Skill: He predicts the next wave of innovation will be \"the automation of automation.\" By that, Cuban means software will soon begin writing itself, which will ultimately eliminate those lucrative software development jobs. About writing software, Cuban said: \"It's just math, right?\" Humans will no longer be needed. \u2026 \"I personally think there's going to be a greater demand in 10 years for liberal arts majors than for programming majors and maybe even engineering,\" Cuban said. He cited degrees such as English, philosophy, and foreign languages as being the most valuable. \"Maybe not now,\" Cuban acquiesced. \"They're gonna starve for awhile.\" Their day, though, is likely coming, he says. There\u2019s also an interesting tool out there that uses some statistical probability for how possible it is for a job to be automated:  Essentially, there are plenty of jobs out there that could be automated. This isn\u2019t something that would happen overnight and would replace the human kind as a whole. But if your job is just greeting people and saying \u201cbye\u201d all day long, there could be a robot that waves at the door and does the job. If you\u2019re pressing a single confirmation button every 5 minutes (which has been an actual job in various Chinese warehouses and factories), this isn\u2019t something that a robot can\u2019t automate, either. Same goes for plenty of other jobs where the daily workflow can be designed in a quick chart with finite iterations without any subjective decision-making process involved. I would agree with Mark that, with time, professions dealing with human psychology, linguistics, or other areas that are more vague, creative, thought-provoking would prevail. The technical industry would likely be flooded with engineers building automated solutions or \u201cconnector\u201d jobs that basically bundle things together. There will always be some room for innovation for each of those industries, but the volume of jobs will decline as businesses would be fairly satisfied with what technology can offer out of the box.

            "answer_text": "Every time I have looked into this question the answer has been that increases in automation actually increase employment rather than reducing it.  However, the increases in jobs come in different areas of skill and activities than the jobs eliminated by the automation. Automation requires new machines be built, operated and maintained.  The new machines can only do limited things but they can do it in  high volume and all day long.  They never need breaks and they don't get sick or need vacations.  So long as the work to be done can be completely defined in a simple enough way that a machine can do it the machines will do it better and for less cost than low skilled people.  Some examples of jobs machines can do very well include picking up parts from one place and putting them somewhere else (such as for printed circuit board assembly); spray painting automobiles and parts; simple assembly tasks such as putting nuts on bolts and tightening them; reading codes on grocery packages and collecting payment for purchases. The machines require attention from time to time.  Operators need to get involved when complicated problems arise.  One example would be a case where an automatic checkout machine in a grocery store doesn't acknowledge money that was deposited in the machine.  Machines are very bad at communicating with customers and a skilled human is needed to deal with many of the problems which can arise. Machines also need programming and repair.  These jobs require specialized skills to perform.  While an unskilled person can be trained quickly to be a checkout clerk in a grocery store or a teller in a bank it takes many months or even years for a person to learn how to program the machines that do these tasks and at least months for a person to learn how to repair a machine when it stops working. The bottom line is increased automation means many unskilled workers will be replaced by the machines but many more people will be needed to perform the higher skilled tasks that arise because the machines are being used.  Without additional training the low skilled workers replaced will simply become unemployed.  Those who can and do learn how to do the more difficult jobs will earn more money and enjoy higher demand which means continued employment and competition between employers to hire them. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether automation will destroy jobs on a massive scale is still an open question. Itamar Ben Hamo recently explored the idea in his recent article: How Automation Is Impacting Jobs During the Pandemic. As Ben Hamo outlines, the debate at hand focuses on whether automation creates, changes, or kills jobs -- and there are plenty of competing opinions. According to Sami Atiya, president of Robotics & Motion, automated technology will create many more jobs than it destroys. MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson and others hold that automation will change the jobs we already have. On the other hand, some, including former U.S. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang, claim that automation harms workers and eliminates jobs. Of course, this was the automation debate before the pandemic just a few months ago. Since then, apocalyptic predictions about mass job loss have intensified. However, this isn\u2019t borne out in the data we have so far. Automation has increased during the pandemic - but only at a modest rate. Automated floor cleaner company Brain Corp says it has seen a 13.8 percent robotic usage increase in the first quarter of this year among retailers in U.S. locations and a 24 percent rise in the second quarter. With offices closed, PayPal has used automated chatbots for a record 65 percent of all customer inquiries. So there\u2019s a mismatch between the rhetoric and the reality. Studies say millions of job are \u201cexposed\u201d to automation, but exposure is not the same thing as definitive loss. At the same time, automation is indeed increasing, though not at apocalyptic levels. So where does the answer lay? Likely somewhere in the middle. ",

            "answer_text": "I just had a conversation over thanks giving with a man who used to work at Chrysler many years ago, I'm guessing like 30 years ago. His job was to spray paint on the cars on the production line. There were 12 employees on that specific production line. At one point they started using robot arms that had automated the process of painting the cars. They immediately cut down from 12 to 2 employees, this gentleman had survived the car. His new responsibility was to paint the spots the robots would miss. I asked him how that was happening, he said that he guessed that they would run out of paint and they would shoot air for a short amount of time, and as a result a final eye of a human would be needed to identify and correct this possible cases. Time passed, and the robot arms had their algorithm improved to perfection. No longer missing any spots, and human intervention was no longer necessary to confirm, and or correct errors made by the robot arms. At this point, this certain gentleman was moved to another position that he would fill in for people going in for breaks and so on, so he continued to be employed by Chrysler, but no longer as a person on the painting production line as it had been 100% automated. To make a point, the labor tasks can most definitely be automated and will be automated. Even other more complex tasks that might require a army of robots to get things done on a non linear production line, which require a network which robots can use to communicate with one another to allocate efforts on a much more granular level, without human intervention. I recommend you watch this     It's a much more non linear system compared to that of a production line, and it's automated farming work. Getting robots to do the work of many, faster, cheaper (eventually, given the overhead cost of purchase, setup,etc), without complaining. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Not only does automation not have a long term impact on employment rates, it\u2019s actually the only way to grow the economy.  The Logic Behind Automation & Employment Let\u2019s look at the logic at the bare bones level: All things being equal: Automation (more productivity) means fewer jobs. This is because it allows fewer workers to make the same amount of stuff.For example, if you add some robot welders to a factory, you may only need half as many human welders as you did before.More output (making more stuff) means more jobs. This is pretty obvious: if you decide to make 10% more cars, you\u2019ll need 10% more workers.Therefore, if automation (economic efficiency) increases at the same rate as output (economic growth), there will be no net gain or loss of jobs. Does History Support This Logic? In by book Bobbins, Not Gold I talk about how even in the 1100\u2019s AD Europe was already beginning to automate. For example, textile weavers in Flanders invented elaborate machinery to full and weave cloth\u2014this didn\u2019t cause Flanders to have a bunch of unemployed weavers. It made them Europe\u2019s industrial heartland, and most wealthy, and highly urbanized region. The same thing happened in the aftermath of the Black Death, which struck Europe in the 1350\u2019s (depending upon where you were). Lots of people died, which meant that people needed to get creative if they were to continue building their civilization. During this time Europe underwent the \u201cFirst Industrial Revolution\u201d (as I, and other Medievalists refer to it), which saw the widespread adoption of paddle-powered engines (river mills) to automatically grind grain, full cloth, and chop wood. This, of course, culminated with the Renaissance. There are countless examples of similar situations, including the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain during the 19th century (or perhaps more properly, the Third Industrial Revolution), where technology grew rapidly, but did not cause systemic unemployment. The common thread of economic history is that better technology, vis-a-vis automation, has invariably made the West more prosperous. You can read more about automation and job loss here. ",

Kodak went bankrupt and all his staff came on the road. . HMT (clock) BAJAJ (scooter) DYANORA (TV) MURPHY (radio) NOKIA (Mobile) RAJDOOT (bike) AMBASSADOR (car) Friends, There was no shortage of quality at all, yet they were out of the market !! reason??? They have not changed over time. !! You have an idea that in the coming 10 years, the world will change completely and 70 to 90% of the people running today will be closed. Welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution ... Uber is just a software. He does not have a single car of his own, despite this he is the world's largest taxi company. Airbnb is the world's largest hotel company, while they do not have a single hotel of their own. There are many examples like paytm, ola cabs, oyo rooms. There is no work left for young lawyers in the US now because the software named IBM Watson gives better legal advice throughout the moment. In the next 10 years, 90% of Americans will become unemployed ... who will save 10% ... they will be Super Specialists. The software named Watson is diagnosed with 4x Accuracy of Cancer compared to humans. By 2030 the computer will be more intelligent than humans. By 2018, Driverless cars will land on the roads. By 2020, this single invention will start to change the whole world. 90% cars will disappear from the streets of the world in the next 10 years ... Those who will survive will either have electric cars or hybrid ... roads will be empty, consumption of petrol will decrease by 90%, all Arab countries will become bankrupt . You will request a car from a software like Uber and in a few moments, a driverless car will be parked at your door ... if you share it with someone, that ride will be cheaper than your bike. Due to being a driverless of cars, 99% of accidents will stop. This will stop the business of Car Insurance. No employment like a driver will survive on earth. When 90% cars will disappear from cities and roads, problems like Traffic and Parking will end automatically ... because a car will be equal to 20 cars today. From today 5 or 10 years ago, there was no such place where there is no PCO. When the mobile phone arrived, the PCOs had to shut down. The PCO people started selling the mobile phones. Now the recharge is also going online. Have you ever noticed ..? Today, every third store in the market is a mobile phone store which does sale, service and maintenance of phones and it's accessories.. Almost all payments are done by Paytm today .. People have started booking railway tickets with their phones. The transaction of money is also changing. Currency Note was replaced by Plastic Money and now it's Digital... Hence... Every Person should continue to make changes in his business or his / her way of working and should also change his / her nature over time for Good. \"Keep Updating / Upgrading Your Skills and Knowledge with Time\" The world is changing very fast .. Keep Your eyes and ears open or else you will lose ... Be prepared to change with time. Run with time and Be Successful ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The open-ended question is how will we manage which jobs are lost and which are created? Industry selects automation projects based on the profit potential. Academic researchers cast a broader net and explore more topics like AI and androids. Some people are beginning to think about the social and political consequences of widespread automation. If automation continues to expand in the rather haphazard way that industry selects projects, I think the social disruption is likely to be greater than is necessary. I also suspect the transition period will be far longer and more painful than it need be. One possible solution is to focus our efforts on single industries and automate the entire supply chain from raw materials to finished goods. The program will require solving a large number of problems, probably many thousands. The good news is that we already have the necessary technology to automate all the tasks. Automated manufacturing does not use human-like robots, or androids. Instead, it applies specialized robots optimized for each task. For an entire supply chain, we would need thousands of such robots to perform all the tasks needed to acquire raw materials, process and refine them, fabricate parts, and then assemble the finished products. Again, this is doable with existing technology. All that is lacking is the will and motivation to tackle the larger job. Once an industry has been fully automated, the lessons from that project can be leveraged to automate the next industry in less time. Focusing on one industry creates space to consider the consequences of eliminating most human jobs from that industry. We could use that space to retrain workers. Many of those workers could help with the automation project by advising engineers on the details of each task. Politicians would have time to ponder and debate ways to deal with the loss of jobs. In my opinion, as a civilization, we need to take control of this transition. We know the end result: few or no jobs will remain that require human labor. Until AI develops something equivalent to human judgement, some people will still be needed to supply that vital aspect of decision-making, but the number will be small. We will achieve the best social results if we make this transition as short as possible, to minimize the misery and pain of widespread job loss. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely. Automation is going to affect jobs. \u2018THE FUTURE OF JOBS\u2019 report by WEF predicts that machines will rule the workplace by 2025.  \"The Future of Jobs 2018\" report by World Economic Forum (WEF) predicts that the rise of robotics will result in machines performing more tasks on the job than humans by 2025.In 2018, humans performed an average of 71% of total task hours across the 12 industries spanning manufacturing, services and high tech.By 2025, that will drop to just 48%, according to the WEF. Machines will perform the remaining 52%.Changed Job Scenario: It also estimates that while that trend could displace 75 million jobs globally by 2022, it will create 133 million new positions only if sufficient re-skilling of the existing workforce is done.Globally, almost half of all companies expect automation to cut their full-time workforce in the next four years.In India alone, 54% of employees need reskilling.Let us weigh some advantages and disadvantages to the overall industry, job culture and what should be our way forward.  Advantages of Automation: Efficiency: Automation helps companies offer goods and services at lower costs than traditional providers. The reduced costs keep the inflation under check and result in more savings by individuals and companies. The increased savings will be utilized as capital by the industry, which will lead to the creation of more jobs.Objectivity: Automation reduces bureaucratic discretion and reduces opportunities for petty corruption in patronage based systems. Reduction in corruption leads to improved ease of doing business conditions, which will further lead to more investments and more fob opportunitiesHuman Development: Technology-driven automation is central to the process of increasing our living standards. Because better tools increase worker's productivity which in turn increases his wages helping him to raise his living standards.Quality: Automated processes can produce more precise products because their working is controlled by computer programs which have a clear set of standards for working.Non-Monotony: Machines do not feel boredom, nor do they degrade their output when subjected to repeated works.Automation raises oil efficiency and productivity: This principle applies to public, private and non-profit sectors alike.For instance, a report released by the World Bank Group in 2016, Digital Dividends, concluded that e-procurement initiatives by the Indian government helped in injecting more competition into the process. Disadvantages of Automation: Job Loss: A recent report from the International Labour Organization found that more than 2/3 of South-East Asia's 9.2mn textile and footwear jobs are threatened by automation.Automation involves high initial cost that may be difficult to offset hence difficult for the small businessman to start a business.Economic Inequality: Automation has the tendency to aggravate economic inequalities further.Developing countries will be among the worst sufferer as they depend on their competitive advantage of low-cost low skilled labour.Ethics of Automation: Robots do not demand wages and this raises the question that whether employing robots in place of humans is equivalent to replacing free labour with slave labour.Way Ahead: Skill Upgradation: The union government has launched various programmes to skill the youth under the Skill India campaign The programmes should include not only the literate youth but also those who lost jobs due to automation.Flexible-labour laws: Labour laws should be made flexible so that an employee's transition from one job to another job is smooth.Focus on SMEs: As per an estimate an investment of around 1.5 lakh rupees is needed to create one job in small and cottage industries (SMEs), whereas it needs 6 lakh in capital-intensive heavy industries.Thus SMEs and labour intensive infrastructure sectors such as textile manufacturing roads and railways should be developed to create employment.Need for employee protection: The World Bank Group suggested that would be better to strengthen workers protection independently from work contracts by de-inking social insurance from employment, offering independent social assistance, and helping workers retrain and find new employment quickly.Universal Basic Income (UBI): Ideas such as UBI may also be given a thought because as the availability of jobs reduces, minimum financial support from the government will allow even an unemployed person to lead a decent standard of life.Taxing the Robots: Utilizing robots in place of humans is economically efficient because robots don't demand wages. Hence, to counter this, the govt can impose a tax on robots to be paid by its users.",

            "answer_text": "Automation cannot and did not ever lead to job loss, except that the people must retrain to learn the new skills of operating automated machines. It is a paradox. In general, the number of new jobs created is always much lager than the number of jobs lost. Consider for example, the transport by horse-ride. How many people do you think rode horses before the engine-operated trains and cars were invented? Very few indeed. But once engine-run trains and cars and buses arrived, the number of rides so greatly exploded that the total number of new jobs as drivers of trains and buses and taxis was thousands and thousands times larger than the number of jobs people had as horse-keepers. Indeed, when horses became obsolete as bicycles arrived, the number of people with jobs to fix bikes was very much larger than the number of jobs lost as horse-keepers. How many people were doing the job of scriveners, who made handwritten copies of documents, before the typewriter was invented? Very few indeed. But when the typewriter kind of automated writing of documents, improving the legibility greatly, and through carbon copying, made great many more copies, the cost of document writing fell so drastically that the demand for new jobs for typists was thousands and thousands of times larger than the jobs of handwriting scriveners. How many people were selling and repairing phones before there was a telephone instead of shouting as the mode of communication? The students of microeconomics may put this into math. Suppose that output quantity q is produced with factors capital K and Labor L. The production function is q=F(k, l). Now, let Fk>0, Fl>0 mean that marginal product of capital Fk is positive and so is the marginal product of labor Fl. Suppose that technology makes k more productive than before by introducing new machines (with some automation). You will see that it makes just no sense to postulate that Flk or Fkl, the cross partial derivative is negative? Why? If more capital increases marginal output, how can adding labor hurt? It cannot. But if Fkl>0, it must mean that the demand for labor must increase to make use of the larger quantum of capital (think capital as machine mainly). Te sad part of education is that people simply seem not to use their heads: of course automation makes the jobs of some people disappear as the machines they used before have become obsolete. But who are going to run the new automated machines? Nobody at all? Think about the laundry machine, and the global explosion of garments industry. The automated laundry machine has created an incredibly explosive growth in the demand for cloth, because it is so easy to wash the cloth now. Do you know how many people had jobs as washer man or washer woman to wash clothe before the laundry machine came, and how many have jobs now selling laundry machines and repairing them? ",

            "answer_text": "Will automation lead to loss of jobs? The question is such now that it must be approached mathematically. Historically items of any kind were expensive. It took a number of people to produce that item. Then the industralisation came along and that allowed one person to manufacture a number of items thus reducing the cost of all items. Then technological adavances led to the manufacture of a wide variety on new products. Further advances led to more efficient production. Then automation came along and removed many tedious and repetitive actions from human toil. Up until now all advances had led to new industries that more than compensated for the demise of old industries and old methods. Now we are reaching a new situation. Automation that was originally targeted at the means of production is now being directed at services. Services were the sanctuary of the newly unemployed or newly educated . Whilst the increase in service industries balanced the reduction in employment in production the situation was seen as manageable even desirable, but now we are loosing service industry jobs and any new industries create fewer new positions. We are fast approaching the situation where there are many more people than jobs available. We aren\u2019t creating anywhere near the amount of new jobs required and we\u2019re removing jobs from across the board and from the services industry as well. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm sure many can answer this. But I will give it a go. In the short-term there will be an increase in jobs. As those that are to run the newly automated processes are trained, while the existing processes are maintained. Some of these new skilled workers may likely come from the old cohort. When that happens there will be fewer new short-term opportunities created. Then yes, the existing workers will too have to upskill, and undoubtedly the ones superfluous to the new technology will likely lose their jobs. What people are currently having to do, that differs from the past, is retrain and upskill into new jobs. This will happen more and more often. Late last year I met a guy I've known for 15 years, on a job assistance scheme. He had recently been laid off a job of 35 years due to a new computer halving their office staff. In this case the extra jobs came for those that trained the staff that would remain. For my friend on this course, he got to use a computer for the first time in his life. He learn't how to write a CV and apply for jobs online. Last I saw he was balancing up to three jobs. But he seemed happy. He had successfully transitioned into a different form of work. This will happen more and more often. ",

            "answer_text": "Will automation lead to job losses. NO, a big NO. It\u2019s an artificial Paranoia of Job Losses. These days there are spates of news all around that there will be huge number of job losses across the world especially in technology industry. This is causing despair not only among the working professionals but also in college students making them worried about their future. Such news are not only being spread by the fear mongering media but also tech titans like Vinod Dham. We are constantly being told that there will be huge job losses and large army of people will be unemployed. Even an idea of basic income is being considered so as to compensate people for their job losses and paying them enough so that don't revolt. Yes there might be job losses. But when there were not, when industrial revolution dawned, almost all manual jobs were lost, but a number of unimaginable new industrial jobs were created which we could not have imagined earlier. Similarly with the advent of computers, there was strong resistance against computers as they will take up the jobs of all clerks, and lower management, but huge number of technology jobs were created which again we were not able to imagine just 2\u20133 decades back. Now we are at the cusp of another big revolution. Probably? Yes, there will surely be massive job losses due to automation, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and all the new emerging technologies but then there will be a massive number new jobs which probably we are not able to imagine right now. This is how the world works, old disappears, better and bigger appears.As farm workers were jealous of industrial workers, as industrial workers were jealous of technology workers, the current workers will be similarly jealous of new future workers which will be surely much more high paying and much more glamorous. Just stay calm, a new wave of creative jobs are going to be there for new generation. DO NOT PANIC. ",

Throughout time, from horse-drawn carries, to the printing press to the wool loom, technology has helped human\u2019s to be free of tasks that can be better performed by harnessing science, engineering a product and finding a useful industrial purpose for it. The latest ground-breaking technology is information technology. It allows us to save incredible amounts of information that surpasses (by a considerable distance) how much a human could memorize. Programming allows us to process that data in highly customization ways. Processing the data through programming rather than human though makes certain jobs, such as supermarket checkout workers, bank clerks and the people who make the Yellow Pages, redundant. If information technology advances at the same pace that it currently is, it also looks to threaten financial traders, doctors, lawyers and truck drivers. But. Advances in technology undoubtedly also creates jobs that didn\u2019t previously exist. Imagine if you had a time machine and told the average person from the 1800\u2019s that you were a \u201cSocial Media Manager\u201d, a \u201cSoftware Engineer\u201d or a \u201cDigital Marketer\u201d and the closest contact you\u2019d had with a farmer was a friend of a friend\u2019s dad knows one\u2026 ",

How valid were their fears and how much of their fear came from being unable to see past their lack of information or imagination? And they hardly had the kind of history to look back on as we do. Automation is nothing new - have a look around you and decide if you would rather fetch water from a well, make a fire to heat it in a crude copper pan, wash your few rough clothes by hand with homemade soap, feed your chickens and rabbits hoping that the sick ones will recover, trade some eggs for milk , churn some butter, grind some wheat, knead some dough, wait for it to rise, put it in the clay oven, walk to the fields to hoe your rows, carrying your lunch in a crude bag, dig up some potatoes, chase and kill some pests, walk home in the evening, sharpen your worn axe, chop more firewood, draw more water, scrape your potatoes in the fading light, go into your windowless cottage, light your tallow candle, boil some meat before it goes bad, repair your boots, darn your socks, take your candle and some leaves with you to the outhouse, remember that it's time to trade for more matches, do your toilet in the dark, wash your hands with sand and water in a wooden bucket, trudge back to your two rooms, hang your clothes on a peg in the wall and finally lie down on your straw-filled bag, think fondly of the fact that in another month you will have collected enough feathers to finally have that mattress you dream of, pull up your handwoven woolen blanket to sleep until the next day when you can do it all again.

            "answer_text": "This is probably the most important question of our era, thanks for asking. There are no reasonable people that believe there will not be job loss because of automation. The real question that people are answering is will replacement jobs come into existence as fast, or faster, than the rate at which we loose jobs to automation. The rate of machine capabilities is likely to follow Moore\u2019s Law, doubling approximately every 18 months. So, as we begin to become aware of job loss in a real way it will be increasing extremely rapidly. Jobs being lost to automation over the next 10 years: manufacturing work, all driving jobs, any repetitive visual inspection job (including things like radiologist), any job concerned with selection and counting (pharmacists and their assistants), any material handling job. That\u2019s a huge number of jobs, some of them require substantial education.  watch this, read \"The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future\" for serious treatment of these issues. The answer is that technology will replace human labor, and that this will rapidly accelerate over the next several decades. This will be accelerating in a way that the previous industrial revolution did not, humans will not be able to get \"new\" jobs because they won't exist. Jobs are going away the same way serfdom and sharecropping did, we are at an inflection point. Our economic value will rely on our ability to work with machines. ",

            "answer_text": "I would strongly recommend starting your search by watching this as it gives you all the agruments why Automation will surely kill jobs. (I have not come across any agrument not mentioned here).  So is it true? Are we doomed? No, apparently the videos is made with a fear-mongering attitude so that you are alerted at least. As most viewers take automation too lightly, this video stares you more than required to awaken you. The problem is already being solved and their is a bunch of solutions available. Let\u2019s the first ready-bunch of these solutions:- 1) Reducing no of hours worked per week to maintain the size of workforce. (Advocated by Jack Ma already) When Mechanical horses were replaced, the benefit was that 5 day week 40 hours rule instead of 6 days sometimes 12 hours (over 60 hr/week) was introduced Automobiles sector by Henry Ford. Now if jobs are lost fast as we move towards automation, We can continuous reduce the no of hours we work from (5 x 8=40 hrs) to (4 x 8=32 hrs ) .. to (1 x 8 = 8 hrs) so as to maintain the size of workforce. So when there is 25% unemployment, reduce the working hours from 40 hrs to 30 hrs and so on. This solution is advocated by Jack Ma already. Forget long work hours, Alibaba's Jack Ma feels 4 hours a day, 3 days a week work culture could be the norm soon. 2) Providing Universal basic income (UBI) (a US president candidate Andrew Yang running on this) Solves the problem of people who can\u2019t be employed as their job is automated. As automation makes it easier for us to fed and give comfort life to more people without cost to society (as work will be done by robots), many people can leave ever more comfortable lives. So automation will mean more time to watch YouTube videos while eating popcorn. Will this person remain unemployable? We discuss the solution for this later. Here is an American President running on this platform Andrew Yang. The Freedom Dividend - Yang2020 - Andrew Yang for President 3) This change is gradual.. Technology evolves but Businesses take time to use it... The Computers and mobiles are now over 30 and 13 years old yet many people and businesses still have a lot of paperwork, why? As just because we have a better technology is available, does not mean it can be used. The people need to be comfortable using it. Imagine how many people will be comfortable driving next to a self-driving autos or comfort able sitting in one. While it might be easy to switch truck with self-driving trucks as goods are less important. So the replacement of older technology will be much slower than fear-mongers would have us think. Each technology will have its own replacement rate. So yeah the technology will be obsolete but history has it that it takes a about 20 years on an average to completely replace a older technology. Relax, experts say it's at least a decade before you can buy a self-driving vehicle 4) Universal Basic Income will give you paid time to learn something completely new even after your Job is automated So when my job is automate am i jobless , no. I can use my basic income to live life and retrain into my passion and try another shot at a new career. Trying more careers as we are paid while learning for jobs, I could try Computers for 3 years and now bored i could try economics for 2 years and then a spend a few years travelling around the world on basic income. So there are many great advantages of automation are: 1) End repetitive manual work like Cashier, Receptionist, discovery in lawyer, etc. This will mean each of us will be able to do something we do not hate to come back every Monday morning to do. More of will be lawyers for 4 days a week (instead of 5 days), but arguing in court not going through boring documents. 2) As automation increases, so will the minimum Universal income. Once a robot can make me travel the world for just some electricity generated from Uranium atom collected from the Moon then everyone will start their lives by going around the world for a few years. Is that great? Something like what Ash does in Pokemon will be reality for everyone. All because now a robot arranges this all. One major disadvantage: 1) Life is very comfortable and so we might find it a little boring If everything is so perfect, we might miss the daily hush of human lies and perhaps the human interaction. But hey. I miss that in the US already as i am from India. So this is just an extension of what we all face anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no Most jobs that people did in 1600 AD have been taken over by automation, at least in part. We don't plant seeds by hand, we have a planter. We don't thresh grain by hand, we have a combine harvester We don't make boards by hand (splitting them and adzing them), we have sawmills, nor do we make nails, we have nail making machines, etc. All of those things have been automated, or at least machine assisted. Yet people still work in the farm industry, and still work in the construction industry. (far LESS people work in farming due to automation but people still do) Many jobs that people did in 1900 (that didn't even exist in 1600) have been automated too.. We don't connect phone calls by hand, the central switch does it for us. We don't collect fares when passengers get on the horse tram, the passenger waves a smartcard at the streetcar reader instead. And so on. Many jobs will be replaced. The proportion of workers in different industries will change. But people will still have jobs. They just will shift in nature. There will always be a need for artists and craftsmen, for prototypers, for trouble shooters, for customer facing workers, for knowledge workers, and so on. ",

For some people it might seem like a bad thing then and there, but believe me, increased automation is a very good thing for humanity. Increased levels of automation simply leads to changes in the type of work we do, as we go towards ever higher levels of abstraction. This means that we get to work with the big picture instead of the details, and that's something we humans are very good at. We can think of it as levelling up. Level 0: People build things with their hands.   Level 1: People use tools to build more complex things.   Level 2: People use machines that can build things based on their design.   Level 3: People use computers to program machines to build things.   Level 4: People use intelligent machines that can decide what to build.   Right now, we are at level 3 and on the verge of entering level 4. I, for one, think that working at this level is very exciting. My job is basically to make the software that will in turn enable the machines to analyze the situation so we can enter level 4. It beats the hell out of carving out stone all day long. ",

This century will not be ruled by capitalist and artisanal products will boom in market which will lead to problems for large corporation. People will become more health conscious and local enterprises will flourish. Technology which we believe as boom for environment will actually lead to its bust. This digital tech is more damaging to planet\u2019s environment then the pollutants from the industrial units. Lithium batteries are equally damaging to nature like oil. Now is the time that we humans must learn the trade and skill with which large companies used to manufacture products and train coming generation to do so from their workshops. World can only become a better world if we start understanding the falsehood prevailing around us. Driverless car is a new thing but robotic arms existed for decades. But these driverless card comes with lots of risk which requires recurring investment on updating security feature. It also has degrading battery. So believe in human potential and disregard large enterprise who only looks human as a slave. Be fearless and be prepared for the fight as coming years are beautiful for humanity. Learn to create something and be fearless. ",

            "answer_text": "Software robots, i.e., automation in its most concrete form, are designed precisely to perform those menial, repetitive, high volume, high frequency tasks, such as data entry and management. So by definition, the primary purpose of automation is to replace humans in some of the tasks they must carry out. However, a recent Accenture research report - \u201cIntelligent Technology Meets Human Ingenuity to Create the Future Workforce\u201d, emphasises that not only the revenues of companies that resort to automation are expected to rise by 32% by 2022, but, more importantly, employment will also increase by 9%. So the fact that bots\u2019 \u201cmeaning in life\u201d is to perform more quickly and more accurately human activities, does not mean that automation will lead to loss of jobs. Now, obviously, (at least) some people whose jobs mainly involve \u201ccopy paste\u201d kinds of processes, will lose them. Yet, in the larger picture, automation leads to employment increase (as reported by Accenture) for 2 main reasons: (1) it amplifies production, which calls for more workers, and (2) it rests on the capacities of software designers and coders, so it makes a significant contribution to the expansion of IT workforce. I believe it\u2019s most important to acknowledge that automation does not render human staff obsolete. Even with the dawning of cognitive technologies, which point to a more human-like functioning of robots, artificial intelligence tools still need programming by humans. Simply, software robots cannot function independently of humans and they are still not able to carry out the more complex human thinking processes. Human employees will be supplemented by the introduction of Robotic Process Automation technologies \u2014 to support staff members\u2019 performance rather than supplanting them. When RPA is implemented in a company, staff roles may need to be reviewed and employees relocated to more important customer service activities, as the tedious back office processes are now automated.

            "answer_text": "The answer is both a yes and no, with an increase in technology there will be a loss of jobs in one sector but it will certainly lead to opening up new ways for others. Automation requires new machines to be made and operated. The new machines can do things really fast compared to when they will be done manually. So long as the work to be done can be completely defined in a simple enough way that a machine can do it better and for less cost than low skilled people. Some examples of jobs machines can be explained as a way of pulling up or lifting up heavy materials. Some other processes a machine operates are simple assembly tasks such as putting nuts on bolts and tightening them; reading codes on grocery packages and collecting payment for purchases. Automation in a way increases the chances for a more skilled workforce with better educational qualifications. The bottom line is increased automation means many unskilled workers will be replaced by machines but vice versa more qualified people will be needed to perform higher-skilled tasks that arise because the machines are being used.

            "answer_text": "Yes, in fact it has already done so. Just look at the automotive industry. Between 2000 and 2010 almost 600,000 jobs were lost. Any new jobs created as a result of automation in the automative industry did nothing in terms of keeping Detroit prosperous. Automation by its very nature tries to reduce the amount of manual effort. The number of people needed to support the automation is a small fraction of the number of people displaced by it.  Automation also stunts growth. In the past, as a company grew, additional jobs were created to keep up with demand. With automation, no more jobs will be created no matter how large a company gets. They may need to order more robots or automation software, but the people on hand to support existing automation will be enough to manage any growth. The majority of the jobs being created are as result of the increase in population. Jobs related to automation are very small in numbers and will only offset a small number of the jobs displaced, and will not increase jobs in the future as sales go up. ",

Next will be your typical librarian, trucker, radiologist and even basic legal work rendering lawyers somewhat vulnerable. Accountants will transition totally away from paperwork and aren\u2019t completely safe either. You see that some of these jobs require college degrees although the low skill jobs will go first. Not everyone in these fields will lose their job, however many of them will need to adapt to a constantly changing technological atmosphere and will need to develop new skills throughout there lives in order to keep up. At some point, a form of basic income may be required. The jobs that won\u2019t be going away anytime soon and are considered safe for the time being are predominantly in vocational fields, such a small the trades and craftsmanship i.e your everyday plumber, electrical and diesel mechanic etc. These jobs generally do not require a B.A. I talk about why a proposition like \u201cfree\u201d college which several politicians are advocating for may not lead society in the right direction when it comes to tackling automation.

            "answer_text": "It is inevitable that as technology advances and AI becomes increasingly more efficient, certain jobs will be taken away. There is a common consensus that blue-collar jobs will go away; even some white-collar jobs may be threatened. I came across a link [1] that details how various jobs could be impacted by technology in the coming years. The answer by job really depends on the following four questions: Does you job require you to come up with clever solutions?Are you personally required to help others?Does your job require you to squeeze into small spaces?Does your job require negotiation?Really what it comes down to is how easy or difficult it is to codify a job. More the practical skills, emotional intelligence and creativity required, lesser the changes of the job being taken away by technology, at least in the short term.  (Snapshot taken from the link provided as reference) Will they be replaced by new jobs? Only time will tell. Although history teaches us that technological shifts have been a net creator of jobs in the long run (though there has been job disruption in the short term), the impact of technological shifts earlier was (1) restricted to a domain or a few domains at most, and (2) the technology could not function by itself; it created efficiencies, but still needed manpower to operate it (think of assembly lines which still required workers, or computers which eliminated certain jobs, but created more as people were required to run computers, and continuously enhance computer technology). However, new age tech (robotics, AI, cloud computing) will impact several industries (though the impact may be varied by industry), and due to their self-learning nature, may take away more jobs than they create. Technology is sure to augment various jobs though, if it doesn\u2019t disrupt them. References: [1] Will Your Job Be Done By A Machine? ",

In food industries , automation is infact increasing production with less loss and optimal labor utilization. Many textile industries , automotive industries has huge amount of labor requirement. Previously without automation different car models were manufactured on plant utlising specific man power , but today including plant man power , other man power is required to develop machine technology , software and design process.

Even mining uses more machines than labor they have open pits with huge machines. Digging ditches used to be a manual labor job, not since the backhoe. Modern office jobs have replaced much of work force with computers and printers. I was a bookkeeper since 1974 and a tiny bookkeeping company had about 13 bookkeepers and 6 in the typing pool. We hand wrote everything then sent the financial statements to typing. In 1983 I got a work computer and single imput data for 2 years for each client and all year to date payroll and amortization schedules. I printed w2s and comparitive financial statements. Before that year we typed w2s all fall and then added the amounts in January, voiding many and retyping. We sent out 1040s to a processing center but imput sheets were hand written. Before the end of my career I could have done the work of 10 bookeepers and all the typist. One payroll clerk did payroll for over 100 union members with costing to all the jobs as well as hiring and other task. Doing that by hand would have needed a roomfull, calculation a paycheck for a union member with all the contracts is compicated, we just needed to make sure we coded them right when new contracts came, she also handled all payroll audits from a dozen unions.

When the calculator was invented, many predicted that the accountant would no longer exist soon. Clearly, this isn\u2019t the case, but the modern accountant is not the same one as the 18th Century accountant. However, we have two potential challenges to address: We may lose more jobs than we gain. Just because this wasn\u2019t the case in the Industrial Revolution doesn\u2019t make it not the case now. We need to be prepared for this eventuality.In the short run, it\u2019s unlikely that those who lost their jobs will get them back for a while. We need to recognise this and retrain them so they don\u2019t leave the workforce entirely.Overall, there seems to be a split between optimists and pessimists on this issue, but both views need to be nuanced. We may be better off as a result of automation, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t need to be careful about it. ",

In India the IT sector is the brain sweatshop , people are hired because services are cheap, we are efficient and because people here can be trained to speak Americanized English. We lap it up because we get good money, jobs with certain degrees are scarce and the IT hires 1.2 million per year.

Now it comes to automation. Will there be a significant job loss? Yes. Because we are increasingly adapting methods to minimize efforts and maximize profits. Moreover, there are less chances of human error. When will it start hurting?Not in the next 10 years because the scale of automation will not be that easily dispersedThere will be pockets of high automation and There will be pockets where it will not affect at all at least for 10 more years ",

And the answer is a resounding \"No\". ",

One hundred years ago the majority of jobs were in agriculture and the work was hard and unpleasant. Now there are relatively few people doing it because of automation and farm machinery. However, automation will never kill all jobs. Humans can be far more creative, flexible and intelligent than a machine will ever be. Automation will only kill jobs it can perform better than a human. In reality, most jobs will still require a human, either because a robot can\u2019t do it or people won\u2019t want a robot to do it. I wouldn\u2019t want a robot filling my teeth, teaching my child or running the country. The jobs that AI, computers and robots can do is always increasing, but humans will still be essential to work along with them. Where jobs are eliminated, people will adapt and train for the many new jobs that didn\u2019t exist before. ",

In 2016 alone, Infosys saw (and openly disclosed) that it has seen 21000 jobs affected by automation. With more disclosures due to come out in April 2017 (when annual reports come out), we are going to see the actual impact of automation on the jobs in IT sector, BPO sector and Business support services in almost all industry sectors. With President Trump\u2019s policies and initiatives, Automation will be a very large factor in achieving their objectives. Many jobs will be lost to automation and some jobs will go back to the countries that have outsourced them. The ever rising cost of manpower in India is also an impactful factor and it only reinforces the business case for adopting Automation. The Automation tools are maturing and there are more and more automation tools becoming available cheaply (and free as well). When the capability of these tools are available to companies, they will not think twice before adopting them to increase their productivity, defect prevention and capacity increase, with cherry on the cake being reduced cost. If anyone says that automation will not affect jobs, they might be in denial and need to wake up. ",

Sometimes it is tradesmen who make devices, sometimes it is the people who did the job that was automated.

The process is gradual and many people do get retrained to take new positions. ",

So a lot of jobs will be lost. However there will be new ones created as well. So this is what will happen. Automation will lead to a loss of jobs. Displace low skilled to semi-skilled workers. People will quickly start to realize that certain fields can easily be automated. Then there demand would. New student will not take on these fields, people will start avoiding these fields. New fields of automation will open up (this will happen mostly in the computer sciences). People will switch to over here. This will be the new demand that will be created. So overall there will be a loss of jobs (and for a certain short period) a lot of people will be unemployed due to automation. However due to automation being itself a field that is growing that offset in workers from those fields will be equivalent to new demand in automation field. This is not something that has not happened before. Infact this is very common. Look at industrial automation. This is exactly what happened over there. ",

But overall, it\u2019s hard to deny that anything that competes for jobs and can perform tasks or even just part of a task faster, better, and/or cheaper (cheap overseas labor, productivity tools, green card workers, and automation) will reduce the value of human labor and thus reduce wages.

Henry Ford started the idea of the modern automation line where he figured out that if you had one worker only doing one repetitive type of hand motion, you get specialized workers doing the tasks faster overall, speeding up the collective overall assembly. Fast forward to the late 1970s and the Japanese perfected the first automated robotic lines. There were American developments in that area, but the Japanese were quicker to adopt robots in their factories overall.[Needs citation.]This was largely felt in the 1980s, when the Japanese could get their mass-produced stuff quicker to market. So what happened to the workers that the machines replaced?Well, machines don't fix themselves or maintain themselves.Some workers were retrained as machine maintenance crews.Others found work elsewhere. The jobs of the future will be centered around software and DBO (Design, Build & Operate) of hardware.You'll still need engineers, technicians, programmers and others to design, build and implement new machines and their related software. It helps to think that automation doesn't \"replace\" jobs, it just changes the jobs. Welcome to the Information Age and the Knowledge Economy. ",

Depending on which study you read, the answer can be different.  Regardless of the results, the key point to note is that jobs will be transformed by automation, which may or may not lead to unemployment. The level of employment will depend on many factors. There are five factors according to McKinsey that will determine whether tasks or activities within jobs can be automated: Technically feasibility for doing so.The cost to automate the task and whether it makes economic sense to do so.Availability of skills and the cost of workers who might otherwise have to do the activity.Benefits (e.g., superior performance) and value of automation beyond just labor-cost substitution.Whether automation is permitted by regulation and is socially (and morally and ethically) acceptable to do so in the geographical location in question.",

Ancillary job creation, I.e. Automation suppliers'  engineers and manufacturing personnel, will not be likely to fill the employment hole left by reducing the number of workers. One significant problem is the (apparent) conflict between the micro and macro view. We may worry, as a society, about dwindling consumer demand due to automation. But the business person, focused on his/her product sees the trees, not the forest. Their small contribution to efficiency in their business ends up undermining the economic system as a whole, and they may not be prepared for the systemic effects. ",

Many answers here assert that new jobs will be created in place of the ones that have been automated, in the same way as agricultural jobs were replaced by manufacturing jobs. But I don't think we have sufficient data from the past to reliably predict the future.  When agriculture was automated, there were plenty of easy manufacturing jobs to take their place. I find it hard to see where the easy jobs will come from when manufacturing goes. The trend towards services over the past 40 years is not encouraging. We have badly paid jobs at the bottom - care assistants, waitressing, etc, and professional services at the top. Most people do not have the intellect to provide professional services, and many of those jobs will vanish anyway. If I'm right, and the jobs lost to automation are not replaced, then wages will fall. If wages fall the demand for automation will drop too. I foresee worldwide economic stagnation. I think it has already started. ",

Automobile manufacturing industry are looking forward for the AI and automation as a way to reduce the manufacturing cost and there by labor loosing there jobs. The solution can be like this. Individual should think about upgrading there skills on avoiding the impact of automation. There have been number of times complaining about the quality of the out coming engineers which is true because as an engineer majority of us have never thought to do something innovative solutions when we see a problem instead of going to Google. While this is a measurable problem, we are not sure if AI has the same negative effect shown in the Hollywood fantasy movies. AI will have an impact on the existence of human and can prove more problematic than automation. We can subject AI to the limitations of it\u2019s usage to avoid the destruction.

Not to mention I doubt many people would trust a machine to totally run an surgery on them or defend them in court. We have too much underlying fear of machines becoming too smart and learning how to take over; to let them cut on us with out a human doctor overseeing (for example) would be highly unlikely. ",

Written decades ago, the kernel of the idea for the book came from his experience working at General Electric, which was beginning to automate. Are we doomed to live in Vonnegut\u2019s vision? Or, are there things humans can do better than computers? In Humans Are Underrated, Geoff Colvin makes a strong case that there are things humans can do better. Here, I\u2019ll quote from the book: \u201c[O]ur greatest advantage lies in what we humans are most powerfully driven to do for and with one another, arising from our deepest, most essentially human abilities\u2014empathy, creativity, social sensitivity, storytelling, humor, building relationships, and expressing ourselves with greater power than logic can ever achieve.\u201d These \u201chigh-value skills\u201d are trainable, Colvin argues.

Some people hypothesise that there might be a destructive equilibrium where unemployment rates will cripple the economy and cut funding to the research that would replace more jobs, but I feel that the spin-off research from the successful industries will still be relevant to other jobs. Some say that we can all do creative things later, but creative jobs are only viable when one has lots of fans and we can't all have lots of fans. Unemployment often leads to crime, but good automation (computer vision, mainly) will lead to pretty much all street criminals being caught very quickly. Google (through Boston Dynamics) will be creating war robots, so human soldiers won't be effective. I think the last remaining jobs will be essentially \"being paid to be human\" \u2212 selling organs; being paid to be a surrogate mother; and selling undesirable children's blood to rich old people who want to reverse their ageing. Already we're seeing some people in China being paid to be white \u2212 they turn up in offices etc to give the business more credibility when visitors come by. There was another current example I was going to give, please comment if you can think of one. Some people say that the economy will shift and that humans will find new jobs, but I agree with an analogy I heard about a horse \u2212 they don't really have jobs anymore, technology has replaced pretty much every job they can do.

Because the activity is it\u2019s own reward, many will not seek or require any type of compensation. I predict that in the coming years, many people will value a simple \u2018material\u2019 life, and will focus primarily on personal growth and spending time with friends and family. There will always be new challenges to solve and there will be times when teams both large and small will be required. But again, no one will really be focused on compensation.

It\u2019s up to business & employment groups to work together to develop retraining for those affected. ",

Secretaries, accounts clerks, draughtsman and a million other jobs have vanished apart form 90% of industrial and agricultural jobs over the last few decades. If you remove a job from a production process, the money that went in the wages for that job has to go somewhere - in better profit, in lower prices (so the consumer gats more money) or higher pay for other or a mix of all three. This means other people have more money and, other things being equal will spend it on something which will add to sales elsewhere and must, somewhere, produce another job. ",

Well if you ask me, the development is not going to be affected by this at least for a decade now since every application is different from another. May be we have some automated services or scripts available but when to integrate those automated services or scripts, you need a knowledgeable person. However, on testing front things are bit difficult. Since, all companies are relying on automation tests but then having said that I also want to clarify that to do a automated test, you need to test the application manually to identify all the scenarios for the automation. An application may not need an automation testing but manual testing is must. However, after few years, you reach a saturation for being just a manual tester. So, it is always better to keep upgrading yourself. Either move to automation or go for a strong domain knowledge with expertise in project management. ",

The key to having a strong middle class is having a thriving and technologically sophisticated manufacturing sector. Automation is part of that. It is mostly a good thing.  The best way to get rid of jobs is to move manufacturing and other key business activities to areas where wages are lower (i.e. \"outsourcing\" although that doesn't necessarily imply overseas, just somewhere cheaper than where you live.) Another good way is to reduce the availability of cash and/or lower consumer confidence so that people spend less. Not surprisingly these things are closely related. ",
