            "answer_text": "I have, in fact, damaged my fingerprint from excessive use of my smart phone. Let me explain. I am a person who is addicted/obsessed/permanently attached to my smart phone (so are you, let\u2019s be honest) but making the issue worse is the fact that I have ADD and a fascination for learning, reading, writing, and generally finding ways to avoid the task at hand, whatever that may be. Show me a rabbit hole and I\u2019ll report back when I\u2019ve found the bottom - but not before I run a tape measure, calculate the volume, area, the number of jelly beans that could be contained by the hole, and ponder how the hole could be re-purposed to the benefit of some inane scenario that I have no intention of ever bringing into existence. Needless to say, I\u2019m constantly doing something on my phone and probably wearing out my pockets by putting it in and taking it back out again. Inevitably I drop my phone. Even more inevitable is the breaking of the screen (see image).  See that red circle-ish drawing I made in the corner? The one above and to the right of the time. That, my friend, is a missing piece of glass. And that is also just one of 3 areas on my beloved Galaxy S8 where I am missing a piece of glass. Due to one or several of the impacts the phone experienced I have a razor sharp glass edge in the exact spot my right thumb likes to touch the screen when I\u2019m pulling down the notification window when I am on the go but still focused on the device. When I\u2019m not on the go, my left hand does the driving and is relatively safe from the weaponized screen. One fine day last year I was in the garage with the intentions of being productive but found myself lost in something - perhaps Quora. A notification popped up and my right thumb did what it does and took action to pull down the notification window and YOUCH! I created a nice little opening in my thumb from whence I bled. This alone is not necessarily detrimental to my fingerprint; however, this slice was sufficient enough to create a scar (damaged the basal layer where your fingerprint ridges and furrows are formed). This scar in turn caused some minor puckering of the ridges that had previously traveled that area with ease. Nothing overly serious but that part of my fingerprint does look ever so slightly, and permanently, different than it did before the incident. So, yes, in a roundabout way your fingerprint can be damaged by excessive use of your cell phone. It\u2019s not the intact glass and friction that causes the problem, it\u2019s the risk of sharp edges caused by your excessive handling and inevitable accidents. So be safe out there. ",

            "answer_text": "No you cannot. You can sprain your hand if you position your hand in awkward positions. This however does not translate to damaging your fingerprints. Your fingerprints will be just fine from your continued use of a smart phone. You would not hurt your fingerprints in any way at least from the way I see it from your frequent use of a mobile device not unless it is broken, has rough edges and you are continuously running your finger on that sharp broken part that is protruding from the edges or cover of your phone ( but then that is unlikely ). Secretaries, cashiers punch at the keyboard most of the times,keyboards are more rugged than a smart phone but those folks do not damage their fingerprints while at it. It is unlikely that you would hurt your fingerprints while using your smart phone. ",
