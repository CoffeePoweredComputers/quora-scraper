            "answer_text": "I think the internet HAS increased polarization. But that is not an intentional outcome from the designers or facilitators of the internet. The internet is a tool like a hammer or a typewriter. Each tool necessarily changes the orientation of each human to the other. Hammers made buildings easier to construct-typewriters allowed faster and more uniform word documents to be produced. That means more legal briefs but also more poems etc. We should all assess how to best use our tools. We should not let those who have thoughtless or harmful intentions rule the world simply because they know how to use the latest tool to their own advantage. ",

            "answer_text": "No, I don\u2019t. You can go back in the history of the United States and find political infighting among the Federalists and AntiFederalists during early elections. Many candidates were as nasty and underhanded during the 19th and 20th centuries as anything we\u2019ve seen this century. The only difference is the general public\u2019s access to news. Having news at our fingertips leads us to believe that it\u2019s never been this bad. Sadly, thanks to human nature, it\u2019s just more of the same. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cDo you think internet has dramatically increased polarization in politics?\u201d The internet puts knowledge at the hands of the people. It takes time to develop the skills to weed through the bad information to find the good. The lies of politicians will be harder to sell to an informed people. This is why the left support censorship. This is why the Chinese government wanted Google to build a censored search engine. Google was caught. So has the polarization increased. If you have a scammer that manages to mislead people into thinking he is a good guy, as the saying goes \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d. But when people, through the internet, are exposed to the fact that he is a scammer we will have more polarization as more and more people learn. Unfortunately indoctrination is nearly impossible to break on those indoctrinated. We find the polarization is here. They don\u2019t want to know the truth. It would mean they are wrong and people don\u2019t like to be wrong, especially if it means they were gullible. The #walkaway movement are people telling of realizing they have been lied to. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. In fact statists are afraid of it as it deminishs the power of the state as it continues to evolve faster than governments can keep up with it. The response and threat is internet neutrality which would eventually turn the internet into a utility or a monopoly controlled by the state. Countries who have such controls or restrictions are dictatorships and other violaters of human rights. Bitcoin was predicted by two Noble prize winning economists, Milton Freidman and F.A. Hayek. Bitcoin could potentially render the Federal Reserve and even government obsolete. Also this past April was the 4th anniversary of the newest nation, Liberland which will use the Merit and have no regulations on economic activity or the internet. ",
