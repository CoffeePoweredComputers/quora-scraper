I like to play Bad Binton a lot. I can even manage to play this game in a small room. Upon that I want to have the best shuttlecock with right threading, and because of this I end up collecting many. Even if I don't have a partner to play with, I'm happy with playing myself and so the sight of shuttle cock makes me feel relaxed and motivates me to be always active. ",

Smallest is just bigger than a pack of cigarettes. Largest is suitcase-size and and weighs 28 pounds without the tripod. I would buy more! ",
