            "answer_text": "Definitely Steve Jobs. Tim Cook is good in his own ways, but he isn't quite the innovater that Jobs was. Think about it: After becoming the CEO of Apple in 1997, Jobs spent around fourteen years at Apple before passing away in 2011. During these 14 years, Apple released many revolutionary products - some of these products really changed the world. Here are some: iMaciPodLightning cableiPhoneMacBook AirMacBook ProiPadCook has spent around eight years as Apple's CEO. During these years, Apple has only released one new product - the Apple Watch. This is a really nice and useful product by itself, but it isn't exactly an \u201cApple innovation\u201d considering the fact that Samsung and Google already had their own smartwatches. Jobs truely believed in pushing the boundaries and creating new stuff that would blow people away. He believed that people didn't know they wanted something until it existed. Cook's strategy is more about taking things which already exist and improving or consolidating them. That's exactly what he's been doing for most part. Most things which qualify as groundbreaking innovations that've been released under his leadership can be seen as add ons or upgrades to the iPhones or Macs. Some examples are: TouchID3D touchFaceIDAirPodsTouch bar on the MacBooksBoth Jobs and Cook are strong believers in innovation, but the degree to which Jobs innovated, pushed the limits and took risks is way higher than that Cook.
