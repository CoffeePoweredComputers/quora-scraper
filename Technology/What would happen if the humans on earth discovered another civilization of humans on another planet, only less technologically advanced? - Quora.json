            "answer_text": "We'd build a wall (or a space-wall equivalent to quarantine). The risks of both planets could very well extinguish each other. This is, of course, assuming they are within reachable distance (within say 10 years travel distance). The biggest fear of any medically-trained scientist is the potential pandemics and epidemics that may affect both races. i may be sounding as gloomy as Dr Leonard McCoy from Star Trek, but exotic strains of viruses which Earthlings haven't had exposure to, bacteria and parasites that we may have no immunity against, are hugely problematic. Forget about glittering discoveries of precious metals and rare elements - think lethal viruses and rare microscopic parasites which evolution takes millions of years to develop an immunity. Short-term-minded humans may want to invade, conquer, and rape that planet of resources, but these knee-jerk desires whould be sobered by remembering what happened to the aliens which invaded Earth in the movie War of the Worlds. Despite their technological superiority, they were felled by Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, bacteria to which we are virtually immune. Humans are a lot more biologically vulnerable than we think. The likelihood of an alien bacteria killing us would be close to 100%. Beyond that, there is the indigenous population's ability to assimilate our culture. Some might embrace any technology we might wish to share, in exchange for us 'liberating' them of their ecological resources (precious metals, rare elements). But would they be happy negotiation with an alien that looks like this?\u2026  Others may be more hostile and less likely to accept our god-like status (mentally incapable of accepting our magic technology) and would likely face a bleak prospect (enslavement). Add to that the risk of us infecting them with our own non-pathogenic bacteria which may be lethal to them, the risks of both civilizations felled by alien microscopic life forms may kill both worlds long before we consider how we might communicate with each other.

            "answer_text": "What we would do and what we should do are potentially different things. Firstly, it is unlikely they will be EXACTLY like us, even if their DNA matches. When Europeans \u201cdiscovered\u201d America it was populated by humans. However, these humans lacked a very important trait that the Europeans had, an immunity to smallpox. We could go over there and totally wipe them out with the flu. Or worse (depending on your vantage point) they could wipe us out with their flu. But if they were EXACTLY like us then we need to be very diplomatic and careful. They are humans, after all. That means they are intelligent, cunning, superstitious, prone to violence, quick to anger, slow to forgive and tragically tribal. They may be less technologically advanced at first, but that status will only last a generation; maybe two. They will catch up very quickly in the tech and knowledge department. Then there will be two planets of humans, both of which get to decide who came first and how did this happen. Is there a God populating every reasonably habitable planet? If so, does she make covenants with all of them? Or is there a race of super-aliens who are seeding planets with their DNA? If so, why won\u2019t they make contact? Or is this some funky co-evolution? If so, is a Chewbacca style alien even possible? Because my dream of being Han Solo really depends on a Chewbacca style alien. ",

They don\u2019t pose any threat to us, and we\u2019re not going to be xenophobic against ourselves, certainly not initially. The first question everybody will be asking is how they got there, or is this some seriously cosmic convergent evolution. First contact will probably involve a DNA sample, which shows that they\u2019re standard Terran Homo Sapiens. From there, I doubt we\u2019ll enslave them. Far too many progressives around today, there would be domestic uproar. No, we\u2019d set up a trade system (assuming cheap and efficient interstellar travel). The trade system would have elements of the transatlantic slave trade in nature, minus the slaves. We\u2019d ship raw materials from their world (seeing as there is interstellar travel, Earth will be rather pushed for natural resources at this point). We\u2019d have them doing the mining for us, of course. In return, we\u2019d ship them manufactured goods. And keep some for ourselves as profit. Good old capitalism, on a cosmic scale. Exploitative? Debatable. ",
