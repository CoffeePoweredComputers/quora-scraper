            "answer_text": "You are missing the most important portable gaming console there is. Sure, playstation 4 has sold 100 million units or something like that, but that is a drop in the bucket\u2026 Portable gaming has never been more popular. More Than 2.4 Billion People Will Play Mobile Games This Year, According To Analyst And sure, these games are not as powerful/complex as some of the others, but they are getting there. You can play Call of Duty on your phone, DOTA, and a bunch of other things. Old console games are available to be downloaded onto your phone like sonic and etc. All of these games can even be played with offline, online by yourself, or online with friends or complete strangers all over the world.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think they are. Nintendo 3DS and 2DS are still strong sellers and the record sales figures for the Switch indicate that there\u2019s still a great demand for portable gaming. Sony\u2019s portable consoles are failing but this has little to do with smartphones, it\u2019s a combination of Sony handling their devices poorly and pitting them against a well supported competitor. It might not seem worthwhile to someone who only plays mobile games but for gamers familiar with portable consoles, the quality of the content is worth the bother of carrying an extra device, the two mediums don\u2019t compare, the only similarity they have is that they both run on devices that fit in your pocket. The success of Nintendo\u2019s portable and hybrid platforms shows that the portable market isn\u2019t impacted that strongly by the introduction of mobile gaming. ",
