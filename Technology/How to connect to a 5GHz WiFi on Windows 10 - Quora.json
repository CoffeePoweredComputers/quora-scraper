            "answer_text": "Q: How do I connect to a 5GHz WiFi on Windows 10? The one thing I have not picked up in other answers is distinguishing between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Some routers are shipped with the same SSID on both bands. Mine came that way. I changed them both, and gave both different names that do not give a clue to the make of router. If there are any security weaknesses in a router, I don\u2019t believe in advertising the fact to anyone who might come across the signal. I can select the specific band by the network name. Simple names such as: 2.4GHzNetwork5GHzNetworkI don\u2019t normally use spaces in network names (SSID) as I have had a couple of devices that did not accept spaces in the network name. You can use the same pass phrase on both or give them different pass phrases - that\u2019s your choice. ",

            "answer_text": "5 GHz WiFi is nothing special. To a newer Windows 10 machine that has a 5 GHz capable WiFi adapter, it is \u201cjust WiFi\u201d and you connect to it. If you have an older computer that you want to connect to a 5 GHz WiFi network, you need to add a 5 GHz WiFi adapter. For a desktop, you can get an internal adapter card like:  Amazon.com: TP-Link AC1200 PCIe WiFi Card for PC |Bluetooth 4.2 |Dual Band Wireless Network Card (2.4Ghz / 5Ghz) | for Gaming, Browsing, Streaming etc.- Supports Windows 10, 8.1, 8 & 7 (32/64-bit) - (Archer T5E): Computers & Accessories A desktop can also use a dongle like a laptop, if you have an available USB port. For a laptop, you want a 5 GHz or \u201cdual band\u201d WiFi dongle. See: Scott King Walker's answer to Is there a gadget can connect my laptop that can connect to 2.4ghz wifi connect to 5ghz wifi?
