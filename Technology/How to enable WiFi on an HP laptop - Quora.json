            "answer_text": "Running Windows? Which model laptop? I'd encourage you to go to HP\u2019s website and download the documentation for your model \u2014 or at least read the FAQs, which I suspect will address this. Normally, there is one of the function keys (f1 through f12) that when used with the \u201cfn\u201d key (bottom left area of the keyboard) can be used to turn the WiFi card on or off. Hold down the fn key, and then press the appropriate function key (look for one with the WiFi symbol in blue). There may also be a button along the area above the keyboard that is a hardware WiFi on/off button. If the WiFi hardware is active but you are having problems with WiFi in Windows, you are best off letting someone knowledgeable take a look at it\u2026 What would take us hours to figure out remotely can be fixed in moments by a person sitting in front of the keyboard.

            "answer_text": "This may seem counterintuitive, but I would check to see if Windows\u2019 generic driver works first. Oddly enough, significantly more often than not, the generic WiFi driver actually works better than the manufacturer-specific version. If that doesn\u2019t work like you want it to, then I\u2019d recommend going to the website of the manufacturer of your laptop\u2019s network adapter, NOT HP, and downloading the latest driver from there. Again, more often than not, this will be superior to the laptop manufacturer\u2019s version. ",
