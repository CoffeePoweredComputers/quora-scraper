            "answer_text": "Advantages of WAN are : It covers large geographical area therefore networks can be made between long distances. Everyone on that network can access the same data. This avoids problems where some users may have older information than others. Different peripherals can be shared with all the computers in the network. Shares software and resources with connecting workstations.Disadvantage of WAN are : Setting up the network could be expensive.Maintaining a network is a full-time job which requires network supervisors and technicians to be employed. Security is a real issue when many different people have the ability to use information from other computers. Protection against hackers and viruses adds more complexity and expense. Need a good firewall to restrict outsiders from entering and disrupting the network .",
