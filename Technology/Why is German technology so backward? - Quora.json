            "answer_text": "German technology is not backward. I\u2019ve lived in six counties for extended periods and I\u2019m now very happily settled in Germany - for many reasons, but one is that things generally work and Germans are very well organised and structured in their approach. German engineering is among the very best in the world: autos, electronics, kitchens, white goods, heavy engineering, civil engineering, medical instrumentation, surgical instruments, aviation, electro-optics, gunsmithing and much more. And don\u2019t forget that the atomic weapons programme Apollo programme was underpinned by German engineers. In spite of its apparent liberal politics, Germany is a deeply conservative society with respect for authority, a penchant for rules, structure and process, prudent personal financial management, reluctance to show off one\u2019s wealth (regarded as crude) and a highly stable employment market having made most Germans risk adverse. When it comes to innovation the focus is on steady incremental improvement based on a solid financial foundation - rather than taking risks while knowing that you can start again so failure is OK. In Germany a business failure means your career as an entrepreneur is likely over. So while the country has a fantastically successful and profitable industrial base there are legitimate concerns about where the great innovations that\u2019s will define the country\u2019s future will come from. I think the question is not really about the quality of German technology, but what impact the country\u2019s \u2018slow, plodding\u2019 approach to innovation (which is an artefact of post-war political strategy and a palpable sense of guilt about the horrors of failed World Wars) will have on the country\u2019s future. But right now Germany has a tremendous industrial base and is the undisputed economic powerhouse of Europe. ",

            "answer_text": "You probably refer to the digital revolution. While German cars, washing machines and sludge pumps are doing very well internationally and are not really backward in any way, perhaps too expensive, nobody has a German laptop or smart phone, and most of German electronics such as TVs etc., once leading, have all but disappeared. I think one of the reasons is that this revolution was pretty much centred in Silicon Valley, and anyone who wanted a slice of the cake, including Germans, would have moved there. The money, spirit, enthusiasm and expertise was all there. At the same time, Japanese electronics (Sony, Hitachi, Panasonics, etc.) beat remaining German competitors in every way, i.e. quality, prestige, lower cost. These now mature technologies have moved to lower production cost places, and China has taken the lead in every aspect of it including research and development, with the South Korean Samsung being a key player as well. A remaining significant strength of German technology is the development and manufacture of specialist machinery and higher grade materials. ",
