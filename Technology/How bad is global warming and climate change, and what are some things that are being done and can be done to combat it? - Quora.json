            "answer_text": "The Project Drawdown[1] analysis of 80 commercial, evidence-based, no-government-required solutions for reversing global warming within 30 years is a good start - because they\u2019re things that are being done and are financially worth doing. However there are hundreds (more likely thousands) of smart solutions coming to market - everything from crowd-funded community renewable energy cooperatives to Marine Permaculture. The Drawdown solutions are collectively modelled as creating trillion dollar savings and millions of new jobs, as well as delivering on 15 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. (Which is making \u201cis it REALLY bad enough that we need to take action?\u201d an increasingly irrelevant question. ) Strategic, constructive action saves us money, it creates business innovation, it creates cleaner, safer systems and it creates a fairer world. The world\u2019s global innovators have noticed this, given up on \u201cgovernment policy\u201d and are busy with everything from Circular Economy to Biomimicry. So the more relevant question for you might be \u201cwhat opportunities am I missing out on?\u201d  Footnotes[1] Solutions | Project Drawdown",

            "answer_text": "You need to be more specific. Are you talking about global warming or are you talking about athropogenic global warming (AGW) theory? The climate is not now nor has it ever been static. It has been much warmer than it is today and it has been far colder than it is today. For about the past 20,000 years, the world has been warming. That is a good thing, since a mile of ice over Kansas and Iowa would not be good for our population. History has shown that civilization tends to advance the most during periods of relative warming and slows and even regresses during periods of relative cooling. Given the choice between warming or cooling, warming is by far the best choice for our species. We are, after all, a tropical species, evolved to the savanna of Africa. AGW theory is proven to be wrong. The computer models that encode it fail in its predictions. What the right theory is? Nobody has that figured out yet. ",
