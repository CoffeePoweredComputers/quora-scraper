            "answer_text": "A PUBG game uses 15-50 MB of data On forums, gamers say they use between 15 and 50 MB of data per 20- to 30-minute game of PUBG on mobile. The amount of data that different players use in a game varies widely depending on the platform they use to play and depending on their game settings. When it comes to game settings, voice chat has a particularly strong effect on your data use. An hour of PUBG without voice chat, for example, uses less than 30 MB of data. With voice chat, that same hour of gameplay would use 50 MB of data. If you use voice chat, then, expect to use as much as 100% more data. ",
