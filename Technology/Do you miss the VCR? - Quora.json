            "answer_text": "Oh, I definitely do miss the VCR these days with the auto-tracking, the OSD displayed onscreen, 4-head Hi-Fi stereo, the sound of screeching and sputtering coming from your VCR while rewinding a tape to the very beginning, etc. Heck, I still use the good ol\u2019 VCR to this very day and adding to the nostalgia blast, I have it hooked up to a big 25-inch CRT TV from RCA, manufactured in September of 2003.  But do I really miss the VCR? Yes, yes I do since it was the best piece of technology at the time and nowadays, I still use to record my shows or watch things that aren\u2019t even on DVD or online whatsoever. I really do miss the VCR. ",

I doubt we were the only people who did this, but one charm with the VCR was able to \u201ctape\u201d movies off of HBO and other channels. You could go out buy a tape for three dollars and have three movies on one tape. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re like me and a bit squeamish, but want to keep an edit for content version of a movie\u2026 you could do that by taping the network TV broadcast version. ",
