            "answer_text": " Today? It depends. The 6s is still a great phone that was released in 2015 with support promised for the upcoming version of iOS 13 this fall. So if you are not a power user who is intent on keeping up the latest CPU speeds, camera apertures or numbers, I would say it still has couple years\u2019 life in it, especially if you can get a used one for a super discount. Apple stopped selling brand new 6s\u2019es years ago FWIW.  (Speedometer 2.0 Webview benchmark from Aanndtech showing the iPhone 6s from 2015 perform as well the 2018 Android flagships). [1] Also, it is the last iPhone with access to a real clicking home button (none of the gimmicky Taptic feedback there), Touch ID (looking at you, iPhone X, XS, XR), and (drumroll) a headphone jack! And even if the hardware itself is from 2015, Apple\u2019s top tier hardware prowess and iOS optimisations mean it still performs as well as Android flagships from a year ago. That means it is still faster than half the phones out there. Moreover, there are rumours that Apple will drop 3D Touch in the upcoming series of iPhones, so if you think you can find the feature useful, that is another feather in the 6s\u2019s cap (the first phone ever to sport it).  So if those are the details that matter more to you than keeping up annually with the latest flagships from either camps, go for it. (One negative: the battery backup isn't the best, so check if you can get one with a relatively new battery in it or have a power bank handy!)

            "answer_text": "I would suggest not to go for iPhone 6s because there are better models available than it, sooner or later it will get obsolete as well. iPhone 7 or iPhone 8 could be a better option. iPhone 7 and above are much better than 6s, you can compare the Specs on apple website, but camera wise and considering their processing speed they are damn good phones in apple family. Personally i am using iPhone 6s (64GB edition) and my spouse is using iPhone 7 plus, i could notice the significant differences between these two models, if you are considering a better camera then please go iPhone 7 plus & above series (8plus, iPhone X if its price doesn\u2019t scare you). iPhone 6s: it has a previous generation hardware, with the recent changes in iOS (iOS11), its hardware doesn\u2019t provide any smooth transitions and a faster response, although Apple is providing a battery replacement programme but i don\u2019t see it, its gonna give any boost or better improvement. One more noticable difference: iPhone 6s is not water resistant, now a days any mishap could happen with your phone, one of those mishaps could be spilling water on your phone or getting your phone dropped in water, new generation iphones i.e. iPhone 7 or above are pretty much resistant to water. iPhones are never cheaper they always burn a sizeable hole in your pocket and buying an older generation iPhone will not only burn your pocket but will give you agony in your heart as well. Old is gold is a gibberish way when it comes to the iPhones. Cheers ",
