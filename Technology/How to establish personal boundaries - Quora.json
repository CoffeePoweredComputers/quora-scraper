            "answer_text": "I\u2019m still learning about my boundaries and implementing them as I go along. First, you have to be ethical. Treat people exactly in the way you would like them to treat you. You also need to know your values. What is right and wrong for you. One other thing you need to be completely aware of is your emotions and the way you react to others when they trigger certain kinds of emotions. For example, my skin has been breaking out a lot lately. I have a habit out of insecurity, of picking at the spots and it\u2019s made my skin red and inflamed and quite frankly, the spots worse. I made a promise to myself a week ago that I would not touch my face anymore, except for washing it. My Mum decided to tell me the other night \u201cyour skin looks terrible! You really need to stop picking at it, you\u2019re making it worse and it looks gross!\u201d while wearing a face of disgust. That upset me. Yes, she was right, but it wasn\u2019t something I needed to hear. How was that supposed to help me? I told her \u201cThat\u2019s not helpful and it\u2019s not the right way to help me. You\u2019re just going to amplify my insecurity which will make me want to pick at it more. If you want to help, when you notice an improvement - tell me. Or just gently encourage me not to pick at my face if you see me do it.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you, it was just meant to deter you from doing it.\u201d She replied. I explained to her that picking at my spots, which are my insecurities, was a way of releasing anxiety about them. I know it made them worse, but I felt better on the inside. She believed I was angry with her when I established that boundary, but I told her, \u201cIf we want our relationship to work - we have to be open and honest and teach each other how to love and work with each other. If you do something I don\u2019t like, I\u2019m going to tell you and I\u2019m not going to feel bad about it. It\u2019ll be said, I\u2019ll wait for a change - no apologies needed from either of us and we move on. I expect the same from you.\u201d This is how I frame all of my boundary setting. I\u2019ve only really began implementing them in the last six months and there are less family disagreements. We feel free to tell each other exactly what we want and expect from each other and when we hurt each others feelings, we will find a way to fix it. We have begun supporting each other and communicating effectively. I encourage everybody I know to create boundaries. My Mum is often all give, no take. She rakes in the highest numbers in her factory work, despite the fact that she\u2019s incredibly ill with adrenal insufficiency, fibromyalgia, conns syndrome, addisons disease and a number of other things. She doesn\u2019t know how to say \u2018no\u2019 to anybody. Especially not her children. She is an avid people pleaser. She\u2019s been taken advantage of emotionally for years. She would never spend money on herself. She felt bad about having any time for herself, or doing something for her own pleasure or making her own decisions. She wouldn\u2019t stand up for herself, but when it came to her kids, she was and is a fierce lioness. She often allows herself to be burned out, used and dictated to. I\u2019ve had to be quite forceful with her. For example, she likes \u2018whacky\u2019 kinds of clothing. At Christmas, Mum, my sisters and I went into a shop that had a beautiful patchwork inspired multicoloured coat. It sounds ugly, but it was absolutely perfect and colourful. She went back to it four times, adoringly gazing at it. I told her to try it on. My sisters mocked her and told her it was \u2018disgusting\u2019 and they \u2018would never go out with her wearing that!\u2019 I stood quietly, and told my Dad about it later and told him how much she loved it and that she looked gorgeous in it. He gave me the money and asked me to go and get it for her for Christmas. The girls once again laughed, and repeated their jokes and remarks. I said loudly \u201cMum, you look fucking gorgeous in it. Wear it as often as you want! I\u2019ll come out with you wearing it. Hell, I\u2019d love to wear it myself!\u201d My sisters shut their mouths. Nothing was said about it again, and my Mum has worn it as often as she pleases and every time, she looks stunning. She still has an insecurity about expressing herself through her colourful clothing. She knows what to expect every time - mockery from her daughters. It requires noticing when she see\u2019s something that fits her style and being able to notice that hint of insecurity and bursting that wall down. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d \u201cI love it.\u201d \u201cWhen then buy it for yourself.\u201d \u201cNo, the girls wont like it.\u201d\u201cBut you do. So come on, let\u2019s go get it.\u201d If she refuses then, guess what? I\u2019ll buy it for her my damn self. Another thing, is her lack of ability to say \u2018no\u2019. This frustrates the hell out of me. With her being so ill, she\u2019s tired all the time. Chronic fatigue cripples her, and she often looks and is physically exhausted. Despite being on daily steroids, she still only weighs 45kg. It\u2019s easy to forget that she\u2019s ill, though, because of everything she achieves. It\u2019s like she\u2019s indestructible and so she set a standard for herself that told everybody else \u201cI\u2019m available whenever you need me and I will do anything for you.\u201d When people ask for something from her, she will give it. Whether that\u2019s time, money, physical effort (like helping decorate, clean up), looking after the kids; you name it, she gives it. She would bleed herself dry just to know somebody else is comfortable and happy. People expect a lot from her. Learning to say \u2018no\u2019 can be gut wrenching. It feels horrible when you\u2019ve said yes all your life and all of a sudden you\u2019re \u2018disappointing\u2019 people by putting yourself first. I asked my Mum to evaluate her life and where her problem areas are. It all reflected back to \u201cI don\u2019t have enough time to do anything I want. I\u2019m exhausted and always doing things for others.\u201d I said, \u201cwell that\u2019s easy enough. Just start saying \u2018no\u2019 more often.\u201d\u201cBut, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d She\u2019d say. \u201cI feel guilty. They need me.\u201d \u201cWell, if you keep exhausting yourself, you wont be around much longer for them to be able to need.\u201d I think that was when she realised that if she didn\u2019t begin putting her own needs above the needs of everybody else\u2019s, then her overall health would only suffer more. And this is true for those of us who aren\u2019t riddled with diseases - our overall health suffers when we exhaust ourselves for the wants and needs of others. I began encouraging her to evaluate what she needs every day. Does she need time to just sit and do nothing? Does she want to go and visit the grandkids? Does she feel healthy enough to do so? What are the pros and cons of doing the thing that\u2019s been requested? What\u2019s the thing that will be most overall beneficial to her? Can she help this person with their request without draining herself? The key theme here, is putting yourself first. Doing things that make you happy without hurting others. Establishing your boundaries means fully knowing yourself and your own limits. Ensuring your emotional, mental and physical wellbeing will remain intact. It\u2019s about being yourself, unapologetically. (Once again, still being ethical and mindful of the feelings of others.) It\u2019s about fully knowing how you want your life to be, knowing what behaviour and treatment you will accept from somebody. Where you draw your lines and how much power you give others to affect how you feel and think about yourself and the world around you. When you notice something doesn\u2019t feel quite right, pounce on it - ask for a correction and leave it be. Communicate further if the person asks, but never apologise for putting a boundary in place. They\u2019re there to protect your wellbeing and the relationship. Decide how flexible this boundary is but never allow yourself to become a push over or have your boundaries completely ignored. If your boundary is being ignored, you need to walk away. This person is no good for you and does not deserve a place at the table of your life. It goes without saying, but I\u2019ll say it anyway - when somebody implements a boundary onto you, you must respect it in the way you would expect them to respect the boundaries you implement. ",

            "answer_text": "My Hubby tells me I give men too much credit. He says nine times out of 10, if a man tries to be friends with me, it\u2019s not because they want to be friends, it\u2019s because in the long run, they hope it\u2019ll get them in my pants. I vehemently disagreed. When a guy we both know started commenting a lot on my Facebook pictures, he scoffed. Hubby: Dude wants to fuck you. Me: Pfft. He knows you. He\u2019s not trying to fuck me. We just chat about hunting and guns. Hubby: He wants to fuck you.  Fast forward a few weeks and dude sends me a private message about this yoga picture I posted. Nothing inappropriate per se, but noting my ass none the less. It made me second guess where he was thinking our friendship was going, but I didn\u2019t want to jump to conclusions. I responded with something like this: All I know is that the Hubby sure likes it. I figured if I brought up my Man, then if he had the wrong impression, he\u2019d back off. Two weekends later I got a message from him at 2 am. You up? I didn\u2019t respond until 2 pm the following day. Me: You need something? Dude: No. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t respond. I was drunk and in a frisky mood. Fuck. I waited about an hour, trying to decide how to respond. Me: I don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions or anything, but just to be sure, let me draw a clear line in the sand. I\u2019m not interested in fucking around. I\u2019m more than happy with my Husband in every way and don\u2019t stray from my marriage. If that wasn\u2019t your intent, my apologies, I just want to make sure that we\u2019re both on the same page. Dude: No problem. I get it. Loud and clear.  When I got home, my Hubby was in the garage. I walked in. We greeted each other with a kiss. Me: I need to tell you something. And I don\u2019t want you to overreact. Hubby: What\u2019s up? Me: I got a booty call text from Dude last night. I handled it. Told him I wasn\u2019t interested. He stood up and set down the tool that was in his hand. Me: And I want you to leave it alone. If he doesn\u2019t back off, I\u2019ll let you know and the ball will be in your court on how it gets handled. But for now, I handled it and I want you to leave it at that. Longest pause ever. Hubby, with a nod: Told ya he wanted to fuck you.  Two hours later, I get a text from Dude: I just want to say thank you for being so cool about that whole situation and not threatening to tell my wife or anything. I\u2019m hoping I didn\u2019t ruin a potentially good friendship and possible hunting partner. So how do you establish personal boundaries: Quickly and clearly. Leave little grey area and it will be abused. ",
