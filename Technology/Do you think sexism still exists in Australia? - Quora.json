            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A I\u2019ve seen that sexism in Australia, while better than in the US, it\u2019s worse than in the UK and France. Actually, growing up in a small suburb out in the Adelaide Hills, I faced little to no sexism until I began to travel a lot around age 14. In my hometown I have never been afraid to walk alone at night, never been criticized for being a lesbian, and never had anyone sexually harass me. Now, in the Adelaide CBD at night I\u2019ve had some men yell out creepy things to me, and it\u2019s even worse in Sydney, where there are some pretty rough suburbs, but urban Australia seems pretty accepting. Then you\u2019ve got the Outback. I\u2019ve seen incredibly accepting (usually aboriginal) towns in the outback, and places more conservative than the American South. I was once attacked by a man at night in a small town near Broome, WA. Luckily someone heard me scream and came outside and called the police. The man ran away but there wasn\u2019t much places to hide in a town with ~200 people. The general attitude I\u2019ve seen in the secondary schools in the Adelaide MA and around is to not teach sexism. My teacher was a lesbian in 2nd grade, and when I came out around age 10 (~4th or 5th grade) the worst I got were some people who had never learned about homosexuality to begin with. My teachers in 7th grade (including male) were allowing me and others to talk about our period at school, they said it was normal and ok. So at least in Cudlee Creek and that area, sexism is rare. In 3rd grade on Halloween, a boy in my class dressed as a princess and his friend asked him why he said, \u201cYou\u2019re not really Spider-Man, are you?\u201d \u201cNo\u201d \u201cExactly.\u201d And that was the end of that. I highly recommend the primary and secondary schools I went to, they are extremely accepting. Thanks for reading. ",

And slightly more recent was our federal police offering a special recruitment round just for women. Attempts to fix sexism here almost always result in more sexism, it's like trying to remove an air bubble under a screen protector, all we're doing is moving the problem. ",
