            "answer_text": "Amazon is pure evil for THIS reason: They and other LIBERAL ELITE OWNED/OPERATED high tech companies have figured out the perfect scheme. How to make billions of dollars while censoring all of your customers\u2019 communication (sellers as well as buyers), while preventing anyone from reaching you except in the most utterly extreme circumstances (maybe not even that), and while screwing sellers while making everyone \u2018think\u2019 they are such a phenomenal deal (they do sell cheaply on many things - mostly stuff shipped from China)\u2026but you\u2019d be surprised how much of that reputation is an illusion and how much you can save buying directly from the seller INSTEAD of Amazon. (Next time you want to buy something from a 3rd party seller on Amazon, see if you can find the 3rd party seller\u2019s website where Amazon cannot control any of the communication as well as any of the transaction. See how much money you save after quoting the Amazon price to the seller. You would be pleasantly surprised sometimes and you should save at least something for pushing the Amazon middleman gorilla\u2019s greedy hand out of the transaction. I found this out just recently\u2026I\u2019m sorry it took so long to realize Amazon adds it\u2019s chunk of profit to the cost and doesn\u2019t really save you as much cost as you think.) Anyway\u2026 Amazon is not accountable. That\u2019s perhaps its greatest evil. They have all the money and all the politicians in their pockets and no accountability. That is a recipe for corruption and evil in any playbook. Absolute power corrupts absolutely and liberals are in their perfect perch at the top of the Amazon slave operation. Yes, they provide SOME jobs. But apart from the guys at the top with both shoes on their desks, and the sweaty, overworked (very much so), underpaid and abused employees in their warehouses, what jobs? Yeah a few tech jobs IN CHINA AND INDIA which is where almost their entire cloud computing operation is worked from and a few tech jobs here in the U.S. where mostly foreign workers are imported to work for dirt wages. They are no example to follow for any decent company, unless you\u2019re a wannabe liberal tyrant who can\u2019t make money in any honest way. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it's incredibly evil - the people there spend all of their time thinking about ways to better serve customers. They do this by thinking about current products in the market or new products that could delight customers and make things cheaper. Pure evil. The author of that article takes the position that because Amazon had developed tools at scale that maximize value to customers, and that those improved efficiencies have side effects on other businesses, that they are somehow morally damaging the affected businesses and their employees. But if you follow this to it's logical end, it's morally wrong to make any improvements because someone might be negatively affected. The shoemaker who first developed the left shoe and the right shoe was an evil person who forced his competition to improve by making walking more comfortable for people than interchangeable shoes. Cars? Evil because the entire carriage industry became irrelevant, despite the incredible leap forward society made by having fast reliable transportation. Houses made of brick? EVIL. In fact, houses or any shelters at all must be evil, because that was an improvement over how people previously lived. That must have negatively impact someone or something somewhere, right? I hope you can see that this premise creates a situation where people attempt to draw an arbitrary line and say \u201cThat's it! I've declared we are technologically sufficient enough! Now all improvement must stop!\u201d Instead, the free market (customers!) should determine when something has improved enough to not be worth paying for the extra changes that companies try to make.
