            "answer_text": "The question is broad; your question could imply how food ordering apps, how food calorie apps work etc. I\u2019ll focus on food calorie apps. The drive-force of this apps comes down to usage of Food APIs. The developers hook their codes to this APIs which then allow them to pull various information related to listing of foods, calorie calculators etc. Using Nutritionix - Largest Verified Nutrition Database as an example, searching for say \u2018Applesauce\u2019, the api should be able to return calories, total nutrients, total daily consumption (% daily value), diet labels (whether it is \u201cbalanced\u201d, \u201chigh-protein\u201d, \u201chigh-fiber\u201d, \u201clow-fat\u201d, \u201clow-carb\u201d, \u201clow-sodium\u201d), health labels (\u201cvegan\u201d, \u201cvegetarian\u201d, \u201cdairy-free\u201d, \u201clow-sugar\u201d, \u201clow-fat-abs\u201d, \u201csugar-conscious\u201d, \u201cfat free\u201d, \u201cgluten free\u201d, \u201cwheat free\u201d). This information is then visually represented in an app for example Track - Calorie Counter - Android Apps on Google Play by Nutrionix Health and Fitness.  However, there hundreds more APIs you can explore, both paid and free. Hope that\u2019s answered your question. ",
