I read that the sea turns red with blood. This is one place I will never visit. I doubt I would enjoy any place which promotes this type of fishing. I don\u2019t believe a sheep\u2019s head on the dinner table is very appealing either, not that they do this in the Faroe Islands, but why not? If they can do it to whales they might do it to sheep.
