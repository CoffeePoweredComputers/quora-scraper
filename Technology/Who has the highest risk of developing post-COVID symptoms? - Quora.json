            "answer_text": "People who have survived symptomatic COVID. While this may seem facetious, recent research has indicated that 50% of people who have had COVID developed post-COVID symptoms, and the risk was the same regardless of whether they had mild COVID or severe COVID. Mind you, if a COVID sufferer developed sepsis, the major killer in COVID-19, and survived, then they have a risk of long-term problems from the sepsis, on top of their risk from COVID, so if you add both risks together they would probably have the highest risk.
