            "answer_text": "No offense, but if you are asking \u201chow\u201d you may lack the necessary technical abilities to do this. It would be advisable for you to buy or go to the local library and rent as many books as you can about furnace construction, forging and foundry work before you even consider attempting this.Read the books thoroughly and then decide if this is a project for which you have the technical abilities and time to undertake. If you decide to proceed after this then I would: Contact your insurer and ask about how your homeowner\u2019s policy would cover such a device - If they say \u201cNo way\u201d you may wish to reconsider doing this. If there\u2019s an accident and the furnace explodes, damages your home or injures someone else, you may be on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars worth of medical expenses and punitive damages.Contact your local fire marshal - If this violates local fire ordinances, you could be forced to remove or risk fines and possibly arrest if the furnace causes any damage or a fire.Contact your local building department and check their ordinances concerning this - If you live outside of a city, the regulations may be lax; if you live inside of a city, be prepared for a number of steps which will have to undertaken to construct this. If you fail to do this and a neighbor complains or there is an accident, the municipality can make you take the furnace apart or fine heavily. Or bothSit down and create a plan on what you are going to do before you construct the furnace - Without a plan, you could find yourself tearing it apart and rebuilding it multiple times until you get it right. You also need to set aside an area where you want to place the furnace, how you are going to fuel, what type of warm up/cool down schedule you are going to use, what type of safety equipment that you\u2019ll need, how you are going to handle any exhaust gases,etc.Build the furnace according to your plans and what you have gleaned from what you read - Go slow and take your time. Make certain that you check your work as you go and if you aren\u2019t certain about something that you have done, stop and review your work.Tim Hofstetter gave a pretty good plan for an inexpensive furnace. After you make certain that your local ordinances permit such a device and that you won\u2019t run afoul of your home insurer, then you might consider constructing that one. Personally (and I have worked in both forging shops and foundries) I would consider buying a small used furnace. It would likely be more compliant with local ordinances and they are surprisingly inexpensive, especially if you purchase one from an auction or a used machinery dealer. ",

            "answer_text": "All it takes is a metal (steel) box - an old woodstove would work fine - lined on the inside with firebrick. A fair-sized burner from a propane barbecue could supply the heat. You'd want to severely restrict or totally block off the stovepipe connection, and tou'd want to make a smallish hole somewhere that'd serve both as an exhaust-gas port and a heating port through which you could insert workpieces. If you didn't want to use propane, you could very probably generate your heat with the nichrome wire from a number of cast-off milkhouse heaters, each possibly shortened a bit if it doesn't get hot enough. Propane would heat bigger workpieces faster, though. ",
