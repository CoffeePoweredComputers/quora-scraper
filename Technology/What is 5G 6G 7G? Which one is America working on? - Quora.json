            "answer_text": "None of these really does exist. And companies are working on 5G at present. In the US this is limited to network operators and device manufacturers. The area of network infrastructure supply is completely out of US for many years already. American operators buy either from Ericsson (Sweden) or Nokia (Finland), and part of the kit maybe from Cisco (Ca) or the Koreans or Japanese smaller suppliers. The other large supplier would be Huawei, which is banned from the US market. 5G is the new international standard for mobile communication. The G stands for Generation. So there was a 2G, 3G and 4G, which is the current network standard. The Generation standard concept is due to and owned by the International Telecommunication Union ITU-R (R stands for Section Radio). They are an organization established according to international law and mandated by the United Nations. ITU follows the international use of radio waves, and advises or decides (with their membership) about future use of radio spectrum. Considerations taken by ITU-R include: growth or decline of certain uses of radio frequencies, in particular volumes of data, number of subscriptions, etcindustry demands for radio frequencies around the worldtechnology trends (what will become available in the coming years)Every 10 years or so they come back with a call for a new generation of mobile technology. That was the case in 2000 (with 3G), in 2010 (with 4G) and with a target of 2020 for the 5th generation. There is nothing about 6G or even 7G. Not even remotely. We are still in the 5G standardization; the global development organization 3GPP proposed their drop R15, but is seems a bit unlikely that ITU-R will accept it \u2014 for many reasons. One being that enormous pressure under which is was done. In particular American operators had opened a 5g marketing war, without any 5g being there. So R15 was released as a premature standard; what is being implemented today is actually this. It will take until 2025 before we will see the first fully functional 5G networks anywhere in the world. And only then, and after the first experiences we will see if and when a 6G will be needed. ",

            "answer_text": "5G is an advancement of 4G in which it stands on the same LTE but here the antennas used and the distance matters a lot.you may have heard that the fcc govenrment has granted 5.9ghz for connected cars ie v2x and here comes the play while china and n korea had implemented 5G and they are working on 6G test bed parallely to enhance and broaden the 5G network. These IEEE fu***** bastards are releasing papers and they are saying that all the nations in the world would follow their standards as mentioned in their papers meanwhile 3gpp,etsi and Ieee are fighting to make their standars as norms etsi silently supported the n korea and 5G had been rolled out. finally there is no 7G asa of now only the iEEE member are writing papers and simulating it on the matlab to showcase their mathematical calculations are correct. no one from them are working partically on these system thats a bad thing and this needs to be improved and finally my advise is just dont ask these type of silly questions as it would affect other users.
