If you mean something similar to the population center of the United States, I'd say a good bit north of the exact center of the planet since most of the technology is in the northern hemisphere. If you mean something similar but on a galactic scale, I'd guess somewhere near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. If you mean of the entire universe, your guess is as good as mine. Something gives me the feeling you really mean some kind of think tank somewhere on or near the surface of Earth, you should ask Google. ",
