            "answer_text": "At this point in time, we are completely surrounded by artificial intelligence in our daily lives. Popular everyday uses of artificial intelligence include email classification, product recommendations, virtual assistants, and voice assistants. However, I assume you are asking for applications which are more specific, hence, I would specify my answer in terms of industry. Fintech: Fintech uses AI widely, especially for the purposes of cyberfraud detection. Machine Learning algorithms are great at detecting anomalies in data patterns and have been able to mitigate attacks in several cases. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is also widely used in the world of finance, for activities like loan approvals and analyzing contracts amongst others. Healthtech: AI Development has made incredible improvements in the field of healthcare. Developments such as wearable technology and virtual AI doctors are some of the most important and sought after innovations in the industry. The emergence of precision algorithms in the world of healthcare has added a different dimension of personalization to the world of healthcare. Edutech: The COVID-19 situation has pretty much every school virtual and schools are looking at AI for effective teaching solutions. Chatbots for eLearning have already received widespread acceptance. Adaptive learning platforms are also being deployed in schools for better learning and teaching experiences. Consumer Robots: Smart homes and consumer robots are becoming a part of everyday affairs. Consumer robots like iRobot\u2019s Roomba use artificial intelligence to understand and detect objects, navigate their way across spaces, and remember routes it has been. It also uses artificial intelligence to understand different surfaces and clean accordingly. HR processes: Although highly unfavorable due to the Amazon mishap, however, AI is being used by organizations to recruit people. Companies like PredictiveHire have been using artificial intelligence to draft suitable candidates for their clients. What I have mentioned above, is barely a glimpse of the applications of artificial intelligence. Unfortunately or fortunately, it is too vast for me to cover it entirely. However, it can be easily said, that it is surrounding us in nearly every aspect of our lives, from self-driving cars to voice assistants. ",

            "answer_text": "AI has is commonly being used in the context of creating \u2018smart\u2019 automation. Aimed at reducing the burden of high-volume and repetitive tasks on the human workforce. Tasks simple enough, but prior to AI, were still too complex or multi-faceted to automate by machine. The best tangible illustration I can think of is the evolution of the automobile assembly line. At the turn of the century, manual labor was required to assemble a car. Back then, the conveyor belt assembly line was an astounding new concept. Then machinery was introduced to assist laborers to do the heavy lifting aspects of production. Today, these segments of the mass-production line are computer automated and robotic. But there are still segments of the line that machines can\u2019t replace. Internal wiring, electronics, and upholstery installations still requiring the finesse of the human touch. True, certain jobs became obsolete. As they eventually do. But the next generation was able to access new kinds of jobs at higher levels. Jobs that involved creating better ergonomics and aerodynamics. Positions that led to the development of fuel-efficiency and safety systems. Engineers and designers. I\u2019ve listed some marketing industry examples in my article: Benefits of artificial intelligence - 5 reasons why every marketer needs AI. AI solutions available can automate repetitive tasks many marketers deal with today. Social media marketing and the constant pace and volume of content being created, has meant that the modern marketer today needs the skills of a data analyst as well. The Talkwalker AI Engine can be trained by the marketer to automatically recognize the difference between relevant and irrelevant data. Ensuring clean, filtered results for reliable analysis and insight generation. Leaving more time for creating unique, exciting and engaging content. Effective strategies based off solid data analytics.  Talkwalker AI-powered image recognition, scanning visual posts for brand presence. ",
