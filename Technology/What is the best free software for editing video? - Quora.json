            "answer_text": "Well there is no ONE BEST app that can be recommended for video editing but what i can recommend you is the process, the problems you will face while editing videos and ways to resolve them ! Now obviously there must be a lot of questions in your mind How can I learn video editing ? How should I start ? Which softwares should I use ? How long will it take me to learn ? Will I be able to create proffesional videos or not ? How expensive will it all be ? don\u2019t worry, i will address all your confusions. But first you must ask a question to yourself What is the easiest and least expensive way to professionally edit a video ? Sounds rediculous ? The first thought that must be coming to the mind is that there is no such way ! Am I right ? I had also thought so in the beginning When I started editing video I too started with a proper laptop and high end softwares like adobe illustrator ,after effects and premier pro.  But soon I realised that it is just a waste of time, money and efforts until and unless you are making a Hollywood movie. Let me explain why I am saying so. When you start using a laptop and some bulky and complex softwares you encounter some issues such as Portability of the devicePc\u2019s are not at all portable but laptops are but they lag far behind the tablets and the phones  2. Complexities of the software premier pro , after efftects , adobe illustrator are hugely gigantic softwares and confusingly complex too. So if you are a complete beginner than you will be left with two options  either learn these softwares by attending some paid courses offline or learn through some free/paid courses on youtube or other learning platforms like skillshare udemy lynda etc. Now you will ask me isn\u2019t attening online or offline course a good choice . Well yes also and no also. Yes if you are making movies, no if you are making any video other than movies. Because understanding these high end softwares requires patience and time, you will have to simultaneously do the practice of whatever you have learned to see wether you are able to achieve the desired results or not and what problems are you facing while doing so ! One thing to note here is that the time it will take to understand the software is another thing and the problems you will face while editing the video is a completely different thing. For eg- suppose you encounter a red frame issue in which a part of the video becomes red,  So to solve this you will have three options  either ask your teacher, or search online( youtube, google etc ) or try figuring out yourself. In any case you will loose time solving the issue and you will stay frustated until the problem gets solved. This is one problem, the problem you can encounter have no counting, because you are handling a highly complex software and whenever anything has complexities then it comes with its own set of problems. The more complex a mechanism is the more problems you will face ,the simplistic the mechanism is the lesser the problems you will face. Another issue that may come your way is 3. Money -  You will need a good quality laptop or pc if you are working with premier pro or after effects level softwares as these are bulky softwares and shows laggy behaviour if the laptop or pc is not of a superior quality. So the money not only goes into the buying of softwares but also in the device. On the contrary if you learn the art of editing videos with phone and free apps then the investment is literally ZERO. Now the question arises how to edit video on phone ? To explain this i have made detailed video here is the link to the video -  and if you have any further questions then you can ask me in the comments section \ud83d\ude0a ",
