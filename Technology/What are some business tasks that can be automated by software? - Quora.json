            "answer_text": "Not to trivialize the question, but everything can be automated to some degree. If you look hard enough and are willing to spend, you can find off-the-shelf software that will write certain kinds of articles, design certain kinds of products, schedule work and manage employees, support customer issues, handle payroll, and pretty much anything else you can imagine.  The questions are the degree it needs to be automated (often, we automate sub-tasks to enhance an employee's ability) and whether the benefits outweigh the costs.  Both depend on the business and their particular strengths and needs. ",
