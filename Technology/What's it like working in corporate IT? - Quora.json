            "answer_text": "It varies dramatically but here\u2019s my take working in different sectors of IT. Working for a company that is a tech company, where IT is viewed as a revenue generator, as opposed to working in corp IT, where IT is viewed as a cost center, as in you aren\u2019t making any money for the company greatly changes your access to resources. The latter being you have to beg for the things that you need, the former, you don\u2019t have to beg so much for things.Different industries demand different things. The older, stodgier companies, expect more meetings, more layers of management, and hence, slower pace to get things done. Think IBM. Takes a long time to get things done. Companies that are more DevOps style, you have to kind of think quick and act fast because it\u2019s forever changing.There\u2019s a style that suits everyone, whether you are young in your career and really want to make a mark, or you\u2019re a bit more mature in your career and you prefer a more even pace without a lot of stops and starts.

            "answer_text": "I have worked in the IT realm for almost twenty years now, in varying capacities. If you really want to know what it was like in the IT support roles, watch The IT Crowd.  When I started in the realm, my coworkers were just as uncomfortable around me as Roy and Maurice were of Jen. The support calls were just as stupid. Yes, I was constantly having to ask if the user had tried turning it off and on. It is absolutely not a \"myth\" that a person complained that their cup holder was too flimsy. Yes. Cup holder. The CD disk tray. Yes, there were callers complaining that the computer was on fire. Expecting us on the phone to fix it.  On a whole though, I have loved working in IT. The people are intelligence, mostly witty, fun to be around and there is always a challenge.   ",
