            "answer_text": "When you program, you write 1. Business logic2. View Logic Business Logic: It deals with the security of your application (Authentication and Authorisation) and the actual data. This is  the backend of your app. Business logic should never appear in your front end because your front ends can be multiple(viz. Android, HTML, iOS), and if you write your business logic on front end, you will have to replicate it on all front ends. This is a severe code smell. View Logic: It deals with GUI elements. For a good, elegant and intuitive GUI, you need to write a good view logic at your front end. This is important as well because customers directly see and interact with the front end of your app. So going back to your question, both sides are equally logical. ",

            "answer_text": "In the past, in the days of mainframes, there were no good screens, there were mostly dark text based console and there was no logic needed to print them, and industry spent lot more time in perfecting backend related stuff, such as transactions and storage. This continued for long time, till GUI based computing came in picture, but still the only business apps that attracted entire economy was banking, insurance sector, where you had to deal with backend, so backend jobs were highly paid till now. After revolution of mobile, tablets, and going on further to IOT (Internet of Things), it is changing, front end is becoming more powerful, there are more opportunities for this instead of backend, because for backend, there are more stable frameworks available to do your transactions and storage. Execpt things like data science and large data analysis, there is not much more logic remaining to be written for backend. ",
