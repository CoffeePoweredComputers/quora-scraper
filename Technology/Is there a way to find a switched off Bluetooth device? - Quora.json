But such a log would have to be a part of an app and there would be no guarantee that it's location hasn't changed and that would only give your the GPS location of the last device that had discovered it.  If it was powered on and simply not broadcasting there is a BLE protocol to switch it to broadcast to then you could discover it and hone in on it's location using signal strength. But these usecases would apply more to BLE than headphones.  ",

Certain devices such as some smartphones can have tracking features that can be activated and used in case you don't remember where your device is. However, Bluetooth earphones are not such devices and when they're powered down, they can't be powered up remotely.  I suggest that you try hard to remember where you've seen them last or get a new pair and try not to misplace them again. Good luck! ",
