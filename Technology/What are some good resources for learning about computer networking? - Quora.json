            "answer_text": "Get a book on Computer Networking,say \"Computer Networks\" by Andrew Tanenbaum. This will give you a good hold on basics of computer networks. Use an Linux Machine to know basic network commands, and do some practical exercise playing around them. You can do a sample Client-Server Chat Room assignment to strengthen your knowledge about sockets,sessions, messaging, packet structure etc. Then you can move on to learn about FTP,SMTP,HTTP etc and go on. You can pick up a specific layer in TCP/IP stack and keep honing your knowledge on it, before moving to the next layer. ",
