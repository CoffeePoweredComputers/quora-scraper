            "answer_text": "No. Both DVDs and Blu-rays are optical media. If your player is free of debris [and I can\u2019t think of any good reason why there would be any debris in a DVD/Blu-ray player], the only thing that comes in contact with the disc is the spin motor, and that\u2019s only with the centre spindle. The data is read by a laser that is positioned below the disc and never touches the disc. ",
