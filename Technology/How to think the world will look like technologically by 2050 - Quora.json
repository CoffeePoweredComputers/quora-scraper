            "answer_text": "32 years from now. 32 years ago was 1986, VCRs were expensive, the biggest TV you could buy was 30\u2033 and it weighed 200lb and had worse resolution than an Apple Watch, a Macintosh computer cost as much as a good used car, and that car might go 100,000 miles before it became unreliable. Things are going to be weird because they\u2019re so technologically different. Viable molecular manufacturing (Reaching the goal of the Star Trek replicator | MIT Video) is available in the home and ends retail stores. The likelihood of human level Artificial General intelligence (will they be legal persons?) is very good. Regardless of the actual level of intelligence, \"AI\" agents are undetectable from humans more than 99% of the time. They exist and pervade your network (which is no longer a cell phone, but likely a worn/implanted device that recognizes you no matter where you are) Human consciousness may very well live in other substrates than the human body, and we may be able to communicate (through technology) via thought with all other people at the same time. We will likely have become much more than human, full time augmentation of our senses and capabilities makes our cognitive abilities effectively superhuman by 2014 standards. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the things to watch out for are the subtle left turns. Look at the contrasts between 2001: A Space Odyssey and 2001 (reality). There was an International Space Station under construction, but it was serviced by a fully reusable shuttle service, seemingly for people only as elite as those who used to fly the Concorde. There were a few permanently staffed moon bases, but by real 2001, we had not yet returned to the moon. On the other hand, while HAL 9000 was more advanced than any Siri, Alexa or Cortana (still decades away in 2001), HAL was also as large as a ship, and all computing power pretty much routed through HAL\u2026and for some reason video calls, while technologically feasible for a long time, didn\u2019t really catch on until the iPhone and Facetime made them convenient. Also, who would have guessed texting and emojis would be so big? And nobody was predicting China circa 2001. ",
