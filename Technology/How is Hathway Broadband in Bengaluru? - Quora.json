            "answer_text": "It is the worst. Let me tell you about my experiences with Hathway (company). On Saturday, November 03, 2018, I raise a request for Hathway Broadband connection and same day their executive visited my place for registration and payment. He did the registration process and I made a payment of Rs 2122. It is a 2-month plan. The executive promised me that you will be able to start using our services within and 24 hours. After 24 hours I called on Hathway (company) helpline number which is 080\u201340161616 the support guy again promised me that we will complete the cabling soon and will start using our services in 24 hours. He created a task in Hathway (company) system(Task management system) for the same. Meanwhile, I called the executive to report the same As soon as I told him my name and address he disconnected the call and when I called him the second time he blocked my number. On Tuesday, November 06, 2018 two technicians visited my place for the cabling and after cabling, they told me that it will take around 2 hours in order to start but it did not start working. On Thursday, November 07, 2018 after getting frustrated by their services I bought a LAN wire and internet started using through LAN cable. it was working :) On Friday, November 08, 2018 I got a call from Hathway (company) technical team and they created WIFI and things started working. On Saturday, November 09, 2018 suddenly it again stops working. This time I got too frustrated so I asked them to refund my money and disconnect the services, the response that I got from support guy was unbelievable, he was saying that this money is non-refundable. So basically till now, I have called 12 times on their customer care number and every time either I have lodged a complaint or I have requested them to update my previous complaint but sadly they haven't addressed even a single complain properly. So their customer services are worst.  I personally believe Hathway Broadband (undefined) service is also a big scam, because I haven\u2019t used their internet for even 3 hours properly, I haven\u2019t downloaded any big file but according to them, my total consumed internet is ~ 24GB But I\u2019m pretty sure that I haven\u2019t used more than 10GB.  There are a few more that I do not like about Hathway (company). Cable: They provide really old fat wire for the connection that really looks very bad.Modem: There is no proper button to restart it you have to use the pin of this. It also looks very old. They also do not provide a new modem so it is very common that there will always some issues with this.Router: There is no proper button to restart it you have to use the pin of this. It also looks very old. They also do not provide a new router so it is very common that there will always some issues with this. Thanks PS ",

            "answer_text": "I would not recommend Hathway broadband internet service to anyone. Reasons: * I have opted for one of the premium quarterly plans and have already paid the amount but my internet connection is down since last 14 days (345 hors to be slecific) and it is not up yet. * In my case they provided the reason that power supply to the regional server is down; and if it takes 14 days to fix the power supply of server, that means they have very limited resources and very weak technical team. * Worst part is, when you call customer care, they tell you that - when power supply of server is down then customer complaint can not be lodged (and that is the Hathway process) * So what should customer do in this case? Answer (as provided by customrr care executive) is to go to the regional office and see ykurself what the isdue is and lodge the complaint with them. * If you manage to somehow lodge the complaint (expecting it may get resolved), it does not get addressed eventhough you personally take daily follow-ups. * The local guy (who had made huge claims about Hathway service and standards of operation), wkuld no longet attend your calls. andyou feel like being alieneted and cheated. * Ultimately you have already prepaid the money for the future 3 months and you do not get the service for desired period. * You will end up blaiming yourself once you buy Hathway internet service or its plans. * So, do not get fooled by their full speed claims, uptime claims or attractive unlimited plans or Sania Mirza's afvertisement. They all are useless if you do not get internet regularly (ehich is highly the case as far as Hathway is concerned). My experience is that HATHWAY DOES NOT VALUE CUSTOMERS ONCE THEY RECIEVE PAYMENT, I DO NOT RECOMMEND HATHWAY BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICE TO ANYONE. (I checked my Hathway internet connection again and it is still down. My complaint is stil open with hathway even after 14 days. Service looks to be as poor as Indisn government servants) ",
