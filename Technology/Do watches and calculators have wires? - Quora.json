Sometimes some of the devices inside are wire-bonded to the PCB, although less so these days, and these are wires. but they are pure gold, about 1/1000 of an inch in diameter (~.0.0025 mm) and not insulated.

Probably not for a watch, but certainly for many calculators for such items as the battery holder, perhaps solar cell, etc. which may not be located close to the circuit board. Generally wiring is avoided for cost reasons. And, remember there are many many calculator designs large and small. X < > Y, Sonoran desert Richard ",
