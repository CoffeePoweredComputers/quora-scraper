            "answer_text": "The term universal implies that a power supply can be used universally throughout the world. All of the countries on the globe have their own power generation facilities. Those facilities distribute their power at different voltages and frequencies. So a universal power supply must be designed to regulate a required output power format (i.e. USB wall charger with an output voltage of 5V) regardless of the local power input format (i.e. 120V rms AC line voltage with a 60Hz line frequency). In the US, the input power format is a line voltage of 120V rms and a line frequency of 60Hz. In Europe the format is a line voltage of 230V rms and a line frequency of 50Hz. There are other formats throughout the world. The term universal also applies with regard to meeting local safety and radio interference regulatory requirements. This is why one finds the terms UL, CE, FCC, and other such markings on the outer case of a power supply. Summarily, a universal power supply is one that can be used in virtually all countries on the planet regardless of the regulatory requirements or input power format. ",
