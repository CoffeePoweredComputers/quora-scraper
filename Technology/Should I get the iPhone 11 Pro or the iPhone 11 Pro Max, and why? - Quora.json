I don't know which you should care, and I honestly don't think anyone cares or that it even matters. Next year there will be an iPhone 12 and it's the same nonsense over again. It's a phone, buy whichever one you want and whichever fits your budget. To many people constantly buy the newest thing and waste their money. I've had the same $200 phone for the last year or so and the only reason I bought it was because my old one (another $200 phone which I used for 2 years) shattered. I would never spend $700 on a phone, and that's the cheapest iPhone. I have better things to spend $1,000-$1,100 on. Look at their specs and features, see which \u201csuits\u201d your needs and get that one. ",

(But you will need bigger hands or some time to practice. A bigger phone is heavier and might break more easy).It\u2019s just a lousy 100 bucks difference.",
