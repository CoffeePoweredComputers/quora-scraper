            "answer_text": "The last VCR manufacturing line (Funai) shut down a few years ago. So the only supply of machines would be new old stock (old unsold machines sitting on a shelf somewhere) or refurbished or used ones. Sony had kept one last model in production for a few years, but caved in before Funai did. VHS tapes are much more expensive to manufacture than DVDs, and the demand plummeted over a decade ago, so I don\u2019t know of any locations still producing them. DVD-9 and CD-Video or even USB drives now seem to be the consumer video source in many parts of the world these days at a tiny fraction of the manufacturing cost of VHS, and require only one person with a basic computer to create, unlike the large tape manufacturing and duplication facilities needed for VHS.

            "answer_text": "Yes, I live in Ottawa, Canada and I have seen new VCR\u2019s sometimes with the DVD player combined, at some of the Walmart stores. Not very often though. As well, if you don\u2019t mind used VCR\u2019s or VHS tapes, I see several of them at Salvation Army stores, Value Village stores, and Saint Vincent de Paul. The nice thing about the latter store is that they test their VCR\u2019s before selling them. Used VCR\u2019s go for about $10 and tapes go for $0.75 to $1.00 each. Hope this helps! ",
