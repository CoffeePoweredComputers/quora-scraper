            "answer_text": "The ideal solution is empowering human ingenuity so that any displaced worker can easily retrain and get a new job where their labor is valued. Good stop gap measures are things like basic income, but ultimately humans feel the need to be valued in society for their contributions. Unfortunately, some people will find it very hard to adapt. Already we are seeing well intentioned retraining programs produce mediocre results and disability claims skyrocketing across the rust belt (the U.S. doesn't have much welfare so diability is the closest thing you can get to a basic income without kids). Unlike prior ages of technological unemployment where farmers en masse became factory workers or the more recent globalization driven shift of manufacturing workers to service work in advanced economies (retail, food service, logistics etc.), there does not yet seem to be a mass market analog this time around in our increasingly knowledge and critical thinking based economy. Perhaps the Flynn effect will continue and make us all move up the knowledge chain: most subsistence farmers pre 20th century didn't really need to go to high school or be literate while most assembly workers in the 20th century did. If so, we are only seeing a temporary mismatch right now and in a few generations most humans will be able to code and do math and build robots to colonize other galaxies. Or maybe even without quantitative or managerial skills we will all become \u201cartists\u201d (writers, YouTubers, sportsmen, philosophers etc) creating beautiful things and entertaining each other in a market economy that values these fairly. But even here the superstar effect is strong. Yet, while I objectively enjoy recorded music played by the best artists in studios more, I still tip a dollar when I hear a local cover band play at a the subway and don't do so to a loudspeaker playing the same song. So maybe there is some hope and human interaction itself will always be valued no matter how good the robots become. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that the commonly discussed ones are not practical, despite seeming so. These are some flavor of guaranteed minimum income, and/or mass retraining. The first will face far greater hurdles than most proponents acknowledge. I have written an article exploring this: Guaranteed Mirage Income? Mass retraining is a favorite among economists, who are generally convinced that this wave of automation will generate more jobs than it destroys, as have the previous waves of automation. They are ignoring the fact that machines can now observe humans performing complex tasks, attempt to replicate those actions, adjust, and then keep on repeating the process of trial and error until they succeed. Once such a machine succeeds, it can be duplicated in whatever quantity is wanted. This competency is rapidly increasing, and robots can now be equipped with human-level senses of sight, hearing, and even touch. It\u2019s even worse than that for job seekers. Deep learning algorithms can train themselves to use very complex reasoning to perform complex mental activities. This process is much faster than human learning, and the scope of competency is rapidly widening. Aside from those two proposals, the other ideas I\u2019ve seen all emanate from within our present Scarcity Game-based societies. Scarcity-based economic systems will not long support huge numbers of non-productive people. Consider how the oil states that have provided such incomes are faring now that oil is dropping in price, and soon to be non-competitive with renewables, according to Deutschbank and others. This reminds me of a quotation: \"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.\" - Arthur Conan Doyle On that basis, I suggest that we look seriously into forming one small, new, model society based on provable, sustainable abundance. We can do this first as a simulation and, once debugged, build and then further refine it in the real world. After it works reasonably well, the model can be duplicated far and wide, as wanted and needed. That is the premise of my book, and it has been well-received. Other abundance-based societal models are also possible. We need one of them to be proven by the time the tsunami of technological unemployment hits; else we may face dire consequences. ",
