            "answer_text": "Yea sure, no problemo. The sim card gets you onto the network that you subscribe to but have to pay for that service. However, any free WiFi or hot spot will give you access to the internet and also free apps like LINE, WhatsApp and the rest of the free services. But all the people you want to contact have to be on the same app. However with the LINE app you can ring any hard line service for free for five minutes, five times a day. ",
