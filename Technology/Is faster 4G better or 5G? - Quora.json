            "answer_text": "Simply said, 5G is widely believed to be smarter, faster and more efficient than 4G. It promises mobile data speeds that far outstrip the fastest home broadband network currently available to consumers. With speeds of up to 100 gigabits per second, 5G is set to be as much as 100 times faster than 4G. Low latency is a key differentiator between 4G and 5G. Latency is the time that passes from the moment information is sent from a device until it can be used by the receiver. Reduced latency means that you\u2019d be able to use your mobile device connection as a replacement for your cable modem and Wi-Fi. Additionally, you\u2019d be able to download and upload files quickly and easily, without having to worry about the network or phone suddenly crashing. You\u2019d also be able to watch a 4K video almost straight away without having to experience any buffering time. 5G will be able to fix bandwidth issues. Currently, there are so many different devices connected to 3G and 4G networks, that they don\u2019t have the infrastructure to cope effectively. 5G will be able to handle current devices and emerging technologies such as driver-less cars and connected home products. Too many devices trying to use the network in one place can cause congestion. The network infrastructure just can't cope with mass numbers of devices, leading to slower data speeds and longer lag time for downloads. 5G is expected to solve that issue \u2014 and then some. The next generation network is expected to have significantly more capacity than 4G. That will mean not only a better connection for everyone's phones, so you can more easily brag on social media about being at the big game. It will make it possible to connect many, many more devices to the network. ",

            "answer_text": "4G is enough when it comes to usual browsing and watching movies in HD. However, 5G has extraordinary features that offer unique digital experiences to users. 5G has capacity to empower newer technologies. Following are a few of the advantages of 5G over previous mobile networks \u2013 Higher speeds \u2013 5G will definitely have higher speeds than previous generations. However 5G speeds in real will also depend on a lot of factors like the device you are connected to, the network traffic, etc. The average speed of 5G will range between 300Mbps to 1Gbps.Low latency \u2013 Latency is the time required when your data travels from one device to its destination. This time is usually in milliseconds and lower the latency better will be the 5G experience. The average latency expected by the 5G network is around 10ms.Higher bandwidth \u2013 5G will allow multiple devices to connect on a network without having any impact on the bandwidth. 5G will not only lower bandwidth issues but have the capacity to support newer technologies like self-driving cars, IoT products, connected home products, etc.All these features make 5G better than 4G and will bring amazing technologies to the Indian households. With 5G we can stream 4K videos and empower technologies like IoT, self-driving cars, etc. During the 43rd AGM of RIL, Mr. Mukesh Ambani announced the roadmap to 5G in India. He said that Jio has designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch. This will enable Jio to launch a world-class 5G service in India using 100% homegrown technologies and solutions. ",
