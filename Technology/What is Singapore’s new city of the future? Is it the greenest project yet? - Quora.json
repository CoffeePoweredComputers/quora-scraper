            "answer_text": "Singapore\u2019s New City of the Future Is Its Greenest Project Yet I take it that this is the Bloomberg article which the question-asker is referring to. For those who may need reference, you may read it above to get a better idea on the context of this question.  In technical terms, the so-called \u201cnew city of the future\u201d is no city, but rather a planning area and a town demarcated by the Housing & Development Board (HDB) as well as the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). After all, Singapore is a city-state. How can a city-state have another smaller city within it? That doesn\u2019t seem very logical. From A peek into Tengah, the next new HDB town the size of Bishan: Tengah will be composed of five housing districts: Plantation, Park, Garden, Brickland and Forest Hill, each to be designed to correspond with a facet of the town\u2019s identity. For instance, the Plantation District, the first to be built, will have a community farmway running through its housing precincts. It has space dedicated for community gardening and urban farming, and activities such as sales of organic produce may also be held there. The town sits on a key eco-corridor linking the western part of Singapore to nature reserves in the Central Catchment area. HDB\u2019s planners drew inspiration from this and set about creating a town \u201cthat would be sensitively integrated with the ecosystems surrounding it\u201d. HDB said it has conducted environmental, topological and hydrological surveys for the area. \u201cTaking into consideration the surroundings, topography and water courses, the plan is to recreate a forest corridor that runs through the town in an East-West direction,\u201d it said. \u201cWhere it makes sense to integrate with the town greenery, we could retain some existing vegetation.\u201d \u2026 In line with the Government\u2019s efforts to get people to cut back on using cars, Tengah will house the first car-free HDB town centre, although this will be put into effect only when the town reaches critical mass. Roads and vehicles will run beneath the town centre. Paired with the other details that were mentioned in Bloomberg\u2019s article, I think it\u2019s quite apt for Bloomberg to label Tengah, the name of this new planning area and town in Singapore, as Singapore\u2019s greenest project to date. As Bloomberg puts it: Giant solar-powered air-conditioners, vacuum garbage collection, subterranean roads for electric vehicles, urban farms and green architecture. Put them all together and you have Tengah, Singapore\u2019s most ambitious project yet to build the city of the future. \u2026 In Tengah, the cooling units will be solar powered and installed on rooftops of public-housing blocks, with chilled water piped through the buildings. The system\u2019s operator, SP Group, says the network can cut energy use by 30% -- an emissions saving equivalent to 4,500 gasoline-powered cars. Residents have the option of connecting to the centralized cooling, or buying and running their own traditional air-con units.  But to be very honest, while Tengah may be Singapore\u2019s greenest project yet, it is going to do little to mitigating Singapore\u2019s carbon emissions. Why?  Taken from Straits Times. This is Jurong Island, the heart of Singapore\u2019s refining and petrochemicals sector. This sector contributes about 75% of Singapore\u2019s industrial emissions, which in turn makes up 60% of Singapore\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.[1] After some simple calculations, it can be determined that Singapore\u2019s refining and petrochemicals sector makes up 45% of all of Singapore\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, which was at 52.5 million tonnes in 2017.   A picture at the Sembwaste sorting facility in Singapore. Taken by Marcus Mark Ramos. It has also been reported that Singapore\u2019s domestic recycling rate is awfully low, at only 17% in 2019.[2] In contrast, the European Union had a domestic recycling rate of 46.4% in 2017. And while the overall recycling rate stood at 59% in 2019, [3] it needs to be noted that domestic recycling is not the only aspect where recycling rates are low. Food waste accounts for roughly 10% of the total waste generated in Singapore, yet only 18% of it was recycled in 2019.[4]  So what does this mean for Singapore? To me, this means that while Tengah may be an ambitious project which is Singapore\u2019s greenest yet, and could make Singapore much greener and more environmentally friendly in the long-term, urban planning projects like Tengah are hardly enough to save our environment. As beneficial as Tengah may be to reducing Singapore\u2019s carbon footprint, the reality is that it will pale in comparison to what can be done in other aspects, especially in Singapore where the key contributors to greenhouse gas emissions aren\u2019t even in this field. The more pressing problems that exist in Singapore lie with our industries, particularly the refining and petrochemicals sector, as well as our dismal recycling rates. Thanks for reading!
