            "answer_text": "Both Industry 3.0 and Industry 4.0 are open ended topics, giving scope for an endless discussion. I will restrict myself to the basics. Industry 3.0: The industrial Era which boasts of switching form Tape reader mechanisms to the usage of Computer Numeric Control (CNC), CAD, CAM and somewhere CAE. The basic point being that all these computer aided operations were being performed on individual scale. There was no integrity in the work being done by several employees in the same company, between the data available with the tier-3 vendor and the OEM, and no feedback loop was being created from the user\u2019s end. All this leads to a lot of hustle and bustle in the operation, leading to complex project management, undesired output and consumer dissatisfaction. No data collection and analysis was being performed. There was automation, but on a very small scale. Negligible emphasis was being laid on Cyber Security. Industry 4.0: The latest age of industrialization. This age uses cloud based digital components for easy access of data over the complete chain: From Tier - 3 Vendor to the User. A file being modified by one person is known to the other as well, and the previous versions are available showing what modification has been performed. Data related to all the processes will be collected, analyzed and it\u2019s results will be used to make modifications in the process or the product. CNCs along with CAE are used, Robots are deployed to enhance automation, product quality has improved. This has also led to an increase in the demand of Skilled Labor. But to note, Industry 4.0 holds the capacity to much efficiently perform customized product manufacturing than Industry 3.0 . ",

            "answer_text": "Business competition began with introduction of industry 1.0 in the 1800s. Mechanizations has been used in industry powered by external force of steam and water engines. During start of 1900s, Second Industry revolution happened after invention of electrical energy that enabled mass production on conveyor lines. Third revolution brought automation, computers, and robots for production to improve productivity and avoid and reduce skilled labors. Fourth revolution is more about IOT, Data Analytics and smart machines to boost operation efficiency and handle operational complexity. It is about smartly managing the increasing and complex market dynamics. Fourth revolution is more complex than third revolution as it requires three different skill sets to implement Industry 4.0 more efficiently. ",
