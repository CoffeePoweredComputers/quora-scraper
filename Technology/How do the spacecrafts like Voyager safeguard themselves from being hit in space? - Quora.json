            "answer_text": "No spacecraft either manned or unmanned can fully protect its self from debris whilst in orbit or on its journey to another planet. Modern vehicles, satellites and probes are afforded a level of protection due to more modern materials (lightweight composites, Multilayer Insulation) but still there is always a risk that a high speed high energy impact could puncture the vehicle and cause damage. Heavy shielding of a vehicle adds weight and its ability to alter velocity. So would be impractical to launch from earth.  The picture is of an impact in a window on the ISS. The second image is of a micrometeoite entering the atmosphere from an external camera on the ISS.  The ESA Giotto probe of the middle 1980\u2019s flew into the heart of Hayley\u2019s Comet and protected it\u2019s self with a double shield to protect against dust and ice.  The spacecraft was derived from the GEOS research satellite built by British Aerospace in Filton, Bristol, and modified with the addition of a dust shield as proposed by Fred Whipple which comprised a thin (1 mm) aluminium sheet separated by a space and a thicker Kevlar sheet. Giotto visited Halley\u2019s Comet in 1986 and Comet Grigg\u2013Skjellerup in 1992. So far Giotto is the only craft to survive a close flyby of two active comets. So until we develop a Star Trek style deflector shield we just have to be careful and/or tidy up around earth a little. ",
