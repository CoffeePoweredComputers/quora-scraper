            "answer_text": "Nobody. Everybody. Viruses are natural things which exist, largely unknown, in vast numbers in every species of animal, plant and even bacterium on this planet. Viruses mutate, often, to stay ahead of their hosts\u2019 immune systems. A virus that can be recognised by enough of its hosts\u2019 immune system is headed for extinction. But small changes to its genetic structure will blunt or defeat that recognition process. Sometimes, such a mutation has an added benefit for the virus. It allows it to jump to another species of host. The new host has no defences whatsoever against a new virus that it has never encountered before. Which is what is responsible for the corona virus in China. A natural process. There have certainly been mistakes made by human beings once the presence of a new infectious virus was first noticed. That\u2019s not the same as saying that these people were responsible for spreading it. The virus spread itself by infecting people who, for several days, do not know that they had an infection and are infecting others. The lesson for next time is that if a doctor warns that there is a new infectious pathogen out there, act immediately to quarantine the area, and ask questions later. If two weeks had not been wasted by public officials more concerned with appearances than reality, we would not be where we now are. Whether imposing infection control earlier and on a smaller scale would have worked, we can\u2019t say. A sufficiently infectious virus will always win. As of 4th February, the jury is out on whether this one is winning. And however bad this one is, the next one could be far worse. Ebola kills 90% of the people who catch it. Fortunately Ebola is not infectious enough to spread as an epidemic outside communities that don\u2019t or won\u2019t or can\u2019t practice infection control when the need arises. Also there\u2019s now a vaccine for Ebola, so it\u2019s not longer quite such a threat to the world. It\u2019s something completely unknown which does not presently exist, which is that threat. ",

            "answer_text": "ALL viruses mutate. Some mutations cause a virus to die off. Some mutations have no significant effect. Some mutations can make a virus spread more easily or make a virus more deadly. Many mutations will make a virus not be stopped by immunity developed to previous strains of that virus (this makes existing vaccines useless for the new strain). In the case of COVID-19, we have a natural mutation that made the virus different enough to not be stopped by immunity to other corona virus strains, and slightly more virulent in person-to-person airborne transmission. Thus we were faced with a virus that can spread from person to person and that is not stopped by any existing vaccine. One factor that makes this virus particularly a problem is that the virus has a moderately long incubation period between when a person is initially infected and when they begin to show symptoms, but the virus can still be transmitted from the infected person to other people even during the incubation period. This means that people who have been exposed to the virus can spread the virus even though they are not sick yet. That is what happened with COVID-19. People who had been exposed to the virus traveled elsewhere spreading the virus even though they were not sick yet. This happens more often today that it did decades ago because more people travel, and they travel farther and faster than ever before. Also most long distance travel is by airplane, and an airliner is a nearly ideal situation for transmitting any airborne infection because you have a large group of people close to each other in an enclosed cabin all breathing the same recycled air for several hours.
