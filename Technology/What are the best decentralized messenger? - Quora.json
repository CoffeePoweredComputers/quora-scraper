            "answer_text": "Thanks to the Facebook scandal, now we know why privacy is important and why do we need to switch to decentralized messaging apps :)) I'm using Zangi Safe Messenger as it works on a serverless and peer-to-peer concept and doesn\u2019t store communication history. The app has been my companion for more than a year especially in critical situations (2G, crowded WiFi, etc....). Irrelevant to the internet connection quality, all my video and voice calls are uninterrupted, and I don\u2019t miss even a word while talking. Besides, it consumes 6 times less data compared to other messengers. Highly recommend! Cheers! ",

Decentralization will become the future of the Internet development. Thanks to the decentralization of the system, you can achieve complete scalability without expanding and supporting the network and server infrastructure. The solution will also be free and resistant to attempts to closure and censorship. ",
