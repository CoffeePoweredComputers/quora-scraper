            "answer_text": "It is as simple as counting 1,2,3\u2026 Here I am gonna try to simplify the process as possible I can. Please read\u2026 Things you require: A monitor (branded one would be better. I have LCD Dell monitor 17 inches).A cable (VGA cable if the monitor supports VGA or HDMI if it supports HDMI)Set up Box (I have DishTV HD)Things to understand. If your monitor has just VGA but your HD set-up box has HDMI port, you have to purchase VGA TO HDMI converter cable. Buy it from Amazon or Flipkart. It is very cheap. Thing will be easier if both the monitor and set up box has HDMI port. Without the hassle of buying additional converter, just use HDMI cable given by monitor brand or set up box, either will do the job. In case your monitor has no HDMI cable except VGA. In that case, use the converter cable and it will work just fine. The VGA TO HDMI cable will look just like this -  First of all, hook the HDMI end of the converter cable to your set up box\u2019s HDMI socket. The other end of the cable having a VGA connector can be hooked to VGA cable of your monitor. That\u2019s it. Just power up both the monitor and the set-up box. Make sure dish tv\u2019s cable is already hooked to the socket of the setup box in order to transmit the picture. You have to do something like this -  Plugin VGA end of your monitor to the VGA analog of your Set up box. Just like this one -  Tada!!!! The screen comes alive! For the last nearly six months, I have been using my monitor as a TV, and believe me, I am tremendously satisfied. Before using it, I just confused myself more after reading so many people telling various technical mumbo jumbo saying how a monitor differs from TV, and that the former should not be used as a replacement of the latter. After using my monitor, I think I made the right decision by not following that stupid stuff on the internet. Believe me, I get fantastic picture quality from my dish tv HD set-up box. Even standard channels look fine, but HD channels are superb on the screen space of the monitor. Now I am planning to buy a FULL HD monitor like the one I have can support picture resolution of not less than 720P. I will never give a damn to what technically savvy guys say on the internet. So long my monitor works fine as a TV as well as monitor, I will keep killing two birds with one stone. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. END NOTE: SOME PICTORIAL DETAILS CLAIMING VALIDITY OF MY ANSWERS:    Hopefully, the pictures explain everything to you clearly. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION - Most of the readers in this thread have asked me how I handled the audio part. Though I have already explained the same, I am going to explain it again in the following manner \u2013 IN CASE YOUR MONITOR DOESN\u2019T HAVE INBUILT AUDIO: Use an external speaker.Purchase the speaker from a local shop or online. I used my stereo speaker of the Intex brand.Hook up the audio cable of your speaker to the AV output of your STB.This way you will handle the audio problems.IN CASE YOUR MONITOR DOESN\u2019T HAVE HDMI SUPPORT, EXCEPT VGA: Buy VGA TO HDMI converter cable (as shown in the picture above).Plug-in HDMI end of the converter cable to your set up box\u2019s HDMI socket.Plug-in VGA side of your monitor cable to the VGA connector of your convertible cable.Hook up the dish tv cable to the dedicated slot of your STB, to transmit the picture.Power up your monitor and STB.DONE! Enjoy the transformation of your monitor as a TV.IN CASE YOUR MONITOR HAVE HDMI SUPPORT (BESIDES VGA): Just plug in one end of your HDMI cable to the HDMI socket of your STB.Hook up another end of your HDMI cable to the HDMI socket of your monitor.Make sure dish tv cable pointer is already inserted to the dedicated socket of STB for picture transmission.Make sure the power cable is also plugged-in to the STB.Start your monitor and STB.Enjoy!HOW TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL? Since the monitor doesn\u2019t have an inbuilt mechanism to let you change the channel, you have to use the remote of your dish tv provided along with the STB when you purchased it.Any channel you change gets reflected on the screen of your monitor.Satisfied? If not, please let me know how I can assist you with regard to helping you use your monitor as a TV. Finally, \u2026 CAN MY ANSWER GALVANIZE YOU TO CONSIDER YOUR MONITOR AS A SUBSTITUTE OF TV? A lot of reasons can be given in support of whether you should buy a TV or a monitor to enjoy televised shows and programs. My thinking is that the way I handled my old monitor and made it a spectacular TV left me in no doubt that monitor can be a great substitute for TV. Here are some reasons that I believe can support my say, in this regard \u2013 Since monitor can also be used as a TV, you don\u2019t have to buy a separate television set. This means saving a great deal of money. Since you can avoid buying a tv using your monitor as a substitute for your television, you can evade considerations, such as: What brand of tv should I purchase?Oh, dear! I liked Sony or Samsung, but their cost is freaking awful!Local brands sound affordable, but what about their durability?The problem with TV is that the more distance you maintain from it, the clearer picture you get. This is annoying when you have to squint your eyes to read certain headlines/captioned on TV. With monitor as a TV, you don\u2019t have to maintain such a distance. In fact, the closer you are to it, the better clarity of the picture you get. By the way, distance doesn\u2019t affect the picture quality of the monitor at all. THE AREAS WHERE TV OUTWEIGHS THE IMPORTANCE OF MONITOR Monitor has limited size dimensions, whereas TVs don\u2019t.4k supported TVs cost less compared to monitor in the same quality segment. For example, the cost of 4k TV of Samsung by 40 plus inches, would cost you around 30k, but you won\u2019t buy any monitor in this quality segment at the proximity of such price.TVs these days come pre-supported with Alexa, among other features, including Android-featured freeware. The monitor can\u2019t give you these feature-loaded privileges.CONCLUSION Buying a TV or using your monitor as a substitute for a TV is an independent choice of the user. Whether you choose either of the options depends on what you feel comfortable with regarding your entertainment purpose. In my case, I thought of using my old monitor as a TV, considering it wonderfully served my purpose. I didn\u2019t have a large room, quality of picture output through monitor was great, and never experienced abrupt downtime, as observed in most of the TVs. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "All the Other Answers up till now don't seem to grasp the question being asked right now and are in general asking the either subscribe to some online service or buy a new device. so i am going to answer the question as i see fit. First of all, i am going to assume that you already have a PC and a TV i also expect that both are fairly modern machines, the PC should have an HDMI port though if it doesn't then a VGA will do just fine but require some additional work. i also expect that you are not trying to connect your PC to a CRT TV the old fat ones they can be connected but require a special cable or device to do so. so now i will list the steps to complete this fairly mundane task find what ports and cable you have on TV. you likely already have a TV that connects to your set-top box (the box which connects your tv to tata sky or other providers of similar service) using an HDMI cable unless you have a CRT TV. so if you have an HDMI port and cable then it all depends on your PCnow look at the back of your PC and check if it has an HDMI port. if it has then its a simple matter of using the HDMI cable to connect your PC to the TV. just make sure that you have the correct source selected on your TV and your PC is set to use the TV as a monitor, if you don't know how to set your PC to use your TV as a monitor then just the hold the windows button(on lower left part of keyboard) and press P button on the keyboard to cycle between various projection modes.now enjoy your TV should be connected and working as if a PC. however, if your PC\u2019s motherboard is a bit old then it may not have an HDMI port in which case see the VGA sectionVGA section the HDMI cable is a much better way of connecting your PC to a TV however sometimes its now possible to do so. the HDMI cable has a bandwidth which supports both audio and video of at least up to 4k. while a VGA cable does support (a high quality one) 1080p at 60hz many local people will tell you that VGA cable doesn't go beyond 1366x768 which is not true. it also doesn't help that VGA doesn't allow audio passthrough. Step to connect your PC to TV using VGA get a High-quality VGA cable, the one you already have might work so it's worth trying it out but if it does support 1080p then you might want to get a better cable unless you are fine with sacrificing quality.get along aux cable some people also call it the 3.5mm audio cable or jack. though it is only required for audioconnect the PC and TV via VGA and switch the source on the TV to VGA, do the same on PC by using the Windows Key+ P comboconnect the aux cable from the headphone out of PC to the line in of TV or an external speaker. rember it is easy to get confused between the 3.5mm headphone, speaker, mic, mic+headphone, line-in, and line out ports. so if it doesn't work on the first try to identify the correct ports before trying againand voila its done its a bit more janker than HDMI and also not of the highest quality but it works",

            "answer_text": "How can I convert my computer monitor into a regular streaming TV? This question is a bit confusing. Are you asking how to use your monitor as a TV, connected to your cable or dish television (not necessarily what is considered as \u201cstreaming\u201d), or are you talking about running a streaming device on your computer monitor, such as Roku, Firestick, or Chromecast? In the first instance, you can buy a card for your computer (not a laptop, but a desktop with the correct PCIe expansion port) which hooks up into your cable and displays the actual television channel of your choice. I used to have one of these, and I could watch TV in a small window while doing other work. Most cards you find don\u2019t have an HDMI input, though, so connecting to a cable box will require a coaxial or RCA cable. Shown is just one example that does have HDMI in and out.  Amazon.com: Hauppauge Colossus 2 PCI Express Internal 1080p HD-PVR: Computers & Accessories Streaming is easier. Most modern monitors have an HDMI input, and connecting a streaming device to it is just like connecting to an HDMI TV. But, since this doesn\u2019t go through the PC, you won\u2019t be able to watch it while working on the computer. In fact, you\u2019ll likely have to have the computer disconnected from the monitor. Another issue is sound. HDMI carries the sound signal to the monitor, but some monitors don\u2019t have sound, or the volume and quality is extremely poor. Some streaming devices might have RCA stereo jacks, but they may be disable when using HDMI. I have a Roku with a headphone jack in the remote, but this isn\u2019t a common feature. If you do buy a PC card with the HDMI in and out, you could connect your streaming device to it, and run the video through the computer. This would allow you to use the computer while watching in a reduced size window. The biggest issue with trying to use a PC tuner card is that laptops and all in ones don\u2019t have expansion ports, and I haven\u2019t been able to find any docking stations with hdmi in and out. The HDMI ports on laptops are strictly output, with no means of input, other than USB. ",

            "answer_text": "Most modern, high-end monitors come with only DVI and HDMI ports (some also have a Display port) but if it is a budget monitor or an older monitor, it would also have a VGA port. Almost all Set-top boxes have an HDMI output port on them, which can be connected directly to the monitor's HDMI port. If both devices do not have the same type of connectors, you will have to buy an appropriate adapter for the same. Now, HDMI carries both, Audio and Video signals in a single cable, so if the monitor has inbuilt speakers, this is the only type of connection you will need from your Set-top box to use it as a TV. If the monitor in question does not have in-built speakers, you are going to need external speakers for the setup. From the set-top box, assuming that it has RCA ports, connect the RCA cable (White only) to the speaker's RCA input port (White) if it has one. Otherwise, check if the set-top box has a 3.5 mm audio output jack to which you can connect your speakers\u2019 3.5 mm audio jack. ",

            "answer_text": "If your monitor has HDMI input and speakers, any of the streaming appliances will work well, including the Roku, FireTV, or Apple TV. If your monitor only has digital video input and no speakers, you can still use any of the streaming appliances as long as you deliver audio through an alternate path. If you plan to listen by headphones only, you can use a smartphone based headphone app, or a headphone enabled remote control. Make sure you choose a streaming device that supports this alternate audio channel. Some streaming devices will also stream audio to Bluetooth speaker. You can buy a device that extracts the audio channel from an HDMI cable for about $20. You can then direct the audio to some kind of speaker system. In the event that your monitor only has DVI input and not HDMI, you simply need to buy a cable that converts HDMI to DVI. Electrically, the signals are the same. If your monitor is VGA only, things get slightly trickier. You need to buy a relatively expensive HDMI to VGA converter, and one that extracts audio if you are not using alternate audio channels as described above. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. :) Well, most of the monitors presently come with an in-built HDMI port, and so do many of the Set-Top Boxes for e.g. Airtel DTH. If your monitor and Set-Top Box, both have an HDMI port then you can simply buy and HDMI Cable, it will hardly cost you around 200\u2013250 rupees from a local shop. Just plug in the HDMI Cable in the Set-Top Box and the monitor, then change the input option in your monitor to HDMI. Some monitors automatically detect HDMI but if yours doesn\u2019t, then manually change the input to HDMI. Now, if either the monitor or the Set-Top Box does not support HDMI, then your best bet would either be purchasing a TV-Tuner, but those things are pretty much out-dated now, so you can buy a VGA-to-S video wire. Every monitor has a VGA port in it.  This is what a VGA Port looks like. Now after purchasing the VGA-to-S video wire, the rest of the things would be simple, just plug in the VGA wire in the VGA port, and the Set-Top Box wires on the other side.  This is what a VGA-to-S video wire looks like. After connecting all the wires, you\u2019re good to go. :) Hope that helps ! Kudos ! :) ",

So the one end of the HDMI cable will plug into the \u201cIn\u201d HDMI port of the cable box, and the other end will be plugged into the Cable modem provided. Then there will be a HDMI cable plugged into the \u201cHDMI out\u201d port on the Cable box, and the other end of that cable will plug into your monitor. ",

In theory, most modern TVs accept input via HDMI, just like computer monitors. So, on paper, it should work. The doubts arise because I have never tried something so wacky before. By the grace of God I've always had a TV, and a seperate computer monitor, never needing to swap one for the other! Happy experimenting! ",

It depends on how big the monitor is but I guess you could just plug it into the cable so you could watch television or something else that is a better idea is to plug it into your laptop/computer and stream through there because there is not only more options as in either you could stream television with channels or just netflix.

There may be multiple other IPTV providers providing TV channels for free or for a paid subscription. This will, however, drain your internet data. If you want to go the other way round and want to connect a set-top box to your PC, you need to buy a Video Capture Card. Just search for the one you need on Amazon and you can view/record your set-top box content on your PC. My best opinion is to buy a cheap TV. TV prices have dropped to the bottom and the best part is that you can watch your PC content on the TV as well with just a simple HDMI or VGA cable. ",
