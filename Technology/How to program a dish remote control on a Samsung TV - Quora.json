            "answer_text": "Hi, You have to find the code of the Samsung TV and use it in the Dish remote control. There are step by step instructions online with Dish and Samsung. You may need to know the model of the Dish remote and the model of the TV as well. It can be a long process so try to have Dish do it first over the phone, then attempt it online yourself, and if that doesn\u2019t work, you can get a universal remote for both. Good luck! ",
