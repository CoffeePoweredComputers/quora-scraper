            "answer_text": "Just yet more hype from a bunch of liars. It's still nothing more than a driver's assist, it can't drive the car itself, and there will definitely be accidents. A child can drive on the highway, there's far less chance of an accident. In fact, but hen you practice driving, the DMV says to spend most of your time in moderate city traffic. So now they think the software program can handle the nut cases who break every driving law in the book? I better start driving my 13 ton truck again, so when some do with their toys run into it, I'll wonder if there's a road plate in the highway. I also have cameras all over my truck, so everyone will know who's fault it is. ",
