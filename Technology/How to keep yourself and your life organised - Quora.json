            "answer_text": "Organisation is actually easier then it seems. This is an area of expertise for me. First of all ask yourself this question do you want to have more free time in your life? Then in turn more time will allow less worry. If your answer is yes, and I'm hoping it is, you know time is more important, or at least as important to me anyway as money. First of all being organized in LIFE as you put it there are many areas when one refers to life. So I'll stick to some of the basics of being organized. First and foremost after using everyday things like tooth brush, hair brush, breakfast dish, towel well you get the drift put it away \u201cright after\u201d like NOW it only takes a few minutes to put everything you use in a day back. Have a notebook in a couple places for notes, don't bother with downloading apps on your dam cell phone for calendars and notes this only sets you up for failure because your sure to be messing around with the program, or waiting for it to download which takes more time and leaves less to get and stay organized. Just use the old fashion PEN AND PAPER. To write down what you need to get accomplished for the day and be sure and take in consideration on the day's of doctors appointments, or meetings, not to overbook yourself. Take the word procrastination out of your vocabulary. When it comes to paper work, and mail, color code folders and keep the ones you grab often closest, when you change your clothes put the ones you take off back in the drawers, closet, or hamper, again I can't stress enough that this is a 45 second task, but when you get in the habit of not doing it it's just going to be mentally draining and frustrating due to the time it takes to organize everything over and over again. (THE MAIL) Instead of having the dreaded paper trail at every turn in every room of the house, that most of it only contains junk mail anyway. Sort through it at the mailbox and throw everything you don't need away on your way back in. Simplify, simplify, simplify, now you don't need to keep the magazine you have already read twice, you don't need 10 different shampoo and conditioners laying around, or old makeup, or depending on your gender that oldspice someone gave you for Christmas three years ago. Keep things in piles that contain the same type things. Use old milk creates to for things you must keep but barley touch and put them in a closet somewhere. Do the dishes right after you eat before you even sit down because it's unlikely your going to go back to them. I buy different size plastic boxes in different colors from the dollar store to better organize things in drawers and under the sink items. I promise once you get yourself organized it's a win win situation, 1. You have more time because your using less of it getting pissed off looking for things. 2. You come home from a long day and you don't have to waist more time cleaning things because you put everything you used before you left away in there new easy to find color coded homes. After all's said and done you should only have to spend 20 minutes a day keeping it all together. Good luck and remember a clean organized home is a happy one ",

            "answer_text": "First and foremost since you have asked the question, you obviously feel there is a room for improvement. You want to be better than you are when it comes to organisation in your life. You start by thinking! De-cluttering your mind and looking at priorities for a successful way ahead. I have always stated a tidy mind leads to a tidy life. Look at areas you feel you are ok with and other areas which are holding you back and need improvement. You have to work on three essential dynamics: Being efficient - being orderly - being systematic. Once you master these three basic principles it should be plain sailing. Efficiency means being on top of things. Thinking ahead and having prior planning to events that are ahead. Being orderly means being tidy. Not only does this apply to your mind, it also applies to your body, your hygiene and daily habits, to the home, your place of study/work, and other areas of your life. Being systematic means adopting good principles and sticking to them. Finding a way that works and stick with it. Being methodical and quickly discarding the way that does not seem to be working for you. Being organised in life is a very simple process and once you have got the hang of it, it is simple. I know many people that are always late for appointments etc. and I do not understand why. Or actually I do - this is just a bad habit that they have got their mindset attuned to. In this age of mobiles and technology, there is not reason whatsoever for anyone not to know the time of something. It is just a case of becoming aware that it is an important aspect of your life to be on time, and work towards that end. No reason to have a messy home, or school desk, or work table. No reason to forget things, whether it be appointments, or shopping in the supermarkets, or to pick up your dry cleaning etc. To do lists stuck on a fridge with a magnet or post-it notes will make all this come together. Still keeping with the lists, write down everything. If you haved a dilemma and are procrastinating, write it down. Sometimes seeing it in black and white makes you come to a quicker realisation as to the way forward. Write down your goals - immediate and long term. Prioritise what you wish to achieve now and in the future. Keep a diary/calendar of every event manageable. Whilst you are building up your mindset to be organised as above, it is most important to remember that you really do not have to be a perfectionist. If one day you are not feeling up to things for whatever reason, it is alright to leave those dishes to the next day. Or cancel (and remember to cancel) that appointment you are really not in the mood to attend. We have to cut ourselves some slack sometimes, otherwise things can overwhelm and this is not a good situation to be in. Organisation is actually habit forming - in the same way as disorganisation is. If you are serious about it - it is really easy and most beneficial to come to terms with it. ",
