            "answer_text": "A OnePlus 8T-like camera bump on the back Leaker Max .J has created a simple sketch that shows off the OnePlus Nord N10\u2019s rear panel. The original oneplus nord featured a slim vertical camera bump in the top-left corner, but the Nord N10 will adopt a much wider module. It seems to have been inspired by the new oneplus 8T 5G which suggests the camera design could become the default option on all future oneplus phones, and should house four sensors. These include a 64-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle alternative, and two 2-megapixel sensors that may act as depth and macro cameras respectively. There\u2019s no word on the selfie camera yet.  Powering the OnePlus Nord N10 5G looks set to be Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 690 chipset coupled with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. These will sit alongside a 6.5-inch display with support for a 90Hz refresh rate. The Nord N10 5G should retail at \u20ac299 in Europe and under $400 in the United States. As for colors, Max J. believes it\u2019ll be available in Blue. SOURCE : phonearena ",

            "answer_text": "After the huge success of the OnePlus Nord, OnePlus is all set to launch the new successor of Nord that is N10 & N100. Oneplus Nord N10 5G & N100 are quietly making their way up the radar of leaks despite silence from the company's side. The company's official Instagram handle has not really broken anything apart from coming soon poster. This new tip reveals details including the display and the battery of the devices.  These specifications are from leaks and expected so once I get to know the original specification. I will update you! So jumping right in specifications according to the leaks; Display: 6.49-inch FHD+ With 90Hz Refresh Rate (no word if LCD or OLED) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 690 5G Memory: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Camera: 64MP+8MP+2MP+2MP Battery: 4300mAH  Pricing is still a mystery. However, judging from these leaked specs, it\u2019s reasonable to assume it will come in well under the \u20ac399 (~$472) price of the OnePlus Nord. ",
