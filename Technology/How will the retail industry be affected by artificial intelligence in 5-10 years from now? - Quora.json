            "answer_text": "Artificial intelligence is making its way into the retail industry in a big way. From 2013 to 2018, retail artificial intelligence startups raised $1.8 billion across 374 deals, according to a recent report by CB Insights. The flurry of activity is largely thanks to Amazon, which is forcing retailers to reconsider both their e-commerce and their physical store strategies to stay competitive. Amazon is expected to capture nearly half of all e-commerce sales and 5 percent of all retail sales by the end of 2018, according to eMarketer. So how exactly is A.I. changing the retail environment? Here are five of the most fascinating trends to watch from CB Insights' report. 1. Better shelf intelligence CB Insights reports that Whole Foods considered charging its top vendors around $300,000 for several weeks of prime shelf space. Even if you can pay for top billing in Whole Foods and elsewhere, you're still competing with many other brands for visibility. That's left an opening for a slew of startups to develop technology to track metrics like share-of-shelf and distribution. Computer vision platform Trax Retail analyzes what happens on physical shelves using images from in-store cameras, robots, or mobile phones to create a digital version of the physical store. Meanwhile, Walmart is already using Bossa Nova robots to monitor price tags and missing items on shelves. 2. Smarter beauty products In March, L'Or\u00e9al acquired augmented reality startup Modiface, a unique move for a traditional beauty company. Modiface helped L'Or\u00e9\u200bal launch its Style My Hair mobile app, which lets users virtually try on different hairstyles. (More recently, in August, L'Or\u00e9al partnered with Facebook to let customers show off their looks on the social network--and then click to the website to make a purchase.) Brands like Sephora and Est\u00e9e Lauder also use AR apps that allow customers try on different virtual make-up looks. Retailers can then analyze the data collected on face shape, wrinkles, and skin tone to better predict inventory needs. 3. The voice shopping assistant that never was In an interview with Billboard last year, Jeff Bezos said that \"voice interface is only going to take you so far on shopping.\" The Information reported that only 2 percent of Amazon Alexa users used the voice assistant to make a purchase this year, and only 10 percent of those were return shoppers. While e-commerce is growing, customers still prefer going to the store and seeing products in person. According to a report by the National Retail Federation, only 21 percent of people surveyed self-identify as primarily online shoppers, while 79 percent said they still buy at least half of the items they need in stores. 4. Cashierless stores could solve theft Since debuting its first cashierless store in Seattle in 2016, Amazon Go has expanded its footprint into Seattle, San Francisco, and, soon, New York City. Amazon has also encouraged other startups, such as San Francisco-based startup AiFi, to develop cashierless store technology, using artificial intelligence, cameras, and sensors. According to the National Retail Federation, shoplifting and paperwork error, among other things, cost U.S. retailers around $47 billion. CB Insights suggests that these new cashierless store models reduce the likelihood of stealing--they're loaded with cameras and automatically charge customers. Plus, the Go stores, which are a fraction of the size of a traditional supermarket at about 1,800 to 3,000 square feet, are currently restricted to Prime members only. To be sure, it's not at all clear that this \"grab-and-go\" technology will be adopted on a mass scale--at least not anytime soon. 5. Food delivery goes driverless In June, Kroger partnered with robotics startup Nuro to pilot autonomous grocery delivery service for customers. Pizza companies like Domino's and Pizza Hut also are testing the viability of autonomous vehicles. The race is on for tech companies to win the so-called last-mile delivery wars--and food businesses want to be the first in line to take advantage. In September, Amazon expanded its Whole Foods grocery delivery services, which can ship to customers' doors in as little as an hour, to 48 cities. Reference: Inc.com ",

            "answer_text": "How is it affected today? We are being tracked in ways most people don\u2019t realise. I once worked at a company who made it possible for retailers to snag your portrait from social media once you gave the retailer your email address. And that was 5 years ago. Now, your social activities \u2014 especially on Facebook \u2014 are being datamined to death. All sorts of pattern-detecting algorithms are being applied to your activities to determine what ads to shoot your way. I\u2019ve had the creepy experience of doing a search for a product on one Google account, and seeing ads for that very same product show up on my Facebook account running on a different Google login of my browser! I worked at another company looking to harvest ping request your WiFi-enabled mobile device does as it passes by access points, when it provides your MAC address to all of them\u2026 and such access points can and in many cases DO send your MAC address to a central database so your movements can be tracked. For this reason, Apple mobile devices will shift the MAC addresses regularly, but the Android devices don\u2019t, yet. You may be able to download an app on Android to do this, and it may also require you to \u201croot\u201d your phone. Haven\u2019t looked at this yet, so I don\u2019t know. So imagine you are a busy mom. You drop your kids off at school \u2014 and your phone pings the WiFi access points there \u2014 and then you go shopping for food \u2014 ping! \u2014 and you go to a nice hair salon \u2014 ping! \u2014 and then an upscale mall \u2014 ping ping ping!!! \u2014 You walk into a shop hooked in with this aggregation service, and they get a tip that you \u2014 or your mobile device \u2014is in in the shop, and a complete profile on you and what you are \u201clikely to buy\u201d. Maybe they have enough of an aggregate that they are able to pull up your picture. That is today. 5\u201310 years from now? Expect a lot more of the same. Data being aggregated about you from multiple sources, your identity being automatically deduced from such, and your location constantly being tracked. You might even see electronic billboard ads pop up targeting YOU as you walk or drive. You walk into a shop and the salesman seems to know a lot about YOU personally and what you might want to buy, how to sell you, and trying hard to hold back the fact he already knows your name! And that\u2019s the \u201cbenign\u201d side of things. How about what law-enforcement might do with this information? Or your ex\u2019s lawyer also taps into this? The system will never be perfect, so perhaps you\u2019re mis-identified? That knock at the door might be the beginning of the worst nightmare of your life due to no fault of your own. I hope I am wrong about this, but some of this is already happening. It will only get worse. In any case, your life will become even more of an open book. I recently discovered that Google has been tracking my movements through my smart phones since 2009, and yes, they do make these records available to you, if you know where to look. It was eerie to see how they tracked me travelling to various countries and the like. I allow them to do this, just so I can have my own record of my movements, but it is creepy just the same. And some retailer will be able to know that not only I like to travel, but where I\u2019ve been. For the past 10 years. The NSA and other various 3-letter agencies in the US obviously already have this information in hand, which might explain why I kept getting \u201cextra-special treatment\u201d while I was living there. They may have already fingered me as a \u201cperson of interest\u201d due to the countries I\u2019ve visited, etc. Again, that is today. What will that be like 10 years from now? Well, suffice it to say I do NOT want to be living in any country that does not value privacy. ",
