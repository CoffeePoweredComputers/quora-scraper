THE BEST GADGETS FOR YOUR CAR  We are currently in a time of unstoppable advances in all fields and sectors of our lives. The automobile, as we have already told you from The New Technologies, was not going to be less. For that reason, we would like to tell you in the following article which are the most demanded car accessories for the interior today. The most important thing about these 'gadgets' is that they are useful for the driver or passengers. They are not mere decorative accessories, but have an added value that is sometimes only appreciated when it is not available. Thus, among the tools for cars most valued in recent times is the browser. Taken as a luxury at the beginning, today is a must for any driver. The current GPS will not only tell you the shortest route between two points, but they are able to warn of fixed speed cameras, speed limits in each section or the state of traffic and roads.  Another of the car accessories for the interior are the radar warnings that use the information of user communities. Although it may seem shocking, these devices are completely legal, not like the inhibitors that could cost us a great dislike. Another tool for cars that we will value most is the so-called tire pressure gauge. It is true that at gas stations we have this service, but thanks to this novel gadget we can do it in our house with total comfort and prepare our trip in a more comfortable way. Nowadays, being connected with the rest of the world is one of the obsessions of society. We are stuck to our smartphone. However, when we go by car we do not always find a suitable place for him. The supports for mobile phones are one of the most demanded car accessories for the interior , as they will allow us to have it secure and access it to start, for example, the navigator.  Logically, if we started using it as GPS, the battery would be drastically reduced. That's why it never hurts to have a charger inside our vehicle. This way we will make sure that we will never be left incommunicado at the most inopportune moment. Since safety is also one of the obsessions in current driving, it never hurts to have a pocket breathalyzer. These small devices will allow to check if the driver is in optimal conditions to start the journey or if on the contrary it is better to wait a little. Lastly, among the most requested accessories or car spare parts in recent times is the portable fire extinguisher, which allows to extinguish small fires and avoid greater evils. ",
