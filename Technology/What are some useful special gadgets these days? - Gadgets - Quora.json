That\u2019s the idea behind the Nuraphone, which we first tested a few years back in headphone format. 2. Build Your Own Telescope Do you or the kids fancy a spot of astronomy but shudder at the idea of splashing out on an expensive telescope? The Build Your Own Cardboard Telescope kit is a neat way to get started at stargazing on a budget. 3. HyperX wireless gaming setup (cool gadgets) HyperX are big names in gaming peripherals (they even have their own esports arena in Las Vegas), so it\u2019s no wonder their kit maxes out on quality and features. Their suite of wireless gear doesn\u2019t disappoint. 4. Ember Mug and Travel Mug Nothing stirs the soul of a Brit more than the thought of a piping hot cup of tea. However, a cold and forgotten cuppa is practically an insult to Queen and country. The Ember Mug2 is a very elegant (if expensive), solution to this distinctly British problem. So here are some new useful gadgets. thank you ",
