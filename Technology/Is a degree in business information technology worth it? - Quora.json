            "answer_text": "I agree with Jim Coyle. I think the absolute worth as in\u2026\u201dWill I make enough to pay back college loans and live a good life too?\u201d is more than reasonable. But it\u2019s also probably not the path to being \u2018wealthy\u2019 or \u2018young and wealthy\u2019. For me there was no such degree to pursue when I was going to college but I have no doubt it would have been my choice if it were available at the time. Today I can\u2019t imagine spending all the hours I do, trying to maintain my interest in doing something else. I\u2019ve addressed a number of questions that relate to yours. They include: How should I learn information technology?Am I making a mistake by studying IT and not CS?Information Technology (college major)What will be the jobs in Information Technology in the next decade with a good outlook?Is it worth doing an MBA in information technology?",

            "answer_text": "I was working in IT for a long time before I ever considered getting a degree. The only reason I pursued it was because my director insisted upon it before granting me another promotion. It was his way of watching out for me. So I enrolled in night school and proceeded to earn my Information Systems degree. All on the company expense. I didn\u2019t pay a dime for my education and it was worth what I paid. At least, it was worthless to me in terms of knowledge about IT systems. Everything was very high level and useless to someone who put their hands on technology. On the other hand, it was an endorsement required by my employer and succeeding employers. I wouldn\u2019t have continued to rise in my career without that degree. I\u2019m not rich because of it, I\u2019m not better at IT because of it, but I make a good bit more salary because of it. ",
