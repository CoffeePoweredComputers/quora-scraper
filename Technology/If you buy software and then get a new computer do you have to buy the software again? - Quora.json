            "answer_text": "Like with all things computer related - it depends. If the software is about 5 years old or newer, then chances are when it was purchased it was done through the Internet and has a registration email attached to it. This makes it fairly easy to get the necessary registration information again if that has been lost. If the software is around 10 years old, then it will be necessary to find the registration key when the original purchase was made. If you can\u2019t find the registration key, then yes it will be easier to purchase the software again. Make backups this time! If the software is 15 years old or older, then registering the software to the new computer really isn\u2019t the main problem. The problem is will the software run on the new Windows Operating System? There are compatibility modes within Windows 10 that will improve the chances of the old software being able to run. Again, with everything computers, the details matter. Gather all your registration codes, purchasing emails, login information, and program DATA and back everything up. When you start up the new computer, start installing the older software packages one at a time. After one is installed, try registering it. If that doesn\u2019t work, then see if there is an updated version of the software that is designed to work in the new computer. If that doesn\u2019t work, or there isn\u2019t any, then see if the Windows compatibility modes will work. And if that doesn\u2019t work, then maybe installing the old operating system under a virtual machine and installing the software within the virtual machine will work. I wish there was an easy answer, but there isn\u2019t. Especially for Windows computers. Apple is a bit easier, meaning the software will work easily for up to 10 years without extra fiddling. If you are a Unix fan, then you don\u2019t have hardly anything to worry about (library issues notwithstanding), and you wouldn\u2019t be in here asking questions anyway. Companies spend millions of dollars hiring people to figure out how to move older software to work on the newer machines. Even if one can get the software to function, the problem isn\u2019t over. Now you need to be able to work with the old data. In most cases, it is simply easier to buy everything new (again) and make the old hard drive accessible (network or USB attached) to get at the old data. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I suspect that legally, most licensed software can be installed on a specific number of PCs as defined in the licence. Sometimes the licence may be rather vague about the legality of uninstalling from one PC and installed on a different one. I have a three PC licence for Microsoft Office 2007. Of the original three PCs it was installed on, two have been replaced. The original hard drives were thoroughly wiped before the PCs were recycled. I spent about 10 minutes talking to a very help guy at Microsoft who explained that what I wanted to do was legal within the terms of the licence, and when I explained what had happened to the drives on the old PCs, he provided new licence keys for the two replacement PCs. Whether you can transfer without problems depends on just how the licence is validated. Some software products use online registration and check whether a licence key has already been used. Some record some form of system ID as well. ",
