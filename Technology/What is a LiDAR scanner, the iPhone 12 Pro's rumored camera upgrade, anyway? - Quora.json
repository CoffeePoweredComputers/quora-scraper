What is its use, and how does it work? Regarding the advantage to the camera? It is expected to be used for depth perception, an important element in giving the bokeh or background blurring effect. Portrait mode will also reportedly benefit from it, but only on rear camera. If used properly, I think that such bokeh effect can be applied to videos too (which was previously not possible, as far as I think). Apple should be able to figure out an upgrade to the video recording features in this way. ",
