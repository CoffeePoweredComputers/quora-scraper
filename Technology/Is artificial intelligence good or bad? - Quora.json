I\u2019m not wondering why everyone\u2019s talking about the benefits of AI, most of us are astonished by the different ways that AI helps us in our daily life. Be it as simple as asking Siri to schedule an upcoming meeting or as intense as carrying out an automated robotic surgery with minimal/zero risk. But did you know that the same machine that aids mankind for the good is being used in equal or even more ways for harmful & dangerous activities? I believe there\u2019re many answers here that support the benefits of AI, so do I. But It is also important to know its dangers so that we can prepare for the future outcomes and utilize AI for good. Here are some dangers of AI that we should be worried about right now. Deepfakes: Deepfakes is considered one of the famous dangers of AI where technology is used for altering digital content to defame a targeted person usually a celebrity. A Deepfake AI application uses two components, namely a \u201cGenerator\u201d and a \u201cDiscriminator\u201d. The generator creates the fake video clip while the discriminator identifies whether the clip is original or fake. As the discriminator identifies the clip as a fake one, the generator \u201clearns\u201d where to improve for the next time. This system is called a \u201cGenerative Adversarial Network\u201d or \u201cGAN\u201d. In this system, not only the generator learns, but the discriminator to improves its algorithm to identify fake videos better every iteration. The risk of people believing in Deepfakes will persist until there is regulation upon such content. An example of a heated controversy is a video showing Donald Trump taunting Belgium regarding the Paris climate agreement. This calls to the governments to take measures to prevent deepfakes from being dangerous. Human-like Dos attacks: A denial of service attack is a cyber-attack where a cybercriminal prevents users from using a particular website/service/ application. It sends requests in large volumes which slows down the system. These attacks are usually sent from a single source. On the other hand, a distributed denial-of-service attack is sent from multiple sources that are coordinated. Cybercriminals infect computers connected to the internet with malware first which helps them form a botnet subsequently using it to launch a DDoS attack on a targeted system. Human-like DoS attacks use AI systems to launch attacks in which supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms play a vital role. Deploying cybersecurity systems with ML unsupervised algorithms might build an effective wall against these human-like DoS attacks. Spear phishing attacks: These are the most popular types of attacks by cybercriminals which persuade people to share sensitive information. They are usually combined with other social engineering attacks like site cloning which makes them look trustworthy. Emails, phone calls, SMS, etc. are the modes through which phishing attacks are carried out. It all starts from when a recipient clicks on a link sent by the hacker as it spreads malware. A spear-phishing attack is when an attacker focuses on a single target and sends a custom email/message. AI is being used to power these spear-phishing attacks and send personalised emails to a large number of people. Implementing Artificial Neural Networks would detect these automated spear-phishing attacks and make cybercriminals abandon their attacks. Swarm attacks: Swarm attacks are emerging to be one of the recent trends of cybersecurity threats. Cybercriminals enable swarm-based bots to collaborate and operate autonomously to pose attacks on a target. For example, Fortinet describes that in the context of swarm attacks, \u201cHivenets\u201d replace botnets, and are compromised devices using AI that helps target vulnerable systems. To prevent swarm attacks, there needs to be consistent cybersecurity across the ecosystem with automated cybersecurity to match the swarm intelligence. AI-powered drones and vehicles by terrorists: With an increased number of terrorist groups and activity in the world, the equipment that these groups use to spread terror is also undergoing continuous sophistication. Easy access to artificial intelligence makes the situation more complicated. Many technologies like UAVs, facial recognition and machine-to-machine communication are available to everyone. The thought that armed UAVs replacing suicide bombers for terrorist groups tells us how far can the risks of AI go when in hands of terrorist groups. Controlling this is only possible through regulation and framing anti-terrorism laws. Read Other 7 Dangers of AI: All the Dangers of AI everyone should know about. ",

            "answer_text": "I see only one of the two things happening.  Or  The danger of AI is real and it is something that has been spoken about by global technology moguls and visionaries time and again. Superior intelligences have a tendency to wipe out inferior intelligences. This we know. The question that begs to be answered is, how likely are we to end up with the first scenario as opposed to the second? Let\u2019s go over the current scenario and then talk attempt to about the future, shall we? The current scenario is that AI is helping psychologists predict Alzheimer\u2019s 6 years before actual diagnosis with 100% accuracy. It is helping radiologists diagnose cancer of almost all kinds at very early stages. Stages, where a life can still be saved. The current scenario is that AI is helping in other critical areas like security, education, human resource and making life easier and better for everyone. Of course, whereas on the other hand, AI is also bombarding you with a plethora of those annoying online ads that you swear seem to follow you everywhere (which you can argue drives value on the other side of the spectrum to people who benefit from it). There's Google Maps, that also tracks you as move around to apparently \u201cimprove your experience\u201d which of course is subjective to the permission you give the app. The same applies to Uber and Lyft. What I think, on careful consideration, is that while such episodes seem to be very creepy and potentially harmful, there\u2019s zero actual chance of them harming you. If we agree, for the sake of the argument, to consider those little episodes an annoyance or inconvenience rather than \u201charmful\u201d and look at the areas where AI is positively impacting the society and changing lives, I think we can say beyond reasonable doubt that in the current scenario, AI is not harmful to us humans. Alright. Where does that leave us? We are unofficially on a quest to mastering intelligence and creating silicon brains. In an experiment, Google recently used 16,000 processors feeding YouTube thumbnails as raw input and their deep neural network was able to identify features of what a cat looks like and what a human body looks like without the programers providing labels for what is supposed to be what in the data! The network was able to figure this out only on the basis on pattern recognition. The way we see.  The left image is what the network looks for to identify a cat and the right is what the what the network looks for to identify human presence in an image. Whether this is a step towards building a truly intelligent machine, we don't know. But as for the future, there\u2019s a question that needs to be addressed here. \u201cWhy do we need an AGI anyway? Isn\u2019t there a possibility of a model in the between of \u2018Narrow\u2019 AI and \u2018General\u2019 AI, the two accepted extremes?\u201d The problem with a true AGI, is emotions. Emotions make things messy. Even if you program in a \u201cmoral code\u201d into the AI, who\u2019s to deny Murphy\u2019s law? Who\u2019s to deny we won't eventually see an uprising, a revolt? But without emotions, without that ability to feel, it is unlikely AI will ever truly mimic or supersede human beings. It\u2019s intelligence may far surpass our organic computing power, but life is not a series of algorithms. The terrain we live within is meant to be grappled with and seduced. Missing that primary skill, it\u2019s hard to imagine a truly functional AI and it ensures that we still continue to live in scenario one (the first picture of the answer). That begs another question. \u201cAre intelligence and emotions inseparable? Does the presence of one beget another and vice versa? Or can one be achieved independently?\u201d That\u2019s unlikely too. Intelligence and emotion are the children of consciousness. They co-exist. Like electricity and magnetism. However, I think it is perhaps possible to ensure only one of those two characteristics dominate. Like a gorilla who can be argued to possess some rudimentary form of intelligence, but it is the emotions that we see it express that are more dominant. If we can find a way to eliminate or curb emotions from a machine, we will continue to live in scenario one and continue to benefit. This is all hypothetically considering that it is even possible to achieve artificial consciousness, of course.  Personally, I believe the best way to predict the future is to be the architect yourself. I think there is a way to extend \u201cNarrow\u201d AI that we have today to be broader and be more intelligent, more incisive, more dynamic and diverse without necessarily growing a conscious into it. I don\u2019t think we even know how to grow a conscious or whether it is even possible or whether it will ever be. So I am optimistic about scenario one and I work day and night to find ways to incorporate AI to benefit our community in innovative ways. I am positive about the amalgamation of human and machine to help solve problems of this world and uplift mankind as a whole. ",
