            "answer_text": "There is a recent video on YouTube with a 27,450 FPS high speed camera that shows many interesting things happening when an AK47 is shot underwater in a pool. Explanation from the video is as below. Try to figure it out before you view the video. Water in front of the barrel is pumped out at high velocity by the bullet. From Bernoulli's Equation, when velocity increases, pressure reduces and below a certain point water turns to vapour. This transition that happens very fast produces an effect called cavitation just in front of the guy's barrel tip. This water vapour area is turbulent and looks like a cloud. Soon the propellant of the fired round reaches this area and produces an expanding cloud-like bubble. As the bubble expands, it pushes the water around it outwards. As it expands, its pressure drops but the water around it keeps moving outwards due to inertia and soon the pressure drops below that of the water surrounding the bubble. This bubble then collapses as water around it rushes back to squeeze it back until the pressure once again increases too much. This produces a cloud-like bubble that expands and contracts and expands again. Further to the front as the above is happening, the bullet pushes the pool water out of its way and again cavitation occurs behind the path of the bullet but this area of water vapour is moving in a laminar condition rather than the turbulent barrel water above. So this pool water vapour seems like a smooth, shiny plasticky bubble rather than the cloud-like barrel water in front of the barrel's tip. All these happens just before the bullet falls to the pool floor after labouring some 4 feet. Be sure to catch the video.  ",
