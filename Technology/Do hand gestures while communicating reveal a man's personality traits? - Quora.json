            "answer_text": "Hand gestures speak a lot about an individual's personality. There are two basic rules with hand movements: open hand movements indicate confidence, clarity and approachability in a person while closed hands indicate containment of sorts. Let me list down some significant hand gestures and related personality types: Palm facing gestures -  this person is usually honest, clear and confident of what he/she says. The believability factor increases when you listen to someone with an open palm gesture. Steeple - there are different kinds of steeple movements. A forward steeple indicates that you are progressive, dynamic and an opportunist. This is a very neutral hand movement used by leaders. An upward steeple shows that you are a thinker , analytical and a decision maker. Any hand gestures on or close to the face usually indicate nervousness or tension so avoid rubbing your face, nose, eyes or forehead temples when tensed. You are making it very obvious to others around you. Hands behind the back- this gesture too has many variations. Holding ones wrist exhibits power and authority. But if one hand is behind the back and the other is gripping the elbow or going above,  then the person indicates anger and restlessness. So these are some of the examples to prove that hand movements can make or break one's personality so be careful while using them. Having mentioned that,  it is extremely important to use hand movements to support ones statements. People with a strong body langauge are by default considered more enterprising than those who avoid expressing non verbally. www.yourimageandi.in ",
