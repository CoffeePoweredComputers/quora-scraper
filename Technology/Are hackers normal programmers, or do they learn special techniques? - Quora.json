            "answer_text": "There are many varieties of \"hackers\" and that's ignoring the original use, that describe people like Richard Stallman, who have nothing to do with what \"normal\" people now call hackers. Anyway, ignoring that digression, there are hackers that know almost nothing about programming except how to run preprogrammed attacks. These are called \"script kiddies\" and the preprogrammed attacks they run are \"scripts\". There are also hackers who write malware. Many of them are essentially garden variety programmers. They write code that uses \"exploits\", bits of code that take advantage of some weakness in the system being attacked to allow the program to get access it wouldn't normally have. There are also hackers that look for new exploits. There is an equivalent for them called \"penetration testers\". These kind of hackers do have techniques that are slightly different from normal programming, although much of what they is akin to debugging, finding out why a program breaks, although the goal is to use that to find a way past security not to fix it. There are many others, but that should give you a rough idea that hopefully answers your question. ",

            "answer_text": "Hacker is a very general term that includes government Information Security analysts (infoSec) working for the CIA, NSA, FBI, and any other three-letter acronym you might think, the Russian threat to undermine the democratic process, the Anonymous movement, all the way to the kid with his android cellphone that hacks his school information system and changes the C to an A. Hackers work alone or in groups, think \u201cMr. Robot\u201d. Hackers like any other sub-group of the information world, as is noted in other posts, have the same qualities as most information specialists. They can be good or bad, intelligent or the other thing, lazy or driven. The two qualities, in my opinion, that make or break a good hacker are the curiosity to explore and the ingenuity to think outside the box. I will give an honorable mention to the will to succeed where others have failed. I say this because hacker types always want the credit for the hack. It\u2019s the abacus of the hackers reward system. The hacker designation is not their core values, but the way they see how the hardware, softare, human interface, policies, procedures, and other component of the information world we live in. They are the demolition experts and safety engineers of the computer world. They see the columns and cracks and holes in the skycraper to determine where the weeknesses can be found and then put in the RDX and bring it to the ground. These are Blackhats, or unethical hackers (don\u2019t get hung up on morality). Blackhat\u2019rs have a purpose and good or bad, eventually clean up the crappy information systems in the world. Whitehats, or ethical hackers, are the safety engineers. They take the new plans and by studying the blue-prints(computer code, hardware, interfaces, etc) and plug any gaps in security that were missed prior to construction. Penetration testers are also included in this category and they do the security remodelling. In systems already deployed and in the world today, Pen-testers go in with their blackhat bag of goodies and ethically hack, crack, crash, disable, and \u201csteal\u201d from their employers to find all the vulnerabilities that a true Blackhat would find and use to compromise the trust of the employer and drain the financial resources of the company. As far as techniques and skills, the best hackers have a solid mastery of core languages, C, C++, and base code of the machines they are trying to compromise. As languages become more transparent and higher fuctioning, the knowledge of lower level languages becomes necessary when flaws in the operation of hardware components is required and the fundamental operation of the physical layer needs to be accessed(think computer controlled security access doors). Using machine code, the fundamental rules of operation can be altered like open, close, lock, jam, lock in open position. Languages and systems are easy to learn. Any good linguist can pick up a new language or dialect, just as any good hacker can pick up Php or Python and hack using the rules of that language. Anyone can hack, but only the gifted can walk through walls, be invisible, and get in and out before anyone knows they are there. ",

            "answer_text": "The hack is the end, anything in between is the thrill. Hacking is basically a special purpose mental exercise which can be learned by anyone (with or without formal education) with a sound foundation in programming, networking, computing, electronics, or combination of two or more of these disciplines. I included the words \u201cspecial purpose\u201d because no one knows everything but people can be really good in their areas of interests. Programming is not a prerequisite but a strong passion for new ideas and things is. There is nothing special about these techniques unless you\u2019re the original proponent of the technique. The rest are mere innovators implementing it in different areas of disciplines and scenarios. Failure is routine and success is rare and only a few can claim being the first to do it. That is why you shouldn\u2019t give a damn where your class or skill level lie. People who call others \u201ckiddies\u201d are basically insecure people who don\u2019t understand how things work in real life. Their idols, these so-called experts that they embrace and follow were once beginners too. Never underestimate or downplay other people\u2019s skills or interests, not even a kid. Because all that is required to qualify is to be in the zone, for a long time. The tools, the mentors, and the knowledge are available for free to everyone in the Internet. ",

            "answer_text": "Most programmers are not hackers, because they paste code modules together in a manner that validates functional tests, and even if they add some extra code and test cases for security/performance/extensibility, this is secondary. The programming approach of a hacker is all about maintaining complete control; every data input is untrusted and every system call\u2019s documented error conditions are handled\u2014a hacker will go into the weeds, questioning if a compiler has been validated to emit the proper machine language code, and will produce verification tests for things which a \u201cnormal programmer\u201d will simply assume. Naturally if somebody were to interest a great hacker into examining code she did not create herself, she will scrutinize it for undocumented \u201cfeatures\u201d that may be useful to perform operations unthought of by the initial programmer. So if a hacker were doing programming, you can rest assured that instead of simply using open source components, the hacker would validate that all dependencies, down to the last bit of code included, was free of known vulnerabilities. We need more hackers. Good ones. Ethical ones. Most code has flaws that are obvious to a hacker. Hackers are not normal programmers. The special technique of questioning and validating assumptions is what sets us apart. ",

They are about understanding how computers and networks work in the real world, where people make mistakes that can be exploited, and how to use the tools that find and exploit those mistakes. Some people do need to program to make the tools, but it's not that many. Most hackers do eventually learn mediocre Python just from being around it so much. At many major tech companies, Security Engineer is a separate job role from Software Engineer. For some of these roles programming is not required at all. ",

In fact most famous hackers in history had very little to do with computers (and more about telephone systems and making people do what they want them to do). But Hollywood wanted to portrait hacker as certain type of people and mostly connected to computers because for a long time computers has been mysterious and boooo stuff. Yes, computers may be used as a tool, but hacking has always been a technique to do the things in alternative and unexplored ways. It may be done on computers but hacking can be done in many engineering, life and other fields - basically everywhere where there is some rule set or system to explore (including exploring people) and alternative ways to do it. Computer hackers are also wide group from soldiers to kids - meaning hacking has been employed for cyber-war (countries involved or not), for industrial espionage (and all sorts of commercial needs and espionage even on all of us), for various sorts of crime, for political reasons, against political reason, and of course hacking done from idealistic reasons (some cause or belief) or just and simply for curiosity or fun. Good or bad \u2026 it is constant and opinionated debate often explained completely wrong. My belief is that hackers are born, not made. But you can learn some of it if you want to dedicate your time to it. ",

They tinker into already made works in places that have no known design function to see if they can make it do things they want it to do. This is deep because your consciousness is the determining factor of how well and capable you are. Do you remember that kid that was obsessed with playing around things to find new ways of getting what they wanted? Wozniak actually changed the function of the pieces he was manipulating in his desire and intention to meet the needs of a desired system. It is a great accomplishment that tinkerers and engineers can do to remake the world around them. To those that subscribe to materialism which denies consciousness this all sounds like gibberish except they cannot explain how plant roots energized by the sun are able to change toxins in the soil into inert different elements. That is something solid atoms are only suppose to be able to do inside stars. They will never question their ideas so it is something they just ignore like reality. ",

Generally programmers are building something up, (a website, infrastructure, operating systems, etc\u2026), a hacker is attempting to exploit what others programmers have built. The hackers programming skills come into play when writing exploits or modifying exploits that someone else has built. The knowledge also comes in handy when viewing the code you want to exploit because you will have at least some knowledge on how code works. Hackers may not be as well versed in programming as someone who does it full time because a hacker may only need to know some scripting to get by. Programming is only one of the skills that hackers learn. Hackers will have a lot of knowledge of other aspects of tech, like networking architecture and setups. ",

Grey hat hackers hack for a different purpose, these will hack into computer systems then tell the owners of that system how they hacked in and how to better secure their systems.

I would say you need more knowledge to penetrate security and bugs than a general engineer as you need to fully understand how the bug, gap, loop, or whatever you are attacking works to manipulate it to do what you want and not just how to patch it like a standard engineer would.

Now, you can break things without knowing how they were made/created. But if you know how that \u201csomething\u201d was made/created, you might know/learn the disadvantages of the way it is created (let's say flaws/vulnerabilities).

Further simplifying : It's not necessary that hackers are programmers, but knowledge of programming definitely makes a hacker\u2019s life easy (generally speaking). Consider it as another bullet point in skills list on hacker's resume. Cheers! ",

Example: on php + SQL is an exploit of inputs that use SQL queries and so an user can just get all emails from a database or delete users table and more. I think i don't have permission to explain in details hacking metods but what you must know is \u201cImagination + programming (can be) = hacking\u201d. ",

Hackers use a variety of tools that dont require programming. Black hat hackers (unethical hackers\u2026.that steal credic card info and the likes) generally combine some general knowledge with a lot of social engineering. Programming is helpful in higher level applications however. ",
