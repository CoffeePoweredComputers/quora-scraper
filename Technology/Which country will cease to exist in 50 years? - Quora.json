North Korea, I mean how long can a recluse \u201ckingdom\u201d continue this nonsense well into this century? It worked well during the 20th, but with the exponential technology growth we\u2019re sure to see in the 21st century, I can\u2019t see how it can be avoided. An independent Taiwan also is a candidate for vanishing as a sovereign state. With China on the rise economically/militarily/nationalistically, it\u2019s probable she could be \u201cabsorbed\u201d into China proper. That is of course if China itself doesn\u2019t come apart at the seams. Lotsa oppression happening there, mostly along ethnic lines. Iraq is a definite on this list. It was artificial to begin with. It seems created by the British over a game of beer pong with zero regard for the deep ethnic and cultural differences of the people there. I also don\u2019t see a Palestinian state ever truly existing,(another brilliant British idea), but I am on the fence with this one. On one hand they have a shot so long as they renounce and repel Israel\u2019s right to exist. If they stay their current course and continue to not accept reality? It\u2019s bye bye Palestine. (Just threw it in there because I feel the Palestinian peeps deserve their own nation). I think pretty much the map would remain the same from here on out save for a border shift here and a reunification there. ",

Some due to political reasons both internal and external, For a country to break first there should be an internal conflict and inept and corrupt govrnence. if such country has a very powerful , big, enemy country waiting to breakup that country it will breakup fast]. Countries like UK, Spain, Canada may break up in a very democratic and peaceful way with mutual consent. North koreaSrilanka, Afghanistan may breakup anytimebecause of ehnic devide, a history of civil war etc. All countries with large KURD population concentrated in some large and contiguous region and suffering didcrimination for long may break up . .The fight against ISIS has given lots of arms, resources. training to Kurds THEREFORE. countries exploiting them and where there was fight for kurdisatan should now be cautious Pakistan is in third category. when it is vulnerable with internal conflict India may break it. Huge countries with large resourcesl break only if a civil war breaks out. The resourcful govt forces win and crush separarist forces,in those civil wars.Insurgencies are at best a nuisance to those countries ",

India seems to have some of the same problems as the US with its political parties. Maybe the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). The ethnic problems there keep continuing. Of course, a breakup of a country is rarely peaceful; Czechoslovakia and the USSR were exceptions. The more common way to break up is a la Yugoslavia, with a bunch of wars. Just my $0.02 ",
