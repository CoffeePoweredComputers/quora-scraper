            "answer_text": "As to your first point, it will be a long time before it's quicker to print out a weapon than it is to find one. An angry enough person might start throwing chairs or grab a baseball bat or something, but they're not going to sit down and print out a weapon to use. As to your second and third points, I think you're over-estimating the impact of 3D printing. It's about as much a threat to the manufacturing industry as the invention of computer printers was to the publishing industry. Yes, in theory we could get ahold of the data file for a book we want, print it out, bind it and use that instead of buying a book, but how many people do you know who do that? 3D printing allows for rapid prototyping of some shapes if you don't need any particular materials or high structural strength. Even for things made completely out of rigid plastic, it will probably always be cheaper to mass-produce parts than it is to print them out one by one. And the designs for the really good stuff won't be open source, it will be owned by the companies who produce them. 3D printing might affect companies that make individual, custom-designed parts on an individual basis. That's pretty much it. Other than that, the affect on the global economy is probably going to be pretty minimal. ",
