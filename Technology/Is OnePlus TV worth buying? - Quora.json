            "answer_text": "OnePlus made an entry into the TV segment last year with two of their products, namely; OnePlus TV Q1 and OnePlus TV Q1 Pro. These TV\u2019s flaunted some really high-end specifications but along with that it also carried a sky touching price tag. Even with the inclusion of high-end features, the TV\u2019s could not do very well owing to the prices of the same because a very few less expensive alternatives were available. Therefore, OnePlus is rumored to make a re-entry into the tv segment with a fresh look, a fresh start with an all-new fresh product.  Yes, OnePlus is all set to bring their affordable TV\u2019s into the market. They are going to be launched soon and this time they are rumored to be priced perfectly. They are going to come with a price tag of something under Rs.20,000. There have been numerous leaks with regard to this product that has been surfacing online and the company has also officially teased the launch of the new OnePlus TV 2020. We have a few details on the features of the TV, however it is imperative to know that nothing regarding these features are confirmed yet, therefore changes are likely. The launch date of the OnePlus TV has been announced by the CEO and it is scheduled for 2nd of July. The company will be launching two OnePlus TV models which will be 32-inch and 43-inch.  The OnePlus TV is likely to come with a bezel-less display with 4K resolution. Some other features such as HDR, and Dolby Atmos will also be available on the TV. There is a huge speculation going around regarding what processor support would be used for these upcoming TV\u2019s. Now the tv\u2019s prior to these had MediaTek chipset equipped in them, therefore there is a high possibility of the same chipset being used, which honestly is a pretty good deal. Since MediaTek chipsets are already highly appreciated for their performance and speed, and they do power over 70% of all TV\u2019s globally. With the new TV\u2019s OnePlus aims to further enhance their OnePlus connected ecosystem experience. As per claims from the company, they believe that with the new products, it will re-define the premium experience in their respective price points by providing unparalleled experience, coupled with best-in-class displays and premium design.

            "answer_text": "One Plus has made quite the name for itself in the smartphone market with its feature enhanced devices. They soon ended up venturing into other forms of electronics like Television - OnePlus ended up releasing its OnePlus TV Q1 and the OnePlus TV Q1 Pro in September 2019 with the price point of around 70k and 1lakh respectively. They released their OnePlus TV Q1 with a bunch of solid features. It has a 55-inch display with 3840x2160 60Hz VA-type QLED, 120% NTSC coverage, local dimming, Dolby Vision support. 50W 2.1 motorized soundbar, 8 speakers, Dolby Atmos support. It weighs 24.2kg with the stand and has the MediaTek MT5887 chipset. It has 2.5 GB RAM and 8 GB storage. The software in this device is Android TV (9.0), OxygenPlay launcher, Google Play support, Chromecast built-in, Google Assistant. Smart TVs are quite the rage at the moment - a device which can change the entire digital and entertainment experience. The OnePlus TVs support Dolby Vision and sound formats up to Dolby Atmos, along with support for HDR10 high dynamic range format. These TVs can be effortlessly integrated with OnePlus mobile devices in order for consumers to indulge in a smarter TV viewing experience. OnePlus TVs also have Oxygen Play - which is a one-stop store for all the content requirements of the consumers. These smart TVs are also easier to control with the combination of the OnePlus Remote and the OnePlus connect Apps. This will allow users to enable advanced interactions by connecting their OnePlus smartphone with their OnePlus TV. OnePlus has also designed the remote in a minimal way so that users do not get lost in the maze of buttons that came in the remote controls of the traditional tv systems. Overall, the OnePlus TVs are pretty decent and personally speaking as a consumer I think it would be more beneficial if one goes for the Q1 instead of the Q1 Pro cause honestly, except for the price there isn\u2019t much difference feature-wise between the two.
