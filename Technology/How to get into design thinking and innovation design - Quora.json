            "answer_text": "Excellent question. The great thing about design is that experience counts. The earlier you can get started and learn from the projects you do the better. A couple of these answers are a great starting place and to add to those, here are some thoughts. Do your own projectsAs you asked, how would you start to build a portfolio, the answer is get started.  There are three primary stages to the process of design. Design thinking isn't a process but rather a mindset or set of ways of being. The process I describe still demands a design thinking way of being. The stages of the process are Research, Concept and then design. [see this for an illustration of the process: That Squiggle of the Design Process] Starting small: You can start three different types of projects that focus on each area, building skills and experience in those, as well as one for the entire process. For instance, working on prototyping is a good skill to build. Sketching, making and iterating is an important part, so giving yourself tasks to do there is a good step. Research projects are also good. How do people use public spaces during lunchtime differently from on weekends? Taking pictures, making notes and pulling interesting observations from your inquiry to develop your own point of view. This is also a very good area to get strong in. Finally, perfecting your craft, whether you're an illustrator, graphic designer or user experience/product design. Look at things you could improve through design and redesign them simply from your own instinct. How might the online DMV experience be improved? Make these projects small enough to do in just a few steps so that you get the chance to complete things and do more. Try to take on too much and you could experience a dip in confidence and bail before accomplishing your goal. Think of them as weekend projects, something you could start and complete in two days. A complete design process (design thinking) project: This is where you put all the three stages together, to begin with understanding your problem, coming up with ideas to solve the problem and through prototyping and iteration, landing on a final design. Take a look at Daylight Design's rather good explanation of 'what is design thinking?' What is Design Thinking? Even though it might bring confusion to my explanation of the term Design Thinking, it is a great overview of the steps you take within the design process. Now design your project. What do you want to look at? What interests you? Stay away from focusing on apps. This is where you know the solution is an app and so you're working backwards to run essentially a user experience design process. Focus on human behaviors and beliefs. Think of something that is observable. Reimagining the cinema experience. Or how might 'we' (royal we) establish better recycling habits at home. Take a look at OpenIDEO online for good challenges, which is where I took that recycling one from. As an aside, it would be good to sign up and have a go on there too. Once you have your problem prompt. Narrow it down to the person you're interested in. So that it is possible for you to focus your research. So you might write that you're interested in recent graduates looking for work. Or high-school students using technology for homework. Where you're beginning any project with a lack of real understanding or empathy for whom you're to design for and you're going to dive in to change that. The beginning part of the process can be filled with uncertainty and a lot of noise as you embark on learning more about the space you're interested in. A good book to read here would be John Kolko's Exposing the magic of design. And download the IDEO Design Thinking for Educators toolkit. Also check out Development Impact and You and find the 'collect inputs from others' section within their tools category. There you'll find some additional methods for design research. There are many books you could read but getting started is key here. The key to getting started is to list out all the questions you have about the users/customers or people you want to learn about, as well as their world and interactions or connections. Then organize those questions into how might you get answers to them. From an expert, from observing them, from secondary research... And so on.  Once you've collected all of your research you'll want to begin synthesizing it. Which is a tough thing to learn in isolation. Ideally, you'd try to find a mentor here in the form of a design anthropologist or ethnographer. Someone who can give you some guidance depending where you are with organizing your research. Perhaps you've labeled themes or patterns already but you're now trying to extract insights or frameworks.  Invite someone to help you at this synthesis stage. Pick someone you trust but also who thinks a little differently from the way you do. Share with them the stories of the people you observed or interviewed. Share interesting articles and anything of inspiration. The help needed here is to make sense of your research so far. Where are the patterns or themes? Are there clusters of observations that can be labeled as an insight or theme? A good essay worth reading is Why is a good insight like a refrigerator, by Jeremy Bullmore from WPP. [ Why is a Good Insight Like a Refrigerator? ] If you don't invite someone to do this part it might end up feeling like a serious pit of an overthinkathon. Where you are unable to direct yourself very easily. So structure your time in short blocks and perhaps give yourself the false deadline of imagining you have to present all this to a client. In reality, you're doing this project for your portfolio so you may end up actually showing this work to someone. John Kolko's book is also a useful read for this part of the work. But there aren't a lot of decent resources for synthesis. Perhaps someone else will be able to add to this. IDEO's toolkit will also be useful for progressing through this part. Then, after synthesizing your research and having made sense of the are of interest, you should be able to set yourself prompts for coming up with ideas. Ideally you'll frame your brainstorming prompts as questions, How might we... because you want questions that encourage the generation of many ideas. If you ask, what is a good way to... then you might self edit what is good before even exploring what the idea might be. On the OpenIdeo recycle challenge there is a 'brainstorm in a box' pdf which would help you with examples of how to create the prompt as well as how to frame an idea you are interested in. [ How might we establish better recycling habits at home? ] Brainstorming is hard to do alone. Like synthesis it can help to involve others. Alternatively, you may have a natural ability to do this on your own. One of my former IDEO colleagues is a brainstorm magician. He can drop into any scenario and run off dozens, if not more, ideas onto post-its without needing others to feed his imagination. It's a wonderful thing to keep your mind fertile like that. I haven't read it but perhaps the Kelley's latest book Creative Confidence can help with this. Look to generate dozens of ideas. And then see if multiple ideas put together might add up to a larger and more substantial idea that interests you. One or two of these would be what you take forward to develop a prototype out of. I'd recommend using paper and pencil (or ink) as much as possible in this process. The act of making with your hands is a powerful way to learn and think. Learn what really is possible, about how to communicate what your idea is and think through details that you have not yet had the chance to solve. The second part of prototyping is to put it into the hands of the people who would be using it. Early on. Even if it is rough. You'll learn a lot not just by how they react but by the questions they might have, the assumptions they make about how it works and if you've answered the question you started with. Iterate on your prototype as much as you can before you nail down the design direction you want to go in. On OpenIDEO (I am a fan, but really it is the best example here of the work within the process) you can see how ideas are presented: [ Less - make recycling a social and collective effort. Update, May 10 ] and it would be good practice to do the same here. If you're feeling pretty capable then perhaps you'll want to go further and make a movie of how your idea might work in action. You could go as far as to do something like how Daylight Design showed a vision of Health Information enabling wellness: [ Future of Health Information ] or Berg's Mag+ work [ Mag+ - Projects - BERG ] or their incidental media / media surfaces work [ Media Surfaces: Incidental Media ]. Or you can create an animation. Screens, photos or whatever you feel tells the story of the problem, the value of your solution, how it provides the benefit you were looking to do and the outcome. To wrap up your project, you should create a story of your project. Essentially a documentary of it. IDEO.org | Home has a deliverables section on their site which show very good examples of how to tell the story of your project. [ IDEO.org | Deliverables ] Should you do this, all of the above, you'll have done something that few do outside of going to a class on design thinking or getting a job. And so you'll stand out for having embarked on this yourself. What is important to know is that each project is a learning experience in itself as you'll learn things like, how to ask better questions in interviews through suffering from not asking questions that prompted stories. Or what methods work in making sense of research, or even the parts of the process you enjoy more than the others. So use the design process, and the mindset of design thinking on yourself to constantly ask yourself what works, what doesn't, and what else could I use or do instead. There are many resources available to you, many are free. Buying books works as well as downloading toolkits, or following some of the online resources I shared here. Innovating for People from the Luma Institute is a good and lightweight resource, just as the HCD Toolkit from IDEO is too. For a better and more advanced look at design, reading Journals like Design Issues from MIT or checking out Design Anthropology publications is worth doing. Sonic Rim in San Francisco (not knowing where you are based) offers a whiteboard Friday session which is open to the public, from time to time, and they are a very very good design research firm. Ask professors at schools who teach the design process or design thinking stuff for their course list and reading lists, and offer to intern for consultants, or consultancies. Ideally once you've started your own projects. You want to be able to show you know how to gain real empathy for those you're designing for and that you can turn your research into strong insights which drove your ideas, which you then could turn into interesting prototypes or concepts. I recommend checking out Don Norman's work and writings. In particular there's an important paper on Incremental and Radical Innovation. Which you can find here: Incremental and Radical Innovation: Design Research versus Technology and Meaning Change I have a course reading list somewhere, which when I find I'll post up here. Good luck. And jump in. You'll enjoy it. ",

            "answer_text": "The similar question that comes into most people\u2019s minds is this: \u201cIs design thinking really applicable in business?\u201d The answer is yes, it is adopted by big corporations like Apple, Coca-Cola, Proctor & Gamble, and IBM and it can lead to extraordinary results. This is because, at its backbone, design thinking can help come up with strategies and initiate organizational changes. However, most people dismiss or underrate design, thinking that it is simply about \u201cwhat something looks like.\u201d But in fact, the principles of user experience comprise three components: how a product looks,how it feels, andhow it works.Before implementing design thinking, you have to understand one thing: Design thinking is not an individual effort, it involves collaborations between marketing managers, professionals, and business owners, as well as the users. So, with that said, here is an outline of how to solve complex tasks using design thinking: Design Thinking Demystified: Business Models  First, you should employ empathy. This is the development of a deep understanding of the human needs that are in play. The next step is to look at problems from a new light by involving human-centric methods. Ensure that you come up with multiple ideas during the sessions. Next, come up with a prototype, which is a miniature version of the new product or feature. Finally, carry out rigorous tests on the finished product or feature, and make changes where necessary. ",
