            "answer_text": "No. Some people will use obviously Kotlin instead of Java, but the coding in Java is quite established. Even if all people would love Kotlin and will write all code in Kotlin (they wouldn\u2019t but just to imagine), most popular JVMs don\u2019t optimize for Kotlin generated bytecode, which in turn will make Java (which has a reputation of being a bit slow) apps to be snappier. At the end: Kotlin promotes also a bit slower code as their stream implementation is slower than the raw Java Streams introduced in Java 8. Kotlin\u2019s filter method would generate a new collection, when the JVM may not generate more than some transient objects but no collection at the end. Even if you exclude this: some companies have 15 years old Java coders (or 20 years experienced): even transition is relatively easy, quite few things are changed, so you cannot throw a Java developer in a Kotlin codebase. So why change them if they are good at Java? What about IDEs? Or toolchains that don\u2019t support Kotlin? What about your bytecode obfuscator that may work suboptimal on Kotlin\u2019s bytecode, so it makes it easy to reverse engineer your app? (disclaimer: I work on a company that does some type of JVM bytecode obfuscator, but I don\u2019t work on that project). There are many moving pieces so people don\u2019t switch just because a language is fancier. As a personal story: I don\u2019t use Kotlin as the advantage is too small (especially from Java 12 with \u2018var\u2019 keyword, nullability check is important, but it is not such of a big deal), and it is decreasing. Though I know that my maven project would work in Netbeans if someone is currageous enough to work on it. So no, but for some people, even I grant that Kotlin is a nicer and definitely a safer language to work with. ",
