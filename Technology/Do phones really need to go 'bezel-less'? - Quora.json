            "answer_text": "Definitely not\u2026 I believe it\u2019s more of matter of style / fashion and a trend\u2026 To be clear, let\u2019s go through some of the pros and cons of bezel-less phones Pros : The phone looks greatBezel-less phone would have a \u2018slimmer\u2019 size when compared to phones with a bezel that has the same screen sizeIsn\u2019t it beautiful? (I\u2019m being a bit sarcastic here)Cons : Bezel-less phone\u2019s screen are likely less than 2 mm away from the sides of the phone, holding it casually may lead to accidental touchesLess protection, as any impact to the sides would most likely have a stronger effect to the display assembly rather than phones with bezels due to the nearly non existent space between the sides of the phone to the display assemblySide buttons would also have a chance to break the display assemblyCapacitive buttons (the ones at the bottom / chin of the phone are no more and replaced with on screen buttons which would take up screen real estate although arguably they can be hidden when not neededYou wouldn\u2019t want to accidentally drop your phone on any hard surface like\u2026 the floor\u2026Protective accessories like bumper cases, silicon cases, and a whole lot of other cases are either too thin to be protective or too thick which would defeat the purpose of having a bezel-less phoneAll of the above are however, just an opinion, based on my own preferences\u2026 If you want to swing that way, feel free to do so\u2026.

            "answer_text": "The smartphone industry is maturing to the point where the variety in the current options on the market is closing. The cheaper phones are going to start to get closer and closer to what the highest end iPhone is capable of and there\u2019s no stopping that. Smartphone manufacturers have to figure out new ways to push the envelope in terms of new features because of this. Bezel-less phones are one of the products of this pressure on the industry. It\u2019s a feature that some have expressed interest, but will push all manufacturers into following in the same way that the notch has come (and hopefully will go soon). So, they don\u2019t really need to be bezel-less, but they definitely will be because that\u2019s the way that the mobile smartphone industry is currently trending towards. ",

As far as I'm concerned, I'm only interested in actual advances in technology where phones are concerned, but many people are more interested in making a fashion statement. To notch or not to notch, bezel or bezeless? Whatever floats your boat. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think soBezels offer at least some protection to the screen at some angles during dropsThinner bezels look aesthetically pleasing, offering placement for key sensors as well as the camera, as the technology to place these underneath the screen is not available to the consumer marketGoing fully bezeless may look nice, but offer no real practical use. I think most people would prefer at least some bezelsIt\u2019s interesting to see where display technology will head in the next 5 - 10 years\u2026.Meanwhile, here is what I think is the biggest breakthrough so far with regards to pushing towards bezel-less vivo NEX S Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "Phones these days do a lot compared to the previous generations. Producers hold the interest of consumers by adding new functions. Bezel-less screen is one of such features for the moment. Phones need to be more durable and shatterproof with greater battery life but as phones get changed every 2 years, manufacturers are focusing on looks rather durability. Phones look cool with this new trend of bezel less screen (I am using S8 myself) but it is unfortunate that durability and battery life did not end up in their (producers) priority list. Yesterday a gentleman at work accidentally dropped his S8+ from an average height and the screen shattered. They don\u2019t need to go bezel less before durability according to me. ",
