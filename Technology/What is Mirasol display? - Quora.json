            "answer_text": "\u201cMirasol\u201d is the trade name of a reflective interferometric display technology originally developed by Iridigm Display Corp., a company later acquired )along with the IP for this technology) by Qualcomm. The technology was also referred to as \u201ciMoD,\u201d for \u201cinterferometric modulator display,\u201d is a micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) based type, in which a flexible reflector is electrically switched between being in contact with an upper semi-transparent film stack on a glass substrate and being a pre-determined distance away from that upper surface; when in the latter state, interference effects cause only a single wavelength of light to be reflected by the cell - hence, that cell\u2019s color is determined by the distance the reflective surface is held away from the upper substrate. Different cells will reflect different colors depending on the gap distance designed into them. The result is a display with very bright colors, excellent contrast (for a reflective display), a wide viewing angle, and very low power requirements. The disadvantages are an update rate too slow to permit full-speed video, and limited grayscale capability. To date, the technology has been commercialized only in the form of small monochrome displays (most notably in Qualcomm\u2019s own \u201cToq\u201d smartwatch) although full color prototypes have been demonstrated. Currently, Qualcomm does not appear to be pursuing further development of the technology. ",
