            "answer_text": "Efficient in regard to WHAT ? You have to Compare with other similar houses. You can get the data on Hydro Bill for example. Ask your Hydro and Gas companies what would be the monthly equal payment for adresses comparable to you. That will give you an idea, if you are below, at, or above average. But as I mentioned before on Energy Use, it also greatly depends on YOUR lifestyle. Are you 2 or 10 in your home ? Do you crank up the Heating in winter and AC in summer ? How much Hot Water do you use ? and so on.. How Energy Efficient are your appliances, especially the Water Heater, Fridge, AC, Heating System. You can buy infrared thermometer very cheaply now, and you can go through your house to detect weak areas, where heat goes through, then properly seal and insulate. Hope this helps, but you will have to do your homework to get your answer. Regards Guy ",

            "answer_text": "Kunal Dodeja gave a good answer. The more important part- Are you energy efficient? Do you clean the coils on your fridge and HVAC systems? Do you close the windows and doors when the HVAC is running? Do you leave on appliances and lights unnecesssarily Do you buy unnecessary things? Do you eat unnecessarily? Do you throw out a lot of stuff into the garbage? Do you go on vacation? Do you drive yourself in your own car? Do you watch TV? Do you surf the net? and Quora? Wow! I\u2019m guilty on a few of these. ",
