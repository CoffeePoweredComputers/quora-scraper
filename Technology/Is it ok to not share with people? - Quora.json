            "answer_text": "To me it is at least keeping you from a fulfilling life if you mean talking and writing to others. If you just mean that you don\u2019t want to tell them your deep secrets, it is probably a life choice that many make. But even this could be a problem. In my life, the help I have received from my friends due to that sharing has been not only pleasant, but helpful, comfortable & useful. I believe I am a better person because of getting opinions from others; often they steer me to some solution that is better, or give me a different perspective on a person or situation that leads me to a more reasonable solution to my problem. Yes, one must be careful: sharing with anyone could be a disaster. My rule is to share my personal issues only with family and close friends who have demonstrated their love and concern for me multiple times to avoid a mistake. But the love of a true friend is precious. i suspect you may have had one or more bad experiences in the past that have made you cautious, and those experiences are good since they teach cautious peopleto make sure. But when you find the right friends, the sharing and mutual concerns are also a joy. Best wishes in yout search. ",
