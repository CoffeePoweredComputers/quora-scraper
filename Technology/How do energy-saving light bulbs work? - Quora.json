            "answer_text": "Well let's start with how energy saving light bulbs do not waste energy on things other than lighting, they do not omit excess Heat, so therefore the amount of energy used was for the primary purpose of lighting. Another way they can save is 2 have certain types of chemical reactions within the bulb which emit the same amount of light measured in lumens, with less electricity used to create reaction, then old style incandescent lights which typically had two wires and a wire called an element in between them, which would glow bright when electricity was applied to it, also they were kept in a atmosphere inside the globe that would keep them from burning out. These incandescent element lights emit a significant amount of heat , and would burn out soon compared to the new LED style lighting.Now comes the compact fluorescent bulb which is nothing more than a fluorescent light that you see in offices curled into a circle, with the ballast which is a Transformer tucked into the base of it. Problems came about and then the technology for LEDs surpassed the compact fluorescent bulb, LEDs or light-emitting diodes can be designed for whatever voltage, do not require a lot of extra Transformers and such, so therefore are less expensive or will be, and are more reliable because they are solid in state.

            "answer_text": "Light bulbs use electric power to produce light. But only a small amount is used to actually produce the light. In an incondescent bulb, 90% of the power makes heat. So it's efficiency is 10%. The heat is not light. So much electricity is wasted. LED bulbs, for example use about 10% of the energy to produce the same light of an ordinary incandescent bulb. So it's efficiency is 90%. A 60w incandescent bulb produces say, 800 lumens. The equivalent LED light bulb only uses about 10w of electricity to produce the same amount of light. The LED bulb is more efficient (90%). It uses less electricity to get the same amount of light. ",
