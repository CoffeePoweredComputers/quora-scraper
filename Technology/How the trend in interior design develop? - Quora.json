            "answer_text": "Gray seems to be replacing beige as the color of choice. We often show clients all sorts of interesting color schemes, only to have them pick monochromatic colors, but less of them are beige now, thank goodness. Everyone wants a big island if they can fit one in. Waterfall countertops on the islands are popular, and quartz or quartz composites are becoming the surface of choice. Stainless steel appliances are still very popular, but colorful appliances are becoming popular. These fall into a couple of categories: some folks want retro colors that remind them of the kitchens of their youth while others like bright bold modern colors. Blue is very popular in kitchens. Wood or wood-look floors are in much more demand and carpet is out. People may get rugs to place on the top of the wood but hardly anyone wants wall-to-wall carpet anymore. It is perceived as passe and unsanitary. Three-dimensional wall tile is very trendy, if expensive. So much of it is so beautiful and interesting . . . and hard to clean. But if a client has a lot of money, they probably also have other people clean for them. ",
