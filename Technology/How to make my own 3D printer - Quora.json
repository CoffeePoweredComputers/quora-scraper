            "answer_text": "All 3d printers have a basically the same components: Hot end: This is a tube, which plastic filament is forced through. At the end of the tube is a tiny nozel (usually 0.4mm - 0.5mm). There is a heating element which is caused by an electrical short (connect a wire between two terminals on a battery and it will get really hot... enough to melt plastic). The best hotends do not clog, are reliable, are all metal, and can go up to 300C+.Extruder: This is the part which forces the plastic into the hot end. This part has 2 main components. rollers (normally notched for grip), and a stepper motor to spin the rollers. You can buy these or 3d print them. The best extruders are bowden style.The bed: The bed must always be flat, and level. If it is not, your prints will have many problems. It is critical that your prints adhere when they start. There are a few strategies for this. My opinion is that the best beds have a high current PCB heated plate under glass. You should be able to heat the bed to 130C so you can work with any material without warping. If the bed is not heated, you can run into a lot of problems with warpingThe frame: Everything connects to the frame, therefore it needs to be sturdy. If the frame cant hold 200 pounds of weight sitting on it, its not sturdy enough. If the frame can wobble you will have a poor print quality.The power supply: For a good heated bed youll need at least 150W @ 12V.Control board: The cheapest is the brainwave, and the best is the aztec. Search around... youll find them. printrbot board is decent as well.There are many styles of 3d printers. Cartesian, delta, and other. Cartesians are the most common. Deltas are difficult to fine tune, but are wicked fast. The main things which make a printer good is a sturdy frame, a carriage which has only a hot end (more weight moving around quickly = more momentum, and more backlash). Don't cheap out on the steppers. They will overheat, and start making noise, and eventually fail. You want a printer which will be able to do 10 hour prints. A hot end which can handle up to 400C can print in almost any material. In general all you really need is ABS. Speed and quality are the key measurable metrics in a 3d printer. If you want the best printer I would recommend you buy a rostock kit, or make a variant. Be prepared to spend a full day calibrating and fine tuning. Feel free to ask any questions in comments. I am happy to answer. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of building kits out there for 3D printers. There are also a lot of designs out there to build them from scratch materials you can buy in hobby stores. One of my personal favorite kit-building ones is the Prusa company. Though a little more expensive ($850 in American dollars, when bought just in pieces), it builds an amazingly accurate and good printer, that can be easily upgraded to the latest model as the creator of the printers designs new ones (he designs them to do this, which is a really nice add on. Instead of buying a whole new $850 printer, you can just upgrade the old one for about $200\u2013$300). It also has add-ons and the like that make it able to print four different colors at once, as well as dissolvable support material. But needless to say, there are many other printers out there that you can build on their own, you just gotta find them. ",

After you've built a kit printer, you will have a good idea of what yo want to change or improve. A few kits out there are open source and self-replicating.    The sot famous of these is RepRap.  You will need to buy the print head and buy or build the circuit board but all the gearing and such can be printed by an already existing printer. For more all in one kits you can go commercial with kits from people like MakerBot Replicator Mini or Printrbot.
