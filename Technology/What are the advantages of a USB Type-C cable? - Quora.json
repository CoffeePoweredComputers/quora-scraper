            "answer_text": "When Apple unveiled its latest MacBook Pro, the authorities announced that the device would just use USB Type C port for transferring data and powering it. Since that day, USB Type C has gained popularity and has set an example for other USB cable standards. So what exactly is USB C cable and what makes it better than other USB cables? Let\u2019s check it out: Introduction to USB Type C Cable Type C is the latest USB connector which is double sided and has 24 pins. As it is a reversible USB, you do not have to fiddle with it in order to decide which side should be plugged in. This was a huge problem with Type-A connector port. Type C looks just a little different from other cables but there is a huge improvement with its standards. What Makes USB Type C a better choice? Although most devices use USB Type A cables, it comes across as quite bulky and large. Moreover, as these USB cables are used for desktops, they cannot be used with sleek and modern devices like cameras, laptops, smart phones and tablets.

USB-C Gen 1 products make use of USB 3.0 technology, having a speed of 5Gbps, whereas USB-C Gen 2 makes use of USB 3.1 technology providing you with a speed of 10Gbps. USB Cables can prove to be overwhelming sometimes because even if they look similar, there are several factors and variables which affect their capabilities. In order to power a device, one has to check out if the cable supports USB Power Delivery. For HDMI, DisplayPort and MHL videos, you might require USB-C cable having Alternative-Mode functionality. The Future of USB Type C cables Although there will be a gradual enforcement of standard features for these cables in the future, you must go through all the details before making a purchase. If the need be, you can also seek advice from the experts of a company selling these devices. There is no denying that USB Type C has a huge potential and it is a simple, straightforward and unifying solution to the connectivity problem. It has proved to be more transformative as compared to other USB Cables. Buy it to believe it! ",
