            "answer_text": "Web is versatile so it's possibility of development is there in the future. But we can't ignore mobile. Everything is on mobile now. Most of the jobs of computer is done on mobile nowadays. So its possibility also exists majorly. We can expect different types of mobile in the future. They change quickly. What I think is that developers have to be more specific about things in case of mobile development. The thing with the mobile development is that the developers need to be specific like android, ios etc. There can be different OS with different development requirements. But web seems versatile. Make once and its accessible on almost every device. This question doesn't have a specific answer. Both have possibility of development in the future. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the future is web development. Especially with the Internet of Things. More devices are being connected to the web. Controlling them is done via the web. The world is also moving towards a client-server architecture that is known as software as a service.  Users will just need to use the browser to access  applications and can work online. An example of this is the currently existing microsoft office online and Google's office online apps too. This way servers do all the mass computing and leave little for phones and computers to do.
