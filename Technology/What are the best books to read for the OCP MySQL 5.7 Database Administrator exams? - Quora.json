            "answer_text": "Sadly there is no book for the 5.6 or 5.7 exam. The best you can do is to cover the list of subjects for the test in great detail before you take the exam. I used to be the MySQL Certification Manager and had written MySQL certification exams in the past but had moved on before the 5.6 and 5.7 exams were written. The 5.6 exam was very tough even with lots of knowledge and skill with the product so STUDY HARD! And good luck! ",
