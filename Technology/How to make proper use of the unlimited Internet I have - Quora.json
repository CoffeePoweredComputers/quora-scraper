See the videos and learn how to build things. If you can go further (and are a bit daunting and you have a good knowledge about computers and if you can follow everything that is written word to word) and if you have a high end smartphone then you can follow tutorials to root it and install custom Roms. The above will increase your thirst for knowledge and improve it a lot. As usual you can download stuff like movies via torrents too which is most users with unlimited internet bandwidth do. Ravi. ",

I don't do anything that I have not done previous at 500/500 or 200/200 or 8/2 all in Mbit/s. The only difference is that I don't download anything anymore, it is no point, I can download stuff faster then I can consume the information. So basically I am the limitation in data consumption. The only other difference would be to do some sort of sever setup and by so marketing my Internet connection, but that is boring so I would not do it. So in reality you are likely having a limitation in your contract with your ISP of selling bandwidth, that mean that you are limited to consumption. Use it and enjoy it, keep on towards happiness\u2026 ",
