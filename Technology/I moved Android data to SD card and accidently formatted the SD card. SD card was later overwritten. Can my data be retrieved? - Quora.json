            "answer_text": "Formatting refers to a process of preparing a data storage device for initial use, such as a hard disk drive, solid-state drive, USB flash drive, or memory card. During the process, it will be divided into small areas and numbered. And every new disc or disk needs to be formatted before use. If not, your computer will not know where to write and read. Then, you may wonder \u201cHow SD card gets formatted?\u201d. It may be a doubt in many users. Some users feel they may accidentally format the SD card, and other users ensure that they don\u2019t delete it. If you don\u2019t delete it by mistake, why your SD card is formatted. Also, your card already is overwritten. Recovering files from SD card after formatting using CMD If you are familiar with the command prompt, you can recover files from a quick formatted SD card via chkdsk.net\u2019s used to check the specified disk for structural corruption. Now, get started with the following steps. Step 1. Connect your SD card to your computer via a card reader. Step 2. Check the drive letter of your SD card via Computer or Disk Management. Step 3. Type cmd in the search box on the start menu, right-click it and run as administrator. Step 4. Type the following command in the command prompt and hit Enter to run it. If the command prompt tells you the volume is in use, you can type Y and press Enter. As your card is already overwritten it is tough to recover your data, but still, there is hope. You can try some great apps. To recover the data from a formatted SD card using Recoverit, follow these simple steps; Step 1: Install Recoverit on to your computer and when the installation is complete, double-click on the program\u2019s icon on the Desktop to launch the program. Once the program is open on your computer, select the formatted SD card. Keep in mind that Recoverit will not recover data from an Android device\u2019s internal memory. You may, therefore, need to connect the Android device to the computer or remove the SD card and insert it into your computer. Click \u201cStart\u201d to begin the process. Step 2: Recoverit will immediately begin scanning the selected USB drive for the missing data. Depending on the size of the files and folders on the drive, the process may take some time, so, you may want to be patient. You can pause or stop the scanning process if you see the file you are looking for. Step 3: Click on a file to preview it and then click \u201cRecover\u201d to save the file to a preferred location on your computer. Recoverit Data Recovery is an ideal solution for the recovery of all types of data from all types of storage devices.
