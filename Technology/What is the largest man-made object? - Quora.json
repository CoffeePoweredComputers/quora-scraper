            "answer_text": "Per wiseGEEK: The largest man-made object in terms of weight and 3-D volume is the Three Gorges Dam spanning the Yangtze River in China. As previously mentioned, the dam weighs about 34 million metric tons, has a length of 2,335 m (7,661 ft) a height of 185 m (607 ft), width (at the base) of 115 m (377.3 ft).  A close runner-up is the Terminal 3 building at the Beijing Capital International Airport, which covers 240 acres and is nearly two miles long.The longest man-made objects in the world are submarine communications cables. The longest stretch from San Francisco to New Zealand or SF to Japan, stretching over 5000 mi (8000 km). These submarine cables are typically 6.6 cm (2.6 in) in diameter and weigh around 10 kg (22 lb) per meter, weighing in at a total of more than 80,000 metric tons for the entire length.  Outside of 2D objects (e.g., rail lines, power lines, oil pipelines), some of the world's largest man-made objects are scientific experiments. For instance, the newly opened Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a circular tunnel 26.6 km (16.5 mi) in length, buried between 50 to 175 meters (164 - 574 ft) underground, and includes over 1600 superconducting magnets. It will collide subatomic particles at to within a fraction of the velocity of light, and cost between $5 and $10 billion US Dollars to build.Source: http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-largest-man-made-object.htm ",

It has a shopping mall, theater, water park, church, hotel, ice skating rink, office space, indoor artificial beach that can be turned into a stage for concerts, IMAX Cinema, university complex and metro station. By Footprint**: AvtoVAZ main assembly building(887.800 m2) Where: Tolyatti, Russia When: Built in 1966 What: It is an automobile factory for Lada Cars. The city of Tolyatti is centered around the factory. By Usable Volume***: Boeing Everet Factory(13.385.378 m3) Where: Everet, Washington, USA When: Built in 1967 What: It is Boeing's assembly site for a selection of the company's largest aircraft. Originally built for construction of the 747, it now builds 747\u2019s, 767\u2019s, 777\u2019s and 787\u2019s. By height: Burj Khalifa(828 m) Where: Dubai, UAE When: It was opened on 4 January 2010 What: It is a Skyscraper housing multiple observation decks, a hotel, residential space, corporate suites and a restaurant on 122nd floor.

Considered the biggest hydroelectric dam ever built, it displaced 1.3 million people. It even has the capacity to slow the very rotation of the earth by strategically shifting significant masses of water.TUPOLEV TU 160Nicknamed \"White Swan,\" the Tupolev TU 160 is the largest operational bomber in the world. It also has the reputation of being the heaviest combat aircraft ever. The bomber can engage in high-level as well as low-level penetration. It features four Kuznetsov NK-32 afterburning turbofan engines \u2014 the most powerful of its kind to have ever been fitted in a combat aircraft.LARGE HADRON COLLIDERBased at the CERN laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, the Large Hadron Collider is the most powerful and the world\u2019s largest particle accelerator, operating at an energy that is seven times higher than that of any machine made earlier. It took 10 years and 10,000 scientists from over 100 countries to build the collider. As of 2012, its computing grid is the world's largest, comprising more than 170 computing facilities across the world.APOLLO PROGRAMAlso known as Project Apollo, the program was carried on from 1961 to 1972 at the cost of $25.4 billion. It was under this program that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first astronauts to land on the moon \u2014 yielding one of the most defining moments in the history of humankind.CLEANUP OF THE DEEPWATER HORIZON SPILLAn explosion at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig on April 20, 2010, caused the largest accidental oil spill in the world that also went to become the one of the largest environmental disaster in American history. It subsequently gave way to a massive cleanup operation that took the help of 47,000 people and 7,000 vessels, costing the federal response a whopping $850 million.AIRBUS A380The world's largest passenger airliner offers 40 percent more cabin space than the next largest aircraft. In a three-class configuration, the aircraft is capable of holding 525 people, with the number going up to 853 in an all-economy class setup. It takes a whopping $432 million to buy an Airbus A380.CHERNOBYL NEW SAFE CONFINEMENTThe infamous nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, Ukraine, that was partially destroyed in 1986 has found a new home that is estimated to cost $3.09 billion. The world's largest land-based moving structure will be 360.9 feet (110 metres) tall and 541.3 feet (165 metres) long, with a projected lifetime of 100 years.PROPOSED NEW CAPITAL OF EGYPTEgypt has proposed to build a $38 billion new capital, 28 miles (45 km) east of Cairo. The city is supposed to have 660 hospitals, 21 residential districts, 1,250 places of worship, a massive theme park and 1.1 million homes that shall be home to five million residents. In terms of population, it will become the biggest purpose-built capital ever.ENDELSTEIN 7-XThis reactor, built in Greifswald, Germany, is the largest and the most-advanced fusion device in the world and can operate with up to 30 minutes of continuous plasma discharge. The project is 80 percent financed by Germany, while the rest is done by the EU.KEMPER PROJECTBeing constructed in Kemper County, Miss., this electrical generating station will be the first of its kind to employ gasification and carbon capture technologies on such a large scale. As of March 2016, the updated cost of the project is $6.6 billion \u2014 three times the original estimate. Once completed, the plant will generate 582 megawatts of electricity.GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEMThis satellite-based navigation system uses a network of 32 satellites that can help zero in on 2D locations and track any movement, anywhere in the world at any point of time. It doesn't need any telephonic or internet reception for its operation. Originally intended for military applications of the U.S. Department of Defense, the network was opened to civilian use in the 1980s.MASJID AL-HARAMThe largest mosque in the world surrounds the Kaaba, the holiest place of Islam in the city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Covering 88.2 acres (356,800 square metres) and able to accommodate 820,000 worshipers, the mosque is undergoing a $10.6-billion expansion project that will help it house a total of 2.5 million worshippers at a time.COPERNICUS PROGRAMThe program, directed by the European Commission, is the largest single earth observation program in the world. In a period between 1998 and 2020, it is estimated to cost $7.5 billion. Through the data resulting from the program, the EU is expected to garner $33.7 billion in benefits and 50,000 new jobs by 2030.KHAZAR ISLANDSAlso known as the Caspian Islands, these 41 artificial islands in Azerbaijan cover 3,000 hectares over the Caspian Sea. The $100-billion planned development will house one million residents along with 150 schools, 50 hospitals, daycare centres, a Formula 1 racing track, university campuses and the Azerbaijan tower.",

At around 1.6 million square kilometers in size (twice the size of Texas) this Embarrassing mess shows us how little we know about scale and size never mind the vial actions we do upon our own planet. If we\u2019re even from here. I think going to Alpha Centauri might be doing the planet a favour to be honest. Seeing children and teenagers protesting against Climate Change and this sort of sickening crap makes one re-think their strategies. The NOT SO GREAT Pacific Garbage Site is the worlds largest man made and women made objects upon all objects in this world and it is this bad no one has the back bone to mention if because they\u2019re ashamed and blame the younger generation for this. We didn\u2019t make this awful mess this has been through generations and generations. I started to look at things from a different prospective as to how the modern day Millennials and younger generations like myself are blamed for everything? How can we be I was being born when this stuff was news never mind the inability to walk, talk never mind know how to see properly. Time to start blaming the generation that left us with a planet we are struggling to fix and then maybe this beautiful ocean can live again without this crap in it. How long until it\u2019s 12.6 million square miles wide (bigger than a continent in some respect) and on and on. It isn\u2019t the faults of people in my generation or younger however we should be sadly the ones made to fix it when we didn\u2019t even know until recently. This isn\u2019t an eye opener this is just disturbing. ",

            "answer_text": "This question has many answers. There are buildings, dams, and machinery. The largest building is still being built to replace the last largest building. The largest dam is the Three Gorges dam in China. The largest machine is the Bagger 288 excavator in Germany. These are miniatures compared to other man-made things. The largest man-made item is so large that it now encompasses the entire Earth and is expanding to the Moon, Mars, and beyond the solar system. It is complex yet very simple. The largest man-made thing is called \u201ccivilization.\u201d Civilization has done wonders to the Earth. Humans can walk out their front door and be anywhere in the world in hours, the deepest ocean, to the Moon, and Mars; Transportation. Humans can send words and pictures in seconds; Communication. The human has built a system to provide safe drinking water and dispose of the garbage and fecal matter; Public Utilities. In the last 150 years, a new source of power has controlled; Electricity. Some secondary events that may or may not exist are pollution, wars, mental illness, and corrupt government. Medicine has been a booming success and growth. Now, it is possible to keep every human alive, alive but dead, and every form of illness cured, with a secondary event; overpopulation. Putting Civilization, Transportation, Communication, and Secondary problems together, the last greatest human-made achievement is now occurring at this moment in time. The Human is making a bigger impact than the Holocene Extinction. It is called the Anthropocene Extinction. ",

It is [in my opinion] a very beautiful for its abstraction and eerie ambient structure. I know that it is a very large ensemble of small structures [greenhouses], but because they are together and form a unit, I consider them the largest manmade structure with a unity \u201cfeeling\u201d or nature. It is, as well, the only man made structure that can be clearly seen from the space: In a regresive scale sequence:           Surface: 3.1614e+8 m2 [316.140.000. m2], or 31.614 Ha Hope it helps ",

One could also consider the entire network of US, Interstate, and all of the interconnecting paved state highways in the USA as a man-made object. The fellows in South Dakota also have been claiming that Crazy Horse Mountain is (or will be) a man-made object. I have some doubts about this idea, though. It is a mountain that men are carving a shape out of, but they didn\u2019t make the mountain.  ",
