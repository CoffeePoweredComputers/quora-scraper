            "answer_text": "We\u2019ll start with digital computers \u2014 in other words, computers as people today would generally think of them. The first general-purpose computer that was actually built is generally considered to be the Z2, built by Konrade Zuse in 1940. It was partly mechanical and partly electronic. In 1941, he built the Z3, which was the first programmable general-purpose computer. Unlike the Z1 and Z2, it used binary storage. Program code and data were stored on punched film, and it had a 22-bit word length and clock frequency around 5 to 10 Hz. The Z3 is believed to have been Turing-complete. Colossus, built in 1943, was the first fully-electronic programmable general-purpose computer, but is not believed to have been Turing-complete. ENIAC, built from 1943 to 1945, was the first unambiguously Turing-complete fully-electronic general purpose computer. The Manchester Baby, built in 1945\u201347 as a feasibility test for the later Mark I, is the first unambiguously Turing-complete fully-electronic general purpose computer to work off a program stored in memory, instead of one \u201cprogrammed\u201d into the machine by flipping switches and moving wires to vary its setup. Those are the candidates for the first electronic digital computer, and exactly which people consider \u201cfirst\u201d depends both on what they think is important in modern computers, and somewhat on political feelings, since they respectively were built in Germany, Britain, the US, and Britain. The first general-purpose mechanical computer to be designed is believed to be Charles Babbage\u2019s Analytical Engine, which he started to design in 1833. Although parts of it have been built at different times and demonstrated to work, no one has built a complete working machine; thus, it\u2019s still uncertain whether his design would actually work. Opinions differ on whether it would have been Turing-complete. Special-purpose analog mechanical computers have existed since at least 70\u201360 BC, the date of the Antikythera wreck, the investigation of which in the early 1900s yielded the Antikythera Mechanism, an analog computer made with gears which seems to have been used to calculate position and phase of the moon, constellation positions, solar eclipses, calendar calculations, and the timing of the Olympic Games and other events. It had at least 30 gears, of a size and complexity equivalent to that of 14th-century European clocks. Some propose that it may have had another five gears, allowing it to show the position of the sun and planets. ",

            "answer_text": "Totally depends on what you mean by computer . Computers aren\u2019t really classified by generation in the same way as game consoles are . You can generally classify them into 5 eras/categories: mechanical , electro-mechanical , electronic (vacuum tubes ) , electronic (discrete semiconductors) and electronic (integrated semiconductor ) A computer , according to it\u2019s Dictionary.com definition : noun 1. a programmable electronic device designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations. Mainframes, desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones are some of the different types of computers. Compare analog computer, digital computer. 2. a person who computes; computist. The first instance of an electronic computer is the 1942 Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer , which was not programmable and built for the specific purpose of solvage equations . The ENIAC, from 1946 , was the first general purpose computer . Both used vacuum tubes to perform logic operations . These made them unreliable ( just like bulbs , vacuum tubes break ) , and expensive to build and run ( the tubes used a LOT of power and produced a lot of heat ). Eventually though , semiconductors entered the computing space . Early semiconductor-based computers used discrete logic components and transistors . The first one was the Metrovick 950 from 1956 . Transistors use less power , produce less heat and thus can be made much smaller . Without the transistor , our modern way of life could not have existed . Early examples of fully-integrated microprocessors include the intel 4004 and the MOS 6502 . These devices reduced costs and improved performance while allowing smaller computers to be feasible ( and thus allowing for personal computers ) . However , there have been earlier examples of computing devices . Electro-mechanical computers , such as the the 1937 Bell Labs Model 1 and the 1944 Harvard Mark I used relays to perform operations ( usually with some alternate memory technology ) . Relays , because of their mechanical nature can only be made of a certain size , and have a limit to how fast they can switch . They do not offer the scalability of transistors. However , there are even older examples of computers that do not use electronics at all . You could technically count devices such as the abacus or the Antikythera mechanism as computers , but the earliest device regarded as such would be Charles Babbage\u2019s difference engine . It was designed during the 19th century and designed to accelerate calculations . It was purely mechanical , and used gears . Also , as stated in the definition above , a computer can define a person who performs computations . Back when computers were too slow to perform all calculations efficiently , \u201ccomputer\u201d was a job , performed by real human beings . So computers have been available for millennia ! ",

            "answer_text": "In 1822, Charles Babbage conceptualized and began developing the Difference Engine, considered to be the first automatic computing machine. The Difference Engine was capable of computing several sets of numbers and making hard copies of the results. Babbage received some help with development of the Difference Engine from Ada Lovelace, considered by many to be the first computer programmer for her work and notes on the Difference Engine. Unfortunately, because of funding, Babbage was never able to complete a full-scale functional version of this machine. In June 1991, the London Science Museum completed the Difference Engine No 2 for the bicentennial year of Babbage's birth and later completed the printing mechanism in 2000.  In 1837, Charles Babbage proposed the first general mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine contained an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), basic flow control, punch cards (inspired by the Jacquard Loom), and integrated memory. It is the first general-purpose computer concept. Unfortunately, because of funding issues, this computer was also never built while Charles Babbage was alive. In 1910, Henry Babbage, Charles Babbage's youngest son, was able to complete a portion of this machine and was able to perform basic calculations. First programmable computer The Z1 was created by German Konrad Zuse in his parents' living room between 1936 and 1938. It is considered to be the first electromechanical binary programmable computer, and the first really functional modern computer.  First concepts of what we consider a modern computer The Turing machine was first proposed by Alan Turing in 1936 and became the foundation for theories about computing and computers. The machine was a device that printed symbols on paper tape in a manner that emulated a person following a series of logical instructions. Without these fundamentals, we wouldn't have the computers we use today. The first electric programmable computer  The Colossus was the first electric programmable computer, developed by Tommy Flowers, and was first demonstrated in December 1943. The Colossus was created to help the British code breakers read encrypted German messages. The first digital computer Short for Atanasoff-Berry Computer, the ABCbegan development by Professor John Vincent Atanasoff and graduate student Cliff Berry in 1937. Its development continued until 1942 at the Iowa State College (now Iowa State University). The ABC was an electrical computer that used more than 300 vacuum tubes for digital computation, including binary math and Boolean logic and had no CPU (was not programmable). On October 19, 1973, US Federal Judge Earl R. Larson signed his decision that the ENIAC patent by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly was invalid. In the decision, Larson named Atanasoff the sole inventor. The ENIAC was invented by J. Presper Eckertand John Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania and began construction in 1943and was not completed until 1946. It occupied about 1,800 square feet and used about 18,000 vacuum tubes, weighing almost 50 tons. Although the Judge ruled that the ABC computer was the first digital computer, many still consider the ENIAC to be the first digital computer because it was fully functional.  The first stored program computer The early British computer known as the EDSACis considered to be the first stored program electronic computer. The computer performed its first calculation on May 6, 1949, and was the computer that ran the first graphical computer game, nicknamed \"Baby\".   Around the same time, the Manchester Mark 1was another computer that could run stored programs. Built at the Victoria University of Manchester, the first version of the Mark 1 computer became operational in April 1949. Mark 1 was used to run a program to search for Mersenne primes for nine hours without error on June 16 and 17 that same year. The first computer company The first computer company was the Electronic Controls Company and was founded in 1949 by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the same individuals who helped create the ENIAC computer. The company was later renamed to EMCC or Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation and released a series of mainframe computers under the UNIVAC name. First computer with program stored in memory  First delivered to the United States government in 1950, the UNIVAC 1101 or ERA 1101 is considered to be the first computer that was capable of storing and running a program from memory. First commercial computer In 1942, Konrad Zuse begin working on the Z4that later became the first commercial computer. The computer was sold to Eduard Stiefel, a mathematician of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich on July 12, 1950. IBM's first computer On April 7, 1953, IBM publicly introduced the 701, its first commercial scientific computer. The first computer with RAM MIT introduces the Whirlwind machine on March 8, 1955, a revolutionary computer that was the first digital computer with magnetic core RAM and real-time graphics.  The first transistor computer  The TX-0 (Transistorized Experimental computer) is the first transistorized computer to be demonstrated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956. The first minicomputer In 1960, Digital Equipment Corporation released its first of many PDP computers, the PDP-1. The first desktop and mass-market computer In 1964, the first desktop computer, the Programma 101, was unveiled to the public at the New York World's Fair. It was invented by Pier Giorgio Perotto and manufactured by Olivetti. About 44,000 Programma 101 computers were sold, each with a price tag of $3,200. In 1968, Hewlett Packard began marketing the HP 9100A, considered to be the first mass-marketed desktop computer. The first workstation Although it was never sold, the first workstationis considered to be the Xerox Alto, introduced in 1974. The computer was revolutionary for its time and included a fully functional computer, display, and mouse. The computer operated like many computers today utilizing windows, menus and icons as an interface to its operating system. Many of the computer's capabilities were first demonstrated in The Mother of All Demos by Douglas Engelbart on December 9, 1968. The first microprocessor Intel introduces the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004 on November 15, 1971. The first microcomputer The Vietnamese-French engineer, Andr\u00e9 Truong Trong Thi, along with Francois Gernelle, developed the Micral computer in 1973. Considered as the first microcomputer, it used the Intel 8008 processor and was the first commercial non-assembly computer. It originally sold for $1,750. The first personal computer In 1975, Ed Roberts coined the term \"personal computer\" when he introduced the Altair 8800. Although the first personal computer is considered by many to be the KENBAK-1, which was first introduced for $750 in 1971. The computer relied on a series of switches for inputting data and output data by turning on and off a series of lights.  The first laptop or portable computer  The IBM 5100 is the first portable computer, which was released in September 1975. The computer weighed 55 pounds and had a five inch CRT display, tape drive, 1.9 MHz PALM processor, and 64 KB of RAM. In the picture is an ad of the IBM 5100 taken from a November 1975 issue of Scientific American. The first truly portable computer or laptop is considered to be the Osborne I, which was released in April 1981 and developed by Adam Osborne. The Osborne I weighed 24.5 pounds, had a 5-inch display, 64 KB of memory, two 5 1/4\" floppy drives, ran the CP/M 2.2 operating system, included a modem, and cost $1,795. The IBM PCD (PC Division) later released the IBM portable in 1984, its first portable computer that weighed 30 pounds. Later in 1986, IBM PCD announced its first laptop computer, the PC Convertible, weighing 12 pounds. Finally, in 1994, IBM introduced the IBM ThinkPad 775CD, the first notebook with an integrated CD-ROM. The first Apple computer The Apple I (Apple 1) was the first Apple computer that originally sold for $666.66. The computer kit was developed by Steve Wozniakin 1976 and contained a 6502 8-bit processor and 4 kb of memory, which was expandable to 8 or 48 kb using expansion cards. Although the Apple I had a fully assembled circuit board the kit still required a power supply, display, keyboard, and case to be operational. Below is a picture of an Apple I from an advertisement by Apple.  The first IBM personal computer  IBM introduced its first personal computer, the IBM PC, in 1981. The computer was code-named Acorn. It featured an 8088 processor, 16 KB of memory, which was expandable to 256 and used MS-DOS. The first PC clone The Compaq Portable is considered to be the first PC clone and was release in March 1983 by Compaq. The Compaq Portable was 100% compatible with IBM computers and was capable of running any software developed for IBM computers. See our index of computer companies for information about manufacturers of IBM-compatible computers.The first multimedia computer In 1992, Tandy Radio Shack released the M2500 XL/2 and M4020 SX, among the first computers to feature the MPC standard.

            "answer_text": "Maybe it is a good place to give some input on ancient \u201ccomputer\u201d - so-called Antikythera Mechanism.  Antikythera Mechanism is an ancient mechanical device designed to calculate the position of celestial bodies. Discovered in a wreck near the Greek island Antikythera, between Kithira and Crete, dated to 150-100 BCE. Until the 18th-century clocks, no mechanism of a similar degree of complexity is known. The discovery took place in 1902, when the archaeologist Valerios Stais noticed that the corroded lump of bronze extracted from the wreck a year earlier contained a gear. As it turned out, there was one of many parts of the larger mechanism. The mechanism consists of 37 bronze gears, 1 to 17 cm in diameter. The wheels were driven by a crank (or several cranks) on the side and moved with a few directions. According to historian Derek J. de Solla Price, the device served as an ancient form of astronomical calculator, which determined the positions of celestial bodies. The shield from the front showed the movement of the Sun and the Moon against the background of the zodiac and the Egyptian calendar used then in Greece, including the leap year every four years. It also showed the phases of the Moon (using cycles discovered by Meton and Callippus). Shields in the back allowed to synchronize the solar calendar with the moon and predict eclipses of the Sun and the Moon (Saros cycle). Through an eccentric combination of two wheels, the mechanism reproduced even details such as the uneven movement of the moon in the sky (according to the theory of the ancient astronomer Hipparchus). The mechanism also allowed to predict the moments of emergence and sunsets of the more important stars and constellations, and probably the positions of the five planets known at the time. The corresponding shields have not survived, but the name Venus on the front of the device has been read. \u2014 more you can find here: Antikythera Mechanism ",

But there was also the ENIAC which came before The Colossus.

But on the other hand, if you\u2019re talking about computers before the digital \u201cbox\u201d then there was the abacus, counting rods, star chart, mechanical calendar, etc (currently the most famous one being The Antikythera machine). Although these aren\u2019t computers, they technically are. People before the 19th centuries (or 18th, what ever you prefer) didn\u2019t have what they need to built a computer, and from that stand point, all the ancient computers mentioned above WOULD be the computers of their time.

            "answer_text": "ENIAC ENIAC, World's First Computer. In 1946 the first computer was announced. It was called ENIAC, which stood for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. Although there are MANY discrepancies about this, as other computers were developed by others back as far as 100 BC.The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog \"computer\", according to Derek J. de Solla Price. It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to circa 100 BC. Devices of a level of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand years later. Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use. The planisphere was a star chart invented by Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b in the early 11th century. The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235. Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012binvented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe, an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine with a gear train and gear-wheels, circa 1000 AD. The sector, a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation. The planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage ENIAC combined full, Turing complete programmability with electronic speed. The Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer (ABC), ENIAC, and Colossus all used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes). ENIAC's registers performed decimal arithmetic, rather than binary arithmetic like the Z3, the ABC and Colossus. I realize that this is a long and detailed answer. However, things changed in 1973. This explains my long detailed answer\u2026 In one of the longest cases, almost five years, in the history of the U.S. Federal Courts, Honeywell v. Sperry Rand , U.S. District Judge Earl R. Larson concluded in the verdict, published on October 19, 1973, that the Eckert and Mauchly patent for the ENIAC was invalid. Judge Larson declared that Eckert and Mauchly \u201cdid not themselves first invent the [ENIAC] automatic electronic digital computer, but instead derived that subject matter from one Dr. John Vincent Atanasoff.\u201d Do you remember what he called his?

            "answer_text": "While Babbage\u2019s designs were the first for a mechanical computer, it was never built until part of it was assembled a few years ago for a museum display. Also, its primary purpose was to calculate and accurately print mathematical tables, rather than to speed up calculations. So I think a question like this is not complete without mentioning some other candidates, and of these the American developed ENIAC is the first and foremost. It was the first electronic general purpose computer.  The main switching was carried out by some 18000 vacuum tubes (thermionic valves) and it had to be programmed by painstakingly connecting up hundreds of cables. It worked in decimal rather than binary. It was originally designed to calculate wartime ballistic trajectories but as the war was over by the time it was completed, it was put to other practical uses. It served until 1955. Also worth mentioning is the experimental Manchester Baby, built at Manchester University in the UK. This was the first machine to have all the elements of a modern computer, including an electronically stored program. It first ran in 1948, and one of the first programs tested was to find the highest factor of 2^18, which it did in 52 minutes having completed 3.5 million operations. It even had a CRT display:  This machine led to a bigger, more practical version called Manchester Mark 1 in 1949, shown below:[1]  The final production version was known as the Ferranti Mark 1. Delivered to the University in 1951, it became the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer: [2]  This was followed shortly in the USA by UNIVAC, a commercial development of the ENIAC computer. There were many other computers designed in the 1930s and 1940s which I have not mentioned, all of which helped contribute to the development of the modern computer we know today. For example, the Atanasoff-Berry computer was the first to have the modern architecture as proposed by Von Neuman, which included a system bus, a main memory, an ALU (arithmetic logic unit) and a control unit. It also had input and output (I/O) devices operated by a control unit. Links Here\u2019s a link to the Manchester University\u2019s page about the history of its computers: Welcome (Digital 60) This is link is to a free ENIAC emulator (don\u2019t use the applet, use the downloadable jar file): ENIAC simulation: simulation This one is for a simulation of EDSAC, which was another early British computer similar to the Manchester Mark 1. This is great fun to play with: Edsac Simulator There are a few other interesting simulators available if you search the Internet, including Babbage\u2019s difference engine, the Atanasoff - Berry - Computer and even Turing\u2019s \u201cBombe\u201d. Learning to program these is a great way to appreciate them (and to waste time). Footnotes[1] Manchester Mark 1 (LHS)[2] The Ferranti Mark 1 Gallery",

            "answer_text": "The answer to that depends on what definition of computer you\u2019re using. Joseph Jacquard invented a punch card driven loom in 1801. That met the data storage, programmable machine capable of logical operations criteria. Charles Babbage designed a computing machine, but he couldn\u2019t actually make it work. The design was mostly sound, and was actually successfully built 70ish years later. Herman Hollerith created a punch card driven machine in 1890 that was used to run the US census. This was the first functional machine capable of data storage and computation. This was the start of IBM. In 1936 Turing developed the concept behind all modern computing, but just the concept. Between 1937 and 1941 J.V. Atanasoff created the first computer not driven by gears, belts and shafts. It is also the first machine to actually be able to store data in memory. 1943/44 ENIAC comes on line and is the first truly digital machine. You can make legitimate arguments for any of those, or even go back to the abacus. But in reality computers are like every other piece of technology we have. There really isn\u2019t a clear first, it\u2019s one person after another building on the work of people who came before them. ",

Besides that its really hard to put a label on the first computer... its saying what's the name of the first telephone. Many different agencies were working with computers... they all knew what needed to be done to make it... mathematic automation. Basically having the machine do the calculation the person was doing! I do know that the word computer comes from what I stated before, but the first machine computer its hard to state, Google even has three which they state. Its such a broad term because just like the telephone everyone was making patents the only ones that seen as the victor was the most popular but takes away who came first or how influential they were. People would just tend to adopt what was affordable to them or separated them from the rest! Its better to ask:What was the first programmable computer?What was the first computer to integrate RAM?What was the first computer to produce audio? ",

The history of computer science goes back a loooong way - because in order to make a machine programmable, all you need are some pegs and some string. Charles Babbage invented the first mechanical computer, which was the Analytical Engine. Konrad Zuse invented the first electro-mechanical, programmable, fully automatic digital computer called the Z3. Tommy Flowers invented the first electronic, digital, programmable computer called Colossus. All these came before ENIAC so not sure why so many people are keen on that answer\u2026 ENIAC is only the first one in the US. Not in the world. I think those are the best contenders but of course, if I wanted to be pedantic I could say the first \u201ccomputers\u201d were people, and I don\u2019t mean in the philosophical sense (although yes, that too\u2026) but in the sense that we had people whose job it was to be \u2018computers\u2019 i.e. to compute mental arithmetic and calculations. For example, the first six programmers on ENIAC were \u2018computers\u2019 and their names were Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer revolves around a precise definition of \u201ccomputer.\u201d Alan Turing and his colleagues discovered the principle of the Turing machine, which forms the basis of all digital computers. However, binary digital computers are only a subset of Turing machines. Binary computation is not part of the definition and most Turing machines are in fact analog. The fabled Babbage engine had all the components of a modern computer, but was not binary. It was, however, a Turing machine. The Turing principle is universal: Sensor(input) - memory/logic/operating system - actuator(output). In fact, my own research has shown that on the basis of thermodynamics and information, all life forms are based on the Turing architecture. So, life itself is a computer. Just not a PC. The ancient Greeks had quite sophisticated mechanical computers. The abacus and even the ball governor invented in the 1600s to control the speed of windmills in Holland are examples of Turing machines. DNA is a storage system that uses arbitrary sequences of discrete codes to store information efficiently. however, it uses a four character alphabet (GATC), unlike the two characters (0,1) in a binary computer. All the rest of the six distinct biological information systems run on analog Turing machines, nested in a hierarchy from molecular clocks within cells to human social organizations. So the answer is, when and how did the first life emerge? Now that is a fascinating question. ",

ENIAC had none, except for its 20 10-digit accumulators. Other early computers used combinations of electrostatic, mercury delay line, and drum memories.The Whirlwind (1951) was the first use of core memory - a whopping 128 bytes. The IBM 701 (1952) still used 72 Williams tubes, each of which stored 1024 bits for a total of 9 KB of memory. It rented for $12,000 a month!

            "answer_text": "It depends what you mean by computer, as well as various other assumptions you want to make. I.e. it\u2019s complicated. The Ishango bone from the Paleolithic era could be argued to be a computer. The Abacus, dating to at around the 2000s bc is a type of manual computer. There are all sorts of manual computers throughout history, the slide-rule being a notable example. Further, you have various computing devices that are more automatic, such as the Antikythera mechanism. Generally, when we\u2019re talking about the modern computer we\u2019re talking about a Turing Machine, named after it\u2019s \u201cinventor\u201d Alan Turing, who described a general purpose computer in a paper in 1936. Mechanical ComputingIf you\u2019re looking at something more akin to modern general purpose computing, the earliest example would be Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Although he never built it, he is widely viewed as the father of modern computing for the design. It was designed in 1837 as a general purpose computer extending on his equally impressive (and unfinished) Difference Engine that was designed to calculate navigation tables.  Parts of the Analytical Engine have been built at various times, with part of the Mill (CPU) being displayed in the Science Museum in London.  The Analytical Engine design is Turing Complete. It has memory, input, output and various processor features that are expected of modern computers (such as branching). It was also the target for the first published computer program, an algorithm to calculate Bernoulli numbers by Ada Lovelace. Electromechanical ComputingIn Germany, in 1941 Konrad Zuse completed what is probably the first (sort of) Turing complete electric computer, the Z3. It used 2600 relays to form the computer logic (hence electromechanical). Though it was less sophisticated than the Analytical Engine (since it had no conditional branching) it had the advantage of actually being built. Though it was destroyed during an air raid in 1943 it was rebuilt in the 1960s.  The Electronic ComputerIn the 1930\u2019s various people, notable Tommy Flowers in London started experimenting with electronic valves for various applications, including telephone exchanges. This research expanded into the first electronic computers in the 1940s. A notable early computer was the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer (ABC). This was the first machine to use binary and electronics exclusively for computation, but it wasn\u2019t programmable or Turing Complete. However, it\u2019s design was very influential to the later ENIAC. Similarly, in Britain, the Colossus computer, designed to attack the German Lorentz cypher, was created in 1944. It was the worlds first programmable electronic computer but was also not Turing complete. Following those was ENIAC, which was the first fully electronic programmable Turing Complete computer in 1945/46. It is generally considered the first \u201ccomputer\u201d, though it wasn\u2019t the first electronic stored-program Turing complete computer (it had to be programmed manually by setting switches). That accolade goes to the Manchester Baby in 1948. ",

The first computer as we know it and would recognise it today to operate in a business environment was J. Lyons' LEO 1 computer ar Cadby Hall in the UK; it also has the distinction of being the first of a family of computers in use for the longest period of time prior to the IBM PC. Eckert and Mauchly produced Univac 1 in the US about the same time as LEO 1 and there was, surprisingly, a free exchange of ideas between the US and the UK at the time.

He invented computers but failed to build them. The first complete Babbage Engine was completed in London in 2002, 153 years after it was designed. Difference Engine No. 2, built faithfully to the original drawings, consists of 8,000 parts, weighs five tons, and measures 11 feet long. It is located in the Computer History Museum in San Jose, CA. Babbage designed two classes of engine, Difference Engines, and Analytical Engines. Difference engines use the mathematical method of finite differences. It uses only arithmetical addition and removes the need for multiplication and division which are more difficult to implement mechanically. Difference engines are strictly calculators. They cannot be used for general arithmetical calculation. The Analytical Engine is much more than a calculator and marks the progression from the mechanized arithmetic of calculation to fully-fledged general-purpose computation. ",

Konrad ZUSE, a German Ingenieur, created them and gave them that names. The \"Z\" was a rename of  first \"V\"(Versuch or Versuchsmaschine). But this \"V\" was exclusive reserved for space-investigation led by Wernher von Braun.  I had a personal dialog with Prof. ZEMANEK, a teacher of mine and a personal friend of Konrad ZUSE. Besides - Prof. ZEMANEK built the first computer by transistors and single electronic elements in Europe.   ZEMANEK said that he (ZUSE) was really that man who created the first programmable full-automatic computer.  It's interesting that in USA and Great Britain that fact is till now not yet well known. I think World War II brought this information-loss.  Z1, Z2 and Z3 as I know got lost in WW II,  Z3 was originally rebuilt by ZUSE because it was the original  \"first computer\".  Z4 - as I suppose - is in ownership of ETH Z\u00fcrich, where ZUSE worked too. ",
