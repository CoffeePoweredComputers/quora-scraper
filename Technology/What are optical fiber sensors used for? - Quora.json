            "answer_text": "The fiber optic sensors also called as optical fiber sensors use optical fiber or sensing elements. These sensors are used to sense some quantities like temperature, pressure, vibrations, displacements, rotations, or concentration of chemical species. Fibers have so many uses in the field of remote sensing because they require no electrical power at the remote location and they have tiny size. Fiber optic sensors are supreme for insensitive conditions, including noise, high vibration, extreme heat, wet and unstable environments. These sensors can easily fit in small areas and can be positioned correctly wherever flexible fibers are needed. The wavelength shift can be calculated using a device, optical frequency-domain reflectometry. The time-delay of the fiber optic sensors can be decided using a device such as an optical time-domain Reflectometer. The general block diagram of the fiber-optic sensor is shown above. The block diagram consists of an optical source (Light Emitting Diode, LASER, and Laser diode), optical fiber, sensing element, an optical detector, and end-processing devices (optical-spectrum analyzer, oscilloscope). These sensors are classified into three categories based on the operating principles, sensor location, and application. ",
