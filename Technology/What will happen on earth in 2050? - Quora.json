            "answer_text": "You are wondering what the Earth will be like in 2050. But you don't want to wait. Being the physicist that you are, you step into your time machine, set for a long, long journey. The machine is accelerating. Warping Space-Time fabric. And there you are! 2050. The year 2050. The time machine shows the red sign, signaling unsafe to get out here. You camp, in a nice, pressurized, oxygenated and radiation free environment. A week passes by\u2026. You're still wondering what's the problem. You check the GPS and, \u201cOh holy shit. Good thing my time machine is radiation free.\u201d You were in the CHERNOBYL EXCLUSION ZONE You turn your machine to \u201cTravel mode\u201d and take off, looking for a safe place. You open the world political map and that was NOT what you expected. NOT AT ALL. India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal merged to form \u201cIndian Subcontinent\u201d. USA, Canada, Russia and Switzerland have formed the \u201c United Countries of America and Asia\u201d. China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, the Koreas, Japan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan are now \u201cMiddle Asia\u201d. Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar have formed \u201c Islamic Union\u201d Africa, Netherlands, Greenland have formed the \u201cUnion Overseas Republic\u201d Australia and the bajillion other Islands are now \u201cThe republic of Oceania\u201d. The carribean and all the countries from South America are now \u201cSouth Earth\u201d The only independent country is Madagascar. When you clicked \u201c more info\u201d, its just like the movie Madagascar. There's a small island near the 0\u00b0,0\u00b0 coordinates. That's Disney world. Like, everything that happens in Disney, is here for real. You think visiting everywhere individually will be a real pain, so you decide to just open up Quora instead. \u201cWhy did Sockistan fall apart?\u201d \u201cWhy is Trump making a wall over the great wall of China?\u201d \u201cWhat happened to the algebra of 33 years before?\u201d \u201cWhat is the history of Donald Trump? Why is he all over our history textbooks?\u201d \u201cWho is this Mohd Sufyan guy? I read about him on Wikipedia. Any ideas?\u201d \u201cWhat is 1+1?\u201d \u201cWhy can't we find a general formula for 135 degree polynomials? The other 134 were no problem?\u201d \u201cWhat happened to-\u201d And you stop in your path. There has been three whole countries missing on the map. Iran, Iraq, Syria. What happened? You open the question, and read: \u201cSockistan drowned them. In 2033, the world had complete unity against the chaos these three guys have been causing, and we drowned them for world piece, and then politically broke up. Hope they find Atlantis.\u201d And you feel like the God. You weren't watching while flying and now can see deep space. Now you are fixed in place. You look through the telescope at 800x towards Mars. \u201cHa! That for sure looks like-- a civilisation?\u201d You fly. Fly at 0.999997c towards mars. You barely miss the moon as wild thoughts run in your mind. \u201cMars has life? That can't be humans. That just Can't be humans.\u201d You are wondering as you set your journey towards the red planet. Who knows who, or what awaits\u2026  This is the end, at least for now. I'll extend the story as soon as I get the time. But for now, I've got middle school stuff to deal with. Thanks for reading. Once I reach 10 upvotes, I guarantee, I'll edit. (If I get the time before that, I will, too) ",

            "answer_text": "The future is bright in my opinion, I believe technology will have some forms of new inventions but almost all of the time it costs money, so maybe new technology will come out then but it won\u2019t hit for another 50 years until it has been funded. For example most technology from the 60\u2019s\u201380\u2019s is finally mainstream, like flat screen TV\u2019s were invented a long time ago but a tablet sized screen costed about 500k 40 years ago. So really it\u2019s the technology that is coming out today that will go mainstream. I think self driving cars like Tesla\u2019s auto pilot will be very hot then and they will be very developed. A new technology that people really take for granted today is AirPods, wireless headphones that you can tap and ask Siri a question while not even looking at your phone is crazy. Without stopping your work you can ask any question that google can answer. With the way technology booming today wireless headphones could be the norm or even old tech 30 years from now. I don\u2019t think we will break the barrier of putting any technology into your body. I\u2019m being very conservative though, most predictions are unrealistic in my opinion, they are very optimistic. I think that 30 years from now we will still have domestic terrorism, hopefully we are out of the Middle East but honestly we could still be there. One field that will have an extreme boom will be gaming, I think that Virtual reality will be so easy to use, small, and very realistic. It\u2019s one of the fastest moving industries and the limits are expanding so fast everyday. ",

            "answer_text": "Its a bright day in 2050 I\u2019m passionate about technology that helps us in our everyday lives and makes us more socially connected. For example, today I got up early to get ready for work. I don\u2019t need an alarm clock anymore because the new bio-metric chip I had installed in my body sends signals to my brain to gently wake me up. Not only that, the chip helps my brain learn things, remember better, and is connected to the new 10G network. I also love my contact lenses . These lenses are connected to the chip . After I said goodbye to my family, I put on my jetpack. I live still live in a small city so my jetpack is the perfect vehicle for traveling to work, which is only a few kilometers away. That\u2019s an incredible progress. In short life in 2050 will be way more convenient and suitable for lazy people like me and there are too many awesome things one can imagine for the upcoming years of world.   ",

China will continue to assert itself with a view to becoming the dominant force/nation/economy. Conflict will likely increase, if not move to all out war. In short - dystopia ! ",
