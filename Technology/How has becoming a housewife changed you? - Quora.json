            "answer_text": "I'm so much happier! I have more energy now I'm not trying to juggle running a house with a job. My husband now comes home to a clean and tidy house and a happy wife who is pleased to see him, rather than having to set to and help with the housework after a demanding day at work, which happened when I worked outside the home. (Yes, I do still reserve putting out the bins for the dustmen for him to do!) We have more home cooked meals, as I have the time and enthusiasm to cook, which are both healthier and cheaper. I can schedule medical appointments without having to worry about taking time off work. I can also arrange house maintenance and vet appointments without trying to juggle with DH who will take time off work or miss a meeting to let someone in. My day is my own to organise as I wish - no one's telling me to \u201cdo this now!\u201d If it's a nice day, I can have coffee in my garden, and work in my garden for as long as I want. Many of my friends are either retired or stay at home, so we can meet up for coffee and a chat during the week. I'm also able to volunteer for organisations such as the YMCA. All in all, it's a good life! ",
