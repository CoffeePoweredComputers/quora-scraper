            "answer_text": "No Iphone till date has came with affordable price..Then How come you expect that 5g version will come at affordable price?..But it does not matter whether your phone has 5g or not unless the region you live in is capable to provide 5g networks. That is the reason why Apple has not provided a 5g version yet, but instead improved on other specs to provide better value for money. Apple is expected to provide 5g support in atleast one 2020 model of iphone, maybe the highest end phone will be the one to come with it, so you can certainly not expect it to come with affordable price.
