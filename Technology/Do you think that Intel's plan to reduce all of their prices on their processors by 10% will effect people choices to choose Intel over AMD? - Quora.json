I\u2019ve built many systems using both, and over the years it has been quite clear that Intel has the superior product. I wish it weren\u2019t so. I\u2019d have saved thousands of dollars. One caveat though. I have not tried the new Ryzen line. I\u2019m upgrading in the fall, and I have given it some thought, but in the end, with 10% off I \u2018ll probably stick with what I believe are the better of the 2. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not really. The price-to-performance difference between AMD and Intel CPUs with same performance is higher than 10\u201315%. So Intel will still be more expensive - even including compatible motherboard. So far, Intel motherboards were already more expensive than AMD ones, so combined price-to-performance ratio still favors AMD. ",
