            "answer_text": "For the moment, the US is far behind China in development of 5G (fifth generation) wireless networks. 5G will dramatically increase internet speeds and boost memory storage. That will result in major upgrades in adaptations to Artificial Intelligence (AI), smart technologies, robotics, Big Data, IoT (internet of things), automated manufacturing, autonomous vehicles and so much more. This is explains why US President Donald J. Trump has talked much about promoting \u201cAmerica First\u201d in the global 5G race. He recognizes that China is way ahead of the game and that whoever leads in the 5G sphere will emerge as the world\u2019s most dominant economy and super power. 5G will make robots more capable of handling a wider diversity of labor tasks on factory floors and warehouses. Smart technologies can tap into better cloud systems to ensure more efficiency in logistics services. Right now the telecom equipment giant and smart phones maker, Shenzhen-based Huawei Corp. Has captured international recognition as the pre-eminent leader in the 5G field. But that doesn\u2019t mean the US can\u2019t play catch up. America is home to California\u2019s Silicon Valley and US hi-tech firms stand well-positioned to get up to speed on 5G and potentially surpass China, but that will still take a few years. The Trump administration had also appointed a White House Commission to help American companies succeed in 5G network adaptions. Consumer News and Business Channel (CNBC) posts a story about US efforts to win the 5G race. You can read the article from a link here: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/5g/the-5g-race-is-far-from-over-declares-president-trump-34859/ As reported by CNBC: \u201c5G is the next generation of wireless network that will enable faster data speeds. Unlike 4G LTE, which mainly targeted mobile phones, tablets and computers, 5G is also expected to enable more reliable connections on self-driving vehicles that will need a constant data connection, and smart cities that use \u2018internet of things\u2019 devices, such as connected street lamps, traffic lights and more. AT&T and Verizon already have fledgling 5G networks in the United States, and T-Mobile and Sprint plan to activate their networks later in 2019. Only one phone from Motorola, offered on Verizon, supports 5G in the U.S. right now. \u2018To accelerate and incentivize these investments, my administration is freeing up as much wireless spectrum as needed,\u2019 Trump said. \u2018[We\u2019re] removing regularity barriers to the buildout of networks. The FCC is taking very bold action, bolder than they\u2019ve ever taken before, to make wireless spectrum available.\u201d But US hi-tech firms face some serious challenges if they intend to defeat China here. That\u2019s because Huawei is already moving forward on the R&D of 6G. So by the time US companies catch up with 5G, you can see Chinese companies stepping ahead on 6G. ",

            "answer_text": "This afternoon, BBC\u2019s Click gave a brief overview of the enormous strides that the Chinese company Huawei has made in its development of 5G infrastructure, but this has created concern amongst western security agencies that if the UK was to take on board Huawei rather than what the US has to offer, the fear is that the Chinese government could use its leverage to infiltrate itself into everything that 5G touches and bring the UK to a diabolical halt, and the TV program gave very disturbing footage of how this could happen in the next 5 to 10 years. Scary stuff, but rather than concern ourselves with what could happen, let\u2019s review what actually has happened over the past few decades. 5G will change the way we live. Everything will be connected and we will have smart homes, smart cities, driverless cars, robots, the whole shebang.  Where 4G delivers 150 megabits per second, 5G will deliver 14.58 gigabits per second.   Huawei campus. A very interesting article published on 25th June 2016 tells us that the so called \u2018special relationship\u2019 between the US and the UK is, and always was, a myth, see: Philip Pullman - Articles The UK may have thought we had something in common with the US, but that was as far as the special relationship went, so when Theresa May went rushing to Donald Trump just after he was elected president, all she did was demonstrate just how gullible she is. The US is beside itself with rage that the UK is going to hook up with Huawei and is basically why Gavin Williamson was sacked for leaking this to a newspaper, something the UK government really didn\u2019t want to be made public. We know for a fact that the US government through its National Security Agency has been routinely spying on everyone for God knows how long. We know for a fact the CIA has its grubby little paws into virtually every corner of the globe, and we know just how instrumental it is in creating havoc wherever it touches. Also, it\u2019s the CIA website that provides information on every single country and nation state on the planet, see Central Intelligence Agency But that\u2019s not the half of it. During the 90s I guess, hidden forces deemed that Microsoft Windows would take precedence over Unix in who the preferred operating system would be worldwide, and everyone who ever used Windows 98 will remember just how prone it was to viruses, worms, Trojan horses and the like. This wasn\u2019t just an accident, but deliberate policy designed to ensure that households worldwide owned computers that were especially vulnerable to malicious software, all of which could easily been avoided had Unix been the preferred operating system for ordinary people. So, if anybody intends to wreck the UK, it wont be China, but let us be in no doubt who the main protagonists are in the battle for 5G supremacy. According to 5G Market Research: What are the top players upto? - GreyB the main players are: 1.\tSamsung Electronics (South Korea) 2. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. (China) 3.\tNokia Networks (Finland) 4. NEC Corporation (Japan) 5.\tEricsson (Sweden) 6. Qualcomm (US) 7.\tVerizon (US) 8. Orange (France) 9. Mobile TeleSystems (Russia) 10. AT&T (US) 11. Cisco Systems (US) But what are the differences between 4G, with which we are all familiar, and 5G? According to What is the difference between 4G and 5G? Simply said, 5G is widely believed to be smarter, faster and more efficient than 4G. It promises mobile data speeds that far outstrip the fastest home broadband network currently available to consumers. With speeds of up to 100 gigabits per second, 5G is set to be as much as 100 times faster than 4G. The transition from 4G to 5G will be not unlike that from 32 to 64 bit computers. Back in the old days of 32 bit Windows 98 and Vista, we had rudimentary video, music and voice to data, but it was limited, and data communication speeds were slow. Nowadays of course, 64 bit microprocessors and wireless connectivity have created a revolution in what we can see and hear. Plus, Microsoft really cleaned up their act with Windows 10, and nowadays, viruses are basically a thing of the past. 4G and 5G are little more than highways for data communications, but what sets 5G apart is the number of things that will be connected to each other, but as always, it\u2019s the software running inside the processors that will control everything. The fact that data will get to its destination a hundred times faster is neither here nor there, it\u2019s basically no different than the old dial up modems and wireless routers. So, basically, the US wishes to scare people into thinking that doing business with China will leave us wide open to potential sabotage, but if the past is anything to go by and we have to choose between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, I know which side I want my bread buttered.
