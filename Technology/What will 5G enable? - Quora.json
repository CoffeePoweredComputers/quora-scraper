            "answer_text": "5G holds the promise of creating a truly connected society with use cases ranging from immersive internet services, augmented reality and low-latency remote activities including highly advanced applications such as remote surgery. So, what exactly is 5G? If we base it on ITU standards, 5G requirements are as follows: 1)     Latency -Target for one-way latency between the radio network and the user equipment is 1ms 2)     Peak Data Rate \u2013 Peak data rate for an indoor environment is 20 Gbps 3)     Mobility \u2013 Wireless services experience of users should be maintained even at speeds of 500 km/hr, which could be the speed of a bullet train 4)     Connection Density \u2013 One million devices need to be supported per square kilometer area in a dense environment 5)     Area Traffic Capacity \u2013 In an area with large density of wireless devices, the supportable throughput needs to be 10 Mbps per square meter The below is what 5G will enable Internet of Things (IoT) \u2013 There are currently 5 billion connected devices in the world currently and there are forecasted to be 25 billion connected devices by 2020. It is really interesting to see the areas of focus for IoT. Although there are a lot of commercial applications, I want to focus on the consumer and what I see as applications the consumer can relate with the most. Connected Car \u2013 In Vehicle connectivity results in a slew of services that increases convenience for the consumer. Navigation, real time traffic information, nearby amenities, entertainment, vehicle diagnostics and emergency calls in case of accidents are all valuable services enhancing everyday life. Autonomous cars are the next step in this connected car future. Connected Healthcare \u2013 Connectivity can help doctors monitor care remotely. In the connected world of the future, remote surgeries could be performed with connected networks and robots. Connected Energy- The homes of today waste too much energy. With connected thermostats, consumers can control their energy use from their smart devices. The home of the future can have all appliances connected and monitored. If there are problems with the appliances, diagnostic information could be sent to the manufacturer to enable them to troubleshoot issues remotely and possibly fixed remotely. If the issues can\u2019t be fixed remotely, the service technicians will know what parts to bring with them when they make the service call. Connected Wearables- Fitbit is a great demonstration of a connected wearable. The Apple watch and the Samsung gear are also great examples of what exists in the marketplace already in the arena of connected wearables. Smart glasses and connected clothing are just examples of what is being envisioned in the connected world of tomorrow. Connected Security- Home automation systems already exist which allow elements of the home to be remotely controlled like locking and unlocking doors and remotely viewing security cameras. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are the changes will we see with the implementation of 5g networks.  Image: Credit Broadband Internet EverywhereBroadband is currently defined by the FCC as an internet speed of 25 Mbps down and 3 Mbps up, which is an increase from the 4 Mbps and 1 Mbps defined in 2010. However, both are much slower than 5G speeds, which are expected to range anywhere from 300\u20131,000 Mbps, and even higher in some cases.Smart Vehicles, Cities, and FactoriesVehicles are pretty smart already, with smart car add-ons and built-in features like lights and wipers that turn on automatically, adaptive cruise, lane control, and even semi-autonomous driving. However, 5G will enable a quantum leap in car techno, still no flying cars, but many amazing changes are coming.Everything Is On-DemandWe could go on and on about other not-so-positive experiences with supposedly \"on demand\" online services. 5G, on the other hand, is built to minimize the delays your devices instantly. That cause these problems and provide a huge pipeline in which data can travel to reachImmersive AR and VRAugmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are very bandwidth-demanding technologies, which 5G can handle with no problem. Immersive games played in AR and VR is one of the most talked about use cases for 5G, but that\u2019s not all you can do with these reality-hacking technologies.Smarter HealthcareExchanging information with your doctor or an AI-powered system should be something you can tap into at any time, especially in emergency situations. An \u201con-demand doctor\u201d is exactly where we\u2019re headed with 5G. 5G's extremely low latency means that the surgery can take place in real time hundreds or even thousands of miles away.Another 5G medical transformation is in digital record keeping and file transfers. Many hospitals manage to keep digital health records without using 5G, but with improved speeds, machines in the whole building can move large sets of data much quicker.Better Law EnforcementPolice-operated drones also allow a city to deploy drones for regular monitoring of its citizens. Some see this as a dangerous invasion of privacy but the technology is already here and 5G will make it much more probable that drones will be deployed for this very reason.Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication5G is changing P2P connections because instead of just servers having access to quick upload speeds, your phone and computer can do the same. Every 5G cell has a minimum upload speed of 10 Gbps (1.25 gigabytes per second), meaning that in ideal conditions, users can transfer 1.25 GB of data every single second between devices. This is much faster than what's currently widely available. Hope the explanation helps, OKportal Technology ",

            "answer_text": "New wireless technology promises to make everything connected. Here\u2019s a sample of what that could mean. As 100,000 people gathered in the Spanish city this week for the Mobile World Congress, the industry's annual conference, the next generation mobile network took center stage.  This is not just to do with its super-fast speeds, it's because 5G will create a ripple of developments that will change daily life. \"5G is going to have a massive impact on people lives,\" says Laila Worrell, CEO of Altran North America, a high-tech engineering company. \"We are going to see a big advance in quality of life that 5G can deliver for individuals.\"  For starters, there's the part it can play in your commute. Self-driving cars have been on the radar for a while, but with a 5G network they could become reality. Industry players claim 5G can be 100 times faster than 4G and that a huge number of devices will be able to connect to the network simultaneously. This will enable vehicles to talk to each other in real time: they'll know when another car is changing lanes or braking and can adjust to manage traffic accordingly. The BMW iNEXT, an electric SUV expected to come onto the market in 2021, is fitted with sensors that collect and process data from the car's surroundings. \"This car is permanently surveying the road around it and sending relevant bits of information up to the cloud, generating a true real-time map that in turn is pushed down to all the other cars,\" Christoph Grote, senior vice-president of electronics at BMW, tells CNN's Samuel Burke.  \"5G is good but 6G is better,\" says Ari Pouttu, a science professor at the University of Oulu, Finland. Expected to roll out in 2030, 6G will be a development beyond the smartphone. \"Let's throw the smartphones away and think about how humans interact with infrastructure,\" says Poutto. \"You can have smart surfaces with electronics in them, smart glasses so you can have devices everywhere.\" So, stay tuned and Like, share and comment.

The text under the headline is completely ok, but if you hadn\u2019t read the headline, would you still conclude from the text that 5G would change the world? Mobile communication has already changed the world, in the 1990s and 2000s, when first voice communication and then the internet became mobile. Those were the ground-breaking years. What we see since 10 years, and where 5G will not be any different, is an evolution. Neither 4G nor 5G have changed anything by themselves. It was the world that started to accelerate change, with the mobile technology fully available and, and using a mobile communication which became a commodity. Now during the 2010-years things have been driven by consumers and industry to a point where the 4G technology, standardized during 2008 - 2010 was foreseen to not be good enough for requested volumes, speeds and variety of applications fo the future. That\u2019s where the International Telecommunication Union, Section Radio (in short: ITU-R) started to act and created a request for a new level of mobile communication - following the needs of society and industry. The key requests were more data speed, delivered essentially by higher bandwidthlower latencies, for industrial applicationsIOT Support, for example for smart city applicationsUltra-reliable connections available, for mission critical and security applicationsAnd that is precisely what we will see coming up during the next 5\u20136 years. Not there yet \u2014 in contradiction to the yelling marketing guys. So you see: it is the other way round: the world is changing, and it changes mobile communications with it. 5G is just a milestone of that development. ",

What are the latest emerging technology trends coming out of the 5G global introduction?  6 Top Technology Trends related to 5G progress In recent years, this technology has emerged and has grown to become very popular. Technology revolutionizes our daily lives and there are several technology trends that will help you in the years to come, and which should be known. So let's find out exactly what Technology Trends related to this technology that will improve standard of communication and improve on standard of living in Cities and daily lives 1. Artificial Intelligence AI is about all intelligent machines that will artificially act like talking, reading, watching, recognizing things and emotions like humans. Using algorithms and code, the machine can perform tasks that are very burdensome for us. And that too with accuracy and efficiency. AI began to be used well everywhere from health services to banking. It can be used on gadgets too. Various voice assistants such as Google Assistant are operated by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Today, many researchers and companies will work in this region to really help us in our daily lives. AI has created possibilities in specific ways , in areas as AI in health services . 2. Machine Learning and mechatronic application Trends in Machine Learning technology Another interesting and emerging technology is machine learning. This is an integral part of AI, which can be a machine's ability to understand, analyze, and track itself. In other words, placing skills to be understood in machines or computers is Machine Learning, which offers the ability to know data. That's possible through algorithms. The possibility of hand held device might come out with diagnostic models due to fast data processing allowing AI to be integrated in such areas will see faster and even accurate option of better healthcare or even or in most areas of application that requires computing solution that can be provide thru high speed data acquisition and computation allowing for better developed software to make use dedicated equipment able to acquire data acquisition to enable higher response rate and data processing  ( available on googleplay and Amazon kindle - Apple- Ibook - Dwayne Anderson ) 3. IoT Internet of Things technology trends IoT is one of the fastest growing technologies in recent years. \"Internet of Things\" is just a concept or concept through which all smart devices can connect to each other using the internet. The Internet of Things is a network that uses applications, electronics, and the internet to really help connect devices, gadgets, or equipment to each other. Once they are connected, they can communicate and exchange information. Radio frequency identification (RFID), sensors, wireless, and QR codes are IoT applications. Similarly, AI and Machine Learning will also be connected with thinking about the Internet. If you are aware of Smart Homes and Home Automation, IoT is the main idea behind the device and the type of equipment that makes your home Smart. Smarter cities will then include integration of smarter facilities and also smart homes into a smart digital hub for everybody to live , work and play 4. Augmented Reality AR is increasingly being applied today. Already used in various activities including art, entertainment, trade, education and the army. And also available on your own smart device. Augmented Reality (AR) improves user experience with sound overlays, videos, graphics, etc. On the real things. Unlike VR, AR develops the facts by enveloping digital elements on it which could act as interactive sensor that allow data manipulation and communication The Augmented Reality application is growing rapidly. It is important to realize that it has an extraordinary ability to change our perception of humans. AR is also used in industries such as health, public safety, tourism and many other industries 5. 5G Technology 5G is the next generation mobile network technology that will provide much faster speed than today's 4G LTE network .there are 2 major manufacturer namely Nokia and Huawei both working and competing for '5G First'. Similarly, phone manufacturers focus on devices prepared for 5G. However, 5G technology may be commercially available in 2020, but has Huawei has push and started launching in China and in the UK when recently USA started tariff related trade war with CHINA , and was try to put up technological restraint especially on Huawei World Gobe 5 G mobile for Smartphone The trend of mobile technology in 2019 is much more excited than the previous year. However, in 2018 many new concepts and things related to the latest mobile technology emerged. We started talking about 5G technology and eSIM. Similarly, some phones come with a wave of multiple cameras on the back, front unlocking and top-notch screen on the smartphone. Yes, it is true that the 5G wave has spread in the smartphone market. In addition, network companies have begun to think about the release of 5G. Although it will take more time, it may be up to 2020, but the focus of phone manufacturers is on this. And the next phones can be released this year with 5G compatibility. One of Samsung's main mobile phones has announced its 5G phone model: Galaxy S10 5G. Not all, but some of us can enjoy 5G speed smartphones. The reason behind this limitation is the execution of 5G. It seems that in 2019, 5G can only be implemented in some states of the world. \u00e9 SIM With the launch of Apple iPhone Xs and iPhone Xr, eSIM came into the spotlight. Many network providers started eSIM services around the world. This is also good news for smart phone companies because, with this technology, they can count on better features on their phones. As eSIM has some advantages, smartphone manufacturers are also considering this for their next range. Inside the smartphone, the eSIM is just a small built-in chip, which can save space inside and can help manufacturers make a thinner phone. Customers can also get the benefits of eSIM technology. Folding screen From the last quarter of 2018, you will hear some rumors about the folding of mobile technology. Many of the big phone manufacturers are in the race to make phones with folding or dual screens. In fact, most of them have demonstrated their fold-able smartphones in various phone exposures. According to rumors, many companies like Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei, LG and Motorola can launch their folding phones soon. And you can start a new trend of mobile technology in 2019. With folding technology, the phone has the maximum screen size and the minimum phone size. However, it is difficult to say how successful the initial folding phones will be. Because in some of the demonstrations, the phones have faults, have dents on the screen and are very expensive. But technology is evolving as such, Google is aligning the folding screen prototype. ",

Note that where I live in upstate NY has ZERO cell coverage at all and I\u2019m only 30 miles outside of Albany, the capital! On top of that the first round of 5G will be using an obsolete, energy-wasting modulation scheme because it was \u201ceasier\u201d to use. This scheme consume 5x more power than the \u201cfinal standard\u201d will take. Of course, this means all currently installed 5G infrastructure will have to be replaced at considerable cost in just a few years. On top of that 5G requires 5x-15x the base station density of 4G/LTE. This begs two questions: what then is the energy efficiency and \u201cgreenness/carbon footprint\u201d of the initial 5G roll out which is known to be power hungry? And now we\u2019ll need 5x-15x MORE base stations than we even needed for 4G/LTE and for that we haven\u2019t had the money, will or legal ability to establish full coverage even today! But magically it\u2019s going to happen now with 5G where EVERY base station requires a fiber optic backhaul connection! You can start to see why I call bullshit on the rosy plans when my LTE connection on my iPhone disappears 5 minutes outside of Albany! And 3G disappears 30 seconds after that! Conservatively: 10\u201325 years with the realistic estimate for USA-wide complete coverage being 25 years if we are lucky. In urban cities you might see it in 5\u201310 years but only in the 10 largest cities of the US. ",

            "answer_text": "5G - The next generation cellular technology that will provide faster and more reliable communication with ultra low latency. The peak network data speeds are expected to be in the range of 2-20 Gigabit per second (Gbps). South Korea and the U.S. became the first countries to commercially launch 5G services, in April 2019. India is yet to begin trial for these as the government is targeting 2020 as the launch year for 5G in the country. 5G technology will extend the use of wireless technologies \u2014 for the first time \u2014 across completely new sectors of the economy from industrial to commercial, educational, health care, agricultural, financial and social sectors. 5G is expected to form the backbone of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine to machine communications, thereby supporting a much larger range of applications and services, including communication between driverless vehicles (self-driving cars), tele-surgery and real time data analytics. The ultra low latency offered by 5G makes the technology desirable for such use cases. Latency is the amount of time data takes to travel between its source and destination. With 5G technology, consumers will be able to download data heavy content such as 8K movies and games with better graphics in a few seconds of time, But once 5G becomes commercial, users will be required to change their current (4G) devices in favour of 5G-enabled ones.

This was clearly evident in the recently concluded Indian Mobile Congress, where Jio, partnering with Ericsson, had demonstrated the real-life applications of 5G and the progress made so far. A prototype driverless car was the first on display; the vehicle, which was situated at Reliance Corporate Park (RCP) in Navi Mumbai, was controlled with help of 5G technology from over a considerable distance at Aerocity Grounds. Furthermore, there were also surveillance drones on display and an aerial disaster management vehicle SKYSHIP, with facial recognition features for rescue activities.

            "answer_text": "Hello, 5G communication is based on 3 main paradigms for future.These are Enhanced Mobile Broadband (EMBB), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) and Massive Machine Type Communication (MMTC). To fulfill these expectations 5G specifications are evolved with major changes in coding scheme for data and control, which is changed from Turbo to LDPC and Polar codes simultaneously. Which provides the efficient usage of bandwidth. The high data rate is achieved by using more efficient waveform for transmission, new concept of sub carrier spacing configurations and bandwidth part concept. The 3 different frequency used for 3 different applications which will provide IoT applications, voice connectivity and higher data rates. The change in waveform for transmission, sub-carrier spacing improve the latency from 20 milliseconds to 1 milliseconds. Hence, 5G will be revolution in the mobile telecommunication, which will improve the overall experience for every 5G mobile user. ",

Dr. Jack Kruse, Dr. Dietrich Klinghardt, and Dr. Martin Pall are a few of them. A group of around 250 scientists and doctors sent an appeal to the UN to stop 5G rollout across the globe because they are fearful of the negative effects on not only human health, but animal and environmental health.

The best part of 5G is not the amount of data you can download, but the latency i.e the response will be very less. This means there will be very less delay between making the internet request and getting your requested data. I\u2019ve recently seen a video in which a doctor 50 kilometers away does a robotic surgery. Check this out. This feels it will be a good impact.  But, on the downside, the frequencies of 5G are too damn high that they might scramble the brains of little lovely birds like sparrows killing loads of them without us even knowing about it. The worst fear I have is that this may lead to the killing of Honey Bees. This might not sound like a big deal. But you know what. Honey bees are the reasons for pollination. They are critical pollinators: they pollinate 70 of the around 100 crop species that feed 90% of the world. Honey bees are responsible for $30 billion a year in crops. That's only the start. We may lose all the plants that bees pollinate, all of the animals that eat those plants and so on up the food chain. Now if you think about it. I\u2019d much rather have my favorite food and other stuff to eat than download my favorite movie in a few seconds. So, we need to be darn careful. WHAT DO WE WANT? BETTER DOWNLOAD SPEEDS? OR THE CROPS THAT WE LIVE ON? Some might still prefer faster Wifi LOL. ",

This leads to use of massive MIMO concept to achieve higher data rates. 5:Due to improved 5G network architecture handoff is smooth and hence it does not have any effect on data transfer when mobile user changes cells.
