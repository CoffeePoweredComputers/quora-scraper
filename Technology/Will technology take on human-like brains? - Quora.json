            "answer_text": "The human brain is beyond science to explain. No AI could ever come within a bull\u2019s roar of it. The gulf between Man and animal is impossibly wide, too. Behold the Most Complicated Object in the Known Universe | The Leonard Lopate Show | WNYC Decoding 'the Most Complex Object in the Universe' People just have no idea of human intelligence and especially do evolutionists massively downplay human intelligence, claiming we are just a bit smarter than animals, or even equal to animals. Consider what our brains mean. Consider key differences between Mankind and the animals\u2026 The human brain is probably the most powerful evidence against evolution. As defined, evolution would never produce the mental capacity of humans. It is reactionary, not predictive and would not give us a capability that is infinitely beyond what we could ever use in our ridiculously short lifespan.  Despite the ridiculous assertions that humans are just \u201csmart animals\u201d it is plain, and confirmed by scientific studies, that the gulf between humans and animals is so vast as to be on a totally different plane altogether. No animal, no creature ever, can so emphatically dominate the planet as to be literally unstoppable by anything.  Only Man has the concepts of past, present and future. Of spirituality, of a higher power and an inherent need to find answers to questions. A thirst for knowledge. A need to explore beyond the earth. The power of reason and understanding of consequence.  Man\u2019s brain literally grows to comprehend learning. (No, not in size, in connections). Our capacity for learning and applying learning is now said to be virtually unlimited and thousands of times what we could ever possibly utilise within our stupidly short lifespan.  Only Man has the power to change his environment to suit himself and thus can live literally anywhere on the planet. Only Man has the capacity to destroy this world\u2019s environment and cause his own extinction and that of most life on earth - something he seems hellbent on doing right now.  Mankind is continually learning and progressing as fast as he is regressing. Early death limits greatly our progress because most of a person\u2019s knowledge dies with him despite the leaving behind of articles and books.  No animal could ever approach human intelligence.  In short, humans are a whole separate entity. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you mean \u201cwill technology attempt to emulate the human brain in search of true \u201cAI\u201d?\u201d Maybe. Certainly the bounds of AI will be pushed to whatever degree is possible, but it\u2019s unlikely that we will be able to actually emulate the activity of the biological brain. More likely we will move towards emulating it\u2019s capabilities with advanced technology. This has been a dream for a long time\u2026. Isaac Asimov came up with his \u201cpositronic brain\u201d idea for autonomous robots in 1939. As Arthur C. Clarke said, \u201cIf humans can think of something, they will very likely be able to build it.\u201d ",
