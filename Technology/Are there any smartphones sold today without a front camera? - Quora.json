Having video call with the smartphone is one of the the main reasons to have a front camera, since the external USB camera is not easy to use/access. However many users - worried about privacy and able to use external camera in case of video call - would love to have one of them, how do I know that? Because I am a user who would pay for a phone without from camera. PS: the third result on Google was this question on http://Quora.com , confirming that there are not many alternatives for those expected smartphones. ",
