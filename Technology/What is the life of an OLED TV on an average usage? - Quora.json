            "answer_text": "I have just bought one so ask me again in 5 and 10 years time. Seriously, I have heard figures ranging from 8\u201310 years. As far as I can tell the organic components degrade over time irrespective of (reasonable) hours of use. If I can get 10 years out of my OLED I\u2019ll be very happy, although i do have a Sharp LCD (using fluorescent illumination not LED) that is still going strong after 15 years. If others have access to reliable data or differing opinions I\u2019d be interested to hear them. All my recent TV purchases have been LG (LCD/LED) and all have performed reliably so far. So my OLED is an LG too. LG makes panels on an OEM basis for Sony, Panasonic and some Chinese and US manufacturers too. The issue of OLED \u201cburn-in\u201d frightens some people but my understanding is that it no way resembles that suffered by plasma panels. It is quite subtle and can be removed by reverting the TV to ordinary viewing. If you are a games freak maybe a Samsung QLED would suit you better. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is - no-one really knows. OLED panels are sourced from the same supplier, a subsidiary of LG Electronics. Very few laboratory panels have yet passed the 5 year mark in ageing tests but so far they are performing OK although there is some reduction in brightness.Extrapolating this gives a predicted useful lifespan of around 8 years but only if the ongoing brightness reduction is linear. So a safe bet is 5\u20136 years, but it could be a lot longer. The degradation occurs in the organic component of the LED so the development of inorganic LEDs capable of sufficient brightness and colour consistency offers a future path forward. Both Samsung and LG are working on inorganic LED displays. Samsung seems to be slightly ahead at the moment. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on your use case. If you play a lot of games or watch the news all the time, it will not be very long, as it can get burn-in. But if you watch regular shows and movies where the picture is constantly changing, chances are that you will never reach the end of its lifespan, with LG saying their TV\u2019s last for 100,000 hours, which is 10 hours a day for 10 years.
