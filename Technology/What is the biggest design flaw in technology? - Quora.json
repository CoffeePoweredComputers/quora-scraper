            "answer_text": "The definition of \u201cbiggest\u201d is a matter of taste. As a matter of a small mistake with long-range, annoying consequences, I note that Benjamin Franklin, in the course of scientific work of immense technological importance, made one basic mistake, which has hampered technological work in the field ever since. Franklin first conceived the concept of electric charge, which he likened to a fluid, except that it flows through conductors, rather than through empty space*. This was indeed a great advance. He found that \u201cvitreous electricity\u201d, obtained by rubbing glass with silk, and \u201cresinous electricity\u201d, obtained by rubbing amber with cat fur, cancelled each other out, and concluded that matter with one sort of electricity had an excess of charge, and the other a deficiency of charge. This naturally led him to the concept of \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d charge, which we still use today. This work greatly advanced the study of electricity, but here is where Franklin made his confusing mistake: knowing nothing about the microscopic mechanism of transport of electric charge, he had a 50\u201350 chance of making the right choice, and he got it wrong. Franklin called resinous electricity \u201cnegative\u201d and vitreous electricity \u201cpositive\u201d. We now know that, in the overwhelming majority of practical uses, electricity is carried by electrons; because of their much lower mass than other stable, elementary particles, and their insensitivity to the strong nuclear force, they have far more mobility than the other common, stable, charged, elementary particles, protons. However, electrons, by his convention, have negative charge. Consequently, When ionic bonds form molecules, because electrons move from cations (e.g. sodium) to anions (e.g. chlorine), the nominal electric charge moves the opposite way, from the anion to the cation.In thermionic valves, otherwise known as vacuum tubes, electrons are emitted from the cathode by thermionic emission, and flow to the anode in response to the imposed voltage. However, the nominal current flows the opposite way.When storm clouds accumulate electric charge, ultimately manifested as lightning, it is because electrons tend to be dissolved in water drops, and thus are carried to the ground in rain. Thus, there is an excess of electrons in the ground and a deficiency of electrons in the upper atmosphere. However, the result is that the upper atmosphere has a \u201cpositive\u201d electric charge, and the ground a \u201cnegative\u201d charge.In solid-state electronics (i.e. the mechanism driving the machine on which you are reading this), N type conductors, in which electrons are the conductors, carry current in the opposite direction to the movement of the electrons, while P type conductors, in which spots deficient in electrons, called \u201choles\u201d, are the conductors, carry current in the same direction as the holes move.Of course, technologists get used to these glaring inconsistencies, but everyone who learns these technologies, or even physics and chemistry in general, has a lot of extra, unnecessary effort and confusion, while studying the intricacies of these fields, because she/he must apply an extra step of reversal in the understanding of them, because current flows in the opposite direction of the movement of the charge carriers. George Johnstone Stoney may have been the first person who detected the mistake, in 1891, because he first used the ancient Greek word for amber, \u1f24\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, in English spelling \u201celectron\u201d, to refer to electric charge. It is not clear whether this was a lucky guess or a brilliant correction to a long-standing error, because the particle we now call \u201celectron\u201d was discovered later, by J. J. Thomson and colleagues in 1897.  * James Clerk Maxwell later conceived the \u201cdisplacement current\u201d which flows through empty space, with even greater consequences. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps it's the way in which technology combines with capitalism to incentivize harmful goods and services. Social media sites don't have to have ads, don't have to track, collect, and sell user data, etc. but they do. Part of it is our fault: we can't bear to pay sites directly, or we're so jaded that we figure the sites will screw us anyway, so we may as well not pay upfront. Cable TV is worse: they take your money and still show you ads. Software vendors prefer proprietary formats and frequent update schemes to keep users locked in, and now they want to have a pure subscription model. They don't have to, but\u2026 money. ISPs and cellular providers keep trying to slowly raise rates, hoping you won't notice or are too locked in to switch. The Internet didn't have user privacy as a fundamental design goal, so now we have NSA spying, advertisers tracking us, etc. ",
