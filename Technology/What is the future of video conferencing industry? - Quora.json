            "answer_text": "The future of video conferencing is, especially in current times of the pandemic, pretty bright. Even before the pandemic, companies of all shapes and sizes have embraced video meetings and web conferencing to cut down the business travel costs, save time, and nuisance necessary to organize traditional, onsite meetings held in office conference rooms. Introducing a video conferencing solution in an organization was a way to swiftly connect and collaborate with employees, managers, associates, business partners, or freelancers from every corner of the planet. As I work for a company that creates a webinar solution, we\u2019ve seen a massive increase in the use of webinars and video conferences. We have noticed 375% more online events than before COVID-19. Those events have gathered a 560% bigger audience. And, frankly, many of these users are planning to incorporate video conferencing into their daily life even after the pandemic ends. More and more companies decide to go completely remote and resign from office spaces. This is where video conferences become a standard, because all daily meetings and conversations move to online. It\u2019s a solution convenient for many people doing different things: educating, selling, doing business, etc. So, the pandemic only sped up the whole process of going remote and introducing video conferencing.
