            "answer_text": "Technology plays a huge role in my life. I use technology for communication, education, entertainment, interaction, and more. I think technology is going to continue to grow, and by the time our current teenage generation reaches their 30\u2019s, technology will be engaged in almost everything they do. Their kids will be completely reliant on technology as well. Most schools by that time will most likely allow you to have personal laptops, and education will surround that fact that everything you do is on your laptop. And now because a lot of the new teachers have grown around technology, we will move away from paper and notebooks. America\u2019s lifestyle specifically, has many people that will take the first opportunity they get to be able to do nothing and sit home and play videogames all day, but the other side of the spectrum has a lot of room. People with initiative or creativity can use this new tech to start a business, get people moving, or start something that lets more people do less to survive. Technology will be attached to everyone\u2019s lifestyle in these upcoming years, and that can either be detrimental to America\u2019s society, or it lead to more innovative organizations to increase people\u2019s likely-hood for success when those people get up and do something.

            "answer_text": " Image : Credit How technology plays an important role in our lives Owing to the application of technology, our standard of living has increased. Our needs are met with greater ease. Technology has brought advancements in agriculture, due to which food produce has increased. Owing to the developments in engineering and architecture, building robust civil structures has been possible. Technology has boosted every industry. Businesses have grown, creating more employment opportunities. Advancements in technology have led to the evolution of newer and faster modes of transport and communication. The application of technology has boosted research in fields ranging from genetics to extra-terrestrial space. The computer and Internet technologies are ubiquitous. They have changed every sector; be it medicine, tourism, education, entertainment or any other. Technology has touched every aspect of life, making it easier, better and different. Technology has changed living. If not for the use of technology, we wouldn't have been able to produce electric power or harness it. Today, it can be generated through various means because of technology. Heat energy (from combustion in fossil-fuel power plants, from steam in thermal power plants and from chemical reactions in nuclear power plants) is converted into mechanical energy that drives turbines connected to an electrical generator that produces electricity. Using overhead and underground cables, the electricity can then be distributed to the smallest of households in the farthest of world's corners, thanks to technology. What made it possible to use the various energy sources to generate electricity? Application of technology. How could electricity be channeled to places far away? With the use of technology, again.  Image : Credit How would our basic needs be met so easily if not for technology? Man could meet his needs even before the birth of technology. But it was so difficult then and so rudimentary. Look at today's food - fresh, preserved or processed, food of any type is available at your doorstep just anytime. Clothing? Gosh, there's so much variety and much more comfort with different clothes for different occasions and seasons. Where does technology come into picture? Everywhere. From food to fashion, technology has a role to play. How else would so much of all this be produced? Look at today's shelters - shelters? Tall buildings, big bungalows, luxurious apartments - how would they be built if not for technology! How does water reach homes? With the help of robust water storage and transmission systems. How do homes get the warmth and cold as and when they need? Due to heating and air conditioning systems. How can food be preserved without getting spoiled? Because of refrigeration. How can civil structures be built under water? How can skyscrapers stand so tall? It's owing to advancements in civil engineering and architecture. Earthquake-resistant and fireproof structures we see today are also a gift of developments in technology. In short, we owe our luxurious lives to technology. Businesses, small and big, need technology to thrive. They are growing and expanding across countries owing to technological advancements. It is technology that gives organizations the strength to spread their wings. If not for technology, how would complex industrial processes be carried out? If not for machines, how would large-scale production of goods be possible? If not for computers, how would the software industry have grown? Growing businesses create employment opportunities for people and technology plays a big role in business growth. That's how important technology is. Technology has changed the way people communicate. Communication systems have evolved from pigeons carrying messages to emails and instant messages that travel long distances in seconds. Cellular technology and satellite communication have increased communication speeds and made 'connecting' easier. The Internet has enabled easy exchange of information over long distances. Even now, you could be accessing this page from a web server in some far-off country. Just a few clicks of your computer mouse can take you anywhere on the Internet. You enter an all new world without even realizing it!  Image : Credit Satellite and radio communication have changed the entertainment industry. Channels from all over the world are now available on your TV set, thanks to technology. Television shows and films can reach the masses within minutes after their release. Radio communication has made it possible to broadcast programs to the remotest of locations. The role of computers and Internet in education cannot be ignored. The use of computers in teaching has made learning more interesting. Computers enable better storage and presentation of information, thus making the process of teaching easier and more effective. Educational CDs are available everywhere. Lectures/lessons can be uploaded on websites, as PDFs or even as videos. This has made information more easily accessible and provided for better ways of knowledge sharing. Online degrees and training courses have led to spread of education. Today, people can continue learning even while managing their jobs, because online education gives them the flexibility to do so. And all the information in the world is so widely available, thanks to the world wide web. Technology is as important in the healthcare industry as in any other. Right from easy communication between healthcare professionals and patients to computer-assisted medical procedures, it's technology everywhere. In the working of patient-monitoring equipment and surgical instruments, there's technology. In various diagnostic procedures from scans to complex therapies, technology has a vital role to play. Many medical procedures are mechanized. Even surgeries are simulated on and assisted by machines.  Hope you like the answer, OKportal Technology ",
