            "answer_text": "Apart from technology development, this depends also on political positions of the governments and on regulations. The technology called \u201cself driving\u201d is not mature enough to be considered \u201cautonomous\u201d due to liability issues which is one of the biggest concern for this area. Autonomous drive contains set of microprocessors those can make decisions and jump to a new set of instructions one after the other. This is a predefined well known environment and for each defined input, processors generates a well known output. In driving conditions however, there are unlimited inputs those can not be evaluated by processors as they could be evaluated by human being through thousans of millions of neurons. Here the point is not to be capable as human brain of course but to minimize casualties as much as possible which requires tens of years to study. Once the casualties of autonomous drive will be considered to be less than humanous drive, then governments and regulations may guide consumers to buy such vehicles through incentives but untill that time i believe options will be limited with some actors whose will be pioneers of this area personally, to me seems pretty creepy to sleep in the vehicle when it is fully in charge, ",

            "answer_text": "Self-Driving cars won\u2019t be safe enough for mass deployment until the 5g network goes fully live (and covers everywhere a car can go). This is because the 4g network has a 43 millisecond latency that will cause the car to respond way to late to run over pedestrians, hit other cars, and prevent multi-car pileups on the freeway. The 5G network will have a 1 millisecond latency; fast enough for any autonomous car to stop in an instant. In 2020, the 5g network should be finished and read for commercial use. In 2021, the federal government will green-light autonomous vehicles. When this happens, the beginning of private car-ownership will begin to go away. Electric self-driving vehicles will be so cheap to own and operate by the rideshare companies that they\u2019ll offer you a subscription model for unlimited rides, whenever and wherever you want. I predict it will be $99 for unlimited free rides wherever and whenever you want and free deliveries of anything from any local store or restaurant. At that point, it will cost you more to own and operate your own car than it will be to get a ride in a car that you don\u2019t have to pay for, fuel up, insure, repair, or maintain PLUS, each self-driving car will be chipped and know where it\u2019s at in the world and where all the other cars are around it as well as where they\u2019re going and what route they\u2019re taking to get there. They will be way safer and auto-related accidents will go down significantly. The most dangerous cars on the road will be the ones driven by humans. ",
