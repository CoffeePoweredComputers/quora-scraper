            "answer_text": "A2A: I view \u201ctechnology\u201d as the implementation of what we know from science put into physical devices to accomplish something for us: cars, computers, TVs, radios, rubbers, plastics, synthetics, physical things. There are many ingredients that go into technology. It is a general term for the collection of things that it takes to make it a part of a technology Because one ingredient of computers is the software, I consider software part of technology. Just because a dictionary describes them differently, as Nick Kapatais says, does not mean one is not included in the other. I find that too narrow a view. I cannot exclude Nikos\u2019 IT software from technology; it is some of the most advanced technology we currently have. After all, it is called Information Technology and uses a lot of software, last time i checked\u2026 (:-o) The technical description of a amplifier is not the same as the definition of a battery, nor a cell phone and the description, piston, or carburetor is not the same as an automobile, but they all go into some particular implementation of their technology. So software is another part that goes into the technology of a computing unit along with all the gates, packages, circuit boards and displays, yet all those things have different definitions. ",

            "answer_text": "First, I won\u2019t define what these two terms are because you can find the definition of Google.com. What I will do is try to explain each of these terms so you can spot the difference. Technology. These are things created by humans to solve a particular problem. To explain further, I will say it is simply applying a particular knowledge skillfully to create anything that can make our life better. Everything around you that you can use, and you know it wasn\u2019t naturally like that, then you are looking at a piece of technology. Examples: chair, table, fireplace, etc. Whatever you can think of that serves any purpose, that is technology. Technology is anything created to provide a solution to any physical problem.  Here is an example to create a good picture. Let\u2019s go thousands of years back. A man walking from point A to point B on barefoot. He starts thinking, \u201cthe ground is too hot to walk on, and there are a lot of things that can harm my foot.\u201d After much thought, he decided to make a sandal (the first piece of technology). Now, this sandal made the journey a bit more comfortable but he still thinks there is something more. \u201cHow can I get to my destination a bit earlier?\u201d After some serious thought and sleepless nights, he finally created a \u201cbicycle.\u201d (the second piece of technology) Now he can get to where he\u2019s going for half the time and still make it back early for dinner with his family. Now this second piece of technology solves the problem of time but creates another, which is energy consumption. The faster he rides, the more energy he consumes. So the question now is, \u201chow can I get to point B faster for more than half the time and with optimum comfort?\u201d After years of thought and work, he develops a car (the third piece of technology). I believe you get the picture. Technology is whatever is created for the purpose of solving a problem is called technology. Now, the process of making these primary technologies to be more efficient and productive is what we can call technological advancements. So, In every aspect of our lives, we need some form of technology or a combination of technology to make life easier. Today, technology has greatly advanced and it will continue in its advancement as long as there is a need. Now, all I explained are physical forms of technology. Today, we have advanced to the era of information technology. This form of technology is created with the need to solve complex problems. It no longer requires physical skills but more mental skills. Technology is how we interact with our physical environment, while information technology is for interaction with our non-physical environment. This is where Softwares comes in to play.  So, what is Software? These are simply a combination of information or data (languages and codes) needed by another physical technology (computer, mobile devices, etc) to create a non-physical tool in other to solve an information-based problem.

Philosophically, technology is the intelligent use of tools by humans. This makes technology an evolving characteristic of human development. Software would begin with the written word, an element that makes technology something that can be taught. It is absolutely true that in technology we stand on the shoulders of giants. My prime example of the nexus of technology and software is the combination of the Apple II PC with Visicalc, the first spreadsheet. The result was one of the most useful computer tools available to the general public. ",
