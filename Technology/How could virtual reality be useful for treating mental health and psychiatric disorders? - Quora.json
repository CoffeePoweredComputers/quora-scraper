            "answer_text": "VR exposure therapies are particularly effective for anxiety, provoking realistic reactions to feared stimuli. On top of that, exposure therapies with simulated images are beneficial for patients with psychiatric disorders such as phobia and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). , VR environments have shown the possibility of changing depression, cognition, even social functions. VR therapies helps patients to improve their quality of life. Virtual reality (VR) is defined as a computer-generated simulation, such as a set of images and sounds that represents a real place or situation, that can be interacted with, in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment. It can transmit visual, auditory, and various sensations to users through a headset to make them feel as if they are in a virtual or imagined environment. patients with a psychiatric diagnosis such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, and even alcohol use disorder share common characteristics such as anxiety, avoidance, and poor insight to their illnesses. Modern VR systems can deliver an ideal place where one can confront the problem which needs to be overcome, not only through talking with doctors, but also through virtual environments with well-controlled sensory stimuli. This may produce cognitive and behavioral changes in patients with psychiatric disorders including autism and dementia. They also have benefits in reducing chronic pain and intensive stress. However, VR needs to overcome technical hurdles such as motion sickness and dry eyes, as well as user hurdles such as preoccupation and addiction. This tactility is advantageous as the sense of presence can be improved by actually sensing the shock or vibration to the user in the medical field, video games, and military training. A 4D (four-dimensional) system of VR refers to a VR system with a motion chair that enhances reality for users with integrated movement according to the content of the VR video. Depending on the type of system and programing, the user may interact with the environment from a first- or third-person\u2019s point of view. ",

            "answer_text": "Just my opinion here. For Anxiety, and Depression, VR could possibly be great, depending on what the person is doing. Anything that gets someone out of their own head, and stops them from thinking about their problems, would be a good thing. IMO, the longer you can keep someone out of their head, the harder it is, for them to sink back into thinking about themselves. Since it\u2019s VR, and if you know what they keep dwelling in their mind. If you can get them out of their head, and also introduce something that could help them overcome their own reasoning, to shift them away from the way they are thinking, it could go a long way from them returning to their Anxiety, or Depression. You can do just about anything in VR. So if you have great knowledge on why someone is the way they are, you could create something, that will help change the way they think. You can do it in a way that isn\u2019t obvious. ",
