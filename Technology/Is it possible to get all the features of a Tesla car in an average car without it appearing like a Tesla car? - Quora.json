            "answer_text": "Tesla cars are far from average, so I\u2019d have to say no. But if you desire an EV that looks like an average car, you\u2019re in luck. Auto makers used to make EVs look like silly toy cars, but not so much anymore. You can thank Tesla for that. Today, legacy auto company are offering EVs that are hardly distinguishable from their gasoline fueled counterparts. They add fake grills, put all the electronics under the hood, and populate the dash board with a bunch of analog controls and a tiny display. Many put a gear shift lever on the center console, use traditional door handles, and make modest attempts to improve the aerodynamics of the car. Can you tell which of these Jaguar sedans is the EV?  Or these two Nissan sedans?  It\u2019s not obvious. Which is good if that\u2019s what you want. But these average looking EVs don\u2019t have all the features of a Tesla: Long range, efficient drive trainsHigh performanceSupercharger fast DC charging networkLong lasting batteriesOver-the-air software updatesSelf-driving (Navigate on Autopilot)Smart SummonDash camSentry ModeDog ModeVideo games/Netflix/YouTube/etcOn-line purchasing/Come to you servicingLow depreciationIf you want all the features of a Tesla, you\u2019re going to have to get a Tesla.

            "answer_text": "No. Iron based cars with poor aerodynamics that were initially internal combustion engine cars have terrible performance using actual parts moved over from a Tesla car. Energy waste is the reason you cannot just add and add. It takes finesse and your premise is \u201can average car\u201d which is not tightly defined but in general will weigh too much have a drag coefficient of .4m too much frontal area, have brakes that drag. have tapered wheel bearings that corner strong but roll poorly, have windshields too flat to the wind, have back sides blunt and misshapen for wind flow and have no place to store the required battery pack for a Tesla car. Appearances are silly. Cars are about going places without killing off your neighbors. Fart cars need to meet their natural end and become something new like cast iron lawn gnomes. ",
