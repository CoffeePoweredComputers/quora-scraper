            "answer_text": "In the 60s when Xerox had all the patents on the plain paper copier business, there were three common ways to make copies, thermographic, electrographic, mimeograph, and ditto or spirit duplicators. Thermographic copiers worked with specially coated papers and a heat source. The operator would put the original and the treated sheet together and feed them to the machine. The heat source caused the black in the original to get hot and activate the chemical coating in the paper to turn black in places in contact with the black lettering. Too high a setting on the machine would result in very blurred copies, too low and the copy would be very light and both results be impair readability. Each copy required another such operation and as the original got warmer you would have to lower the setting on the copier. Exposing the copies to heat afterwards would blacken the page and reduce readability. Electrographic copiers worked with coated papers by projecting a copy of the original on to a charged drum, only the black parts of the image would remain charged and as the blank paper came into contact with the drum the charged sections would activate the chemical in the coating to blacken. These machines were also sensitive to the settings on the copier. The mimeograph machine used a stencil and a rotating drum. Ink was forced through holes in the stencil to the blank sheet which was to be the copy. Ditto machines also used a prepared original on a special papersandwich. The operator types or draws on the first sheet which makes a wax impression on the second sheet. The second sheet is put on a rotating drum. As copies are made alcohol from the machine causes the wax to dissolve and make an image on the copy. This method was good for making about 40 copies. As Xerox\u2019 patents expired, other companies entered the business. Xerox had patented every innovation they discovered even if they did not make a machine that used it, thus guaranteeing leadership in the plain paper copy business for a long time. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two methods I\u2019m aware of: the oldest is thermal printing. It uses a special paper which reacts when heated to turn black on the treated surface. The printer will have a special thermal print head that has a matrix of heating elements. You often see these used in stores to print the the paper receipt strips. Another type that has recently appeared is Zero Ink or Zink printers. Again, these printers require special paper. But, they are able to print in color. The paper is heated with varying pulses and intensity to release a combination of layers of color pigments in the paper. You\u2019ll see these most commonly in handheld photo printers. Because of the layers in the paper, it is thicker than ordinary paper\u2014similar to inkjet photo paper. ",
