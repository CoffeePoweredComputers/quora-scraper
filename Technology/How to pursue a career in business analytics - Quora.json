            "answer_text": "It is 2019, and there is still a significant shortage of analytics/data science talent. Back in 2017, I was looking for answers to the same question. Hopefully, my answer can help those looking to move into the field right now. After my undergraduate studies, I swore I would never go back to school. But, after weighing the options I had, I realized that pursuing a Master\u2019s in Business Analytics was the best option I had. Why, you ask? Here are the reasons that compelled me to pursue a Master\u2019s in Business Analytics: Pros: 1. Academic Rigor Today, you can pick up almost any skill you want online. But analytics is a lot about statistical rigor, and other than a Master\u2019s/Ph.D., few online programs would be able to instill that rigor. 2. Structured Learning One of my biggest problems with learning through online courses is that none of them are all-encompassing. Every course has knowledge gaps that you\u2019ll have to cover, and in the end, you are facing a giant jigsaw puzzle of topics. A good Master\u2019s program would cover ground in a structured manner, leaving avenues of self-learning open to the curious soul. 3. Social Learning and Networking You don\u2019t learn alone; you learn in a cohort. When one of your classmates implements a new idea in a contest/project, you immediately learn it. You learn much more efficiently in a group. Eventually, these valued colleagues will become the most reliable links in your professional network. 4. Research Opportunities and Industry Projects Schools work with companies all the time on exciting research projects. Exposing you to current, real-world data science problems. Cons: 1. Cost of Attendance/ Opportunity Costs A lot of Master\u2019s programs are prohibitively expensive. It is essential to consider the ROI (Return on Investment). Pick a school that has teaching assistantships and scholarships 2. Unpredictable Job Market/ Immigration Every business/field has a cycle of growth vs. cutting. While it is true that variable immigration policies are making it difficult to find jobs as international students, the shortage of data science professionals compensates for that difficulty. But where do I pursue my Master\u2019s? In America. Why? Robust jobs market and some of the most significant advances in A.I have been from the U.S.A and Canada. Now, moving on to the next piece of the puzzle: Which schools do I consider? There are a lot of options. Many top schools offer 1-year programs in Business Analytics. These are better suited to professionals who already have an extraordinary profile or multiple years of relevant analytics experience. If that describes you, you need to be pursuing a 1-year program at schools such as UT Austin, University of Minnesota, University of Southern California, University of Cincinnati, etc. A quick lookup of the tuition costs will show you that most of the schools that fall in this category are quite expensive. In my case, I wanted to develop a strong foundation since I did not have relevant experience. I also wanted to experience American culture and take time to adjust to a new country, something that would be quite difficult to do in the short period of a 1-year program. My search for a school that would cover all the points I mentioned above brought me to Oklahoma State University\u2019s MSBAN program. (Now known as MSBAnDS \u2013 Masters in Business Analytics and Data Science). Link: Business Analytics & Data Science - Oklahoma State University Here is why OSU MSBAN was right for me: 1.\tMSBAnDS is a 21-month program, with a detailed and well-structured curriculum. 2.\tIt has a small batch size, allowing for close student-faculty interaction and individual attention. 3.\tWith ample internship, assistantship, and on-campus job opportunities, I could not find a better ROI from any other program. 100% of my cohort had full-time summer internships, and quite a few of them went on to have part-time \u201cCo-op\u2019s\u201d in Fall and Spring. Most students work almost 7+ months as part of the program. 4.\t90% of my cohort found a job within 3 months of graduation. 5.\tLocation advantage is real, but so is industry reputation. OSU\u2019s MSBAnDS program has an excellent reputation in the industry. I gleaned this by following alums on LinkedIn and speaking to them about the program. It is also indicative through the program\u2019s board of advisors. I\u2019ve had the privilege of meeting several advisors through various networking events. 6.\tAt the time I was applying, there was no reliable source of ranking. Always read the methodology used to construct the scores for each school. Next, compare the programs through the curriculum and through the tuition and average salaries. You might find a lot of inconsistencies in these rankings! 7.\tStillwater is a college town that has a low cost of living and is exceptionally safe at any time of the day or night. 8.\tIt\u2019s not all work, it\u2019s also a lot of fun! With thanksgiving parties, tailgaters, and other events, I was able to have a fun social life as well! :D  ",

I have put in a lot of time to gather information and pen this down, so I really hope it\u2019s useful. Analytics Profile - Analytics is a process that enables us to take data-driven decisions to improve our business performance. I work with the Business analytics team but there can be various domains within analytics depending upon the requirements of the business. Here are few - Business analytics that covers KPI\u2019s (Key Performance Indicators) like sales volume, revenue, user churn etcMarketing analytics that takes care of managing and tracking the performance of different marketing campaigns to optimize the ROI (return on investment)Product analytics that enables the business to understand their different products and improve customer experienceRisk analytics that makes sure the integrity of the company is maintained by mitigating possible risk sources and corresponding lossesThere are also other types like financial analytics, HR analytics, pricing analytics etc., Where to start? You could be interested in any of the above domains, but the basic skill set for an analyst profile is the same across all the domains. Only the business context and metrics change between all of them For a beginner, it\u2019s important to have some knowledge on statistics. You can check out this course https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probabilityWhen you\u2019re done with statistics, you need to improve your knowledge on other analytical and data science techniques, for which there is a website called \u2018Analytics Vidhya\u2019 and it\u2019s quite useful - Learning Path - Data Science, Analytics, BI, Big DataWhen you\u2019re done equipping yourself with theoretical concepts, use Kaggle datasets to apply them - Tutorials | No Free HunchAlso, the websites given below have very good analytics courses - Data Science Certificates | Coursera Data Analysis & Statistics Programming Languages - It\u2019s important that you\u2019re familiar with at least one querying language when you apply for an analytics profile. Few querying languages that are used to extract data are Teradata, MySQL, VBA Visualization Tools - There are many many data visualization tools. It\u2019s not required that you know all the tools, but basic knowledge on common tools like Tableau, QlikView, Excel is mandatory Resume Preparation - A lot of people sent me messages asking about this as well. If you have previous experience on analytics, mention those projects. Please don\u2019t add projects that you\u2019ve not worked on (even if you\u2019re a fresher in analytics). For any interviewer (who would also be a seasoned analyst) it wouldn\u2019t take a lot of time to figure out that it\u2019s not your project. Also, mention only those skills that you\u2019re confident about Interview Preparation - For an analyst profile, other than written tests, they have some interview rounds that are common across all companies Case Study - You will be given a case study based on a business problem. Please invest more time in understanding the business case and the data set. It would involve some basic calculations, reading the trend and providing insights on the sameProbability - You can always expect one or two probability questionsGuesstimates - This one is very important. The questions might be as blah as \u201cHow many trees are in the US?\u201d, \u201cHow many black cars are in India?\u201d. The answer need not be perfect, of course you wouldn\u2019t know the statistics. But what matters is the approach. So, you come up with a number (reasonable one) and explain with calculations why the number is right. Make sure you consider as many scenarios as possibleQuerying Languages - They can also ask for some small programs on the querying languages you have on your resumeThere will definitely be many questions on your previous projects. So, again, only add projects that you\u2019ve worked on! How are the projects? An analyst profile is not only about data science projects, so please don\u2019t have your expectations too high. You won\u2019t be predicting and forecasting stuff every day. The type of projects can be as small as pulling just one number to creating excel reports or as big as prediction models If you\u2019re prepared with all the above, then I\u2019m sure you\u2019re ready to be an analyst and you will definitely do great! All the best! P.S : And the remaining 40% of the messages, they are about my eye color and \u201cyes, I have naturally colored eyes\u201d *.* ",

            "answer_text": "Business Analytics is a hot career option right now. So first of all, congratulations on taking the first step towards pursuing that avenue. There are multiple ways you can pursue a career in business analytics. There are several online courses that you can register for on educational websites such as Coursera, Udemy, DataCamp. These websites are really helpful to learn at your own pace and to go over content as many times as you need to. There is also a Business Analytics certificate course from NSE that is like a 3 month course. Business Analytics Course with NSE Academy Certification | Data Analytics Course. These are good options if you are currently working and do not want to quit the job or if you are looking for an option that is economical while giving you a basic understanding of analytics. However, if time and economic conditions permit, I would genuinely recommend pursuing a Masters program. I was working for 5 years in India and then decided to go ahead with my plan to do Masters in Business Analytics and it is a decision I am very glad I made. There are multiple universities in US that focus on Business Analytics and offer a wide range of courses to choose from. Universities with a good Masters program while being reasonable in terms of fees would be: UT AustinOklahoma State UniversityPurdue UniversityUConnCMUWhile a simple google search will give you multiple options on what is the best university for pursuing business analytics in the US, I would like to share my personal experience with Masters. I applied for OSU because they have amazing opportunities to work as graduate teaching/research assistant. I personally was a graduate research assistant for 3 out of 4 semesters and my tuition fees were waived for the 3 semesters which made my Masters really affordable. More than 90% of the students had assistantship for 2 semesters out of 4. from the school of business. You are free to pursue opportunities outside the school of business for any of the semesters you don\u2019t have an opportunity within department. Coming to the program (MS BANDS - Masters in Business Analytics and Data Science) and why it is different from other programs, this program is tailor-made by one of the most experienced analytics professors - Dr. Goutam Chakraborty. This program was a vision to bring in a small group of passionate students(class size is typically 35 to 37 students) and provide them full attention as opposed to putting students in classrooms of 100 and not giving any personal attention. Student faculty interaction is given utmost importance in this program and that is what I love about it. Dr.C puts tremendous effort into making sure the students have access to the most current technologies and information in the business. There is a certain level of personal touch that he puts into making sure each of his student is successful when they graduate out of this program. There are guest lectures from industry leaders every now and then. Training sessions are provided across multiple platforms. The course ensures you have couple of certifications before you graduate. It is a 2 year program of which 3 months would be your summer internship and 4 months advanced internship (if applicable). I did not do an advanced internship because I was still doing my research as a GRA. 100% students had paid internships for the past 2 years and 90% students received offers within 3 months of graduation. The course is also STEM designated which gives you enough time for 3 H1B attempts. The course also gives you an opportunity to work on several real time company projects. I personally find that very helpful because one gets to see real company data and gets to meet company leaders to discuss ideas for their company. Students also get to attend various analytics conferences in different part of the country with decent reimbursements provided by the department. Course curriculum is also quite flexible if you want to choose different avenues with analytics as your core such as HR Analytics, Health Analytics, Advanced Data Science, Marketing Analytics, Cyber Security Analytics etc . You can read more about the course on this link -> Business Analytics & Data Science - Oklahoma State University Besides all the great things this course offers on the academic side, it offers a great sense of community. The projects, events, classes and everything makes you bond as a cohort. I was an activities chair with the Business Analytics Students Association for a year. We conduct events throughout the year such as potluck parties, christmas parties, tailgating, graduate-alum mixers and so many more. The network that this program offers is irrefutable. I have met several of my friends that graduated from the top ranked programs who not only spent a lot more on their degrees than I did but also struggled to find internships/full time offers. This program was created after merging with MIS data science with MS BAN (The program I graduated from) and is less than 5 years old which makes it a very current course. It is also the reason why it is not ranked yet. I understand as students we tend to look at university ranking and program ranking but I would strongly suggest to get in touch with alums of the program that you plan to apply for because they speak from personal experience as I am right now. The campus is one of the best in the country. Stillwater is very reasonable place in terms of living expenses. The library is one of the best and so is the recreation center. The campus is extremely safe for women and international students. I have on several occasions stayed in the university till 2 or 3 am. Last but not least, I would be really happy to speak more about the program or any other questions you have regarding OSU. You can reach out to me on Linkedin (same name) if you are interested to discuss more. I hope whatever you choose to do, works out best for you. Good luck! :) ",

            "answer_text": "My suggestion would be to get the basic understanding of what business analytics is. Try to research what is included in business analytics (you can look at some university\u2019s coursework to see what topics are covered in their business analytics degree) and then try to find online resources to learn the same. Business analytics is a field that is a cumulation of I.T. and statistics. You need to understand probability, among other topics, and you will need to know how to utilize Python/SQL to apply those statistical principles on the data that is provided to you. Business analytics may also include finance, marketing, Machine Learning, etc. So to pursue a career in it, I would suggest you get the basic understanding of what Business Analytics is using online sources like Coursera, Udemy, etc. Try to utilize your learning on datasets that are freely available on the internet. Websites like Kaggle provide tonnes of free data on various topics, and you can also visit websites like Yelp, Airbnb, etc. to get their own datasets and analyze those. Then, you can apply for a job related to Business Analytics. Another method to start a career in Business Analytics would be to get a degree in it. This one is a sure shot way to jump into Business Analytics especially if your current job/degree isn\u2019t anything related to Business Analytics. However, this will require your complete dedication, energy , money and time for a specific period of time , which might range from a year to 2 years if you will be studying full time. Happy Learning! ~Saloni. ",

A Company's Future Relies on Its Business Analytics. The need for effective, efficient business analytics is stronger than ever. Businesses need to know what they want to learn from business analytics\u2014and then how they're going to use that data to inform their decisions across the board. The growing importance of Big Data across all parallels of the industry is driving companies and organizations to adopt both Business Analytics and Business Intelligence. Data in its raw form is of no use until it is analyzed and interpreted to uncover valuable insights. This is precisely where Business Analytics comes in.  Business Analytics refers to the study of Big Data by leveraging statistical and operations analysis, forming predictive models, employing optimization techniques, and communicating the results to all the stakeholders involved \u2013 team members, business partners, and customers. It focuses on quantitative methods and evidence-based data for business modeling and data-driven decision making. Usually, commercial organizations use Business Analytics to: Analyze data gathered from disparate sources.Monitor KPIs and respond to changing trends in real-time.Use advanced analytical and statistical techniques to uncover hidden patterns in massive datasets.Communicate information to relevant stakeholders through interactive dashboards and reports.Every company has three core goals \u2013 cost-optimization and reduction, maximizing customer satisfaction, and boosting profits. If leveraged correctly, Business Analytics can not only help companies accomplish these three objectives but also much more: Enhancing and speeding up the decision-making process.Making decisions that are aligned with the company business strategies.Responding to customer/client demands in real-time.Synchronizing financial and operational strategies.Keep pace with the latest industry trends to gain a competitive edge.In addition to your MBA core classes and business analytics concentration, you\u2019ll complete an internship, practicum, or other experiential learning component.
