            "answer_text": "This is my area of specialty, so I think about it all day every day.  It would be easy to write a book, and I sometimes do that for simple questions, so I'll try hard to run through some highlights.  Although my primary concentration is on winning elections, even the public policy discussions that take place when the victor takes office involve some of the same communications issues. It's not trivially obvious, especially since politics sometimes lags in innovation when compared to the private sector, but politics takes advantage of every technological advance, and will in the future.  In the printing press, Alexander Hamilton (and Madison and Jay) had a way to distribute the Federalist Papers almost anonymously.  That was a just a small step in the road that extends, literally, from yelling at the whole tribe to get them to take action, all the way to Twitter. Radio and television changed politics perhaps more than the telephone and the internet have even to date.  Before FDR's fireside chats, it's hard for us to understand that almost nobody knew what Herbert Hoover sounded like.  You could seek out a message from him in a newspaper, but he couldn't reach you proactively.  The famous Kennedy-Nixon debate was the one where the radio audience felt that Nixon had handily won the debate.  The TV audience saw Nixon with sweat on his face and no makeup on, and thought he had collapsed miserably in comparison with the suave, telegenic Senator Kennedy - many think TV got JFK elected.  Many have observed that in an age of TV we almost certainly would not elect a man as ungainly as Abraham Lincoln or as portly as William Howard Taft. The outbound telephone marketing industry presented political campaigns with a way to reach out to tens of thousands of targeted voters quickly, and quietly, below the radar.  This went way beyond the small volunteer call centers that have existed for at least forty years.  It was necessary for the technology to be in place and widely used; political campaigns could not have put into production an entire industry of different companies, large and small, with many thousands of telephones in call centers.  One day they're selling credit cards and the next day they're \"selling\" Jones for Senate.  So this is a revolution compared with media: you can target (calling only the households you want to, using any criteria from gender and age to vote propensity to (if you have acquired a good enhanced list) income, level of education, presence of children, etc.).  You can tailor the message even within a single calling program, so you may be calling all women, but the script may be different for younger women versus \"seniors\".  And maybe most importantly, you can collect information.  If you ask each voter what issue is most important to them, you can not only find out the answers that correspond to 100,000 individual voters (very, very different from a poll sample where you try to infer the opinions of the whole electorate), but you can change the way you communicate with those voters based on their answers.  (Note that pre-recorded \"robocalls\" have also been designed to do this (\"press one for healthcare\"), it's mostly been found to have limited effectiveness. Every year from about 1996 onwards has been declared the \"year of the internet\" among political people.  Of course, in a way, it was true each time.  Aside from sitting down with a piece of paper and writing a letter to the candidate asking for more information, or visiting their office, there used to be very little information about the candidates that was available on demand, when you wanted it.  With websites, campaigns were free to put up a \"brochure\" website and, if they were smart, continue refining and adding answers so that, for voters with access to the internet, they could \"talk to\" voters on the issue of most interest to the voter, at the convenience of the voter. Websites continued to evolve, of course, along the lines now called Web 2.0.  The conversation was suddenly two way, and websites evolved from brochure sites to interactive opportunities for the voter to organize events, make donations, give feedback and sign petitions. Facebook and twitter have been used effectively for two election cycles so far, but I believe that 2012 will see a paradigm shift in the way Facebook is used.  Instead of each campaign having a \"fan page\" where voters \"like\" the campaign, more viral features will help the campaign message spread.  I predict a much greater level of engagement by the voters, who will be leveraging existing tools but in a more integrated way.  A voter might research an issue and then generate a message to their current representative; it might say \"thank you for your support\" or \"I'm really unhappy about the way you voted on HR 2233.\" ",
