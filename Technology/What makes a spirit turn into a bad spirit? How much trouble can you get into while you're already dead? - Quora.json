            "answer_text": "What makes a spirit turn into a bad spirit? How much trouble can you get into while you're already dead? Bad spirits were bad people. Typically they continue those behaviours after death except that their immediate audience now consists of other people just like them. No matter what your vice, plenty of others will have that choice too. Continuing to be evil will move you to new audiences just as evil. If like many people, you also are determined to be in charge, you will be hard pressed into getting ever nastier. The really slow learners get to the bottom of the hells this way. The faster learners immediately realise what is going on and will then try to change. It\u2019s very hard to be nice in the midst of hordes of nasty people but eventually you will move to another group of people who are less nasty and in time into the light. One of the complications is that some vices like sex, drugs and alcohol are not adequately satisfied in spirit and then they learn how to come to earth and join in Earth activities. That\u2019s really bad and is an express route deeper into darkness. ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on the earthly life your spirit grows. Some do really bad and evil actions thinking they will be ok or get away really damage their spirit and become evil spirits. Many of the evil spirits are so deformed they do not look like human any more. This really the reflection of who they really are. It is hard to liberate these spirits. There is another kind of evil spirit because they were so hurt for no good reason and develop resentment against those that had hurt them. These spirits try to invade the body of the decendance of the people who hurt them and try to bring diseases and sickness. These spirits can be liberated by prayers and repentance of the living person. A good spirit in the spirit world is less likely to become an evil spirit. The make up of becoming good or bad happens in this physical world. Spirit world everything is clear. ",
