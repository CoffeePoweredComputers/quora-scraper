            "answer_text": "Better is a subjective term. I think we need to talk about security when we\u2019re talking about touch ID and face ID. Face ID has been proven to be hackable with twins and in other situations. And I guess if you were to cut off a finger tip, you could access it that way too. But in the setting of a live person or a willing person, I believe the fingerprint has proven to be more secure in its application as an access device or entry key. My vote is for touch ID. Take Care, Be Well, Stay Blessed Terry ",

I much prefer TouchID, simply because I find it more convenient. Supposedly FaceID is more secure, but as I am a creature of habit, I do prefer TouchID. ",
