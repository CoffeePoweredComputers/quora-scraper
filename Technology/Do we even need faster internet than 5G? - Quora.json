            "answer_text": "It depends what we want to use the internet for. Ready Player One shows a MASSIVE virtual reality network - essentially a whole new virtual world where everyone can interact with everyone else on tens of thousands of virtual planets. And it runs without lag, without any discernible difference to the real world. It renders so well that - most of the time - you literally can\u2019t tell the difference. In order to that, you need something faster than anything that exists now. Not just on the hardware side (graphics, CPU and memory) but on the network side. The connection between computers around the world, and between client and server would have to be nigh on instantaneous. Obviously there would also have to be hundreds of servers around the world - rather than a single server that everyone connects to. But even with hundreds of servers all running copies of the same source code, there would have to be instantaneous connection to run cloning software to ensure all of them are up to date. This would require high speed network beyond what exists now. And for people who wanted to check in on the move, it would be beyond 5G. ",
