            "answer_text": "Amazon is taking a lower margin than Apple stores. Manufacturers who sell direct generally sell for full retail price. Otherwise, third-party retailers would have little incentive to carry their products. This is true of other direct retailers like Nike and Sony. In general, most manufacturers don't have wide direct distribution and the stores tend to be flagships to show off the brand in a few prime locations. Apple is rare in that it has a broad direct distribution network. On the retail side, some people are willing to pay a premium to buy a product and have it in hand immediately. Online, Apple offers free personalization. One of the keys to Apple's success has been they've created a retail experience so compelling that people will pay for it. Not only can Apple capture wholesale margin, they can capture retail margin. I once wanted a MacBook Air immediately because I had just had a particularly bad experience with my PC and was ready to fling it out a window. I went down to the Apple store a few blocks away. (As it turned out, the Apple store was really busy. So I used their computer to order from Amazon.) Related: Apple, like most premium manufactures, has MAP policies. These restrict the lowest prices that can be advertised by retailers. ",
