            "answer_text": "I can confidently say most of the millennials (Gen X, people born after 1970 and Gen Y, people born after 1980) are social media friendly, but Generation Z (people born after 1990) may be called social media savvy. These people have accounts on virtually all social media sites. their fingers run on the mobile like a robotic instrument. These people will meet an old friend at 4:30PM on a street, at 4:30:30 they will take a selfie together and by 4:31PM, the selfie will be flashing on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Whatsapp and local messengers. They are the people, who stay late night and keep on chatting with their friends on social media. In metro trains and during breaks, you\u2019ll find them disconnected from the rest of the world and glued to their mobile phone screens. ",
