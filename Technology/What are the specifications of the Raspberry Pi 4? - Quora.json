            "answer_text": "Benchmarking the Raspberry Pi 4 - Gareth Halfacree - Medium It\u2019s almost twice as fast compared to the previous version (3 B+) and a good desktop replacement for regular use like email, browsing, spreadsheets and of course with the dual 4k micro HDMI, entertainment. What seals the deal for me - 4GB LPDDR4 vs 1GB LPDDR2 [Faster and higher capacity memory]USB 3.0 vs USB 2.0 [Faster transfer speeds]28nm SoC vs 40nm SoC [Less power and heat, better perfomance]H.265 4Kp60 decoding vs \tH.264 1080p30 [Fabulous performance]Looking at the benchmarks (Linpack etc) the current RPi4 is comparable to few years old Pentium 4, in terms of speed and throughput, though I would compare this entry - medium level laptops considering the video decoding capabilities.
