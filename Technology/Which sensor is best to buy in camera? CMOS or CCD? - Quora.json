            "answer_text": "I would always suggest to go for CMOS sensor when deciding to buy a camera. There are so many advantages of CMOS sensor based camera over CCD sensor based. However, in some aspects CCD leaves the CMOS behind but overall CMOS takes the lead. To know more about CCD and CMOS image sensors you can see my other answers here on quora: Mary Ware's answer to Is a CCD sensors better than a CMOS sensor for DSLR's? Mary Ware's answer to Which one is better in terms of performance, durability, and likelihood of becoming obsolete, between a CCD sensor or CMOS sensor? Mary Ware's answer to What is a CCD camera? Mary Ware's answer to Which sensor for cameras are best for making a film CCD or CMOS? What does Hollywood prefer? Hope you will get your answer out of these. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are looking for quality in a still picture both CMOS and CCD will give similar quality. CMOS image sensors have improved their performance significantly over the last decade and now stand on the same level with CCDs. But for high speed videos, burst photo capture CMOS image sensors are better, as they support very high frame rates compared to CCDs. Cameras with CMOS image sensors will consume lower power and are smaller for the same performance compared to CCDs. ",
