            "answer_text": "This s a non-linear function. I would say the answer today is still no - that technology is enabling more jobs in the form of coders - people that can make machines perform functions in the workplace - than are displaced. In the past that was an unequivocal yes. For every buggy whip worker displaced by lower demand for horse drawn carriages, there were several openings in large factories for labor to build autos. We are clearly reaching a point of contraction in key industries that employed a specific group of people due to technology and automation. The farm workforce used to employ over half of the US population. Today that is less than 3% - and we can feed ourselves and the world. Manufacturing has dropped to less than 15% of the workforce as we have relocated manufacturing jobs overseas. That means those with just a high school education are challenged to find a job that will employ them. Once they find that job - the rising costs for health-care, food, rent, utilities and entertainment mean they will be hard pressed to generate the kinds of disposable income readily available to a blue-collar worker a generation earlier. With advances in machine learning, automation and emergent AI, duplication of human vision in machines - many tasks previously to unique purview of humans will surrender to machines. Unfortunately it is clear that over the next decade the rate of collapse in blue-collar jobs will be far faster than he rise of new jobs elsewhere. And those new jobs require much higher levels of skill and training. That is one reason Jeff Bezo\u2019s decided to set aside $700M to retrain his blue-collar workforce to become coders. They are already one of the higher paid Blue-collar workforces in the logistics and supply industry - but the writing is on the wall, literally in many of their distribution warehouses - that automation, robots and machine learning systems are coming to render the human labor obsolete. From 2030\u20132040 I expect to see the white collar jobs, Doctor, lawyer, Banker, analyst, Trucker, cabby, clerk, umpire - yield 60\u201370% of their positions to more advanced technology - providing society with more accurate, productive and reliable systems that can invent ways to improve. At these rates, humanity has a problem. Isn\u2019t it time to decide on a direction today - rather than wait until those who pull the economic levers no longer care? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, for those without higher education. For example, in the 1940s - 1960s, when manufacturing jobs abounded (across the US, at least), many people could make entire careers with jobs that required nothing more than a high school education, and sometimes not even that. Equipment operators just had to get familiar with the tools, something that didn\u2019t require anything more than on-the-job training. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, more and more jobs were being taken over by automation. For example, cars were no longer painted by hand, but were painted by machine (early robots).  Robots don\u2019t breathe, so they have no need for masks around airborne paint Today, more and more jobs are being automated and those jobs that required people no longer do. Many jobs that are still handled by humans are only done so out of habit and \u201cthat personal touch\u201d. For example, many fast-food restaurants could be completely automated, requiring just one or two people who just took charge in emergencies. They\u2019re still staffed by people, though, because fast-food employers are used to having people make the food and assume their customers want real people making it.  McDonald\u2019s has experimented with automated ordering in some locations But we see technology displacing even non-manufacturing jobs. How many bank teller positions have been eliminated with the advent of the ATM? Some bank tellers have college degrees, but it\u2019s certainly not required. I worked as a teller before I had my degree. All that was needed was on-the-job training. Real people are still required for jobs such as in healthcare, law and technical engineering. Despite the current hype over AI, computers still can\u2019t program themselves and can\u2019t really \u201cthink\u201d despite any outward appearances. Technology has certainly helped in all these areas, but nothing has displaced the need for actual humans and their creative minds in these areas. And higher education is required for most of these positions. Even if a college degree isn\u2019t strictly required for these jobs (such as software engineering), employers typically prefer that piece of paper for any perspective employee. So, an employer hires a software engineer with a degree, and he goes on to invent new technologies that further displaces people with automation\u2026 Image credits: Google Images ",
