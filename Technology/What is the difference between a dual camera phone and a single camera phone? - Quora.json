            "answer_text": "Dual Camera Setup on smartphones provides results which are hard to achieve through single camera setup for e.g. DSLR like bokeh effect, better white balance and low light performance, 3D image, optical zoom with no moving parts etc. Bokeh Effect: Bokeh is the word for Blurred background, the one you see in photographs taken by professionals through expensive DSLRs. Bokeh is affected by a few factors: the lens design, the relative depth of field, and the aperture of the lens. Dual camera setup can provide information like distance measurements, and depth of field data which can be in turn used by a software to give Fake bokeh effect to your photos. Better White Balance and Low Light Performance: Smartphones cameras starts struggling when they have to perform in low lighting conditions, one solution for this problem is using the larger image sensor which is hard to incorporate in a smartphones where every single millimeter is very precious in their design. A larger sensor may result in a bigger camera bump on the smartphone. In case of Huawei P9 or Xiaomi Mi5s Plus\u2019s dual camera lenses one lens has RGB sensor and other one has monochrome sensor. They may look the same, but they have very different functions. One shoots in RGB to produce a color image, while the other takes care of the monochrome (black and white) images. The monochrome lens brings out the detail, and lets in around 200 percent more light than the RGB lens which takes care of the colors. The result is photos with very good white balance, contrast and lesser noise.3D image: Two cameras can capture two different photos from different angle to make a 3D image.Optical Zoom with no moving parts: iPhone 7 Plus\u2019 camera is a good example of it, you are able to zoom on the iPhone 7 Plus without sacrificing image quality. The dual-lens, provide two focal lengths, with 1x and 2x magnification. There's no moving parts ( hence it reduces thickness of the smartphone) required for zooming in or out by changing the focal focal length of the lens, it simply switches between lenses of different focal length.",

            "answer_text": "We will look at the changed key features that are only possible with twofold camera central focuses, PDAs with twofold camera will when all is said in done take better pictures yet that is a sound judgment answer to the request, unmistakably, everyone can determine that PDA with twofold cameras can take better pictures yet why twofold cameras? Better camera for instance with better sensors, opening, point of convergence, and objective can moreover take better pictures then why there is a prerequisite for the discretionary camera close by the fundamental camera. Well the suitable reaction is up 'til now the equal, to take better pictures yet this answer is exorbitantly wide and hard to explain, we should revolve around the key features,  You ought to have an idea with respect to a specialist DSLR camera, the idea of picture DSLR cameras produce is past the catch of mobile phones, anyway they are fighting to get the ball really rolling in case they can replace traditionalist cameras now they may overpower DSLRs one day, who knows Directly you got the idea! Mobile phones are endeavoring to make DSLR like pictures with twofold cameras, The twofold camera Bokeh (dark establishment) Effect The top clarification behind twofold cameras is a bokeh sway, as you no doubt know even DSLRs disregard to convey wonderful bokeh sway if you are using the normal/standard unit point of convergence, you should have a tolerable wide opening point of convergence to have the choice to make quality pictures with quality bokeh impacts. So likewise, mobile phones can't achieve bokeh impacts with the single camera point of convergence, moreover, they are insufficient in sensors that are in DSLRs. Nevertheless, tech associations like Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and Oppo are endeavoring to improve camera sensors and including more central focuses which perform express tasks to achieve the goal. In case you have twofold cameras on your mobile phone the fundamental camera is, for example, 20mp and the discretionary camera is 2mp which is much of the time used for significance recognizing. World's first DSLR keen assistant revealed The significance of field is what makes an image stick out, the helper camera measures the division of thing and significance of field and takes the foggy picture to incorporate with fundamental picture, their photos are then taken care of in the item to consider dark establishment giving it a vibe and look of DSLR picture. Sharp pictures The second reason behind using twofold cameras in PDAs is to make the photos more sharp, again the sharp picture is the key part of DSLR which PDA is endeavoring to achieve. Light sensitive pictures Low light photography is another key segment of DSLRs which twofold cameras are focusing on, when the image is taken in low light, the fundamental camera thinks all the more with respect to the issue while discretionary cameras obtain even more light to the image making it possible to have clear pictures in low light conditions.
