            "answer_text": "The advantages are obvious: more time for whatever it is that you do. The disadvantages are probably more subtle, but here they are: Your teacher or TA knows. It doesn\u2019t take much interaction for us to get to know you, so we know when work isn\u2019t yours. If you don\u2019t get pegged for plagiarism it\u2019s because the marker couldn\u2019t be bothered to do the paperwork and knows that it\u2019ll catch up with you later.Ss are overwhelmingly dissatisfied with these services.The writers have not been in your class, they don\u2019t know what your prof or lecturer has said in class about the assignment.To cheat so well that you don\u2019t get caught requires the same amount of investment in time (or money) but has a much lower return. Just don\u2019t.Here\u2019s a little empirical evidence to back-up some of my points: \"By purchasing 54 assignments from 18 different contract cheating sites across a range of disciplines, we found contract cheating sites\u2019 promises flawed. Many sites do not deliver assignments on time, or at all; they provide variable quality assignments (including fail grade work), and do not necessarily respond rapidly to user queries. When markers graded work, 52% of cheated tasks failed to meet the university pass standard.\" https://doi.org/10.1080/ 02602938.2019.1576028 ",

            "answer_text": "I have never used, nor written for, an essay writing service, but I have been that student madly pushing the word count up a couple of hours before the assignment is due. Advantages If you pick the right one, you get a competently written essay that meets the requirements of the assignment.You can spend that time working, studying other material or partying.Disadvantages Cost.You are guilty of academic misconduct, which means that you risk being tossed out of your institution without a qualification.You are a fraud. If you don\u2019t get caught, you are still defrauding every person who relies on your qualification, because you haven\u2019t earned it.You are missing an opportunity to develop your writing skills, which are important in most jobs which employ graduates.You are missing an opportunity to consolidate what you have learned about your subject.Consider instead seeking support from student services; swapping critiques with your fellow students; or finding a writing coach.
