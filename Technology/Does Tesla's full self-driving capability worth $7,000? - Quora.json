            "answer_text": "I value Full Self Driving as not worth $7000 it today. With the features being implemented this year I value FSD as worth more than $7000. You most definitely are prepaying for future features. This is of course is highly subjective and depends on how much you personally value the package and it\u2019s available and future features Let me attempt to explain how I currently value FSD. BMW prices adaptive cruise control at $700. Lets use that as a sort of reference point for trying to determine the worth of FSD. These are my assigned values. Yours will differ. If you are considering buying FSD I suggest you personally value each of the options. The main differences today between FSD and AutoPilot today are AutoPark, Lane Changes, Summon, Advanced Summon, Navigate on AutoPilot and Traffic Cones today (April 2020) I would assign each of these features the following values based on my usage and the current feature set. AutoPark. $500. This is comparable to other manufacturers. Lane Changes. $1000. Some may think this is high but it is a huge safety feature. It is much safer than manual changes. I have never heard of an accident with an FSD lane change. I know of several people in the Tesla community that now only change lanes with FSD on the highway. This feature is in my opinion is a must have for AutoPilot. Summon. The ability to back out of a space with your phone. $500. Somewhat of a trick but is useful sometimes. Advanced Summon. $2000. This is a cool trick that no other car has or will have for many years. It has limited real life worth but you could same the same of shiny rims. Navigate on AutoPilot. $500. Personally I don\u2019t find the feature too useful although I am warming up to it. I just did a trip from Canada to Florida and back and it does take the stress off finding your exits. The automatic lane changes have some bugs to be worked out. Traffic Cones. $100. This may become an important part of FSD. Today it doesn\u2019t do too much. When we add that all up FSD is worth $4600 to me. This is shy of the $7000 charged. Not let us look at some of the future features. In the short term most likely the FSD will be enhanced for stop lights and stop signs and assisted city driving. Stop Lights and Stop Signs. $2000. This has the potential of being amazing safety feature. The likely hood of both the driver and autopilot missing a stop light or stop sign should be order of magnitudes lower than a car with just a human driver. Most deaths and accidents happen in the intersection. $2000 seems like a low price to pay to reduce my mortality probability. Inner City Driving. $1000. I priced this a bit low. We haven\u2019t seen it and I have no idea how useful it will be. If it can actually drive me to work and back they it will be worth way more. This seems unlikely for a while, but it might materialize. Entertaining the above estimates we now come to a value of $7600. For me, FSD value should exceed $7000 in value by end of year 2020. Now consider things on the distant horizon. Unassisted Level 4 or 5 autonomy. It is a big unknown if this will actually be realized. I give it about a 10% chance but others seem more confident. RoboTaxi. $100,000+. Earning over $100,000 during the life span of the car should be possible if the car is dedicated to RoboTaxi in a suitable area. Elon claims that the cars will appreciate in value as features for FSD are released. This is a bit of a stretch but one can assume some recovery of the money paid for FSD when the car is sold. Even if RoboTaxi never materializes there still will be many features over the next few years that get added to FSD. I expect some will be limited as the hardware gets more dated. One of the things that makes FSD seem worth less is the fact that Autopilot is now included with the car. You get 90% of the functionality for free. Personally I think having the 10% that makes the feature complete is well worth it. Autopilot/FSD if used responsibly is absolutely awesome and statistically reduces your chance of having an accident. On my 3000 mile+ to and from Florida it totally de-stressed the drive. I have had my car almost 2 years now and still check my phone first thing in the morning for Tesla updates. Would I pay $7000 again for FSD? This type of excitement in my life is priceless. Absolutely! ",
