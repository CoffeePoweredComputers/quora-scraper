            "answer_text": "The Apple logo does not actually have a color. Apple's use of their logo is proper in that they treat their own logo as a silhouette (or shape) that can be expressed through different media. The logo could be black on white, white on black, or chrome on black aluminum and it's all still the logo. Logos (I mean good logos) in general don't have 1 specific color to them. What you are looking for may be the \"Brand Color(s)\" ",
