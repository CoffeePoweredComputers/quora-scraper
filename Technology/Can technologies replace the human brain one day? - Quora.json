Behind brain, Consciousness remains active to control all physial activities.Human soul utilises brain to deal and manipulate physical experience in outer world through the Mind. Mind remains active between psyche and Brain of human being as translater and transformer.Technology will do what human brain will want it to do. Humans Brain is creator of Supercomputer or technology and humans cannot yet create Consciousness. Brain has been created by the Consciousness. Consciousness prevails throughout universe and it manifests itself into physical form to look at itself as objects and events or Actions. Human brain is creative and translates and transforms psychic data into physical forms and events. Computer must be programmed and get feeds by the brain itself. Brain, therefore represents soul in physical body. ",

            "answer_text": "Human brain is the most powerful super computer on the earth. The human brain looks to consist for the most part of standard structures whose neurons are cut away as skills are learned. The technology like Artificial intelligence is a system of computing whose aim is to mimic the power of human brain . Animals learn severally, however automaton learning will be derived from one machine to a different. as an example, today's text and speech understanding programs were fastidiously trained over months or years, however every customer's copy of the software system is \"born\" totally educated. According to my view point there can be a chance of replacing human brain. To know more click on this website ",

Humans program machines even if these were designed to behave and imitate humans in some actions. Computers will never be able to think intuitively because they rely exclusively on preset rules. Moreover Machines only do what they have been designed or programmed to do. They lack free WILL, but free WILL is necessary for thought. So this is never going to happen. ",
