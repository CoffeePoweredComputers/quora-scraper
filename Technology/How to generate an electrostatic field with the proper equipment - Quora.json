            "answer_text": "You need a highly complicated machine. It\u2019s called: \u2018Comb\u201d.  Somehow collect this machine. A plastic comb. Now, don\u2019t use oil in your hair for 1\u20132 days. Let it be dry. Take some small pieces of paper. You have got equipments. Comb, dry hair and paper pieces. Rub the comb in your hair for several times. You are done! you've generated an Electrostatic field. How to check? Bring the comb near small piece of papers. Those will be attracted towards it.  Electrostatic force is in action. How it happens: For rubbing the comb in hair, some electrons come to the comb from hair and the comb gets negatively charged.  So there is an Electrostatic force field around the comb. When this charged comb is brought near the paper pieces, the previously neutral papers are now polarized due to electrostatic induction. The part closer to the comb will be positively charged and the opposite part will be negatively charged.  Now electrostatic force will act between negatively charged comb and positively charged end of papers and those will be attracted towards the comb. ",
