            "answer_text": "NO. R Pi 4 runs on a ARM based Broadcomm Processor. Apple's Current line of Mac OS, since they shifted from PPC architecture, runs on Intel's x86_64 based processor. ARM and x86_64 are two entirely different platforms. Apple has indicated that it will be very soon shifting away from Intel and use Apple designed platform based on ARM. Apple's current generation of mobile processors as in iPhone X put Intel's laptop grade processors in lower range to shame. Hence that makes sense. But even when Apple did make the switch, it's unlikely to run on RPi that will be current for that time. Apple's ARM processor will be extremely customized. Also R Pi's processing power is too anemic to run a full fledged desktop OS. Even the version of Windows that runs on it is a lean IOT version . ",

Darwin is the open source heart of the MacOS, based on BSD Unix. X11 Window Manager would graft right on too. It would probably be extremely limited, but the Pi isn\u2019t known for high performance anyway. It would be a good bit of work, for certain, but anything that runs Linux variants, could also alternatively run Darwin. macOS 10.14.5 - Source ",
