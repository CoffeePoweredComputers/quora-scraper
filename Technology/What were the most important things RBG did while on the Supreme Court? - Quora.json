            "answer_text": "RBG stood for individual liberty. To those who don't know what their talking about or the unreasonable minded crowd will say the exact opposite but will be restricted based on the their views lack of merit. They will simply point to the immigration and equality issues and spin tails of dissent and pushing opinions that they revere as fact. What they won't mention,\u201d mostly because they haven't been told anything thats true and that has value\u201d is that Justice Ginsburg was a fierce defender of the 4th amendment and fought for equally within the 4th amendment for all. So as the Justice would push for rights of minorities and women she was also pushing for expansion for, as Justice Louis Brandies Brandies first said; \u201c The most comprehensive of rights of civilized men is the right to be left alone, to be free from unwanted Government intrusions \u201c Justice Ginsburg will be remembered for her liberal position and those who are ignorant of the term liberal will truely miss out on understanding the many many liberal views that they themselves believe in and like, because they only relate the term liberal to the thoughts and ideals that they dont like and disagree with. Case law does lie and Justice Ginsburg sided against the Government involving 4th amendment issues 62% of the time. That number shows fairness and unbiased thought with regards to the rule of law as opposed to Justice Burger during the same time span sided against the Government only 9% of the time. Justice Ginsburg showed fairness and reasonableness over all else. Here are the numbers and as you will see there are few Justices who can claim they are defenders of liberty and who support reasonable reasonable Governmental powers. Many are either for or against the 4th amendment. Many Justices today are against the right to privacy. Heres the score card.
