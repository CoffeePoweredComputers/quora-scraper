            "answer_text": "As a gay man, I don\u2019t like either of them. And frankly, I resent being lumped into this \u201cmiscellaneous box\u201d like we\u2019ve been air-dropped onto the Island of Misfit Toys. I\u2019m GAY. That\u2019s \u201cG\u201d. I\u2019m not a lesbian, not bisexual, and not transgender (which, in fact, has absolutely nothing to do with sexual orientation). And I\u2019m certainly not \u201cQ\u201d (\u201cquestioning\u201d), which is often tagged on at the end. There is no unified LGBT \u201ccommunity\u201d; LGBT is a demographic aggregation, nothing more. We are also not an integrated voting bloc; we span the political spectrum just like everyone else does. Referring to us as a unified \u201ccommunity\u201d is like lumping all the racial minorities together and calling it the \u201cBLANA community\u201d (Black, Latino, Asian, Native American). Even more to the point, please do not refer to an individual who\u2019s not a heterosexual as an \u201cLGBT person\u201d. One cannot be gay AND lesbian AND bisexual AND transgender at the same time (at the very least, the odds are absolutely astronomical that the person to whom you\u2019re referring is all four at once). Yes, there is a kinship among all of us based on certain shared experiences. But we are not a singular unit to be generalized and compartmentalized. We are PEOPLE. PERIOD. ",

            "answer_text": "LGBT is indeed the preferred letter order.  Erica's note about how we got here is spot on and now LGBT has stuck.   I still see people re-arranging the letters (most notably LA Pride's use of TGLB), but those cases are rare.   The most recent research by CMI shows which terms are preferred in communications: LGBT -  73% gay men / 82% of Lesbians had a positive opinionGLBT - 55% gay men / 46% lesbiansLGBTQ - 46% gay men / 70% lesbiansLGBTQQIA - 11% gay men / 24% lesbians It's noticeable that LGBTQ is more preferred by women than men, but LGBT is still the most preferred of all.    This survey did not specifically break out Trans, so I would love to learn the terminology preference there.   Source: Community Marketing, Inc. | LGBT Research ",
