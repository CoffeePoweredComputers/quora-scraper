            "answer_text": "There are many of them for exampe at amazon.com. What they have in common is that they use the OBD2 interface, most of them with a wired connection, so you\u2019ll need to run a wire from the HUD module which will sit atop your dashboard facing the windshield (and reflecting the data on some sticky film you\u2019ll have to put there), to the HUD port in your car which will usually be somewhere below the steering column on the driver\u2019s side. What they display is usually the most generic info and it\u2019s fixed (80\u2019s type LCD screens with fixed characters/graphics, it can enough for this kind of use but won\u2019t leave you too much freedom for customization). Or you can go a more DIY route: you get an OBD2 wireless dongleget a small android tablet / use your android phone with torque PRO applicationSet it in HUD modeBuy a film you can paste on your windshield so the images can reflectThis one is a pretty customizable solution, I\u2019ve used torque pro in the past and it\u2019s just great (not as HUD but rather hanging the phone somewhere not obstructive so I could look at it directly). In this way you won\u2019t need to run a wire to the OBD2 port but you will need one to provide current to the device. For short enough trips you can make do with just charging it before going out, though. I\u2019d rather use the second option because it\u2019s so easy to customize Torque pro and there are already some very neat interfaces you can get from the playstore (like racing meter for torque pro) ",

It is designed as a HUD that mirrors the screen of your smartphone, but it actually has a full size HDMI input, so you can connect any video source. Please note that the projector\u2019s resolution is 480x240, but it\u2019s more than enough for a HUD. ",
