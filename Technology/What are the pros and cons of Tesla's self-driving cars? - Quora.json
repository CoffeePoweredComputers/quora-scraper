            "answer_text": "In 2018, I purchased a 2018 Tesla Model S. I would like to start this that I am a woman who is not into cars or electronics for that matter. The first time I sat in the Tesla was 2012 when they first came out with the Model S. I loved the appearance of it on sight. However because it is a computer on wheels, I decided to wait for the bugs to be worked out. When I purchased the car, it was for the intention to load up my car to go to trade shows. It is cheaper for me to purchase this car with no cost to charge on the road than paying airfare, shipping, car rental and parking two to three times per month. Let's start with the con. You should go ahead and get the charger placed in your home. Although I have free supercharing for the life of my car, it is time consuming to stop and get a charge. This could take anywhere from 35 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes depending on how low you allowed your battery to get. If you are not familiar with a particular area, it can be scary looking for the Supercharger station. If you do after hours, there usually isn't anyplace to use the restrooms or to grab a quick bit. This is especially true in small towns. You have to be conscious of your speed. You will pay for a lot of tickets if you aren't. I wish it had cameras like the Chevy Equinox where it offers a 360 view of your vehicle. The insurance is expensive, then our son turned 17. That was a true sticker shock. The cost to get things fixed is costly. I got a chip in my windshield and learned that I had replace the windshield because of all of the cameras. I have since learned that this is the case for many vehicles. The pros is why a love my car. It's fun to drive. The ride is smooth even with the sports suspension. You do not have to budget the cost of gasoline. Gas prices are not your concern. You don't have to worry about oil changes every 3 months. Your brakes last because of the regenerative brakes. Tune-ups are every 2 years and cost much less than normal gas powered cars. There is so much room in the cargo area. It's fast. It's quiet. I love the GPS system, the streaming music, and even the fun \u201ctoys\" offered on the screen. Because I do have a charging station in my garage, I have a fully charged battery. You can lock your car via a pin so that your 17 year old son doesn't drive it. The Sentry system is convenient. It records activity around your car. When I take my dog with me, I can put on the dog mode and not have to worry about my dog in the hot car. The car has so many features until it's hard to use them all. This is just a few uses pros. I absolutely love driving a Tesla. I would buy another one in 10 years. I keep my cars that long. ",

Self driving has to get to a point where it is statically MORE PRECISE and BETTER at driving a car than HUMANS. We are getting closer and closer. They tech is there\u2026the data is being compiled and the algorithms are constantly being tweaked. Now there is the \u201clegislation\u201d hurdle\u2026once the technology is fully vetted. Self driving will be SAFER and in many cases FASTER and CHEAPER. Insurance for cars that DON\u2019T crash will drop. Anyone can get in a self driving car and not need a LICENSE to drive. ",
