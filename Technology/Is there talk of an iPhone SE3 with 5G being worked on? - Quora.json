            "answer_text": "No, but as far as I know the current SE is selling well, so I would expect another in the future & for that one to have roughly what the flagship iPhones have at the time. However the first SE was out for like 4 years before the second SE came out & has only been out a year now. So it could easily be another 3+ years before you see a new one. Alternatively Apple may see the \u201c12 mini\u201d as the SE replacement, and the SE will vanish after the mini drops down a price tier or two (I.e. two years maybe?). If you like the SE because it is cheap you may as well wait for the 12\u2019s price to roll down next year. If you like the SE because it is small, get the 12 mini. It is smaller then the screen size implies. ",
