            "answer_text": " Everyone has an opinion on this. Actually I lied. A lot of people don\u2019t know what a browser is. When they turn on a tablet, phone, or computer they ask things like \u201cWhere\u2019s the internet?\u201d.  For these people a browser is just \u201cthe internet\u201d, and they probably don\u2019t really know or care which one they are using.  Because you asked this question, I assume this isn\u2019t you. Everyone with an opinion on this topic has good reasons for their opinions. There are no modern browsers, at least among the popular crowd (Chrome, Firefox, IE (or whatever they\u2019re calling it now), Safari) that is absolutely terrible. Yes, even IE is no longer absolutely terrible.  For years it was. Microsoft defeated Netscape and IE became the default browser choice for most people. It wasn\u2019t even a choice, it came with the computer so they used it. They didn\u2019t know about anything else, and they had no reason to switch even if they did.  Then Microsoft got complacent. They sat on IE and did nothing for years. Kind of like poor people who get a car in good working order, after a few years of no maintenance it is spewing blue smoke and struggling to start.  This made room for new browsers. The project now known as Firefox was one of the first good ones. I used it for years. It was more secure and let users customize it with all sorts of extensions. It is still secure and has a great ecosystem of extensions.  To answer your question about the best browser, I\u2019m not going to get very technical. I\u2019m not going to talk about web standards or rendering speed or even security against malware. It\u2019s not that these things aren\u2019t important, it\u2019s that any reasonably modern browser does a reasonably decent job of all of these things. The average user probably won\u2019t notice a difference. I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s best for you, but I can tell you how I made my browser decision. Like any decision, it is always subject to change, but so far, I\u2019m sticking to my choice.  I used Firefox for years. But changes happen. Mobile happened.  Around the time I got my first Android phone, I saw that it came with a browser that I hadn\u2019t played with much up to that point; Chrome. It did its job. It was a browser on a phone, so that job is pretty simple. But like a Trojan horse, it opened the doors to me using Chrome on my computers as well.  The killer feature that got me? Was it security? No. I\u2019m good enough at technology that I was already not getting viruses and malware from the web. Extensions? Again, no. I actually lost the functionality of some of the extensions I had on Firefox. Speed? It did seem faster on the PC than Firefox, but some of that was probably attributed to my long list of installed extensions. A nice bonus, but not the reason I switched.  The reason I switched? Cross device sync. I know other browsers now support similar features and run on Android, but at the time, using Chrome on the PC was the easiest way to have all my bookmarks, history, and saved passwords with me wherever I went. People can make an equally valid (or invalid, depending on your perspective) for any of the other major browsers. That\u2019s sort of the point. People have choices in this area, and you can\u2019t go too far wrong with any of them. ",

            "answer_text": "I would choose the Brave Browser for a few reasons. It\u2019s built on Chromium (the open source foundation for Chrome). Makes it very similar in ease of use, but with many upgrades.It is more secure, blocks ads and trackers, and your data is not compromised.It is much faster than alternatives. Up to 8 X faster than Chrome.I\u2019ll explain each of those points in more detail below. The most important to me is that my info is not compromised and the increase in speed. I switched to Brave Browser from Chrome about two months ago. I\u2019ll admit it, what drew me in was the idea of generating some passive income(getting paid to browse). We\u2019ll get into that later. What I\u2019ve noticed\u2026. There are SO MANY other reasons to use the browser. Don\u2019t believe me? Let\u2019s take a look: Brave is built on Chromium (open source foundation of Chrome). So it is very similar and equally easy to use. But it also offers many benefits that make it better than Chrome: The Brave Browser offers users a higher speed while browsing and more security throughout the process. The team includes Brendan Eich and Brian Bondy. As far as speed goes, Brave browser is between 2 to 8 times faster than chrome.That means that mobile users require as much as 50% less data usage while browsing. This could save the average user $23 a month in data charges. The speed increase is a direct result of less time spent loading ads and trackers on web pages.  2. Security is a huge improvement from other browsers, which readily hand over your data to advertisers. The Brave Browser accomplishes this by: Blocking ads and trackersBlocking phishingHTTPS upgradesNo storage of personal data BAT is a cryptocurrency used to power a new online advertising ecosystem behind the Brave Browser. Brave Browser aims to replace the current advertising ecosystem which heavily rewards middlemen like Google and Facebook. Google takes an estimated 73% of ad revenue. Brave does this by stripping away ads from web pages and, in the future, replacing them with its own ad network (users can opt in to this and receive compensation). The end result is publishers/creators walking away with a larger percentage of ad revenue, and users like you and I being paid to watch ads if we so desire. Brave will use it\u2019s own cryptocurrency, the Basic Attention Token, to accomplish this. Brave users are given BAT\u2019s when they initially download the browser. They can donate these tokens to advertisers whose content they enjoy (or set the browser to automatically reward creators whose content they give the most attention to). Brave\u2019s new advertising network will also distribute BAT to publisher\u2019s and creators whilst taking a smaller cut for itself (so they claim). This leads to a more efficient advertising ecosystem that rewards content creators and content viewers for participating.  The team behind this project has an immense amount of experience:   Brendan is the creator of Java Script, the coding language that underpins just about everything on the internet. Brian co-founded Mozilla Firefox, his experience in this industry speaks for itself. Here\u2019s a full review of the browser if you\u2019d like to learn more.  ",
