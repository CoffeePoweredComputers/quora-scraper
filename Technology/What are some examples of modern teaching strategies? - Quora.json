            "answer_text": "Some teaching strategies have been around since the development of the modern education system (think cooperative learning and math puzzles) but others are uniquely suited to address modern classrooms. Blended learning combines online learning with traditional classroom instruction. Students in a blended learning program take certain courses entirely online, and develop technology skills alongside traditional academic ones. There are a number of different ways to bring blended learning to your classroom, but some common methods include implementing learning stations and putting certain lessons online in part or entirely.Media literacy gives students the skills to recognize bias and use critical thinking within the context of classroom subjects.
