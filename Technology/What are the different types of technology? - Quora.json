There is lot of technology but I am going two.for more detail you can go to given Techno Archives | huntsends .since technology can be so simple or so complex, there are many types of technology. One type is mechanical technology, which includes wheels, cams, levers, gears, belts, and engines. Things that turn, or allow motion in one direction to cause a different kind of motion, are mechanical. The wheel is probably one of the most important technological advances in human history, and yet it's super simple. Perhaps the type of technology that we're most familiar with in modern life is electronic technology, usually just called electronics, which is a complex form of technology that uses electric circuits to achieve a goal.describe only two Since technology can be so simple or so complex, there are many types of technology.

            "answer_text": "Basically, Technology is the collection of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers of communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. Technology is the application of scientific knowledge to the practical aims of human life or, as it is sometimes phrased, to the change and manipulation of the human. Hope you understand what is considered to be a technology and how technology is defined. Thanks for reading and have a great day. ",
