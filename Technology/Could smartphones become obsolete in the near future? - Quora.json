            "answer_text": "Eventually they will likely morph into different solutions like wrist bands or Google Glass style devices. Their ability to perform without judgement on the end user will make it difficult for them to become obsolete though. Glasses and watches will both have fit factors but I will muse on this more below!! We may not see cell phone obsolescence until an even crazier solution comes like an implant or something. How and why wrist bands or glasses? Caveat: Technology will have to increase so these alternate solutions can compete with our consumer needs while fitting our weight and size needs etc. This is a hypothetical talk assuming we define the cell phone as a device that stays a flat black mirror going forward.\u00a0Caveat 2: Virtual personal assistants will have to become much better so that alternate devices will have a similar or easier use without an input interface requiring our fingers, eyes, or both. \u00a0Caveat 3: air pods by Apple exist and they are amazing, they play audio, record your voice surprisingly well, while being mobile, rechargeable and simply a great product.  A similar product may need to be used to get the best experience out of our future alternate devices below. \u00a0Wrist watches are convenient, so is a personal assistant that can place calls, send messages, and write letters on your behalf while you dictate the message. The amount of screen that could fit onto your wrist could be just enough to allow a user to have a rather spartan alternate experience relying mostly on the digital assistant and the watch as a quick time/notification checker and miscellaneous status display interface. Also the wrist watch would be the backbone powerhouse that airpods connect to. Battery life, interface, and virtual assistant are the biggest issues I see here. If this future become more of a reality then some folks may become two watch consumer so they have no down time while one watch charges. Glasses are still bought worn and sold for various reasons despite LASERS! This futuristic device was already created by Google and it was a flop in the consumer market. It was before its time. The discussion about the product became a deeply tumultuous talk about privacy rights, and more. This style device has a lot of promise. The wrist watch style alternate described above takes a step away from cameras and screens being a big important and integral part of the device and use, thus described as a more spartan experience. The glasses can be more of a does it all solution, but glasses have a few concerns more over than the watch. They will be more susceptible to constraints regarding weight and size. They will also have more health and safety concerns. The glasses will eventually be able to provide a various degree of experiences though from a head up display to an alternate reality experience or possibly a full vr like experience, depending on retina projection technology advancements. BOTH? We could experience both of these alternates in the future with the wrist watch as a daily commuter style of device and the glasses being an entertainment style device, but who knows. This is something I have thought about as I like to tinker with end user products to better suit my needs, or discover products that perfectly fit my needs and this stuff is fun, but I need to move on from this question, for now.

At first they will do simpler functions such as controlling seizure attacks. Or aid in muscle motor control. But as time goes on they will become more and more advance your PC, CELL PHONE, GPS, VIDEO GAMES, TV and VR will all be on one little chip smaller than a postage stamp inside your head. You will be physically linked to a network. Today the majority would not except this but tomorrow it would be so common that you would be considered an out cast to humanity without it. Just think no more down time cause your laptop or cell needs recharged. Down fall NO more privacy of any kind even in bed. No more lying or deception especially by politicians. Public knowledge of everything you know. Computer vireos could become fatal. KNOW what your partner is really thinking and if they cheated on you and with whom. Kids not being able to sneak out at night anymore And many more. The sad thing about it we would slowly wing into this so that to the people growing up with it. It would be normal. Say 10 or 20 generations later we become the BORG. ",

With technological advancements that is going at rapid pace, A.I, Machine Learning, the invention of bendable display and even smaller components that fits into tiny silicone, one day smartphone is going to be obsolete. Next time people doesn't even need to hold a thing (smartphone) to connect to internet and to get information. They can just ask, get the audio (think like AirPods, but smarter, better, perhaps smaller) and visualization directly (via smart glasses) or even smart soft lenses. I hope I can see that day coming!

There were no monthly bills to put us all in debt, we didn't worry about the reception if you found one that wasn't beat up, it worked. They say on-line that the adults now, 30% have never seen or used one of these, so only 7 out of 10 people looking at this, this was our public phones for a very long time. At times they were a lifesaver. I know of one that saved my life. Bleeding from a car wreck, nothing was around but this phone and a closed down business. I was able to have the operator call for help and I never lost a signal. I wonder what all the operators are doing now? Retired by now I guess. I know theres been times my cell phone was dead this would have been a sight for sore eyes.  ",

It also depends on the battery.. when the battery dies, the phone is nearly obsolete unless you can get it replaced.. getting an iPhone X battery replaced by yourself is not easy nor cheap. Android phones last longer despite not getting new software updates, the app store will still allow the user to install new apps and update them, regardless of the OS version. As long as you take care of your phone, the phone will last decades. Phones nowadays are becoming \u201cgood enough\u201d and many users are not buying new phones every year. ",
