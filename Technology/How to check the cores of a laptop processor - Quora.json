            "answer_text": "If you are using a laptop of windows 7, 8.1, 10. Then you can just open the task manager and see the logical cores and threads\u2019 of your CPU. And even see how much percentage is your CPU is working in your PC in per 60 sec. And also you can check what CPU are using here and also the gen and the tier of the gen you are using. Plus you can also see other things too like the memory is been used etc. This the most easy and detailed way to go when using a windows\u2019 laptop and desktop. Have a nice day. ",
