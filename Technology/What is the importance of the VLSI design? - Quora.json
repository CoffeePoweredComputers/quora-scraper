            "answer_text": "VLSI Design reduces the size of circuits also the effective cost of the devices, the operating speed of circuits is increased and it requires less power than discrete components and are very small in size. In today's world VLSI chips are widely used in various branches of Engineering like Voice and Data Communication networks, Digital Signal Processing, Computers, Commercial Electronics, Automobiles, Medicine and many more. To be a part of this Industry requires strong command on basics as well as good hand on knowledge of latest skills. To get basic knowledge on VLSI , the best way is to take up the Online VLSI courses from MAVEN SILICON starting at just \u20b9500. elearn.maven-silicon.com These courses cover the overview of VLSI and explains VLSI technology, SoC design, Moores law and the difference between ASIC and FPGA. With this overview, it walks you through all the steps of complete VLSI Design flow and explains every step in detail. Then it covers the complete digital design, combinational, sequential and FSM designs. And finally it trains you extensively on Verilog HDL programming and makes you a hands-on RTL designer. The benefits of this Online VLSI Course are: - Affordable Online VLSI Course - Online course with Projects, Labs and support material* - Course Delivered by Industry Experts - Certificate with Grade on successful completion of the course - Avail scholarship on certification for job oriented Advanced classroom courses VLSI Intro | VLSI Design Flow | Digital | Verilog HDL | EDA Tools | Verilog Labs | Verilog Project | Certificate Reach us at 9741519977 to explore more\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Electronics is the relation between input and output.  In Electronics between the Input and output, Electronic components and connections (Circuits) are there.  These circuits can be divided into two parts. Discrete - Where Electronic components are inserted and soldered on a PCB. Then the connections are given as per the Circuit diagram. 2. IC (Integrated Circuit) - Where Electronic components and connections are printed (fabricated) on a Silicon and put it on a base and packaged it properly.  Since Engineers are putting crores of Transistors inside an IC, the discrete circuits are vanished from the Electronics filed. Today Electronics field is using only ICs. The ICs are designed using various Software tools. There are few processes involved in this method. FrontendBackend.In Frontend DesignVerificationIn backend Place and RouteFabrication.All these things belongs to VLSI Flow. So if VLSI design is not there,there is no IC. If there is no IC, no Electronic equipments like TV, Smart phone, Computers, etc. I hope you understand the need of VLSI. All the best. ",
