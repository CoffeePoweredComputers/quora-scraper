            "answer_text": "Leonardo would probably have been a sensitive, nature-loving person, with powerful spatial perception. The depth of expression in his paintings reflects this, although painting was only a small part of his life. He was primarily an inventor and a natural philosopher. He conducted dissections on corpses to understand the workings of the human body, and was the first to sketch a foetus in the womb. His work on optics is less known, but it was very influential, and would certainly have influenced his art. He could have been dyslexic; he wrote with his left hand in reverse script - or mirror script. He probably did this to protect his work from others, as it was potentially heretical at times. He has been called a procrastinator, in that he often left work unfinished, but this could also have been because he had so much going on at once that some of his commissions were shelved in favour of other things he probably found more urgent or fascinating. He was a true polymath, a product of his time. The Italian Renaissance produced such individuals because it was a time of enquiry and change, but coming as he did from such inauspicious beginnings (he was an illegitimate child from a broken family), Leonardo\u2019s natural curiosity would surely have meant that he would make his mark regardless of the opportunities he had.

Kind of a dare devil. He liked to dress really well and they called him a dandy . For what ever reason, Oscar Wild comes to mind. He was definitely a perfectionist , par excellence ; factidious too the point of nurotism and cleary a workaholic,, running from an internal deamon type, very likely OCD and showed symtoms of ADD without the H. Extremely sensitive with a very active mind. Curiously, he was likely extremely focused and or really not; possibly lost in thought at times which is an ADD trait. Staying on task was an issue and loosing interest a problem do to boredom. He had a big time tender spot of his mother and or mothers and it reflects in his Mona Lisa. He tolerated his father, but had a lot of distain for his type. Probably had a love hate relationship with his father and dysfunctional relationships with his lovers and students . Probably child like and a bit of a joker. Pretty Italian in that he probably loved to entertain and or being entertained. Clearly a people watcher. ",

However records show he had great manners, was very charming and a very calm person(in contrast to Michelangelo who had little patience for others) . I personally think (from all i read about him) that he was very suspicious and distrustful towards others. We have to note that he was anonymously charged which something for which the penalty could be very harsh. Experiencing this at a young age makes you more reserved and careful how you ac,t so you wouldn't end up in a life threatening situation again . ",
