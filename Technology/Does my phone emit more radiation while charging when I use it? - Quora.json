            "answer_text": "The charging program for phones is designed to get the battery up to full capacity in the most efficient manner possible, as well as helping to condition the battery for maximum life. This involves using \u201cpulsed DC\u201d (direct current - as opposed to alternating current), which delivers bursts of high charge current many times per second. Batteries used to be charged simply with steady voltage DC, which takes longer and doesn\u2019t help improve the overall life of the battery. The charging waveform would emit very tiny amounts of relatively low frequency RF (radio-frequency) energy, so technically, there might be a very slight increase in emissions compared to when the phone is not charging. Charging occurs at the maximum rate possible, whether the phone circuitry is drawing current or not - so the answer is no. It will, obviously, take a little longer to charge the battery if some of the incoming energy is being siphoned off in order to operate the phone. These are only of theoretical interest, since the RF coming from phones has NO proven harmful effects to biologic entities (like us).

            "answer_text": "It is less radiation than a lightbulb gives out, that is the maximum amount it gives out. Same with wifi, if you somehow got your wifi router to be 1000x more powerful, it would not even be a fun lit lightbulb, you would probably think it was off. These radiations are so small compared to the sun and earth give out that it has no effect on you what so ever. Think your thigh is warmer where the phone is? Put a book in your pocket, you will be warmer on that spot, not because of radiation but because you have something in your pocket. Feel your ear getting warmer, similar effect but also, your phone gets warmer when in use, the components can get warmer. Just because there is this word, radiay, does not equal radioactive. You are bathed in radiation all day, every day, even inside a concrete building. Lightbulbs, radio and all that other stuff, but the radiation coming from space, sun and from earth is much greater. But the thing is, it does not affect you. This is what we are used to. ",
