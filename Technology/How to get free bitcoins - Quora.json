            "answer_text": "5 Ways to Get Free Bitcoins Do you wonder where you can get some free bitcoins? For many of us, the discovery of Bitcoin is like the discovery of organic foods. We can see the benefits of using them but find it difficult to justify the cost, and then there is the risk that we\u2019ll be getting a bad deal since we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. In Bitcoin, it\u2019s like every organic food store has someone out front, offering free samples. Also, there\u2019s a library everywhere you look, but only a few of those libraries have any good information. The largest traders would benefit a great deal if everyone just jumped blindly into Bitcoin, investing large chunks of their life savings in the process. That would be just fine by them, but it\u2019s unlikely to happen. More likely, people are going to get involved with Bitcoin either by necessity, by chance or because someone was willing to give them a few bitcoins to get started with. Now, before we begin discussing the places out there to get free Bitcoin, let\u2019s just be clear: there is no way to get wealthy without working or investing for it. It is impossible to make an income in bitcoins or any other currency just by clicking around on some websites. However, that being said, cryptocurrencies are unique in that clever marketers can make a profit doing exactly that, giving away money. This would not be possible in other currencies, where they simply can\u2019t be broken down small enough. The operator will usually make less than a penny. If they were forced to give you a penny or more, there\u2019d be no way to be profitable. Getting free bitcoins is not a way to get rich, and certainly not the most profitable use of one\u2019s time, but if you\u2019ve got some free time and would like to pick up a small amount of extra Bitcoin now and then, then this definitive guide will is a great place to start. 1. REPUTABLE FAUCETS Bitcoin faucets have been around since at least 2011. It is believed that Gavin Andresen owned the first one. They come and go and often enough are just advertising scams \u2013 the owners want users on their site so they tempt them with free Bitcoin that never actually materializes because before the users have made enough to \u201ccash out\u201d the site has disappeared. Additionally, it\u2019s hard to judge a Bitcoin faucet, especially if you are a newcomer. The author once participated in faucets. He recalls that when he started, they were giving out up to .002 BTC per request. Most faucets pay out once a week, but Free Bitcoin Wallet, Faucet, Lottery and Dice! seems to be the most legitimate one we can recommend. They apparently pay out once per week or whenever the user has reached a certain threshold. They have a whole system within the site, and a patient user with more time than money could conceivably earn some real cold, hard satoshi. 2. GO SHOPPING Rewards programs are a good use of cryptocurrencies, specifically tokens of the modern epoch, and one that might keep on giving is one that pays in Bitcoin. A network called BitcoinGet has a shopping service called CoinRebates which has a few major retailers including Walmart and Newegg within its network. You earn a varying amount of \u201cbits\u201d (100 satoshi = 1 bit) per dollar spent at each of the retailers. Walmart and others have in-store pickup, so you can effectively do your regular shopping and get a small Bitcoin rebate on it. Over time, this could really build up. 3. READ BOOKS Readers may remember CCN\u2019s coverage of Paid Books, a site run by the friendly folks behind Bitcoin Aliens. It has the same functionality as a regular faucet, but instead pays users for reading classic books. It is one of the more interesting and engaging methods of giving away free money, as it gives the user the opportunity to engage in more ways than simply getting around a CAPTCHA and pressing a couple of buttons. Since we first wrote about PaidBooks, they seem to have converted to Bitcoin Cash via a service called AirDrips. BCH is easily converted to Bitcoin, if desired, via services like ShapeShift. You create an accout at AirDrips and then you are able to read books and get paid. They also offer other similar things such as watching videos for money. 4. INSTALL APPS A newer way to earn Bitcoin is to test applications on phones and tablets. Various app developers pay to have their app installed and tested, and sites like CoinBucks forward some of their commission. 5. GAMBLE Most dice websites allow the user to have a free balance to play with, albeit a very small amount. Examples of sites that do this are PrimeDice and 999Dice. Whether you\u2019ll be able to play the actual games depends on your jurisdiction, though you can often withdraw the money you\u2019ve earned for free regardless of where you live. It is possible to research dice strategies and take the free amount and turn it into a substantial amount of money if you\u2019re willing to invest the time. The author once took a 0.000005 faucet payout and turned it into .1 BTC, which was over $30 at the time. Other types of casinos also exist in the Bitcoin world. CloudBet offers a 1:1 deposit bonus for which you must successfully gamble the funds you deposit several times over in order to cash out the bonus. They offer sports betting as well as regular casino games \u2013 even live ones with dealers over video chat and such. Stake, a much newer entrant in the crypto gambling space, has a faucet in five currencies that allow the user to get started. If you\u2019re great at Blackjack or Roulette, you could conceivably work your way up to being able to withdraw. If you fail, you can try again. ======================================= But Bitminer is the best free bitcoin eraning site i eran .0264654516BTC every 10 minits if want this cheek this video ==================================== ",
