            "answer_text": "Short answer: zero. Or under 700 dollars (setting up a C-Corp if you want VC money using one of cheap & efficent online services - google online legal startup legal services - & a few other legal docs, hosting, emails and etc). Depending on the type of the business and how much you have to pay for the basics. Long answer: if you have partners and want to do it the right way for the long haul, start at zero at the beginning. If you want to start a startup just for the sake of it, I suggest you to take a step back, think of it as a project, because as soon as you start looking at your work as a company, the pressure of having sales, etc builds up & you forget the basic elements of having a good product & doing enough research/work/iterations to get to a good product market fit. So think of your idea as a project that's supposed to turn into a good product that a small number of people including yourself would love to use, so it can solve one of the problems you're dealing with. After a bunch of test users, some research and effort to make small sales, you have a proof of concept and enough time to worry about costs associated with setting up your business, patents, hosting, contracts, etc. Once you get to know your cofounders, understand how to sell, legal issues, etc you can spend reasonable money on patents, legal stuff, to pass your initial stages.

            "answer_text": "From zero (0) to 1K. In my case, it took about $750 to start a remote tech company, and I\u2019m sharing the exact expenses I made (and why I made them) via the link above. If you\u2019re a service-based business (IT service company), you can start with zero and then make only those expenses that are absolutely NEEDED for your business. You will see them along the way: maybe it\u2019s extra servers for your tasks and projects, maybe it\u2019s legal issues, or sales tools, etc. If you plan to start a product-based business, then you\u2019ll have to invest into the creation of your tool/product. If you\u2019re a developer yourself, you will only have to invest your TIME into the creation of a pilot version of your product, and only then it will cost you some significant amount to develop it into a solid product. I\u2019m sharing all the tips of starting a remote IT company on my YT channel - you are welcome to check it out. Good luck with your business! ",
