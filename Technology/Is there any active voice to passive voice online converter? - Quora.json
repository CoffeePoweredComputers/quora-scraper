            "answer_text": "Most grammar checkers do the opposite, with varying degrees of intelligence, but to answer your question: I, too, am surprised to see that there's an app for that. Unlike most of your earlier respondents, though, I CAN imagine its usefulness not only as a cheat for exercises your English teacher assigns (in which case you will wind up \u201cpestering\u201d Quora for answers some of the earlier responders think should be obvious), but also as a quick reminder of HOW to convert to passive voice (a reminder because, like a thesaurus, it shouldn't be followed slavishly, but consulted for examples you can imitate) should the need ever arise. And the need WILL arise. For instance, in the previous sentence, I wrote \u201cshouldn't be followed\u201d instead of \u201cyou shouldn't follow\u201d because I began with a comparison to a thesaurus and needed to name the Voice Converter immediately to make the comparison logical\u2014first from Like to Like, second in relation to the predicate of that sentence. I COULD have written \u201ca reminder only, because you shouldn't follow it slavishly, but use it as you would a thesaurus, for examples you can imitate,\u201d but that construction 1) is wordier and, well, jerky; 2) switches the emphasis from the Voice Converter to you (inappropriately, given your question); 3) requires \u201conly\u201d or a similarly limiting modifier to supply the bit of meaning that disappeared with the switch of emphasis; and 4) sounds preachy, because no one except that challenge-loving rebel inside us likes to hear \u201cyou should.\u201d Having said all this, I find I DO want to preach. We prefer active to passive voice because writing is already so much more abstract than speech that making it approximate the immediacy of speech is hard work. Active voice is more immediate than passive. Find or invent a few short clauses and try each in both voices. Compare how present they make you feel. Once you understand why we prefer active in the sentence base, see how much backstory you can sneak into one good passive construction. You can usually condense a paragraph into a subordinate clause or even into one carefully chosen past participle. I can go on and on about this, so I'd better stop before I tempt fate. N.B.1. I am addressing your request for information, not any underlying or unexpressed motive for it, and simultaneously taking on the \u201crules\u201d of \u201cproper\" English. N.B.2. I don't think a thesaurus is a very good comparison, but I DO have to go make lunch. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know of any app or software that can alter verbs or suggest edits without analyzing your document. MS Word usually picks it up in the grammar check. If it doesn't, you just need to change your setting from the default to the most formal setting. If you're having trouble with passive voice, it's much easier just to learn the rule. Look for action verbs: Is whoever or whatever doing the action of the clause's verb included in the sentence and placed before the verb? (Don't get confused with participles and verbals). Passive: The store was closed. The stored was closed by Thomas. Active: Thomas closed the store. Passive voice is not past tense. Tense is how the language articulates time and condition. Passive voice only relates to word arrangement for clarity and strength. Passive voice is not a grammar error; the choice to use it is your own. However, sentences loaded with passive voice are often verbose, vague, and weak. Active voice forces you to focus on action. Some documents, like some lab reports and medical research, use it on purpose so that the people conducting the research or making business decisions are not highlighted or emphasized. Example: You are now being informed that our business has been purchased and restructured. Twenty percent of staff have been deemed redundant and unnecessary to our new mission.. You will be compensated with two weeks of severance pay. (Notice how no one has been named directly). Revision to strengthen clarity and precision with active voice: Acme, Inc. recently purchased and restructured our firm. As a result, managent must eliminate 20 percent of our department. Your severance package will include compensation for two weeks. (Much stronger, but somewhat harsh for the situation). If you are in an English class and writing essays, avoiding passive voice can help to raise your grade because by doing so, you help eliminate vague sentences and wordiness. It makes your writing become precise with sentences driven by the action of verbs. ",
