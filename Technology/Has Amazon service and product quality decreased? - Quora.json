            "answer_text": "Not in my experience, no. I find that BNBR works with customer service. I've gotten some great Amazon Basics items and I have bought 4 different Kindles. I've gotten some poor quality items from Amazon, listed by third-party sellers, and returned them. Same with clothing I didn't like. I tried a Chromebook and decided it wasn't for me. Returned it. So anyone who was banned for returning items had to really be abusing the privilege. Amazon went to bat for me with the Post Office when I had a meltdown about a delivery. Not their job but they did it. I've noticed that two day delivery now doesn't include the day I order. But often orders arrive early anyway. I recently got a case of toilet paper and after unpacking it and putting it away, realized it either wasn't 2-ply as advertised, or you would need laboratory tools to discern the plies. Called customer service and explained. I'm disabled and after dealing with 2 huge boxes and 50 rolls of toilet paper, there was no way I was going to repeat the process to return it. They refunded my money and didn't make me return the stuff. If you can beat that, I don't know how. I should mention that even on Amazon I don't order from sellers who can't be bothered to use correct English. Or those who use hyperbole instead of product information. ",
