            "answer_text": "An instant, side effect free cure for all addictive drugs. Stay with me here. 40,000 people die from drug abuse. 125,000 if you include alcohal. Or 570,000 if you include Tabacco. All these deaths could be prevented. Drug running is huge money. Drug wars killed 164,000 people since 07 in Mexico alone. This does not include El Salvador, Venezuela, or Honduras, all with higher murders counts, all of which are connected to drugs. Those deaths could be dealt with. With drugs no longer a market, many criminal cartels would simply collapse. This drug allows Law Enforcement to take away drug users, the real challenge, in massive numbers. More extreme nations could possibly mass dose unknowing people in lunches. Drug Addicts addicted to hard drugs but fearing the long programs can now deal with their addictions in under an hour. Once someone turns it into an aerosol, one could dose entire blocks. And the fact it has no side effects makes sure no one will move against it. Drug tests would be out dated. Just make every applicant take one pill. Wait an hour, and none of them are addicted to anything. And if some are not addicts, nothing happens. Once this goes down, crimes goes with it. Up to 18% of robberys are drug related. 1,488,707 people were arrested for drug code violations in 2015 alone. The prison system is heavily based around thousands or criminals, many related to drugs, coming in. We spent billions fighting drugs. Imagine if we could spent those other places. The end result would be: thousands of lives are saved, crime rates vastly go down, some of the largest crime cartels implode, prisons become less crowded, and billions are saved. Not free energy quite yet, but pretty close. ",

The current way of getting the meat from the animals is highly inefficient and cannot scale to feed to billions of people. \"We shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium.\" Ref: Cultured meat - Wikipedia 8% of the world''s water supply and one third of the world's non-ice landmass is used for raising livestock for meat and leather. At least 18% of the greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere are from the livestock industry. Firstly, we can make our planet happy. Check these numbers to see the benefit that lab-grown meat can have.  it takes 6.7 pounds of grain, 52.8 gallons of water, 74.5 square feet of land, and 1,036 Btus of fossil fuel energy for feed production, according to a recent NPR study. Take those numbers and multiply them by the 26.4 billion pounds of beef that was consumed in the US in 2010 and the environmental burden becomes catastrophic.  Lab-grown meat can redefine of the entire agriculture and livestock industries. This would have a tremendous and immediate impact on our society like never before.Reduces the carbon footprint of the livestock industry.Don\u2019t have to kill the animals \u2014not a bad side effect.The food would become so cheap that there won\u2019t be any hunger deaths in the world.Suddenly, being vegetarian is not a good thing anymore :-) You end up harming the planet more by eating vegetables!I hope the whole organic nuisance will go away!People will stop treating animals like food.Images Ref: Solve for X: Sustainable, scalable 3D printed meat ",
