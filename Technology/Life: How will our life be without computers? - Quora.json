            "answer_text": "You would be able to go to plush, air conditioned libraries with couches and big fluffy bean bag chairs that you could fit in with your girlfriend and study together. There would be people actually talking and calling each other. You would have missed calls that you never knew you got unless you had an answering machine. Less stress because you missed calls that may have stressed you out. Needing to make a call at a payphone late at night when your car breaks down in a small town and everything is closed and everybody in the town is asleep and you don\u2019t have any change. Book bags, checkbooks, savings accounts and trips to a real bank. Spelling devices with one function: Spelling. A lot more driving to places you may not have really wanted to go to but had to pick up a form or pay a bill or collect unemployment or take a test. Driving to places you\u2019ve never been and getting lost because you had a hard time reading your Thomas Guide. Going on a real blind date with no idea of how the person looked. Going to a real building to get educated instead of getting your degree \u201conline\u201d. Meeting a LOT more people because you had to go to real buildings with real people in them and places where other real people were. Writing hand written love letters to your girlfriend with a pen and paper with no spell checker and mailing them in a mailbox. Playing Pong and Pac-Man. Breaking up with your girlfriend in person while looking at each other in the eyes. Asking your new girlfriend to marry you in person while looking at each other in the eyes. Submitting your poem on a typed written piece of paper by mailing it in mailbox in an envelope with a stamp on it at the post office. Making sure to use CERTIFIED MAIL to assure that the contest administrators received your entry. Getting an envelope in the mail with a letter in it that said out of all the entries from all over the world, you didn\u2019t win, but your poem did receive honorable mention (and there were only a few of those.. ;0).

            "answer_text": "There WAS a life without computers once upon a time! Lets divide this answer into two sections. PROS: We'll realize the difference between Real World and Virtual World.We'll spend more time with our family. Vacations. Gatherings. Family functions. Fun.Love stories will have a reality. :P No more email and social media proposes. Rather the traditional methods will come into practice. Love letters, Long walks, Beach romances, Long phone calls, Shall I ask your parents?, etc. etc. Interesting?Play traditional games outside our houses instead of virtual computer games. That running on the streets, laughing, shouting. Ahh! That was Life.Thousands of books in the libraries will be referred to instead of Wikipedia.CONS: Think about a working environment without them. :ORooms piled up with documents and files.Software Engineers, Coders? oops!Digital India? :PMovies? :Dand there are many many many more that could be included in both the sections. The thought of having a life without them is too good. It feels as if only then we\"ll actually have a Life. But imagining a life without them after so much of dependence and addiction is too difficult. I'll end by adding one more to the list of CONS:   6. NO QUORA! :O ;) ",
