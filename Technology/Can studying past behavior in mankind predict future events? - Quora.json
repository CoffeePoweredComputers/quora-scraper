            "answer_text": "This initial claim does not answer the question, but history does not repeat itself, no matter how often this trope is utilized. History *cannot* repeat itself. History is what was. What *was* cannot ever be, again, what is. You are not what or who your were a second ago. Every function in your body has occurred, cells have died, replaced, and carried oxygen through your circulatory system. Neurons have died, made new connections, and fingernails have grown. However, studying widespread behaviour in humans is obviously beneficial. It\u2019s how we learn about each other and compile information that has become the fields of behavioural analysis, psychology, psychiatry, anthropology and other branches of social sciences and medical endeavours. It\u2019s why doctors are moving towards prescribing MMJ more often than fentanyl. Figuring out what is, and putting our predictions through the scientific method, is how we learn. Studying people will allow you to predict certain events. It will allow you to do what people do best: recognize patterns. The recognition of patterned behaviour allows us to \u201cpredict\u201d future behaviour given the access to recorded history. However, prediction is not equal to knowledge. We can look at all the data in the world and come up with a maximally possible conclusion, but we can still be entirely wrong about the outcome or the reasons for the outcome. I\u2019m a bit confused when you use the word \u201cevents.\u201d Do you mean events surrounding individuals or groups or do you mean events such as the direction of AI, food production practices, prediction of evolutionary direction, or the revelation of some supernatural realm. We can\u2019t do any of those type of predictions of future events. If they occur, we either guessed correctly or gained evidence of how they happened. No \u201cprediction\u201d is possible in these circumstances. Even the prediction of weather events, wars, famines, etc. can only be \u201cpredicted\u201d once they are on their way to actually occurring. An event, no matter how protracted, is a single occurrence of an activity. These occurrences form the basis of things like astrophysics, mathematics, etc.: things that can be logically deduced to form hypotheses, laws and theories. However, deduction does not equal prediction. So, my answer would be a qualified no. \u201cPast behaviour in mankind\u201d can be used to *understand* mankind and venture guesses as to what might come next, but these are still hypotheses and not facts. Human behaviour cannot predict what I understand to be what you mean by events. If you mean something else, feel free to clarify. I\u2019m always open to being totally wrong. =) ",

            "answer_text": "History does show us that mankind\u2019s past behavior repeats itself over and over and over again. Whole civilizations get destroyed not because there is something better to be offerred. It is because those who \u201chave not\u201d want what others have. In the process they ruin it for everyone. It is the rut we always fall back into and cannot seem to avoid..Warfare.. ",
