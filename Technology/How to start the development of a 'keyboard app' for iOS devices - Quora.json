            "answer_text": "Great question! You can find the official Apple documentation on custom keyboards here: App Extension Programming Guide: Custom Keyboard. I found it with a simple Google term \"ios create keyboard\" and must say that it is an intermediate-to-advanced topic. Given that you've never programmed an app before, I strongly encourage you to try something easier. Keyboard apps aren't just apps, they're custom components and do not function in a rich environment such as available to normal iOS apps. I don't want to discourage you to try out app development, rather, make sure you stay motivated to keep learning. Taking a goal that's too big to achieve is a killer for your motivation. Try this: make an app that functions like a keyboard. Fill it up with buttons and what not, and a text field. When you press the buttons, the text field should show the right data. When you've got the fundamentals right, attempt to make a custom keyboard component. I wrote a beginner course on developing iPhone apps with Swift at LearnAppMaking.com. Do check it out, it's got the fundamentals you might want to learn. Good luck! ",
