Necessities: an adequate AMOUNT of supply. An effective supply route, with pipes that do not leak. A way to supply the water at a good pressure. A way to clean the water before it is added to the system. A way to ensure that the clean water remains clean up until it reaches the customer (chloride). Testing of the water. A way to dispose/ recycle unused water. A way to recycle contaminated water (sewage). Monitoring to detect leaks. A way to collect the cost of the supply. If you are setting up a new system, a way to recycle 'grey water\u2019 within the customers system, this reduces the waste of treated water for cleaning purposes. ",

            "answer_text": "Water supply schemes are a basic necessity of every town, city or village where there is density of population. General health in a city cannot be maintained if the water supply is not introduced and maintained and supervised by the water board. Water catchment areas must be maintained properly and protected from any sources of tainting of water intake, Daily tests have to be run of samples of the water that is being fed to the public. As a student in London we visited the London Metropolitan water Board and saw all the filth coming into the floculation tanks and this included the water from Urinals in London. At the end of the tour there was this clear pool of pristine water. The tour guide took a ladle which is chained to the side of the pool and took a ladle of water and tasted it and offered it to us to taste. There were no takers from the student group who has just seen the entire purification process. So I think that answers that question? ",
