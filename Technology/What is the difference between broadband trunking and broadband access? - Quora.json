            "answer_text": "The differences between eLTE broadband trunking and eLTE broadband access are as follows: First, the field of application is different. eLTE broadband access applies to wISP (wireless local area network operator), smart city, education, smart grid, and railway. It is mainly used for data transmission services. eLTE broadband trunking applies to public security (police and internal affairs departments), military, ports, airports, subways, electric power, energy, and mines. This feature is mainly used for voice and video services. Second, different terminals are adapted. The eLTE broadband access terminal is adapted a gateway device, such as an eA660 or eA360 CPE. The CPE provides the Wi-Fi function for common users to access the Internet. The ivs camera is used as the lower-level device of the CPE to implement video surveillance on the ivs server. The smart grid can also implement smart meter reading through Wi-Fi or a lower-level device. eLTE broadband trunking terminals are adapted the handset such as EP650, EP680, and EP820, which support video, voice, SMS, and GIS services. These terminals are more similar to common mobile phones. But these terminals are customized for the industry and have feature frequency bands and functions. Besides, the information storage and the transmission are more secure and reliable. Third, the composition of the product is very different. The eLTE broadband access network consists of the NMS (eSight or U2000), core network (eCNS610 or eCNS600), base station DBS3900, and terminal (CPE). The eLTE broadband trunking network consists of the NMS (eOMC910), dispatcher (eAPP610), dispatcher (eDC), core network (eSCN230, eCNS210 or eCNS280), base station (DBS3900), and terminal (handheld such as terminal EP650, EP680, and EP820). The dispatcher system is a highlight in the eLTE broadband trunking system. If eLTE broadband access is a pipe, then eLTE broadband trunking means that trunking voice and video scheduling services are added to pipes. These services are the key points of efficiency improvement in the emergency command. In addition, the eAPP scheduling system provides the SDK interface openness. After the eSDK encapsulates the SDK interfaces of the eAPP system, afert the eSDK encapsulates the SDK interface of the eAPP system, it is easier to be integrated by third-party integrators, and promotes the expansion and application of the eLTE broadband trunking market. All of the above are personal understandings. If there are any deficiencies, please add them.
