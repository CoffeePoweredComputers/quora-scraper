            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t speak to what all of them were used for, particularly the minicomputers and mainframes. My guess is the mainframes in the \u201970s were used for what they had chiefly been used for since the 1950s, which was accounting. I remember in the 1980s seeing that they were used for storing large databases (my local library digitized their whole card catalog on one). Newspapers used them for typesetting their daily editions. Supercomputers were around in the \u201880s, and as far as I knew, they were used for running atmospheric models for research and weather prediction. As for microcomputers in the \u201870s, the only thing I remember them being used for was to run VisiCalc, which was the first spreadsheet, though Wordstar also existed, which was a word processor. In the \u201880s, that didn\u2019t really change, at least in the professional sphere. Dbase was added to that, which was a relational database package for PCs. Businesses typically used it along with a word processor and spreadsheet, creating a suite. This was usually the way computers were used during that era. Eventually businesses added the local area network (LAN) to the mix, so people could share computer data without having to put it on floppy disk. Mind you, this was all on command-line systems. Computers with graphical interfaces came out in the mid-80s, but that didn\u2019t become the standard way that people used computers until the \u201890s. Beginning in the early \u201880s, parents started buying microcomputers to do work at home. Some also bought them so their kids (typically their sons. From what I understand, parents tended to keep their daughters away from them) could use a word processor to write papers for school, and/or just a machine to play around on (probably to play video games). This was the time when a lot of budding programmers that have since started their own technology companies, or become software developers at the same, got their start, because it was expected that if you were going to use a computer, you\u2019d learn to program it at least a little. It was difficult to do much else besides run software on them without learning to program them. Every computer (with the exception of the Apple Macintosh) came with a version of the Basic language, usually from Microsoft, and part of the user manual would have instructions telling the user about it, and introduce them to the language\u2019s commands. Programming was also encouraged in the industry literature. Most computer magazines had program listings in them in Basic and assembly or machine language, at least from time to time, that readers could type in, and get some cheap software (for the price of the magazine). Starting in college (\u201888), I could use my microcomputer from my dorm room or apartment to call up what were called bulletin board systems (BBSes), which were homebrew remote-access systems that people would set up in their homes, or for their store, which they would open up to the public. Typically only one person could call them up at a time, because they\u2019d only have one phone modem hook-up, and most PCs were not set up for multitasking. This was one way I used to carry on online discussions with people, and get some public domain software for my computer. Online discussions were slow affairs, though, with BBSes. You\u2019d write something one day, and not see a response until the next day, or a few days later. Since I was a computer science major, I also had access to the internet (starting in \u201889). It was a bit of a convoluted process, though, since I didn\u2019t have direct access. I\u2019d use my phone modem to connect to the school\u2019s minicomputer systems, and access the internet from there. This way, I was able to do my programming assignments from home on the school\u2019s computers, which was a good thing, because many of us CS majors didn\u2019t have computers powerful enough to run all the different interpreters and compilers that we needed to get our assignments done. We got exposed to a bunch of different languages in CS then. By the late \u201880s, it was fairly common for students to write their school papers on word processors. That was starting to be the norm. It also seemed like schools were adopting the graphical user interface as their standard way of using computers, since Apple still dominated the education market, and after the Apple II, schools upgraded to Macintoshes.

            "answer_text": "OP: What were old computers from the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s used for? I can\u2019t add more than what Mark Miller, Chris Torkildson, Michael Lipphardt, and the others have already said, but thanks for the A2A. Your question covers a 20 year time span, so there were a huge amount of developments in computers during those decades. When comparing oranges to oranges (comparing apples might be confusing), the computers from 1989 were vastly improved over the computers of 1970. Computers in the 70s and 80s were pretty much used for the same things they are today, although with less processing speed, much lower resolution graphics (if they had graphics), less user-friendly interfaces, and at a significantly higher price tag. Computers calculated things from ballistic trajectories to animal populations, they simulated things from economic behavior to weather patters, we used them for word processing, spreadsheets, drafting, and even gaming. The main difference was in home use. In the 70s, almost no one had a computer at home; they were just too expensive unless your job demanded/paid for you to have one. As companies started cloning the IBM PC, prices dropped to the point that people could afford a computer at home. The Internet wasn\u2019t anything like it is today, and was pretty much unknown to most people, so computers weren\u2019t used for things we now take for granted like shopping and blogging\u2014although you could order things direct from some companies using your computer, and you could post information to a variety of BBSs. If you really want to know more, I highly recommend looking at The Old Computer Museum, which has a timeline of important computers, and you should also look at The Computer History Museum, where you can explore several of their exhibits online. If you\u2019re into nerdy pursuits like computers, be sure to stop by The Nerd Manual and check out my articles. ",

In the 70s many still ad bank books and you could not withdraw money without the book so the account always had at least as much as marked on the book.
