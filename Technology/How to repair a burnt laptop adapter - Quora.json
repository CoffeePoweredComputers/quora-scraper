            "answer_text": "The most common fault that makes it obvious for you to think it is burnt is the capacitor. With the smell, and sometimes the liquid electrolyte from the busted capacitor draining through. If you are lucky enough and it\u2019s just the capacitor, you can open the charger making sure it is unplugged. You can sight the capacitor by the damage most times. It is the largest cylindrical component inside. Use your soldering iron to remove it by heating the pin points of the capacitor on the other side of the board. Take the specifications of the capacitor ( \u00b5F and v) and replace with the exact rating. take note of the positive and negative legs while replacing. Solder, close and test. Anything more than this is probably worse and i\u2019ll best advice you to buy a new adapter. \u2026 and yeah, fuses are the first things we check when making such diagnoses right? ",
