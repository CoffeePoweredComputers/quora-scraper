            "answer_text": "Yes. And I will prove it below with actual searches. My one disclaimer is, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible for such a large platform to not be biased in some way, shape, or form. But there is definitely a bias to mainstream liberal viewpoints on Google. Below I show five sample searches to demonstrate. \u201cwhy i oppose donald trump\u201d vs. \u201cwhy i support donald trump\u201d The search about opposing Trump returns straightforward results about opposing Donald Trump. But it is much harder to find a straightforward defense of Trump using the opposite search term.   \u201cwhy tariffs are bad\u201d vs. \u201cwhy tariffs are good\u201d Again, Google comes right out with several articles that are unequivocally anti-tariff. For the opposite search, it is a mix with a lot of anti-tariff articles as well. This definitely supports a center-left/center-right viewpoint over the more ideological sides of the spectrum in either direction.    \u201cwhy i am pro life\u201d vs. \u201cwhy i am pro choice\u201d This one isn\u2019t as bad, but they still insert some pro-choice results in the pro-life search. I would be perfectly fine with this, but when you make the opposite search, every result in the pro-choice search pushes a pro-choice agenda.   \u201cmuslim terrorism\u201d vs. \u201cchristian terrorism\u201d\u201cwhy i love america\u201d vs. \u201cwhy i hate america\u201d These seemed pretty balanced, so I won\u2019t take up too much space with screenshots. I did want to include that I searched for these so it wouldn\u2019t be a cherry-picked post. Basically, there are some cases where the Google results seem pretty balanced. \u201cwhy the stock market will go up under trump\u201d vs. \u201cwhy the stock market will go down under trump\u201d (results through November 8, 2016 only) Here is a case where predictions are demonstrably and factually wrong. Plenty of articles about how a Trump win would be a disaster for the stock market. This is actually the worst example out of any of them. On top of the fact that all of these articles were dead wrong, you basically get the same results with two opposite searches and not a single article predicting (correctly) that Trump\u2019s win would be good for the stock market.

            "answer_text": "I also answered this on: Gennaro Cuofano's answer to Can Google be trusted to rank political websites fairly? Google is a search engine that uses over 200 factors and many more variations. The algorithm itself should not carry any bias or political view. Rather if we look at the aim of the search engine (provide the most relevant content for a particular query), then it might not always be effective in doing that. For instance, if for some reason a piece of content is better indexed compared to another (which might be more relevant) the search engine will privilege the former at the expense of the latter. In other words, my opinion is that there is no political bias, in the human sense. Meaning that the search engine doesn\u2019t know the difference between left and right. However, machines have their own biases. Therefore, if I were a search engine I would privilege a piece of content that uses better SEO tactics. Why? As a search engine I wouldn\u2019t have idea about what\u2019s good content. The only way to know would be through the signals found on-page. If a page were better indexed I might privilege that (together with other factors) independently from what\u2019s written on that page. ",

They take it very seriously, and they are not looking to manipulate the results for any nefarious purpose. YesThe algorithm is created by the people at Google. The type of data, the weight they give each signal and the way in which they process that data are all controlled by people. Those people will have some sort of bias (they're human, not robots) that will likely show up in one way or another.  Bias or not, Google still seems to provide extremely relevant results which is not nearly as easy as it looks. ",

Could their algorithm be improved? Sure, can we as webmasters improve as well? Absolutely. I have personal experience with paid search for a few major accounts where we were able to detect irregular patterns of traffic and conversion. Google is excellent at responding and refunding if necessary on the paid search site. On the organic side, they do give more weight to trustworthy brands who have a long history in the results and massive visibility online. You might call it bias, I just call it algorithm and in most cases it makes perfect sense. ",
