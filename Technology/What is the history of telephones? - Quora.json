            "answer_text": "When I were a lad in England, telephones were big, black bakelite devices \u2013 which connected rich people to other rich people, via an operator. For the rest of us, there were street phones. For the SUPER-rich, they made phones in a couple of other colours \u2013 but they were pretty rare. So much so that today, genuine WHITE bakelite period phones in good condition are highly collectible. But everybody \u2013 even the rich \u2013 had to play by the rules. You could only use GPO equipment. You could not turn its loud bell OFF. You had to answer with your NUMBER \u2013 not just say \u201chello\u201d \u2013 and you had to group the numbers THEIR way. And all calls went through operators, in three minute blocks. This last was a PAIN if you wanted to call ABROAD. You had to BOOK your call with the operator \u2013 who would ring you when she (it was always a \u201cshe\u201d) eventually had the call ready. Then, after three minutes, she would interrupt and ask you if you wanted to pay for another three minutes (assuming the extra time was AVAILABLE). And since a three minute call to a foreign country cost more than that country\u2019s national debt, this meant many calls got terminated just BEFORE the people concerned could say a proper goodbye. This authoritarian system was run by a government department called the General Post Office. And, tragically, this system was STILL in place when the Sixties arrived. In movies and on TV, people now used swanky, high-tech telephones \u2013 but in reality, YOU still only had that big, black bakelite bugger. Oh, you could BUY the swanky phones \u2013 from a handful of specialist shops \u2013 you just could not USE them on the GPO system. Well \u2013 in theory. In practise \u2013 if you knew a tame telephone engineer, you could get him (it was always a \u201chim\u201d) to connect one of these models to your system as an extension \u2013 but if anything went wrong with your service, you had to get him to quickly DISCONNECT it \u2013 before the GPO engineer turned up. This was because if said engineer discovered it, he would report back to the GPO \u2013 who would CUT YOU OFF for your transgression. It was not until the VERY late Sixties that \u2013 with the speed of an arthritic snail \u2013 the GPO (now just the PO) began to catch up with the second half of the twentieth century. It started with the Trimphone. These were light, slimline phones which \u201ctrilled\u201d instead of ringing (which anyone with a parrot soon discovered was a DRAWBACK \u2013 since their pets could accurately IMITATE the ring). You could also get them in a variety of colours.And whilst you still could not turn their bell (or rather, warble) OFF \u2013 you could at least turn it DOWN. Plus, for the first time, there were phones with PUSH-BUTTONS. But since the \u201ctone\u201d system was not yet in place, all that happened was a small chip would store the numbers pushed and convert them into the series of pulses needed to work the GPO\u2019s antique Strowger exchanges. Eventually however, the pulse system began to be replaced by tones and \u201cdirect dialing\u201d replaced those nosey OPERATORS. Enter Thatcher. In the early Eighties, Thatcher\u2019s right-wing government began selling off all of Britain\u2019s nationalised industries \u2013 starting with the utilities \u2013 to private companies. This resulted in DISASTER for most of them \u2013 but was a shot in the arm for the telephone business. At least \u2013 initially. At this point, the writer has to make it clear that all following references to British Telecom are taken from personal experience and are therefore offered as OPINION \u2013 not fact. BT began promisingly, replacing all of the (mostly broken) street phones with shiny NEW models. They then brought out a range of new phones \u2013 which you could even UNPLUG. At this point, the rest of the World \u2013 sensing that Britain was FINALLY entering the second half of the twentieth century \u2013 began exporting modern phones to it. They had FEATURES \u2013 like last number redial, hands-free operation, number storage (speed-dial) \u2013 and you could finally turn the damn ringers OFF. Which is where things STALLED \u2013 as BT began issuing demands that these phones earn their official APPROVAL before being connected to their system. The \u201cgreen labels\u201d scheme was begun. But since many of them were manufactured in the Orient, where companies were not regulated, they ALL ended up having said labels \u2013 whether they had \u201cearned\u201d them or not. The same was true of the new \u201ccordless phones\u201d that began to emerge. These had a base unit, with a mobile handset (with rechargeable batteries that were topped up every time you replaced it into the base unit) which could transmit and receive calls via said base unit from a range of about a hundred yards. Unfortunately, the frequencies which these devices used were limited in number \u2013 which meant your call could often be heard by OTHER cordless phone users \u2013 and anybody nearby who was listening to FM radio \u2013 plus they would drive radio-controlled toys CRAZY. And ALL of these phones were now available EVERYWHERE \u2013 from Argos to Tesco. Of course, BT had THEIR shops \u2013 where only \u201capproved\u201d phones (mostly THEIRS) were on sale. They had DOZENS of customers. In fact, as the Eighties gave way to the Nineties, BT began to fall out of favour generally \u2013 particularly when \u201cde-regulation\u201d began. At this point, OTHER service providers were allowed to enter Britain \u2013 and the British finally discovered they were being RIPPED OFF. This was because \u2013 particularly on POPULAR routes \u2013 they charged a FRACTION of the cost that BT still charged for foreign calls. Indeed, using one of these services, it was cheaper to call AMERICA than it was to call the NEXT TOWN \u2013 on a BT line. However, BT still had their ace-in-the-hole. Only THEY could connect up a line to a dwelling \u2013 thus getting connected cost you a FORTUNE. They justified this extortionate charge by pointing out it was STANDARD. I.e., while they charged you over a hundred pounds just to throw a switch at their exchange, they charged the SAME price if you lived MILES from their network and they had to run a line, on poles \u2013 over a MOUNTAIN. Great, if you were a HERMIT. Furthermore, even if you used an alternate SP (and with your own phone) BT still got their quarterly LINE RENTAL \u2013 which was not cheap. And they had ANOTHER trick up their sleeve. They introduced the \u201cnon-geographical\u201d service. This was where COMPANIES would be given numbers, which callers would be charged a flat rate to use (local, or national). They gave preferential rates to said companies \u2013 who LAPPED it up. But for the caller, it meant they HAD to use BT to call these companies. The alternate SPs were effectively CUT OUT. However, more moves were afoot \u2013 MOBILE phones. These had begun in the Eighties. Originally, the phones were the size of a house-brick and you had to sign up to an expensive contract to own one. Thus people used to talk on them in loud voices, in streets and on trains \u2013 just to demonstrate to those around them that they HAD one. Those people were roundly HATED. Cars began to get them too. Indeed, some people even bought empty plastic boxes that LOOKED like car phones \u2013 just to IMPRESS people. They were called \u201ccar phonies\u201d. Unfortunately, the joke wore thin when an owner returned to their car to discover someone had broken into it to NICK their phone \u2013 and upon finding it was BOGUS, had left something unmentionable on their SEAT. Nevertheless, as happens with all of these things, eventually competition drove prices down and pretty soon EVERYBODY had a mobile \u2013 from tramps to priests, undertakers to butchers, etc. to etc. Which, two decades ago, was the point THIS writer got one \u2013 just before he managed to ESCAPE cold, wet, miserable, over-priced Broken Britain. The last he knows about The Phones In Britain (The Romans In Britain? \u2013 never mind) is that many people were DUMPING BT and their overpriced \u201cland-lines\u201d \u2013 in favour of just having a MOBILE. BT were circling the drain. But that was before the INTERWEB took off. And with it came something we had only DREAMED of in the Sixties \u2013 VIDEO-PHONE. And it was FREE. However, that damn DELAY \u2013 and the fact people have no time to FORMULATE conversations \u2013 has rendered it less than popular. Certainly, the young prefer TEXTING. Their conversations may be unintelligible \u2013 but at least they have time to COMPOSE them. But whether you are young or old \u2013 you now have a computer (if not, what are you reading THIS on?) \u2013 and thanks to those, the borders between communication, entertainment and information are breaking down. However, the one thing ALL these media need is a CONNECTION. The woods are FULL of networks, these days. And with \u201cTV On Demand\u201d finally having become a reality, those networks are going to need their broadband to be SERIOUSLY broad. The technology can barely keep up. And given BT\u2019s past performance \u2013 one doubts it has a rat\u2019s chance in hell of being at the forefront of this Brave New World. One last thing - since you've STAYED with this (1,500-odd words) here is a REWARD - The History Of The Telephone In 53 Seconds...  ",
