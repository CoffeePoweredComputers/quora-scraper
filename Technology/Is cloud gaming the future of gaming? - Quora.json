            "answer_text": "No it isn\u2019t, and it isn\u2019t going to be. You could have the world\u2019s fastest internet connection streaming hundreds of terabytes of data per second and it wouldn\u2019t matter worth a damn, because what\u2019s important is not how many bytes you can send or receive in a second, it\u2019s how fast each byte gets from A (your device) to B (your ISP) to C (the cloud gaming server) and then back through B all the way to A again.And electric signals always move at the same speed (barring extreme temperatures beyond even the abilities of the climate changes of Greta Thunbergs worst nightmares), which means that over whatever the physical cable distance is, it will always take the same amount of time for your button press to be sent to the game server.What you can achieve through technological developments is better and faster video encoding of each image frame (and audio data) that must then be sent back from C through B to A and will always take more time per frame than any button press.This means you\u2019re going to have a substantial delay between your button press and you seeing what the button press does on your screen.What\u2019s even worse is that the game\u2019s AI doesn\u2019t take into account that there is going to be a substantial time gap between them doing something (like attacking you) and their action being shown on your screen, which means you\u2019re losing valuable tenths of a second of reaction time for everything that happens in the game.How do you think that\u2019s going to effect games like first person shooters? How about fighting games like Street Fighter? How about games with quick time events? How about rhythm games? Now add onto that that even the best and fastest internet connections still encounter package loss, meaning that a fraction of something like a streamed image gets lost in transit to your device.When you\u2019re streaming a movie or music or some other kind of non-interactive media, that\u2019s no big deal, that\u2019s what buffering is for. Your device will just recognize that a package it\u2019s going to need 5\u201315 seconds into the future is missing and request that the server resend it so it can be merged into the full image frame before it needs to be shown.In the case of a videogame, the game streaming server can never know what it\u2019s going to be rendering ANY amount of time into the future, so there is no such thing as buffering.So when you get package loss on a streamed game, what you\u2019ll see is skipped frames, as it just won\u2019t show the frames that there is data missing from.So for maybe a third of a second your game is going to be a still image of the gradually more and more distant past while the game still being run on the server moves on without you, until you get full frames again and warp back to what\u2019s as close to what\u2019s presently going on in the game as the service can provide. One of the big marketing selling points of cloud gaming is that the service can run your games on much more expensive and more powerful hardware so the graphical quality can be cranked up to max without you having to buy all that expensive hardware, but what\u2019s the point of that when the video encoding is going to turn it into what\u2019s at best the quality of a well encoded YouTube video.All that graphical fidelity is going to evaporate, like dew from a green blur (that would have looked like grass if it had been rendered locally), long before it ever reaches your screen. Cloud gaming is nothing but another scheme to turn games from something you own and use at your leisure into something you rent the privilege to experience until the service is dropped, and if you have any interest in gaming at all, you will reject it outright as the snake-oil abomination it is.

            "answer_text": "It will probably be a part of gaming landscape, but it will most likely not become the most important way of providing video games. I will explain. In order to be able to offer cloud gaming, the service provider will need to host gaming capable PCs (or equivalent) in a data center that is reasonably close to the gaming terminal. There are already problems with capacity management, as is evidenced by Playstation Now, which opened in my home country Finland last week. On the first week there were queues, when people wanted to play some PS3 games, but all the consoles in the data center were occupied. So, your general purpose computers do not suffice, the gaming server need to be pretty specifically equipped to run the games. Obviously the load could in theory be balanced across the globe, so when Europeans are asleep, gamers in Asia could use the service, but here we come to limitations set by physics, especially speed of light. Like I said, the nature of cloud gaming requires the data centers to be located somewhat close to the end point, because every single instruction sent from your gamepad needs to travel to the data center, where the server computes the next image and transmits that back to the terminal connected to your TV. This has to be done 30 or even 60 times every second. The distance causes latency, and every single network element \u2014 router, switch, gateway, etc \u2014 adds to that latency. If the delay between a button press and your character\u2019s action grows to be in the range of 80\u2013100 milliseconds, you will notice. Running the service will be expensive, so it cannot be offered to gamers for that much cheaper than what it would cost to buy your own console or PC. Especially the more demanding consumers will not be satisfied with the performance when compared to what is possible with a device you can have at your own home. But I can come up with at least one use case, where cloud gaming could work beside home consoles: gaming on the move. If game saves are synced to cloud, it could be possible to pick up a game on your mobile phone or tablet from where you left it. Game would run in the cloud which could be accessed over 4G network. Of course more casual gamers could be happy with an inferior technical quality, if the games catalogue were broad enough and the price reasonable. This could be another viable use case. But as the only option or even the most common one? No, I don\u2019t believe cloud gaming will ever be that. ",
