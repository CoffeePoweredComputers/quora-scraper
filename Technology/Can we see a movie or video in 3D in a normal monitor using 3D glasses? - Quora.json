            "answer_text": "When you say 3D glasses, I will assume you mean the kind that you get in movie theatres (slightly tinted, but otherwise normal, colorless glasses). These are polarizing filters, and with ordinary computer or TV displays, they won\u2019t do anything. 3D video gives you the perception of depth by showing one image to your left eye, and a different image to the right eye. The two images are recorded from two distinct camera positions, and these views represent the exact views of your left and right eye (slightly offset by the distance between the eyes). The polarised glasses you get in movie theatres have filters with the opposite polarity. 3D projectors project two polarised images (left and right) onto a special screen that reflects the light while preserving its polarity. One image has clockwise polarity, the other counter-clockwise. The glasses will receive the light reflected from the screen; one filter will filter out clokwise-polarised light, and only let through the counter-clockwise polarised light, while the other will do the opposite. If you show a 3D movie on an ordinary TV or computer display, the light will not be polarised \u2014 it will simply be linear. Both eyes will get the same image \u2014 2D. However, you can get a 3D effect and even watch 3D movies using those two-colored glasses (blue-magenta). The movie must be specifically recorded for the two-colored (also called anaglyph) encoding. There were a few 3D movies that were released on DVD in blue-magenta (or cyan-magenta) anaglyph (and you would get 2 - 4 pairs of cardboard glasses with them), but I don\u2019t think there are any movies released on Blu-ray in anaglyph 3D. Now that we have 3D TVs (with polarised screens), 3D movies are simply encoded for those TVs. ",

If it is a computer monitor you must have the required graphic card which can render the 3d vision in normal monitors. But you need the suitable 3d glasses for it. ",
