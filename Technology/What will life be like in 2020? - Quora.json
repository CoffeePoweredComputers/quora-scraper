            "answer_text": "Very complex issues will be laid bare as costs meet reality and the consumers realize they cannot bear the burden. Politicians in the news will be replaced in the mainstream media. Commercial marketing will set it's sights on infrastructure commercialism and \u201cpatriotism\u201d will be required to cover the costs. Hollywood will adjust their revenue streams accordingly. Switching the revenue streams from carbon fuels to smaller distributed generation inter-connectivity will demand RE-designing the electrical grids. Less line loss as runs become shorter and advanced AI can react to balance the grids. This may take another 2 election cycles to get the campaign financing sources adjusted. EVs will be sought out by most families and the parking lots at work, home and shopping centers will become the RE-fueling stations and connected to the grids. The utility companies figure out they can make money selling the small power to EVs and retail businesses they generated by covering acres of parking lots and didn't lose in transmission. The good thing with this is the muscle car and badass trucks sales will be a very specific slice of buyer and will be much more focused. War machinery will throttle back as smaller platforms become more powerful, more versatile and more expensive. America and China may agree to disagree and get to work on moving the human race forward instead. Of course we have to elect real legislators who focus on commerce not BS. Entitlement programs will decrease as patriotism and infrastructure jobs are created using the same competing taxpayer funding. Career paths in the trades will pay more than managerial positions in manufacturing. By the way, manufacturing will depend upon 20th-century energy sources and the labor supply will build new energy-efficient and disaster-resistant housing within the range of the EVs that will take over the highways. SpaceX and Boeing will push the interstellar colonization and seek out one-way specialists who are nearing retirement age as returning to Earth's gravity after a year+ will not be an option physically. Huge wealth will be found in new sources of resources to support energy storage and creation. Consumers will realize they are healthier than told and that healthcare was really just a power grab by unseen rogue trillionaire puppeteers. But the puppets had better cut their strings  ",

            "answer_text": "My clients at two scenario planning companies frequently asked this kind of question. Our answer was that no one can know the future for sure, but the best way to be prepared is to preview the set of worlds that could be created if the strongest forces in the present were stretched to their possible (not just probable) extremes by the target date. It then helps to build a plausible narrative around those extremes and ask yourself how you could respond if they start to happen. At Global Business Network we would list 20-50 drivers or forces that were shaping the present but also undergoing change themselves. Demographics are changing, but they are predictable, baked in by birth and death rates. All versions of the near future will have pretty much the same demographics. Of the things that are uncertain, which ones are most influential? It is also critical to limit the context. The future of healthcare, energy, government, or China? Very different answers to these questions. Let's take ground transportation as an example. The economics of electric vehicles are changing rapidly. Car makers have already announced plans that defy their earlier lethargic response. Self-driving breakthroughs are not quite as rapid and they face regulatory constraints but they are also occurring rapidly. Car sharing/ownership changes are also ripling through the economy. Can we construct four stories that describe where these forces could take us by 2020? Already been done. The informal consensus is that it is more useful to go out just a bit further, say 2023, for the changes to really take hold. Actually building the scenarios is a bit beyond a Quora answer, but it has been done and will continue to be revised as changes in the forces occur. What about war with North Korea? Wouldn\u2019t that invalidate all the transportation scenarios? Yes and no. Best way to tell is to develop both transportation and war scenarios and see how they interact. The process is both an art and a science, not the easiest to learn to do well, but worth the effort. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s really hilarious that optimism about 2020 prior to the year. Nobody even expected this year to be of turmoil and huge global crisis due to Covid-19 virus. Also the lockdown in most countries as well as canceled events globally or postponed to next year (like Summer olympics and UEFA Euro 2020). This year will be that year economic upheaval takes place (especially post-corona) with a possible economic depression. Also the disease also exposed the weakness of neo-liberalism which has been the political and economical paradigm (that political parties shifted towards both politically and economically) since the end of the cold war and the fall of USSR. Neo-liberalism economical policies has it\u2019s roots in the 80\u2019s economical boom and emulating it. It\u2019s basically \u201cmake profits at all costs\u201d no matter of the long term effects. Even the socialism-aligned parties (especially social democrats) as well as conservative-aligned parties aligned onto neo-liberalism, which not at least created several shortages seen in the public sector (like lack of vital medical supplies for the covid-19 patients). I think there will be a new political and economical paradigm that will replace neo-liberalism in the post-corona era. And this is from a EUROPEAN point of view and NOT american (USA) point of view, since USA has always have that political paradigm by default in a very extreme way (no matter republican or democrat) and we can see that USA is the country that has the disease hardest strucked at because the whole healthcare system is privatized. In Europe (as well as Canada) there is room for shifting towards a more stable public sector (as well as a political and economical paradigm) that can withstand crisis with the magnitude of covid-19/corona. Also, another note is that I think USA will be declining in the post-corona era and China and EU will rise ",

            "answer_text": " Let\u2019s play it safe by comparing innovation in the 2020\u2019s what happened a century earlier, back in the 1920\u2019s. What we can anticipate is refinement & mainstream adoption of technologies that are already in existence today. Electric Vehicles: They\u2019re already here - we\u2019re seeing them on the roads more & more often, and they\u2019re becoming more affordable for consumers. The rollout of electric vehicles seems to be very similar to the advent of gas automobiles back in the horse & buggy age. At first, lots of horses, then the occasional automobile, and before you know it everybody\u2019s driving a Model-T. Well, same difference, but now it\u2019s Tesla. Medical Wearables: People are living longer & more independently than ever, meaning that medicine will continue to become more important - and medical wearables will fill a valuable need for medical & emergency monitoring of seniors while they hold on to their lifestyle independence. Think \u201cApple Watch\u201d. Cryptocurrency: There are a zillion reasons why you\u2019d want a fully digital replacement for cash, especially one not intrinsically tied to a single national government. PayPal demonstrated the need, but it has limitations - now PayPal is one of the partners in Facebook\u2019s Libra currency, which just might make the dream of a fully digital currency real. Crypto got off to a very rocky start, but that just may be a good thing, because it\u2019s helping to iron out the bugs before it goes mainstream. Drones: Again, already here. Drones are empowered by advances in batteries & computers, just like electric vehicles. Expect to see more drones - and more uses for drones - in the next decade. I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019ll see them delivering packages anytime soon, but I\u2019d bet they\u2019ll rapidly become a staple for photography at all manner of events, from weddings to graduations. Everything Goes Wireless (Again): Wifi 6 is coming out, which allows more devices, more wireless, faster bandwidth, etc. The same is true in the cellular world with 5G technology - which promises to increase speed & reduce latency and basically make your cellphone work like it\u2019s on WiFi all of the time. ~ A Bit Further Out ~ A Cure For Aging? Harvard geneticist David Sinclair claims his team been reversing the aging of mice in the lab for around 3 years now by using NMN to boost NAD levels. We probably won\u2019t have to wait for human trials, because a sister compound Nicotimade Riboside is selling like crazy on the Internet under the brand name Niagen\u00ae. Mainstream Quantum Computing? In 2016 IBM added a Quantum Computer to the cloud - letting anyone with an internet connection design & test their own quantum circuits. I don\u2019t expect to see Quantum Computers in the home during the upcoming decade, but we\u2019ll definitely be seeing & hearing more about them in the 2020\u2019s. Fusion Energy? There\u2019s a LOT going on in fusion research right now - too much for me to cover here. New ideas & technologies, combined with much faster computer modeling, might just give us a fusion breakthrough in the next decade - but don\u2019t hold your breath. Climate Change: Greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut in half by 2030 to avoid a 3 degree Centigrade increase in global average temperature. Or else. I\u2019m guessing that the already worsening effects of climate change will inspire more action on this in the 2020\u2019s, and if people really get motivated it may lead to changes in many other areas, such as an intensified push for renewable materials & alternative energies. Humans On Mars? There\u2019s lots of work being done in this area, but it\u2019s going to be a big endeavor with a lot of unknowns. Elon Musk seems to think we can get there in the mid-2020\u2019s, so maybe? Keep your fingers crossed\u2026 ",

The nation will go through a cleansing it has never gone through before. The truth of Ginsberg\u2019s death will be revealed. Declassification of secret documents shall bring down the DEEP STATE. The Central Bankers shall lose control and we will become a Sovereign Nation. There is much more including possible martial law when the big name politicians are arrested. Everything will change including a financial reset as the President puts us back on the gold standard. Great things will happen as we go from dark to light.

Nothing is worse, believe me I know, of not having enough to meet not just my creditors but my family needs. I\u2019ve lived under that umbrella for many years before I was able to work and when I did - there wasn\u2019t any stopping me from getting a job even at 16 after high school to take care of my mother\u2019s and my needs. Reality is harder now due to the circumstances and if I were a billionaire I would give up my fortune to help those in my community and state wide those that are out of work.

The other invokes a rather serious view of the future, in which myriad different strands are coalescing into a major paradigm shift. I hold the latter opinion. Currently COVID19 is consuming the news cycle. But it is connected at its base with two other major other issues. One is Global Warming, whereby global heating has changed the balance of nature such that viruses (and other life forms) are no longer in a state of balance and anomalous outbreaks of diseases deadly to humans have mutated and become direct threats to our society\u2019s continuance. The other major threat is the rise of Nationalism and authoritarianism as exemplified by Trump , Putin , Erdo\u011fan, Orban and others. Together we can either address and remedy these bad situations, or we can ignore and accept them. Either way, 2020 is likely to be a major event in human history. Or the beginning of its end. ",

Drastic change has been brought on by our childishly exuberant and wasteful ways; we\u2019re going to have to make some similarly drastic social and economic changes to survive, and then to cope with our changed circumstances. Our strength as a species has been our adaptability \u2014 we have remained generalists, instead of specializing in big predatory teeth and claws, or extra stomachs to digest grass, or wings, or prehensile tails. We can become whatever we need to; the question is one of will. At issue is our survival as a dominant (in terms of our world) species, or perhaps as a species at all. I think we need to look forward more than we need to look back. That\u2019s our \u201csingularity\u201d, IMO. When we do have time and energy to spare for looking back at what will undoubtedly be seen by many as a \u201cgolden age\u201d, it will be across an unbridgeable canyon of change.

The major exception would be natural disasters and their consequences. For example, the undersea earthquake off of northern Japan, the resulting tsunami, the flooding and destruction of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, and destruction of cities, villages, and shoreline over hundreds of miles, has made Japan a very different place. If the long-anticipated volcanic eruption under Yellowstone Park should occur before 2020, much of the world would look quite different. A large asteroid striking anywhere on the earth would change things greatly. And so on, for many types of natural disasters. Otherwise, we will probably see a world in 2020 not much changed from today. ",

I don\u2019t think there would be much of a change. But it is almost impossible to predict about the future. When Soviet Union began after WW I, no body expected it would end within 75 years. I know there were some who predicted about the unsustainability of the economic model of Soviet Union, such as Soviet dissident Mr. Andrei Amalrik, Frenchman, Mr. Emmanuel Todd, economist Mr. Ravi Batra and the author of 1984, Mr. George Orwell. Apparently Soviet government told in 1984, that the predicted time of collapse, 1984 had passed but the Soviet Union still continued. But in 1991, it eventually collapsed. Similarly, I don\u2019t think there was any prediction about Arab Spring. (I\u2019m not considering the astrological predictions of Nostradamus). We can generally assume that authoritarian regimes will face huge resistance sometimes and collapse. Perhaps it will happen in China and a few other authoritarian regimes, sometime in future. ",

I think unemployment rate will get worse. As for positives of the Democrats do take the election I think we could see a trend in better healthcare reform and foreign relations. I think the food industry will trend upwards with more people wanting organic food. Overall though I think we won\u2019t see much of difference. 2020 will probably be just as bad as it has always been. ",
