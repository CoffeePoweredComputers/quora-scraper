            "answer_text": "Yes. I am not sure what's special about Google in this respect. If you get a highly paid position (like CEO) in any other company, you'd also become rich. At Google you don't have to be the CEO maybe, because it's big and has many highly-paid positions, but this is also true of many other big companies. If you are in the tech field, you are probably more likely to get rich at a startup, actually. ",
