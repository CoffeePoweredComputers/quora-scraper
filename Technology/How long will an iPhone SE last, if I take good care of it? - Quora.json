            "answer_text": "My mother is still using a 3GS, a 9 years old phone. With the original batteries. I was using it for years, then my wife, then my mother. She is over 80. All the major functions work, but of course the phone seems to be a little slow. What can go wrong: Batteries - you can let those be replaced. OS - after a few years Apple will not issue the new OS for the older phones. This is about 4\u20135 years. This only means, that you will be bound to the last valid version of the OS and the included Apple apps which are installed on the phone. Not a real limitation. Speed - the relative (apparent) speed of the older phone will be different after years, since the newer ones are always much faster. Apps - this is the biggest issue, you need to keep the old versions of the apps which still work on the phone. Some of the newer apps only run on the latest OS. But there are also good examples here: My wife is playing the newest version of Township on an iPad 2, which is in our possession since 2011. So it is about 7 years old now. With good care practically there is no limit. There are rumours now that a new version of the SE is on the way. Take also a look at that one. ",

            "answer_text": "iphoneSE is a 2016 phone. I think iphones have a \u2018current\u2019 lifespan around 4 years \u2018good as new\u2019 and then another couple of years \u2018getting old\u2019 but still good as long as the battery is good, or you get a new battery thrown in. Currently I think that 6 years is reasonable and I use this figure to calculate the cost of ownership when considering a new phone (My wife just bought an XR and plans are to use it for at least 6 years - maybe she will buy a new phone in 3 years and pass the XR down to me).
