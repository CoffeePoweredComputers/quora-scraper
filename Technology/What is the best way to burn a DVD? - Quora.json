            "answer_text": "The best and the most effective way to burn a DVD is via Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate. Don't go by its name as it not only converts media files, but also helps in burning videos to DVDs. You have to try it to believe the speed and efficiency of this software. I vouch for this software, especially because it offers a free trial to test all its features. It burns all video formats to a DVD and also lets you modify and improvise them using this tool to make your videos more attractive. There are so many different templates to choose from and the best part is that this software is a one stop solution that takes care of all your needs. For example, you will not have to tamper with the video once it is burnt on the DVD as the tool will give you options to adjust all the settings beforehand. ",
