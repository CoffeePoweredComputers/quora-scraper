            "answer_text": "Very difficult to answer this question. I live in a civilisation style that has made me dependent on the products of many different companies. I can\u2019t exist without many of these products. There is no easy alternative to this existence. I could pack my bags and live in the bush but I don\u2019t know how to and have no experience to do so. I don\u2019t know the difference between an edible or poisonous berry or mushroom. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve never been taught. I still drive a car, use my home electrical appliances and warm my house. I fly to places for a holiday, eat processed food and fresh produce prepared for me and I wear clothing. These things are prepared or manufactured in industrial complexes that use all sorts of machinery and consume a load of energy, much of which comes from fossil fuels. When I\u2019m not feeling well I see my doctor and if things are bad an ambulance comes and takes me to a sophisticated and high tech environment called a hospital. The skilled medical staff give me an excellent opportunity to survive and continue my life for which I am extremely thankful. I am a slave to all these components of the industrialised system of civilisation just like everyone else. We are all in this together. I support companies that are environmentally friendly but they also can only be environmentally friendly to a point. They are also slaves to this system. There are no companies that are totally environmentally friendly. The first time a company turns on a light or flushes a toilet the company can no longer be considered environmentally friendly in the absolute meaning of the term. ",
