            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. There is consistent labor abuse, berating or upbraiding workers for \u2018only\u2019 working 80 hours per week. Managers are forced to come in and work with very little warning. Warehouse Associates are expected to keep rate and there are new policies in place called \u2018Time Off Task\u2019 (ToT), or \u2018Visual Time off Task,\u2019 which if accumulates to two hours can get you terminated. One girl was written up because she went to HR during the shift (a perfectly acceptable thing to do), but because she didn\u2019t tell her manager and didn\u2019t tell HR to tell her manager (she wasn\u2019t a native English speaker), she was written up by her manager for ToT. Raising the minimum pay to $15 was a total shit show because NO ONE got paid any more given the elimination of variable compensation and restricted stock units. Meanwhile, competitors like Target are starting at around $20 per hour with additional bonuses for nights and weekends, and Uline is doing up to $25. Anything else? Lots. They keep an off-shore bank account in the Netherlands to avoid paying US income tax on revenue earned in Europe. In fact, they pay zero tax year over year, having declared loss after loss while the CEO\u2019s stock awards keep making him richer and richer. The culture encourages back-stabbing, stepping on people to get ahead, and rewards amount of time worked over actual quality of work. They are extremely anti-Union and verbally discourage employees from starting one, despite the fact that we need one. For example, the 2019\u20132020 health plans, which are frequently lauded as \u2018the best healthcare we have ever had,\u2019 are now all co-pay plans. Before, the premium paid by employees raised by about $1 a year, this year it was more like $4, and $25 co-pays every time they see a doctor. More for a Specialist. Up until now, no co-pays were ever necessary, deductibles were low, and out-of-pocket expenses were very minimal. Why did they do it? To save money. They are constantly on their employees about \u2018saving Amazon money,\u2019 for example, \u2018the most expensive thing we ship is air,\u2019 indicating poor trailer utilization. Ordering an ad-hoc can cost $700-$3000 depending on where it\u2019s going, but the lowest bidder gets the gig. That\u2019s right, Amazon doesn\u2019t care about contractor reputation or quality, just that they are getting the best deal. Flex drivers get screwed over on tips. One example I heard recently was that a girl received a $10 tip for a grocery delivery (this is pretty standard for Prime Now or Fresh, as orders are usually $100 or more). She was paid $10.88 for the delivery by Amazon. When she called in, the rep told her that she was compensated the 88 cents for the time, distance, pickup, and drop off, and because the tip was so high (it wasn\u2019t), it factors into her hourly pay. She was livid. Doordash does this too, which is why people are quitting that service as well. So no, Amazon\u2019s desire to be the \u2018most customer-centric company on earth\u2019 died when Jeff Bezos whipped his dick our for a selfie and decided to build a massive clock in Texas with all that \u2018money saved,\u2019 the cool features we will never see in our lifetime, since \u2018something\u2019 happens every 100 years or every 1,000 years \u2014 I believe a cuckoo flies out. That\u2019s right...in the year 3020 or so, spectators who have technology in their hands we can\u2019t possibly begin to understand will watch as a mechanical bird briefly emerges in a big press event. Parents will tell their kids they are so \u2018lucky\u2019 to have been born at this time in history. My guess is it will suck ass and will be forgotten minutes after it happens. There are lots of other examples, but I\u2019ll save it for a book I\u2019m writing on their history of labor abuse, law breaking and OSHA violations. NO, Amazon no longer cares about their customers\u2014Amazon cares about Amazon. They believe they can help the customer by helping themselves. ",

            "answer_text": "This depends on what your definition of an \u2018ethical company\u2019 means. Does it mean, are they ethically responsible towards such causes as recycling, sales tactics, return policies and general business? Does it mean are they ethically responsible when it comes to their user comment system? Does it mean that they are ethically responsible towards their employment practices? Let\u2019s explore some of these. Business Ethics This is a topic has had many books written. In fact, I could probably write a book on this topic myself with enough time. Hah, perhaps I should. I digress. Business ethics are never black and white and are best represented in the shades of grey between black and white. What I mean by this is that no company is ever 100% ethical nor 100% unethical. This is typically because a company is operated by many different people at any given time. Yes, Jeff Bezos is at the top of this Ziggurat, but he has many executives and managers underneath them who help operate the Amazon business. One of the things you\u2019ll quickly learn when you hire someone is that not everyone is as they seem. You initially hire people for their skills, not for their ethics. This means that folks you hire can and will cross ethical boundaries sometimes knowingly, sometimes unknowingly. Yes, it happens. I worked for a company (not Amazon) where the head of HR was completely untrained in employment law. She would routinely ask questions of interviewees that were completely against the laws EEOC enforces. I\u2019m still surprised no one brought a lawsuit against the company (and her). Again, this was not at Amazon, but is used as a real world example of what can happen. Shades of Grey These situations happen because each manager, supervisor, VP, EVP and C-Level exec all come from a different background and upbringing. It also happens because companies tend to enforce unrealistic timing of internal project agendas. This forces people to cut corners to make ends meet. This corner cutting problem is rampant in every organization where I\u2019ve personally worked. I\u2019ve yet to work for a company where unrealistic and arbitrary goals aren\u2019t continually being shortened and redefined. I\u2019ve personally worked on projects that were perfectly on-track until a new product feature required re-working the entire project completely from the beginning throwing the project timeline out by at least two-weeks. Yet, the management wasn\u2019t willing to accept that extra two weeks. So, corners were cut to make the project come in on time\u2026 which meant the project was essentially unfinished on release day. If the customer didn\u2019t notice the problem, then it wouldn\u2019t be considered unethical. If the customer did notice, it still wouldn\u2019t be considered unethical. Eye of the Beholder Ethics are really defined by each person individually. What you may consider unethical, another person might consider perfectly acceptable. Facebook is a prime example of this. Facebook sees nothing wrong on what Cambridge Analytica did, yet those of us who may have lost our data in this situation certainly don\u2019t see it that way. Amazon and Ethics There have been a number of ethical issues that Amazon has run up against. For example, the Echo. Privacy advocates find that a constantly listening device sitting on the home countertop to be quite unethical. For example, you have to really and solidly trust Amazon to not eavesdrop on your conversations. In fact, it\u2019s almost certain that Amazon has a way to eavesdrop through the Amazon Echo. I mean, why wouldn\u2019t they put that back door into the device? Yet, how would we know that backdoor exists if Amazon never discloses it? Let\u2019s examine the Kindle. If you read books on the Kindle, particularly if you\u2019ve bought the \u2018with special offers version\u2019, then you know that they\u2019ll advertise on your device. Is knowing what you\u2019re reading and buying then targeting you with similar content considered ethical or unethical? Well, that depends on how that data is used. Of course, Amazon\u2019s terms and conditions explicitly authorize them to use any collected data for their own purposes. Unless you read Amazon\u2019s terms and conditions closely, you may not have known that. But, does that make it an ethical practice, particularly if they take that data and use it outside of the context of Kindle advertising? Only you can decide. Warehouse Practices Here is a bone of contention that Amazon\u2019s image has been fighting for quite a while. In order to support their 1 and 2 day shipping, Amazon has had to build many warehouses with tons of rigid logistics. This also means hiring many folks to help keep those warehouses humming. To support that level of shipping, there have been many folks who\u2019ve worked at Amazon\u2019s warehouses who complain about their working conditions. For example: Amazon warehouse workers skip bathroom breaks to keep their jobs, says reportAmazon warehouse workers, fearful of wasting time, relieved themselves in bottles: undercover investigatorAmazon Warehouse Employees' Message to Jeff Bezos -- We Are Not RobotsThe Life and Death of an Amazon Warehouse TempThe fact that Amazon requires approved \u2018bathroom breaks\u2019 indicates a fundamental problem with Amazon\u2019s warehouse management methods. Is it ethical to effectively force employees to withhold bathroom breaks because the company has veiled threats that you\u2019ll lose your job? This isn\u2019t the only practice that\u2019s been questioned regarding Amazon\u2019s warehouse personnel practices as seen other articles. Unethical Practices The two biggest unethical practices I personally see at Amazon are as follows: The unnecessarily harsh conditions of warehouse staff. Amazon could do with reviewing this situation and improve the conditions without sacrificing its ability to deliver.The censorship of user written product reviews. This situation only serves to make products look better than they actually are. In fact, Amazon got rid of their discussion forums almost solely because of this point. Amazon couldn\u2019t effectively manage the user discussions being placed into the forums. Instead of trying to deal with it, it was simpler to close it all down and not deal with it. Censorship in any form is an unethical practice. Though this is where my view differs from Amazon management. Amazon believes their terms and conditions relieve them of the guilt of censorship because their terms allow for content removal. See: Amazon accused of 'Big Brother' tactics over customer reviewsCritical Thinking I\u2019d suggest that you head over to Google and search for \u201cAmazon warehouse working conditions\u201d and \u201cAmazon review censorship\u201d and see what turns up. You might be surprised by what you find. At the same time, the reason the warehouses run in this way is almost as a direct result of untenable deadlines created by an executive at the top of the chain\u2026 probably at Jeff Bezo\u2019s blessing. These situations don\u2019t create themselves. They are created by unreasonable, unrealistic and, dare I say, unethical management practices. I could come to a conclusion for you regarding your question, but I\u2019d prefer you to come to your own conclusion and form an answer yourself by objectively looking at all of the information you can find on the Internet. And, don\u2019t just stop with the two examples I\u2019ve given. Dig deep and hard because there\u2019s a lot to read. How I\u2019ll answer this question is that parts of Amazon aren\u2019t ethically operated while some of the organization is operated fine. This is likely due to specific management staff who choose to skirt the ethical boundaries by enforcing and endorsing such practices. Know that for any ethical or unethical practices, the reason Amazon does whatever it does is in collection of the all mighty buck. Money is truly the root of all evil. ",
