            "answer_text": " Chatbots have always been controversial. The first was ELIZA, created in 1966 by MIT Professor Jeff Weizenbaum. It worked by passing words users entered into a computer which then paired them to a list of pre-coded, scripted responses. In today\u2019s world, it\u2019s obviously unworkable to create scripted responses in preparation for any possible input. Luckily, there has been a sharp decrease in the cost of technology needed to experiment with chatbots, and an explosion of messaging apps. Chatbots are ubiquitous in this environment, and as you can imagine, this has led to some staggering advancement over ELIZA. Traditional (or scripted) QA-based chatbots do not scale beyond a certain complexity, which is where AI comes in. Natural Language Processing has the power to completely free you from manually programming various intents (potential questions). The number of intents does not matter; there could be 5 or 5 million - because AI would ingest the entire corpus and match data to query intents automatically. Imagine maintaining a manual system. In a Customer Service application (perhaps programmed to answer FAQs), you may think 100 base intents is an exhaustive list, but each will have their own variations. Anyone in customer service knows that customers are endlessly \u201ccreative\u201d in asking questions. More and more intents will be added as you add newer systems, products, and variations in infrastructure. Most enterprise applications practically require NLS-based chatbots. Technical language, complex workflows, and relatively sophisticated users (e.g. agents) abound, and enormous flexibility is needed, coupled with a painless integration with existing systems and an easy-to-use UI. I would suggest you look into Coseer (full disclosure, this is my company).  Take a look at this video.
