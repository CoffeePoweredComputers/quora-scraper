            "answer_text": "iPhones in India are expensive due to multiple factors. Partly due to import duty imposed by Government of India and majorly due to Apple\u2019s strategy of increasing profit margin instead of increasing net profit. Competitive Pricing Apple cannot win Indian hearts without giving actual comparable prices in Indian market. Take an example of iPhone 6s, this is currently made in India and is sold for \u20b9 29k, if you compare same iPhone 6s in US, it's being sold for $199 which is approximately \u20b9 14k. Which means the iPhone which is made in China, sold in US is twice as cheap as the same smartphone made and sold entirely in India. Target Consumer Segment Earlier Apple was targeting higher middle class as the customer segment for iPhones in India, so the sales were still high comparably. Now with skyrocketing prices of iPhones in India has completely changed iPhones customer segment entirely. Raising iPhone prices so much, Apple is starting to target only 1% of Customer base which are only Rich instead of 20\u201330% higher middle class segment of India as compared to earlier. Per-Capita Income Vs Smartphone Price Furthermore, the iPhone's price is nowhere comparable when you consider per-capita income vs smartphone price graph in other countries(even including developing countries like Brazil) So, Apple is definitely lacking to realize it's mistake to understand what it takes to tap Indian Smartphone markets. What Apple doesn't realize is, there is a huge potential to turn around their declining Y-O-Y iPhone sales into biggest gain in Y-O-Y sales by just realizing the need of the country. ",

            "answer_text": "Even though Apple's iPhones are designed by Apple in the US and manufactured in China, cost is less in US as US is the home of Apple. But in India, foreign imported smartphones have a tariff of around 20% and also Apple increases the iPhone prices further to 6 or 7% so as to maintain revenue. If you add all these and include the currency conversion, you'll find that iPhone's price in India is one of the highest in the world. In this way, India is encouraging local manufacturing of smartphones. That's the main reason why Apple, in order to avoid these tariffs, has started assembling iPhone SE and iPhone 6 with the help of one of its main manufacturers, Wistron. Apple has also partnered with Foxconn, one of Apple's main manufacturers, to manufacture higher end iPhone X series in India in 2019 as Apple now views India to be a really important market. It is said that Foxconn is going to invest around $376M to build a manufacturing plant in the State of Tamil Nadu to manufacture these higher end iPhones. I believe in doing this, price of an iPhone will decrease and it'll be affordable to not only Indians but to the rest of the world. ",
