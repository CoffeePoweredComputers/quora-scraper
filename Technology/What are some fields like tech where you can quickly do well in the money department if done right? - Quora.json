In many professions, such as plumbers and electricians, they also need special Master Certification, unless they want to remain as the supporting cast. All this can only be learned over time, first apprenticing with someone really competent, earning a good reputation for yourself, and then going on your own. Of course future success depends upon maintaining your reputation with prompt and quality service, while remaining competitive in your charges. ",
