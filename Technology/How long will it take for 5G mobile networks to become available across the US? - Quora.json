            "answer_text": "The research project of bringing 5G into existence began in 2012. It was a 50 milliom euros research project that was implemented to deliver by early 2020. As of now there is no solid statement by any organisation that claims to deploy 5G into the country by 2020, but it was the plan to finish every phase of the project by 2020. In 2015 verizon promised to carry out tests in 2016. As promised, on February 2016 verizon announced its initial tests on 5G networks at the Mobile World Congress. Samsung, Ericsson, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm are working together with Verizon on the tests. The latest news as of 2017 is that 5G will be available in 11 cities in the US for a selected group of customers for their pilot run which will have only limited access. The markets that were stated are Ann Arbor, Atlanta, Bernardsville, Brockton, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, Sacramento, Seattle and Washington DC. Some organisations have predicted the actual dates that 5G will function for over a million users like, Ericsson predicts on 2022GMSA predicts on 2025This is because for 5G to work you will need smartphones that can support at least 1 Gigabit per second with a latency of less than 10ms. Samsung has released its Galaxy Note 8 that consists of a LTE Cat 16 modem which can reach speeds up to 1 Gbit/s but we are still not sure whether it can reach the maximum speed, this can be further tested only when 5G networks are available in the country for everyone. 5G is not only about upgrading the speed but many other standards also; Providing a speed of 1 Gbit/s simultaneously for a group of users within a specific area which will override the use of Wifi.Metropolitan areas will have 100 Mbit/s of data rate.Connecting several hundreds of wireless sensors simultaneously which will reduce the work load for many users. Everything can be operated over the network.Efficiency of transmssion will be improved.Coverage will reach further with better quality.Latency is reduced compared to 4G.",

            "answer_text": "Depends. People loved 3G because 2G/EDGE was so slow loading web pages was noticeably faster on 3G, as was sharing pictures, and you could kind of sort of do some limited video. So it became a marketing advantage for a cellular company to advertise 3G. Company\u2019s that spent money to roll out 3G made it back by getting many of their competitors customers. Companies that dragged their feet on 3G lost customers and didn\u2019t actually save money. People loved LTE/4G because 3G wasn\u2019t fast enough to do a lot of things people wanted, like streaming quality video, video chat, and\u2026well to be fair mostly just video. So it became a marketing advantage for a cellular company to advertise LTE. Company\u2019s that spent money to roll out LTE made it back by getting many of their competitors customers. Companies that dragged their feet on LTE lost customers and didn\u2019t actually save money. With 5G I\u2019m not so sure what people will love. I mean sure it is in theory faster, but is the cellular network on your phone holding you back from anything? I mean what feels faster when you use wit on WiFi? Does anything not only feel faster, but is now so much faster you can actually use it where you couldn\u2019t before? I can\u2019t think of anything. So no \u201ckiller app\u201d for 5G means we aren\u2019t going to see a 5G roll out for the same reasons we saw it in LTE or even 3G. There is some promise that 5G will have more fancy broadcast modes that do better building penetration, so you can get signal in places you didn\u2019t before. With the right equipment. If so maybe a variant of \u201ccan you hear me now\u201d might drive customer demand, and maybe that can drive a rollout. There is some promise that 5G can be used with very small cells with minimal building penetration to provide high bandwidth home service (actually profitable unlimited data), but using a whole different fancy broadcast mode. If so that will drive adoption along a different curve where it replaces the \u201clast mile\u201d solutions that make things like fiber to the house costly and let cellular companies compete with cable TV companies. That might not make it a dominant network though as LTE might well keep serving non \u201cfixed location\u201d needs. There is yet another fancy 5G mode for doing great building penetration, having huge cells, supporting very low power terminals (phones and devices with embedded cellular modems)\u2026but at a very low speed. This could be very useful for things like kindles, cars, dog location trackers, and things that need Low power budgets but could benefit from a command and control network, but not a network fast enough to send say pictures of anything. Or in other words: I don\u2019t think anyone knows if 5G will gain widespread adoption. They haven\u2019t really agreed on its goals yet, they have just run off and made a pile of variants to try to sereve niches, but I don\u2019t know that any of those are big enough to justify the kind of money a nation wide rollout costs. Could be 3 of those things are a hit and it rolls out as fast as LTE. Could be none of those things are, and LTE is with us for another two decades. ",
