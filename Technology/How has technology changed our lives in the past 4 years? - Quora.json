            "answer_text": "I think that it has improved us moreover disproved us because there is the fact that it made 60% of indian obese. Other then that, technology has improved so many things!It has saved over 95% more lives today then it did back in the old days. People used to die, and others will say \u201cOh, well.\u201d But because of technology, we have medicines, defibrillators, hospitals, casts, X-rays, and more!The weird thing that I noticed about technology, is that more technology helps speed up the process of making even more technology. I realized that early homo-sapiens took over a course of 800 years to invent a spear. In the steam age, the light bulb came out after 30 years of the idea. But now, a new amazing invention comes out every month! At home, I order a magazine called Popular Mechanics monthly in which it features something new every time. First, a cloaked tank, next, a faster version of the concord, then, a plugin car that can last for over 600mi in one full charge!Also, over the last five years, technology has been rapidly changing and expanding in many ways. Our average laptops have grown every now and then. From faster processing, to paper thin lightweight computers. Smart phones are now capable of acting as complex computer devices that can take pictures, search the Internet, send emails and text messages, and they even make phone calls. While it might seem that the technology of today has reached its limits, is still actually expanding more and more. Because of this, it makes people lazy and they end up not using their brain most of the time. Then they can\u2019t remember simple mathematics.Technology has helped us learn many things. Such as; Earth rotates around the sun, Pluto is a dwarf planet, species in deep ocean trenches, how old the earth is, and many important discoveries that help us understand the world we live on. With these discoveries, we\u2019ve been able to adapt to our environment. Because of this, we are now the most adaptable species existing. ",
