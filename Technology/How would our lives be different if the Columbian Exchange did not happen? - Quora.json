            "answer_text": "Columbian exchange played a huge part in changing the diet and lifestyle of many old world populations (Europe and Asia most notably). Let's look at some of what we would be missing. No potatoes - This wonder root vegetable which now a staple across many world cuisines is of New world origin. Mashed potatoes, hash browns, coleslaw, potato curry, French fries etc vanish from our dinner tablesNo tomatoes - That means no ketchup and diminishing varieties of sauces and curriesNo chocolate - This would break the hearts of many. This manna from heaven would cease to exist in its present form in the absence of Columbian exchangeNo smoking - Tobacco is native to the Americas. We would be having a significantly healthier population with fewer cases of cancer and ailments associated with smokingNo vanilla - we wouldn't be using vanilla as an additive or as a byword for anything plain and normalNo cornNo chili peppersNo rubberNo Thanksgiving and no TurkeyHorses would have remained on the eastern side of the Atlantic. Americas would have seen fewer or no outbreaks of old world epidemics. Transatlantic slavery wouldn't have happened. Healthier levels of native American populations. Aztecs and Mayans would have been around for much longer culturally and politically. Probably no USA. ",
