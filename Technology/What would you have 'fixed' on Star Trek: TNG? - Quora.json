            "answer_text": "#1. Have the main cast get put in their place a lot, and force them to ask hard questions about humanity, the federation, and what they plan to do about any of it. Now that I\u2019m older, I still enjoy TNG, but I find that I sometimes dislike the constant preaching everyone does about how awesome humanity has become and how amazing the Federation is. They act like they\u2019re so enlightened and open-minded to the various races and cultures throughout the galaxy, but at the end of the day, they simply see themselves and their own culture as inherently superior to all others. They\u2019re like the overly-sweet housewife caricature who smiles at you as she says things that she THINKS are nice, but in reality she\u2019s insulting the crap out of you, until you\u2019d rather she just insulted you to your face instead of beating around the bush. It would be nice to show them, time and time again, that no matter how \u201cenlightened\u201d humanity may become, humans themselves do not change. Ever. I\u2019d have loved to see Picard try to give some rousing speech to someone like Luther Sloan,  having discovered the existence of Section 31 and being horrified by it, only to be resoundingly rebuffed time and time again, as Sloan\u2019s actions, however cruel, are shown to objectively make the Alpha Quadrant a safer place to live. I want the whole crew to be completely shaken as they realize that their high and noble plan would have resulted in the deaths of billions of worlds, while Sloan did what was necessary, not just what felt good and prideful. And every time, as Sloan fades into the shadows, have the crew be given some sort of new ambassadorial mission as the Federation gains more and more political power and territory, and the show, while still having themes of hope and exploration, would be constantly tinged by the dark realities of intergalactic politics, espionage, and murder.  #2. Make Troi into a character that\u2019s even remotely interesting.  Deanna Troi is half Betazoid, half Human. There were never Betazeds in Star Trek before her character was created, so they could have done anything they wanted. Betazoids could have been powerful on their own, even feared in many parts of the galaxy for their mental abilities, with a government and military on the same level as Romulans and Klingons. Furthermore, the coupling of a Betazoid with other species resulted in different power sets depending on the physiology of said species, so any \u201cNon Pure\u201d relations were banned on Betazed. However, Luwaxanna Troi, Queen of Betazed, had a secret relationship with a human male, hiding the existence of her child under the guise of a miscarriage, among other things. Young Deanna was sent away with her father to Earth, where she eventually joined Starfleet Academy, using her Betazoid abilities to excel in her life. But over time, she began to exhibit other abilities such as telekinesis and minor matter manipulation, as the children of Betazoid/Human couplings were among the most powerful. So Troi could have spent the series both being the ship\u2019s counselor, and also BEING counseled by Picard, and even more importantly, Guinan, as her powers began to grow even further. You could even work the angle that a lot of people on the ship are afraid of her as she grows more powerful, and will actively avoid her whenever possible, and it takes a long time for her to earn their trust. This also strengthens her bond with Guinan, Picard, and the main bridge crew, because they\u2019re some of the only people to really show her any real humanity and care. This also forces Picard and Riker to step their game up, since Picard can\u2019t exactly order his crew to spend time with Deanna, but he also can\u2019t have a ship full of people that want her gone, so he and Riker have to constantly go through this huge juggling act to keep everyone at least marginally happy, while also not destroying any of their relationships or morale. Plus, Riker and Deanna\u2019s relationship complicates matters further, resulting in time in the brig for Riker and other crewmembers when they told him how they really felt about Deanna. She also could have had her own Worf-like story arc, where she does meet her mother, and her true identity as Princess of Betazed is revealed, dragging the Enterprise, its crew, and the Federation as a whole into all kinds of political intrigue, civil wars, fending off kidnapping and assassination attempts, etc, as various factions tried to destroy or control Troi for their own ends. Over time, Deanna gains a loyal following on Betazoid as their Warrior Princess who always shows up riding her Enterprise when they\u2019re in trouble, as well as the respect of everyone on the Enterprise, and by the end of the series, she and Guinan could even hold their own against the Q for short periods of time. #3. More hijinks with Geordi and Data.  I feel that they simply did not play on this angle enough in the show, this friendship between an engineer and a living machine. Personally, something I\u2019ve wanted to see for some time now is \u201cGeordi and the Droid\u201d, a spin-off miniseries about Geordi and Data being stranded in Victorian England. At first, Geordi doesn\u2019t know anything about Victorian-era technology, but Data teaches him from his vast databanks of information, and they manage to make a modest living for themselves, with Data hiding out in their apartment, and Geordi taking the name \u201cWatson\u201d for a pseudonym. However, there is a mysterious murder, and Data takes the opportunity to finally use his skills and his love of Sherlock Holmes stories to solve it, with the help of a young and aspiring writer named Doyle. The miniseries is just Data, Geordi, and Doyle teaming up to solve various mysteries and murders within London.  After the miniseries ends, and Geordi and Data return to the Enterprise, Doyle uses their adventures to write the first Sherlock Holmes novel.  #4. Better combat, better suits, better Engineering, Papa Johns. Star Trek combat sucks. I realize it\u2019s not the focus of the show, but come on. How many centuries do you need to realize that Krav Maga is a thing? I don\u2019t care how strong that Klingon is, if it has balls, they need to be kicked. Hell, you literally have full knowledge that an alien race basically built you all on a similar template, so anything that works on humans can also work on anything else with a humanoid form. Even Q got decked by Sisko, for crying out loud! As for suits, you can keep the onesies if you want, just please add some basic pants pockets to the things at the very least. Engineering. Where do I even begin? First of all, make sure your ENTIRE bridge crew gets adequate seating, with appropriate seatbelts. Every time the ship gets hit you\u2019re falling all over the place. Even Klingons have chairs for everyone on their ships. Also, I don\u2019t know why your panels explode in people\u2019s faces all the time, but it needs to be fixed. Second, the turbolifts. I realize the ship is fairly massive, but surely you must have STAIRS on the thing somewhere. Every time someone so much as sneezes on the ship, the turbolifts start acting crazy. Fix it.  #5. More humanity. When I say \u201chumanity\u201d, I don\u2019t mean \u201chumans are awesome\u201d. No, I mean you should show more mistakes. Yes, show the crew as awesome and well-trained and all that, but also show them making dumb mistakes, tripping over their own feet here and there, doors not working when they\u2019re supposed to, etc.   There\u2019s probably more I\u2019m forgetting. Edit #1: #6. Delve far more into Picard\u2019s Post-Borg encounter. They did deal with these things, such as when Picard went to go see his brother in that one episode:  Or his interactions with the Borg \u201cHugh\u201d:  And yes, I\u2019m fully aware of the events of the movie First Contact, but I\u2019m going to ignore them, partially because I\u2019m only talking about the show, and also because I\u2019m not even sure the films are canon. So, going off what happens in the show, they really don\u2019t deal with Picard\u2019s trauma very much, or the wider effect it has on the morale of the ship\u2019s crew, Starfleet, and the Federation as a whole (once again, I know about the interaction between Picard and Sisko in the first episode of DS9, but this is about TNG, not DS9). Personally, I would have started out with a few episodes of Picard directly after his rescue from the Borg. Dr. Crusher AND Pulaski are working together to remove his borg implants while also trying not to kill the man in the process. They manage to remove most of them, but some of the more deeply integrated technology in his brain and nervous system simply cannot be removed without causing irreparable damage and/or death. Even worse, many of those systems are still active and cannot be shut down. Picard locks himself in his room for a few more episodes, screaming about the \u201cwhispers\u201d in the ship, while Riker must command an Enterprise full of scared and saddened crew members. All anyone can think of is what\u2019s going to happen to Picard. Dr. Crusher examines Picard more closely, and discovers that his rantings about hearing whispers are actually valid; the Borg implants in his body are allowing him to \u201chear\u201d the various systems of the ship itself. Some counseling from Troi allows Picard to realize that he can better understand various forms of technology around him. Not control it, necessarily, but understand it, and even \u201chear\u201d it, if it\u2019s advanced enough. Picard now thinks of himself as, at least partially, a Borg. He continues to refuse to retake command of the Enterprise, even actively avoiding Guinan, who keeps trying to visit him. Eventually she corners him and gives him her classic Guinan wisdom, but he is still unable to be captain again. Starfleet begins to review other candidates for Captain of the Enterprise, planning to boot Riker into command of a different vessel, believing him to be too emotionally involved in the recent events to be an effective captain. All sorts of political shenanigans ensue, with Picard even stealing a shuttle and becoming a fugitive on some forest world for a bit while he rediscovers himself. Eventually, however, he does indeed return to command the Enterprise, but that doesn\u2019t mean everything goes back to normal. Now, because of the whispers Picard hears, he has to take a strong sleeping medication every night or he\u2019ll never be able to sleep. He often has nightmares about his time as Locutus, and in many episodes, can be seen exiting the turbolift in a clearly very tired state, but then visibly readying himself for command. In episodes where they meet other captains, they are often wary of him, some even being openly hostile. At times, they will blatantly ignore his suggestions, resulting in needless casualties. And at all times, Starfleet is always waiting and ready to replace him with some other captain. On the plus side, however, he can now hear the whispers from other ships if they\u2019re in range, knowing where their shields are weakest, what kind of weapons they have, etc. He can more easily escape captivity if his captors place him in any form of technologically advanced cell. He also gains the new hobby of building things in his free time when he can\u2019t sleep, ironically adding to the whispers with each new piece of technology he creates. His relationship with the crew also deepens greatly, especially with Troi, since, as ship\u2019s counselor, she hears all his deepest darkest fears and helps him through his various bouts of depression and existential horror. All of these things continue every season. #7. Make Wesley a try-hard idiot instead of a super genius. Everyone apparently hates Wesley Crusher with a passion. Apparently they hate his sweaters,  they hate how there\u2019s a \u201ckid in space\u201d angle with him,  and they also hate how he\u2019s apparently this super science prodigy where everything he touches turns to gold, and is even responsible for saving the ship once or twice. Everybody hates Wesley.  So what I would do, first of all, is do away with the sweaters (though honestly, I never saw anyone in Star Trek wear a t-shirt; somehow that\u2019d be even weirder than the sweaters). Second, I\u2019d make the kid not all that bright. Oh sure, he\u2019s no idiot, but he\u2019s no genius either. I\u2019d make him kind of charismatic and give him a knack for piloting and a hint of engineering skill. Maybe his mother taught him some basic first aid as well. So there you go. He\u2019s not a genius, not a total idiot. Just kind of privileged, like everyone on the Enterprise. So you\u2019d see him here and there, always getting berated by some other officer as he struggled to learn something new, always with dirt and dust on his face from crawling around in old jeffries tubes or fixing old shuttles for practice, always some new \u201cthing\u201d he has to learn or do, and always from a place of disadvantage, but always trying to be chipper and optimistic about it.  To make his character a little more interesting, focus more on the \u201cdead father\u201d angle. Because he never knew his father, there\u2019s always been a hole in his heart that can never be filled, so he throws himself into his tasks and studies because he feels he has something to prove, no matter how difficult it gets, because maybe it\u2019s what his father would have done. His mother worries about him, but she\u2019s always busy with her work as well, so young Wesley is left to his own devices, working hard, playing with the other kids on the ship, etc. Sometimes he plays pranks on the other crew members, and the audience would be annoyed with him, but they would understand why he did what he did at the same time, and thus empathize with him more, and they would support his desire to succeed in life and prove himself worthy. You\u2019d see him grow over the course of the show, from a stupid kid who once snuck onto the bridge and tried to pilot the ship (it ended poorly),  to an older, slightly wiser kid with more responsibilities.  You\u2019d see him get accepted into Starfleet Academy and leave the ship, having earned Picard\u2019s respect,  make friends in school despite hardships, and then return, having learned enough, struggled enough, failed enough, to even help Picard himself on dangerous missions.  And then, when he\u2019s supposed to graduate, he and his classmates still attempt their illegal maneuver and fail, disgracing them all.  Only this time, you feel just as disappointed as Picard, you feel the same pain as he does, because you have also watched this boy slowly grow into a man over the course of the show, only to see him crash and burn at this crucial moment. And it would all boil down to hubris; after all those years of struggle, all Wesley and his classmates wanted was to have it all end with a spectacular finish, so everyone would see their worth in one dazzling display of prowess. And it all came crashing down around their ears. And now he has to rebuild it all over again. And no, he doesn\u2019t become some weird college dropout space/time traveler. #8: More Moriarty, Ma\u2019am. One of my favorite parts of TNG was the character of Moriarty, the hologram that gained an awareness of its own existence, sentience, and right to exist.  I would have loved to have seen more of this idea explored; perhaps Moriarty\u2019s program is shipped off to Starfleet HQ, where he is under constant study, and while there are those who converse with him, he is still treated as a hologram. So he learns as much as he can, attempting to prove himself, but the only effect of his efforts is that the humans fear him that much more. Eventually, there are talks of deleting him as a safety measure. Moriarty, still every bit the Sherlock Holmes character he started out as, deduces that his life is in danger. Using his knowledge, he learns how to move freely within cyberspace and across all manner of communications and systems, escaping Starfleet HQ by leaving a dummy hologram of himself behind to stall them, and hiding out in the databanks of passing ships. To add to his skillset, he even learns to control his own holographic matrix to change his form, making it even harder to capture him. While on the run, he sees as much of the galaxy as he can, learning as much as he can, occasionally crossing paths with the Enterprise and crew, sometimes as a force for good, other times as an enigmatic anti-hero, but always stealing every scene he\u2019s in when he\u2019s on screen. Sometimes they even manage to capture him, but he always escapes in the end.  By the end of the series, his studies lead him to a method of attaining a semi-permanent form, sort of like a light-based version of Odo, allowing him to move freely within both the corporeal and incorporeal realms.

            "answer_text": "What would you have 'fixed' on Star Trek: TNG? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really liked Star Trek: TNG, but that being said, I\u2019d have gone a different direction creatively with a few particular points. I\u2019d have included more of the \u201cNavy\u201d feel as done by Nicholas Meyer in \u201cThe Wrath of Khan\u201d and \u201cThe Undiscovered Country\u201d. I really loved this because it gave a sense of professionalism, duty, and gravitas that the original series sometimes lacked. Under this back-to-basics \u2018Horatio Hornblower in space\u2019 approach, Star Trek stories started to explore deeper character growth, long-term consequences, and Starfleet as more than just explorers. NO KIDS ON THE ENTERPRISE! Seriously, you\u2019ve seen the danger the ship gets into! Diseases, hostile takeovers, time travel paradoxes, and hell, there was a section of the ship that was removed by the Borg! You want to put kids through that?! It\u2019s one of the most insane decisions I\u2019ve seen. On Deep Space 9, a space station orbiting a planet, having kids around makes sense given the circumstances\u2026 but on a Starfleet vessel heading out into the unknown, it does NOT. The uniforms. They\u2019re not practical or functional. I\u2019m sorry to people who like jumpsuits and onesies, but if you\u2019re exploring new places, you need some pockets and utility. Maybe not full-time, but at least SOME of the time. I never liked the uniforms even as a kid, and as I\u2019ve grown older, I\u2019m still baffled by this design choice.  See these uniforms? More like this. Practical, functional, and pretty comfy. Maybe swap out the boots until away missions.  The attitude/smugness. TNG was decidedly smug about themselves, sometimes almost to the point of arrogance. I really appreciated Nick Meyer\u2019s interpretations of the Star Trek universe, where people make mistakes, science can be overwhelming, and space is a dangerous place. Even when these lessons were driven home in TNG, the effect was temporary, at best. I really appreciated the original series films because life and death were constantly hanging in the balance.  Actual fighting.  I can\u2019t even say how sick to death I am of the lame hand-to-hand combat on Star Trek shows. It had already been about 20 years since the original show when TNG came out, and somehow, they made fighting look even WORSE than the silly fistfights Kirk used to get into. TNG\u2019s fight choreography was abysmal. These people are supposed to be explorers, yes, but they should know how to fight, too. I\u2019m so sick of a single palm strike or a Tai Chi class on TNG supposedly being some \u2018advanced Klingon martial art\u2019.  Keep the optimism\u2026 but temper it with the knowledge that humanity isn\u2019t perfect yet, and needs to keep working hard. It\u2019s actually why Ben Sisko is my favorite Star Trek character. In the course of \u201cDeep Space 9\u201d we see him as a character grow and change. It\u2019s hard to argue that Kirk, Janeway, or Picard really change very much in their shows; by contrast, Sisko has to deal with being a grieving widower, a Starfleet commander, a religious icon to a religion he doesn\u2019t even believe in, (while being a Federation citizen, which appears to value atheism over religious \u2018superstition\u2019), and a father. By the end of the show, he\u2019s grown in every area, has explored his brighter and darker elements to his personality, (seriously, watch \u201cIn the Pale Moonlight\u201d) gotten re-married, and actually considers retiring to Bajor. More like Ben Sisko, please! More transfers, and more promotions! Starfleet should be able to shake up the roster as needed. Captain Jellico became Captain of the Enterprise while Picard was on a dangerous mission. He was only the Captain for two episodes, but he quickly became one of my favorite Captains in all of Star Trek! Even though he was only there for a short time, his demand for professionalism changed Deanna Troi for the rest of the series, (and the films), as she stopped wearing her casual clothes and dressed in uniform ever since\u2026 she even became interested in chasing a promotion and being in command! Jellico also had a completely different management style, outlook, and history than Picard. For two glorious episodes, the social dynamic on the ship was completely turned around\u2026 and personally, I would have loved to have seen more of this! Characters got pushed and changed by a Captain with a different outlook\u2026 I would have loved to have seen what would have happened if Jellico had stayed. Would Riker have finally decided it was time to become a Captain himself and left the ship? Would Data have been promoted permanently to first officer where he was now in charge of Riker\u2019s old job\u2026 but without Riker\u2019s charm? It was also amazing to see a very competent, very capable, yet very different Captain step onto the Enterprise. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind Jellico could have been an excellent Captain for the flagship for the long haul, and it would have been a very interesting switch.  Ensign Ro Laren is another great example. She came in with fire and rebellion, and had a character arc that took her many different places. Her presence also started challenging other members of the crew and opened up a lot new possibilities. Like I said, I loved TNG because they DID have good ideas, they just always kept coming back to the status quo with the main cast instead of letting these characters continue to evolve. Not everyone should be on the ship forever; but if they\u2019re in our line of sight, we should be seeing them growing and changing. I love Geordi! Levar Burton was one of my favorite TV show hosts on \u201cReading Rainbow\u201d when I was a kid, and THE reason I tuned into every episode I could of \u201cTNG\u201d. But what killed me was that Geordi never really changed\u2026 ever. I thought this was a tragic waste of possibly the most charming member of the crew. Riker may have been smooth with the ladies, but Geordi was an everyman\u2026 and in my opinion, the most easy-going, likable guy on the ship. He spoke his mind freely but with consideration, he was typically extremely positive, and delighted in his job. But he struck out a lot with women. I would have loved to have seen him grow and change over the years. What if, by the time the series was done, he had been the character who had met someone he truly cared for, got over his hangups, had a kid, and then had to move because the relationship meant as much to him as his career\u2026 or maybe more? I think it\u2019d be great\u2026 which is why they used some of these ideas on a different character, Miles O\u2019Brien.  But for the main cast to be firmly stuck in place as characters was a big missed opportunity I would have loved to change. That\u2019s all I can think of off the top of my head. I\u2019m a fan of The Next Generation, but these were probably my biggest gripes. ",

            "answer_text": "I loved Elizabeth Hamilton \u2018s answer to this question. She spoke that day as a true Trekker. Her heart is of that world. I think I would have got the Ferengi a better agent. We needed a Quark right at the start. Armin, you redeemed the Ferengi in DS9 and then some. Troi should have been the First Officer, with Commander\u2019s rank and also the role of Counsellor. It would have been unusual to see a single crewmember with a genuine interest in the sciences, who was also versed in tactics and strategy, and a keen mind to sense crew morale on an Away Mission. Spock had two roles on board during TOS so there is precedent, and then some. Troi would have looked splendid in command red. Geordi could and should have been the Science Officer and worn blue. They didn\u2019t need to give Geordi a superpowered cybernetic visor - there are different kinds of blindness, and Geordi should have been shown to have been able to cope with having no sight, because people with sensory impairments needed that representation - someone to show how people cope without these senses. They did not need to cast Crusher as someone who \u201cwalks like a striptease queen.\u201d They didn\u2019t need to have Picard and Crusher share a past - but if there was still a need for that shared past, and for there to still be a Wesley Crusher, it should have come out early on that Picard is indeed Wesley\u2019s Dad, from when Crusher had just come out of a relationship with Walker Keel and they\u2019d both been on the rebound. And Wesley, and any other kids, should have been kept in the background. Stable relationships would and should have been a thing right from the get go. Troi, Geordi, Picard, Crusher, all seeing civilian members of the crew. But again, the kids should have been seen and not heard. The Farpoint Station thing could have taken place around episode 8, and introduced two new crewmembers who were awaiting transfer to the Enterprise - two old friends, a Klingon called Worf, and his android buddy Data. Both with the rank of Lieutenant Commander, having served Starfleet together with distinction. Both would have far different back stories - Worf was a member of a proud, flourishing Klingon family, but he and his father Mogh had had differing views, so he ran away from his qorDu\u2019 and sister Kurn, and joined Starfleet, which is a Klingon turn of phrase equivalent to our saying that someone\u2019s run off and joined a circus; and Data could have been found in a warehouse on Earth, property of a genius called Dr Soong who\u2019d just run away rather than face further ridicule. No Omicron Theta, no Crystalline Entity, and no Lore. The Klingon Empire could have matured, and acknowledged that farmers, construction workers and other personnel such as physicians, scientists, artists and actors had their role to play in promoting Klingon culture, not just its warriors. Worf could have run away from a traditionalist tuq to pursue his own careers in anthropology and medicine, proving himself to be a brilliant medical doctor in his own right as well as a formidable warrior. And they could have been grateful for some unspecified disasters in their past where the Federation intervened selflessly to save Klingon lives, because it was a Starfleet officer who said to them \u201cKlingons are a proud race, and we\u2019re happy to do everything to ensure you can go on being proud.\u201d The Farpoint Station should have been a mid-season two-parter; the planet was indeed falling to the Ferengi, but Picard realised something else was going on and discovered the Energy Being, releasing it to its mate, and formally giving the planet over to the Ferengi who had presented the better claim to Deneb IV - only to have them reject the offer, as the planet was now worthless to them. Worf could have empathised with the Ferengi, because they had their own code of ethics, and sometimes they could have been stifled by traditionalism too. He could have seen the limitations of militarised colonial profiteering, and been the moral core of the crew if it looked as if they were about to do a bit of colonialism, just as Crusher was the moral centre of the ship when it came to general ethics. Data did not need to be a Pinocchio, following the story of Asimov\u2019s Bicentennial Man. Data could have been happy, literally happy, to be an android, and quested for Dr Soong to show that Noonien\u2019s final experiment had been, in fact, a success. No Q until about episode 16. Have them encounter him on a dead world, Omicron Theta, in his judicial regalia. Have him look at them as if to say \u201cYou took your time getting here,\u201d and then the trial. Without the racist Orientalist trappings. Q could reveal that his species comes along once in a while to judge whole civilisations as worthy or unworthy - basically, everything the Prime Directive was set up to defend against. Q would have been a member of a Type III or IV civilisation, judging the fledgling Type I Federation on the eve of its becoming a Type II, \u201cin a millennium or two.\u201d Yes, Q would still have been the main villain of the show. They would not have needed to bring in the Borg, at all. Romulans would have sufficed - Romulans, and Klingons, who had lost whole worlds to the Ferengi, and who would have had to work together with the Federation to buy them back, before Q stepped in to reveal that the Ferengi had been agents of the Q, and that their activities had been part of the Q\u2019s investigation into the worthiness of all three civilisations. Looking back, TNG had a lot of faults, and honestly the scriptwriters were the largest part of the problems - and you ought to know that, despite the radical changes above, I am happy with the way things turned out back then. In 1986, it was enough that there was going to be a brand new Star Trek on our screens. You have no idea how much that meant to those of us who lived through those days. ",

            "answer_text": "I have been re-watching ST:TNG for approximately the thousandth time since it first aired in 1987. I was a big fan of Star Trek from a young age. My father remembered gathering in the common room of his college dorm to watch it, and when it was in syndication, he showed me. A local station played an episode five days a week at 4:35pm. As a teacher, he was usually home by then. We would make some popcorn and settle in. We watched the same 79 episodes again and again. We made a game where we would try to be the first to name the episode. So, I was basically born a Trekkie. When a new series was announced, though, I was skeptical. Could they recapture any of it? Would it just be a remake of old stories, or would it really be something new? Encounter at Farpoint was fine, but then they followed it up with The Naked Now, and I almost gave up. The only thing that kept me going was that there wasn\u2019t really a lot of other TV science fiction going on, so what else was a nerd to watch? The first season had its ups and downs, but overall, it got better and better. What did they do right? Female representation: Female security officer (at least to start), female doctor, ships counselor (more on that later)Black senior officerDisabled senior officer (more on that also)Bald captain - yeah, I think bald representation as sexy is importantActual diplomacy, actual first contact, actually facing the Prime DirectiveLwaxana Troi, Q, Lore, Duras and Gowron - I loved recurring guests who had some continuityStorylines that actually have an effect. Locutus didn\u2019t just go away, nor did Worf\u2019s Klingon problems. Let\u2019s face it, you could basically watch TOS episodes in any order and not miss a beat. Not so with TNG.Now, what could they have done better? Deanna Troi should have been in a uniform from the beginning - and not the mini skirt from Farpoint. For too long, Troi only stood on the bridge and basically acted decorative. We didn\u2019t see her counseling ship\u2019s personnel until much later, and it wasn\u2019t until even later that we see her actual diplomatic chops, giving the command staff useful advice on tricky situations. She didn\u2019t get a real uniform until halfway through Season 6. She could have been so much more than an intergalactic cheerleader.LaForge having a disability was remarkable, especially for the time. However, they went too far toward making this disability a super power, and it almost never caused actual difficulty. Being blind should have been hard on him, sometimes.Speaking of LaForge, I never saw his stalkerish, incel tendencies until re-watching episodes in rapid succession. What was with that? Either give the guy a chance or stop writing Geordi near-miss romances into the scripts.Wesley. When I was 16, I liked him. In fact, I had a massive crush on Wil Wheaton. But on re-watching, the first two seasons make me think of the coach who has to put the sponsor\u2019s kid into the game even though he belongs on the bench. I think he should have had important stories, but he should not have been an \u201cacting ensign.\u201d That was out of place with the world. Then his final storyline was weak. I liked that he screwed up at the academy. I would have liked to see him work through that and come out stronger on the other side instead of running away with The Traveler.Pick up the storylines they left laying on the floor: The parasites from \u201cConspiracy\u201d, the aliens from \u201cSchisms\u201d, Moriarity, Tasha\u2019s daugher, the frozen humans from \u201cThe Neutral Zone\u201d and others. The \u201cConspiracy\u201d aliens really get under my skin, if you\u2019ll excuse the expression. Just gonna go on about your business, huh? OK.In spite of the things I would have liked to see them do better, I still think Star Trek: The Next Generation is one of the greatest TV series of all time. Knowing that some things weren\u2019t perfect doesn\u2019t change that. ",

            "answer_text": "When Gene Roddenberry conceived Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG), he wanted new races and new adventures, not a rehash of TOS. I consider this to have been a fundamental misstep that left an otherwise brilliant series less satisfying than it might otherwise have been.  If some divine agent like Q were to give me the opportunity to go back and fix past mistakes, like \u201cJean-Luc Picard\u2019s\u201d adventure in \u201cTapestry,\u201d I would jump at the chance, and hopefully with better results. Buckle your non-existent seat belts, let\u2019s do it! I believe the formula used to good effect in later series, particularly Deep Space Nine (DS9) and Enterprise (ENT), would have been the better way to go - long-term story arcs spanning many episodes and often continuing over multiple seasons. It is the difference between a pile of bones and an assembled skeleton, and Roddenberry chose the pile of bones.  TOS introduced us to an early but successful Federation of many species; but TNG deliberately refrained from presenting the evolution of any of these, apart from the adversary races (Klingons and Romulans). Instead, we got an endless succession of new one-episode races - never to be heard from again - portrayed with a few prosthetic lines or bumps on their heads. You will recall that ENT methodically provided the backstory as to how humanity developed a relationship first with Vulcan (Jolene Blalock\u2019s T\u2019Pol was a delight to watch), then Andoria (likewise Shran, played by the consummate Trek actor, Jeffrey Combs). Soon, we saw another of the founding races, the quarrelsome Tellarites, and we met the instantly adversarial Klingons and Romulans. We witnessed humanity\u2019s first encounter with the Ferengi. We saw the horror of the Borg, reanimated in Earth\u2019s own Arctic and destroyed by the Enterprise NX-01, but not before sending a message that would not arrive until the 24th Century - and now we know why TNG\u2019s Q arranged humanity\u2019s first \u201cofficial\u201d encounter with the Borg. They were coming anyway.  Unlike the later TOS prequel, ENT, the writers of TNG produced an uneven succession of stand-alone episodes. They would have done better to follow the route ENT took and present serial episodes with large-scale plot arcs. What would I fix? That. Despite the insertion of the Xindi War (recall Ferengi Rule of Acquisition #34: \u201cWar is good for business\u201d!), the general flow of Enterprise was to introduce races, treaties, institutions, and technologies (eg., \u2018phase pistols,\u2019 transporter, holodeck) in a sequential way. The fourth and final season ended with the founding of the \u201cCoalition of Planets,\u201d the immediate precursor to the far more sophisticated Federation of Planets.\u201d Had ENT continued, the evolution of the new Coalition toward the Federation would undoubtedly have been a continued theme.  DS9 succeeded where TNG failed, developing grand themes and characters\u2019 stories alike over time. When an event like the wedding of Worf to Jadzia Dax happened, it was no one-off surprise, but the culmination of a long set-up. Would I be a disloyal Trekker to say that what TNG needed was the Babylon V formula? DS9 was the most successful of the Star Trek series at presenting serial stories and plot arcs on a grand scale - the Emissary\u2019s evolving relationship with the Prophets, the trials of the planet Bajor, the ongoing intrigues with the Cardassians, the brilliantly portrayed Dominion War, the descent of Kai Winn and Gul Dukat into hell. Instead of this kind of consistency, what we got with TNG was the farcical New Race Of The Week, and an endless procession of human actors with head prosthetics. TNG featured a bewildering scatter of stories, some great, some bloody awful, but most happening with no relationship to anything that had boldly gone before, or anything that would follow. I would have boldly fixed that if I were given the chance. Q, are you listening? ",

I had the opportunity to meet many of the writers on TNG, see a lot of the new props, uniforms and the like during the first season at a fairly exclusive SF con. I wasn\u2019t very impressed with that first season and really wished it had been different. Some \u2018fixes\u2019 others have mentioned but these are the ones I would have liked: No kids. Sorry, kids do not belong on a space ship that is regularly put in danger. That was a horrible idea. Wesley could have appeared very irregularly in episodes in which the new Enterprise hits starbasesSmarter Economics. The whole question of money and the Federation economy was wishy-washy and still not defined.Uniforms. The \u2018grey variant\u2019 uniforms shown in the movies looked more polished, but they still left me wondering how easily they can be taken off to use the rest roomExuding Competence. There were too many psychologically fragile people in Star Fleet, and most officers and admirals had less charisma than your average DMV worker. Star Fleet should be the best of the best.More familiar aliens. Id like to have seen Andorians, Tellarites, Vulcans, as well as aliens met during TOS as regular members (even the purple haired space hippie from TOS would have been interesting)More alien aliens. The rubber head alien with the personality of a suburban Californian got old, very fastOngoing plots other than Q, the Borg. Unlike TOS, TNG could have had each discovery build on the next. The \u2018puppeteer\u2019 aliens should have been a season long story.Dial back on Data. It was a bit too much too fast, especially since he seemed to be learning while being a senior officer.Ship\u2019s Counselor. Never saw one on another ship. Doesn\u2019t belong on the bridge, and the empath ability was kind of a sick invasion of privacyBetter fighting choreography. Shatner alone practices Kirk-fu. Worf always seemed to go down after three blows. Way too predictable.Better missions. Some of the missions they were on were totally inappropriate for a flagship vessel",

            "answer_text": "Get rid of that witch, Troi. No, not Lwaxana (she\u2019s fun), I mean Deanna.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t hate the character at all. I quite like her. She\u2019s the femininity of the series, the romantic vortex, the emotional linchpin, the new-age spiritual priestess. But having \u201cmagic\u201d in Star Trek is just silly and drags it down. I am not calling her a witch to be disparaging. I call her that because she is like the magical witch/wizard prophetic advisors to the king in tales of old. Her role is literally that of a witch. Now, obviously, I can see the rebuttals people may have against that. Here are some that spring to mind: Star Wars had the Force, which was magic, and it worked well. Yes, it worked well because SW is science-fantasy and it was central to the story. (Well, it did work until George Lucas decided to sabotage his own franchise, but that\u2019s another rant)She\u2019s half-alien with half-alieny superpowers, and to paraphrase Arthur C Clarke, \u201cany sufficiently alien biological function will be indistinguishable from magic.\u201d Sure, but it doesn\u2019t make it not crap.There are other more outlandish ideas, especially in the original series. Sure, but TNG was made for a different generation. Also, TNG made a big deal of its scientific and technical advisors.I am sure there are many people who like the telepathy and tele-empathy aspect of ST, but I could very much do without it. Star Trek is more sciencey than Star Wars. In Voyager, Seven of Nine had telepathic powers, but they were plausible, explained with science and technology. Obviously, this answer is intentionally pedantic and hyperbolic. I don\u2019t really have a problem with the telepathy, since ST is not supposed to be really hard scifi. But at the very least I would have had it as a couple of one-off episodes. I will say that it did lead to some interesting premises, like the ethics of having a witch advisor in political and business negotiations, but that should have been a one-off philosophical exploration. Indeed, one of my favorite episodes is about Betazoid. Tin Man, it is all about an extreme empath who makes a connection to a weird alien. It\u2019s a brilliant story, but again, it\u2019s a one-off. TL;DR: My point is that I think it was a mistake to have a core character be \u2018magical\u2019. I think Troi would have been a better character without the magic. I think a sensitive, emotional grounding for show elevates it above just being a nerdy collection of technobabble. But the telepathy somehow diminishes her usefulness and demotes her to \u201cinformation witch\u201d. As some people have pointed out, Spock was a telepath. I already said the original series was pretty wacky, and at least touch-based telepathy is more feasible than telepathy through space (but don\u2019t fucking get me started on Discovery - UGH!). Also, I wouldn\u2019t have included her in the poker games.  ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there, Having re-watched all of it on Netflix (which is totally worth it on this front alone), here are my solutions\u2026 [1] Less Worf Family troubles \u2026. this got annoying quickly.  [A man with severe family matters\u2026er troubles for every.second.episode .. wears thin] [2] Less Klingons, while we are at it\u2026  [Barely 2-dimensional, and wore thin even more quickly] [3] Get rid of the neverending set of K\u2019apostrophe aliens that look like Angelenos - more variety - and creativity please ! [4] Lwaxana Troi aka \u2018The Wife\u2019 , Majel Barrett Roddenberry - was not seen enough - she was an utter joy.  [The life and soul of the party - truly much mourned] [5] When we do see phaser fights, I\u2019ve see actors dodge - poppycock ! [6] STAY OUT OF FRIGGIN\u2019 CAVES !!!! ARRRRGHHH!!! You\u2019ve got a blinking Starship, and then you want to go spelunking ? ALL the time ???  [bleaagghh!] [7] Useless technobabble - which is not scientifically rigourous. The list is long - and derisive ! The Particles of Star Trek [8] By the 2nd season of ST:TNG in 1990ish, computer graphics had (by personal experience) already become mature enough to make some amazing TV programs - look no further than Mainframe Entertainment\u2019s epic Reboot. This was an open the door to making anything you wanted, and at photorealistic appearance more than adequate for TV production at the time. And yet\u2026we got endless reuse of a non-descript triangular ship and other retreads\u2026eventually they bit the bullet in the movie First Contact with the Steamrunner Class but there was NOTHING preventing a bit of creativity in that department either\u2026.  [Should have seen stuff like this ages ago - Mainframe could have more than adequately rendered stuff like this in 1991] [9] Some creativity with PLANETS ! Did we get a gas-giant-with-rings habitable moon ? Nope\u2026  Did we get a planet orbiting a pulsar-star pair ? Nope\u2026  Heck, did we get an M-class planet orbiting a binary or a trinary stellar system ? Nope\u2026  Or perhaps a Rocheworld ? Nope\u2026  Or a planet in an open cluster ? Nope\u2026  Or\u2026. I could go on and on - in 1985 there were more than adequate scope for places to go in the universe, explore, and make into the basis of a story. Having a mystical experience at a black hole. Getting lost on the surface of a ringed habitable planet which is empty, and having a spiritual experience/survival experience ( STAY OUT OF CAVES IDIOTS!), discovering new life on a Rocheworld - which looks nothing like humans (next point!), Finding intelligent life in the atmospheres of a gas giant. And all for this is inexcusable ! You\u2019ll see a name on the end credits, in the form of Rick Sternbach, who is a wonderful space artist - his high point in terms of producing amazing imagery was as contributing artist for Carl Sagan\u2019s series Cosmos which included such real-world examples as seen here - yet the poor chap seems to have been utterly ignored from Season 3 onwards\u2026 [10] Artificial Megastructures - we could have seen so much more ! By the time TNG came out, Iain M. Banks Culture novels were already out - so why didn\u2019t we see an Orbital ?  Or, if we are sticking to American SF, a Ringworld ?  Or, perhaps other Dyson Spheres ? The episode \u2018Relics\u2019 should have been the basis of a series of stories involving coming back to the newly discovered Dyson Sphere. And discovering others part built, perhaps. We only got a Space Elevator in Star Trek Voyager, so that\u2019s another opportunity missed. And how about a Star City ? We saw one in Cosmos - there\u2019s Rick Sternbach being ignored again\u2026  There are so many megastructures which could have been discovered and been both superscience and archaeology in one go - to the delight of Captain Picard. [11] More NON HUMANS !  [He doesn\u2019t count] I would honestly like to have seen more exotic non-human life \u2026  Such as Gas Giant fauna\u2026.  More Silicon based life \u2026  And we should always consider going weird - this kind of stuff was not impossible back then ! [12] Smack the blinking Romulans - good and proper. They are more trouble than they are worth imho. It would up requiring a supernova to finally get their heads out of their arses - best thing for them, again imho. And Irish Tal Shiar, Romulan New Zealand Elves as a consequence is certainly more fun !  [Kiwi Romulan Elf - great fun] [12a] Transporters not being explored to the limits\u2026. One thing that sticks in my mind is how a transporter could so easily be the basis of many stories\u2026 [a] It is a fountain of youth ! You can literally use DNA to de-age Dr. Pulaski, so \u2026 ? [b] The cure for cancers, too\u2026 [c] Rebuild nervous systems too, by that definition - and therefore cure Geordi of that Alice-band. [14] Replicators not being explored to their limits\u2026 While Captain Kirk talked about making tonnes of diamonds, its likely that this was by replicator tech. So, why are we not seeing stories about the impact of replicators ? we would again have to wait until Voyager before we got into some good story opportunities\u2026and so this was a great chance missed. [15] An invisible Federation We know about Earth, Vulcan, some snippets about Andoria and Tellar, Risa, Archer 4, Betazed, and \u2026 ???? The remainder of the Federation seems to be a total non-entity, and this I find to be a very great disappointment - even when exploring the Galaxy, there would have been enormous scope for encountering a colony of Andorians whose community dates from before the contact with Jonathan Archer\u2026.or, perhaps, something even more interesting. [16] Bathrooms. More of them. PLEASE ! [17] Less.friggin.ambassadors. An explorer ship, flagship and all, has better business than being a glorified limo. I mean, you\u2019ve already got an entire ship class named for and devoted to these busybodies !  [Uber for busybodies]  Ok, thanks for looking at my list of wishes and peeves on where TNG could have ended up - and should of. In this way, Enterprise and Discovery have been hugely satisfying to me, in terms of seeing a form of Star Trek that I have always wished it were - again, subscribing to Netflix has been have been totally worth it in this regard. My 2c worth, and with kind regards. ",

            "answer_text": "The entire world building has to be redone from the ground up simply due to the implications of transporter technology. Why are you transporting entire human beings around in a massive starship if you can house them digitally in a \u201cpattern buffer\u201d? Starships become nothing more than space going server farms, because it solves so many problems: Your explorer always beams down in peak condition. Giant Thnark chewed off your arm or a case of Rigillian toe fungus picked up on planet? Just edit that out when you beam back aboard.Mess or Chow halls are not needed, nor any of the logistics of storing or transporting food. Your pattern does not need it in storage, and when you beam down to a planet etc., all your cells are refreshed and full of glucose, vitamins, minerals, and in the case of Captain Kirk, Viagra.Briefings and debriefings are all done in virtual space while in computer storage. To the outside observer, you just received a PHD level training in the History, Society, Customs, Language and diplomacy of Wzissoo IV in about 3.5 seconds, then spent another 25 seconds with the team running about 457 different scenarios. The last 1.5 seconds included the crew party, promotions boards, two Captain\u2019s masts (those virtual engineers really can get into a lot of s**t) and the usual administrative paperwork before instantiation and beaming down.The real world logistics are also very different. Rather than massive space docks, Western Digital churns out starship cores by the millions. Even a \u201cGlobular Cluster\u201d class cruiser with 10,000 beings on board is only about the size of a 20th century era jet airplane. Things get ridiculous with dedicated warships- a \u201cNeutron Star\u201d class energy bombardment ship may be the size of a 20th century aircraft carrier, but the crew is housed in a heavily armoured capsule only slightly larger than a 21rst century USB\u201dthumb drive\u201d. There are 600 backup crews in their own secure drives scattered around the ship as well. In fact every sort of tool or piece of equipment known or developed is also stored in the pattern buffers.Sorry, but you actually don\u2019t need pockets. Or canteens. Or even underwear or sanitary tools like a toothbrush-when you are instantiated in real space, whatever you need can be beamed directly to your hand, foods or nutrition beamed into your stomach (or even at a cellular level) and wastes removed, you body cleaned, clothing renewed\u2026Your weapons for personal and collective defense can be as simple as beaming a piece of metal into the center of the adversary\u2019s brain matter, while the computer can randomly beam you around the room to evade blows, strikes, kicks etc. Bullets will be \u201cplucked\u201d out of the air. Evading beam weapons will be much more difficult, but even if you get scorched on the way out, you are re edited back on board the ship.A lot of story lines die out as well. There are no space miners - a mining ship comes along and beams the lovely dilithium crystals right out of the rocks and into the cargo bay. Same for space farmers - even people who want to farm will be doing it in virtual space.Which means the entire \u201ceconomy\u201d is mostly dedicated to gathering energy and raw materials. Earth is embedded in a Dyson swarm to provide the energy for running trillions of transporters and associated devices. The Star Trek Universe There are so many other potential implications of transporter technology that I have only scratched the surface. So Star Trek world building needs to be totally redone to reflect the implications of transporter technology. ",

Let Patrick Stewart lean to his strengths early on. Roddenberry looked at Patrick Stewart on the set like he didn't belong their every day of filming while he was alive. He couldn't see an older man being a starship captain and wanted a young buck that could bed women and captain guns a blazing. It wasnt until after he died the writers could start giving Picard his best episodes. Picard is the greatest Captain of all time BECAUSE he's not the same as Kirk.Be more consistent with what Data can and can't do. They had him get drunk and claim he bleeds in the Amock Time tribute episode.Give Geordie a journey to becoming Chief Engineer. They started the show without having a regular cast in the role yet and kept changing the engineer every week. But engineering is important! You cant have an enterprise without a Scotty! And Geordi was always going to be the regular cast member to get that role. Roddenberry loved the ironic poetry of having a blind pilot, but pilots don't do much during most episodes, and a blind engineer with Daredevil super vision is just a poetic. But knowing that, they could have built up to the job change. Had him study mechanics because of his visor. Getting engineering experience on Datas circuits cause they need his visor to see things or whatever\u2026Geordis thing was partly the great Everyman archetype. But he got radically overshadowed when nearly every episode he plays a significant role in it's as supporting cast to some awkward socialite (Hueh, Data, Barkley). It was never Geordi who had the arc in most of his episodes. They needed to put him in situations that foiled his Everyman nature more. Episodes he had to grow in.Diana and Riker. Some more serialized consistency would be nice their. Are they people who are awkwardly figuring out how to just be friends or are the an old burning flame waiting to get rekindled? Maybe we could get more Betazed focused episodes out of this if they took this path.Remember the bug people? Who took over Earths high command? Yeah just do something else.",

Hm\u2026some of the best (and the worst) episodes of ToS ended the crisis, and then the clean up started. Think \u201cA Taste of Armageddon\u201d. Kirk gets the two sides to stop fighting and talk to each other. As the episode ends, the final message from Ambassador Fox is that peace negotiations have started, and the outlook is hopeful. Think \u201cDevil in the Dark\u201d. Kirk and Spock establish communication with the Horta, explain to the miners that they\u2019ve been destroying the Horta\u2019s eggs, and arrange a modus vivendi between the Horta and the miners. The final message from Vandenberg - \u201cthe Hortas are ugly but you could get used to them\u201d. Spock comments the Horta had the same feeling about humans. They\u2019re not best friends - they\u2019ve just decided to leave each other alone and maybe work together. Maybe after a time there might be trust, then friendship. \u201cArena\u201d. \u201cReturn of the Archons\u201d, \u201cThe Apple\u201d. \u201cThe Cloud Minders\u201d. All of these find the Enterprise confronted by a problem, and the Enterprise destroys or neutralizes or corrects whatever or whomever is causing the problem to not be fixed. But when the Enterprise leaves the planet, the problem still needs to be fixed. By contrast, I found that TNG tended to make really interesting and severe problems, and then someone finds the magical solution and - poof - everything is solved and tied up with a neat bow. The one that really grated was the episode where the Romulans are secretly supporting one side in the Klingon civil war. The Enterprise stops one Romulan supply convoy, and the forces of Duras collapse, and the war is almost over. It would have been more interesting to see the civil war continue, and Duras and his family have to try to hold their side together after it had been demonstrated that they were getting support from the Romulans. But no. There are lots of other examples, but because I\u2019ve seen the ToS episodes many many times I can easily recall them. Not so, for me, with the TNG episodes. Get rid of the nice, neat, bow tie endings. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of my problems involve poor character development for Yar, Troi, and Worf. And then there are consistency issues\u2026 I would have left out Tasha Yar entirely or given her a role of \u201cweapons officer\u201d and made Worf security chief from the beginning. I would also have had a dedicated communications officer, like on the original series, since that job really does require a lot of work. (As a ham radio operator, I know how challenging radio operation really is.)Left Troi off the bridge. She was criminally underused through much of her time on the series (she really only got two or three really good episodes), and she spent more time as a love interest than being used for her telepathic powers. I get why she was so often \u201caway\u201d, because she would have seen through some of the plots in seconds, ending the conflict before the third act. So if that\u2019s the case, she should simply not be part of the main cast - instead only being used for diplomatic missions and times where her specific talents are needed. The rest of the time, she should be in the medical center, treating patients and doing psychological research.Just like Crusher didn\u2019t have a seat on the bridge, neither should Troi have had her own chair.Worf never got to be the hero. Instead, he was the show\u2019s punching bag. He needed some glorious moments, which he eventually got in DS9. I\u2019d like to have seen more great Worf moments. Likewise, Worf was a terrible father\u2026 and I lay this mostly at terrible writing. Even if Alexander was off screen most of the time, he should have been around, and Worf never should have sent his son off to his parents.Consistency of units of measure and other details: In one episode, a ship with \u201climited speed\u201d can travel 15 light years in a day, but we later learn (in Voyager) that the maximum sustained speed of a a starship is around 1000c. This means a starship can (roughly) travel 3 light years per day. So a \u201cslow\u201d cargo ship should have been able to make less than 1 light year per day. Those kinds of mistakes annoy me to no end.",

            "answer_text": "So many good answers, but I'll try to give something less talked about, the aliens. In TOS the klingons looked bad but were greatly improved upon by TNG. Yet, most aliens looked the same and few showed what is known as a \u2018starfish aliens\u2019 design. TOS had the tholians, the horta and even the gorn, more fantastic designs than most rubberheads. Another problem was the \u201dalien if the week\u201d syndrom, which introduced many races thay were barely touched upon. For example, the sheliaks, they were both starfish aliens and had a history of conflict with the federation. why not develop that potential? TNG was great in exploring klingon and romulan culture and politics but what about all those minor races? you dont even have to show them, just mention them more and use them as background. For example, minor races in Babylon 5 were very well developed, ask a fan, just from watching the show, anout the culture of the drazi or pak\u2019 ma\u2018 ra, which dont even have a character and they would be able to tell you so much about them and those races had a feel and presence much more than the average random alien TNG met this week. Overall, less is sometimes more, making first contact be actually important and special, having fewer alien cultures but more developed, just like main characters and not be afraid of having a recurring race looking like a lump like the Horta did. For example, there are so many episodes with temporal anomalies, maybe they should've happened around Tholian space while mentioning intel about the Tholians being time travelers or having several missions around Sheliak space which would've force the crew to work around the convoluted Sheliak peace agreement. More of the Tamarians and their culture, building on that one successful first contact with a series of episodes throughout the show, showing how the Tamarians change from first contact status to trade, military and eventually federation partners. Even something fantastical like Q is brushed aside because it's annoying while its basically a SPACE GOD. why not a single episode where the federation try to negotiate with the Q or just showing a bit more intrest than \u201cyou are hindering our mission of exploration with you reality shattering presence\u201c. Hello? this space god is one of the most amazi.g thing a crew could stumble upon yet they give it as much attention s being forced to do chores. I just want my fantastic space adventures to be\u2026 fantastic? ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously, I would have doubled down on the men in skorts. Every man would be in a skort, all the time.  Also, I would have tweaked the characters to amplify their purported reasons to be on the show. Most of the characters were, as written, too conservative in what they were supposed to be. Picard: Leave him as he is. He\u2019s marvelous. Riker: Was billed as an ambitious hotshot. This was dropped after the first few episodes. I think it would have been a fine approach to the character. An ambitious hotshot would\u2019ve come into conflict with Picard in a reversal of the Kirk/Spock dynamic, and once we got attached to him, we would\u2019ve been worried that he was going to seek a promotion and leave the crew. Or the writers could have played up the lothario bit and made it a character flaw for him to overcome as he matures enough for Deanna to give him a second shot. Or . . . anything, really. There was never much to work with for Riker. I don\u2019t feel that the boat was missed, because I never figured out what the boat was. Data: Fan-friggin\u2019-tastic. Leave him as he is. Worf: Really great character who transitioned smoothly to DS9. My only quibble is that the writers used \u201cthis bad guy can throw Worf around like a doll!\u201d to tell us how dangerous the bad guys were. Over and over and over. Worf must\u2019ve weighed thirty pounds. My change: Give us frequent scenes in which Worf is in the background casually mopping the floor with big tough troublemakers or heaving massive objects around and nobody bats an eye because, like, that\u2019s why he\u2019s security, dog. Wesley: Iconic. This character is agonizing and unfixable and has finally come to be deeply cherished by fans everywhere. It took us three decades to understand what a cringey treasure we had in Wesley Crusher. Don\u2019t change a thing. Wil Wheaton forever. Troi: HHHHHHUAHHHHHHHARGHHHHHH *deep breath* Look. Easy fix. It\u2019s the fix that the Picard writers went for, and they did nothing else effectively: Write her as a goddamn therapist. When she lays into Picard and Riker, it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s the only person on screen who\u2019s been paying attention to the traumatized person in front of all of them, and she\u2019s demanding better. It\u2019s beautiful. In her original run, this was such a frustrating misfire after misfire after misfire. Troi\u2019s purpose was clear. We were in the mid eighties; we were getting comfortable with the idea of mental health care. So we put a therapist in space. And then didn\u2019t make her a good therapist. She just . . . mugged at people and had big feelings. I think we came up with the idea but didn\u2019t bother finding out what a therapist was.  And she was supposed to be semi-psychic. She was supposed to be so skilled at taking her species\u2019 natural empathic senses and interpreting them, that she was a walking lie detector, a pro cheerleader, an indispensable advisor to negotiation, and an early warning system for violence. And she never did any of that. She just pulled faces and said things like \u201cI\u2019m sensing . . . hostility\u201d after we saw a big angry alien roar and heard him make threats. Troi\u2019s superpowers actually being super? Also an easy fix. Just cut away the things that make her redundant, to the viewer and to the crew. We\u2019d make the big alien smile and say friendly things, and Troi would say \u201cI\u2019m sensing . . . hostility\u201d and we\u2019d say \u201cHuh?\u201d and then the alien would fire on the ship and we\u2019d say \u201cShit!\u201d Troi would yell that something\u2019s wrong with the away team, and then we wouldn\u2019t have the bridge crew gape at her and then get a distress call from the away team. We\u2019d just have the bridge crew act on her warning and beam the away team out immediately, without wasting time checking in first. Troi was redundant. She didn\u2019t have to be. Geordi: Wesley\u2019s awkwardness and frankly terrible writing as a sensitive, bright teenager has aged better and better (but lord it\u2019s not good). Geordi\u2019s awkwardness and mediocre writing as a sensitive wanna-be lover has . . . aged very badly indeed. It comes across as condescending to the character and as casually misogynistic. Geordi needs a revamp. Give Geordi some new hobbies that aren\u2019t \u201ctrying to hook up with girls.\u201d Make him less naive and more useful in his mentoring relationship with Data. He\u2019s a tech wizard with magic robovision and his BFF is a robot. How fun! Now what? If Riker is the guy who runs around doing all his Riker things with no clear sense of who Riker is supposed to be, Geordi is the guy with lots of distinctives who doesn\u2019t seem to have much to do when he\u2019s outside of engineering. He\u2019s just the guy who hangs around and comments on things. Crusher: Just more, please. Do we want to focus on her tension as a mother and a bridge officer? Her grief as a widow? Are we gonna do a will-they-won\u2019t-they with the captain? Is she an impassioned medical ethicist? Does she impulsively chase opportunities to better herself? Does her experience with the Borg leave her horrified with herself? I dunno, man; none of those facets got more than a few lines. We needed more Dr. Crusher.  Here\u2019s a baby blanket I made for a family friend. I call it \u201cShut up, baby!\u201d ",

One of Roddenberry\u2019s earliest mistakes was his failure to understand that his evil capitalists could not simultaneously be threatening and portrayed as comically clueless idiots. I\u2019d want them to be clever, cosmopolitan and operate through charming and pretty representatives. I\u2019d want them to be Gordon Gekko. Above all I\u2019d actually make the Ferengi predatory capitalists. I\u2019d want to see them destroying planetary environments, creating company towns where everyone is in debt to the company store, selling weapons to both sides of local wars, introducing addictive pharmaceuticals into new markets. The Combine would be an evil mirror to the Federation, just as racially diverse (including humans) and expansionist, After that, I\u2019d \u201cfix\u201d Data. Specifically I\u2019d the first episode be the ship investigating the loss of yet another colony and have them encounter both a Ferengi vessel and that the only survivor is an android. They have to figure out if the Ferengi or the android is responsible and whether to yield to the Ferengi claim that they financed the creation of the android and therefore are the rightful owners as well as dealing with the actual cause of the massacre which threatens them both. Eventually the android would be brought aboard but wouldn\u2019t be given a rank. That way deciding whether or not the android was a person on Measure of a Man would still be an open question. I\u2019d seriously consider making the android the eye candy female that every Star Trek series seems to have. After the hearing to decide the android\u2019s legal status, I\u2019d make it the \u201cacting ensign\u201d I\u2019d make Worf the security chief from the start and I\u2019d make sure to include fights he gets to win. And I\u2019m sure the show would get along fine without ever having Wesley. ",

            "answer_text": "(1) Made the uniform costumes proper clothing rather thang the uncomfortable and stupid looking onesies the cast wore in the first few seasons. The idea that people will be wearing tight jumpsuits where they have to strip mostly naked just to pee in the future is really ridiculous. My version of TNG would have either used loose fitting coveralls like the military used at the time, or ideally proper three piece outfits with separate pants, and under T shirt, and an outer jacket. (2) Made Troi a more well developed character with more to do on the ship and bridge. The universal translator would be a lot less reliable and she'd play double duty as a linguist and the ship's therapist. She'd also wear a proper uniform when on duty. In general she'd use her telepathy and empathy a lot more. (3) Aliens would be more alien. If I ran the production we'd spend more money on creature design, probably hiring David Cronenberg, so most of the aliens wouldn't look like humans with things stuck to their faces. Similarly, aliens wouldn't speak English unless the were canonically supposed to speak English. They'd speak alien sounding gibberish with subtitles, and the Federation crew would simply be expected to understand the alien language thanks to their universal translators. (4) The universal translator would be explicitly written as an chip implanted either in \u201cwearers'\" inner ears or brains, or as an earpiece or bone conducting headphone type thing that was plainly visible. (5) The bridge crew/main cast would rarely be sent on away missions, with lower ranked/supporting and guest actors making the majority of missions. (6) The main cast would not be unkillable and redshirting would be greatly reduced. If an episode featured a botched away mission or a space battle, the involved main cast members would have a 1 in 5 chance of ending the episode either dead or on life support in sickbay. (7) Riker would be absolutely useless at playing the saxophone. ",

They are always presented as mono cultures, with a universal mindset (for instance, the ferengis are ALL uber-capitalists, another species are ALL xenophobic, another will be ALL peace-loving or ALL war-mongering.

That swooping panel warf stands before is curved the wrong way (picture a big piano keyboard that curves away at the edges so the distant keys are even more distant), and impractical as people are always walking around it down the swooping ramps (with the swooping handrails making for an even longer trip).

I could go on and on. The cast\u2014 both permanent and those just passing through were, almost without exception, the sappiest ensemble in history. Even the cast members who were likable enough weren\u2019t feasible \u2018liked Wil Wheaton; \u2018think Wesley Crusher is not feasible. \u2018LikedLevar Burton; utterly distracted by his appliance and his eternally cheery disposition. I liked Guinan and Worf; absolutely hated Q!! And so it went\u2026 How TNG survived with so few likable and relatable characters is a mystery. I would suppose it\u2019s just a credit to those very few characters one could relate to. TNG was a really cool show that was always flying on just one wing\u2014 or more rightly on one nacell because of more than HALF of its crappy crew. ",

            "answer_text": "TNG was a product of its time\u2026 Answering this question today, in 2020, seems rather unfair to the show. TNG maintained good ratings over its entire run. And compared to the drek that was on TV in the late 1980\u2019s and early 1990\u2019s? TNG is downright amazing. Remember, this was all before streaming\u2026 or DVR\u2019s\u2026 Or even widespread use of home video recording. Grand schemes to turn it into a \u2018modern\u2019 show are just non-starters in the TV environment that it was born in. Further, so many issues in ST:TNG really get back to the absolutely pathetic budget the show had, especially for effects. Want to know why they reused the same five sets for everything? Or why every planet looks the same? Because they literally couldn\u2019t afford to do anything else. I could go on, and I will: So much of the shows \u201cerrors\u201d are just a product of the time. The clothing styles, the character traits, even the nature of the federation are all just part of the worldviews of the writers and directors. Oh, and speaking of the writers and directors: TNG writers TNG directors That\u2019s about everybody in Hollywood. Tons of people wrote or directed single episodes. That\u2019s the reality of episodic television of the era, but the reality is that you aren\u2019t going to be able to do the sort of more complex character development in that environment that so many answers call for. While we could point out specifically bad episodes or small errors, the reality is that if any of us went back to 1989, knowing only what we knew then, it\u2019s doubtful we could have made a better show.

They should have actually watched every original series episode, every animated episode, and every original series movie, and then proceeded to write and produce new stories for Star Trek TNG. Before a doctor can practice medicine they study everything they need to know and then specialize in studying an area of expertise. You would think the TNG people would have adopted the same seriousness about their job, but they didn\u2019t. This results in ignorance of the subject and weaker storylines marred by inconsistency, plot holes, and contradictions. Not all of it\u2019s bad, but a lot of TNG was unprofessionally done by the new writers and producers, badly written, badly dated, and doesn\u2019t hold up the way the original series does. It\u2019s still a good attempt and is entertaining, but has too many flaws too many mis-castings to equal the original. ",

Most of the Data centric stories focussed on him learning something new about how humans think and feel, yet by the time he arrived on the Enterprise, he\u2019d gone through several years at Starfleet Academy, and then over 20 years on active duty. In over 25 years, nobody explained what a joke was? He never once tried dating anyone? He never learned poetry before meeting Beverly Crusher? Not very realistic. I know that some people have tried to explain that the Enterprise crew were the first to treat him as a person rather than a tool or machine, but were that true, there\u2019s no way he\u2019d have been promoted to Lt Commander - that\u2019s not a rank given just by passage of time without getting into trouble, you have to earn it competitively and be selected for the rank. If his commanders prior to Picard had seen him simply as a machine, he would not have been recommended for promotion, nor the awards he\u2019d received (mentioned in the episode Measure of a Man.) After 25 plus years service in Starfleet, he would not have been as android naive as he was portrayed, and if he was, he wouldn\u2019t have been promoted to a rank that qualified him as 2nd officer.

            "answer_text": "I think that one of the biggest issues with TNG was that the wrote themselves into a corner very early on by not having clear limits of what the technology was capable of. Far too many episodes revolve around some sort of techno-babble or hand waving where some piece of technology needed to be negated to allow for some sense of jeopardy or a problem was solved by some hand waved technological solution. Similarly it was never entirely clear what it was that the Enterprise was actually supposed to be doing. the presence of families with children suggested that it had some sort of diplomatic and science role but you never saw very much of that in practice and the overall feel was still pretty military. You definitely didn\u2019t get much of the feel of exploring the \u2018final frontier\u2019 that you did with TOS, and they never seemed that far from somewhere pretty familiar and it failed to convey a sense of relative distance. When you have warp drive what does exploration actually mean anyway ? There are also little details like the fact that they wore exactly the same uniforms when wandering around on the ship as they did when going to explore some potentially hostile planet. Perhaps it was incredibly sophisticated clothing which could cope with any possible climatic extremes but it never really felt like it. It felt like they only went to places which had nice weather. When your exploring clothing is basically a futuristic suit and tie it somewhat take the edge of the sense of exploration. So the overall feel was of a hugely expensive and sophisticated Starfleet flagship that was just sort of bumbling around more or less at random. In fact in terms of story it seemed a bit like what you would get if a modern aircraft carrier went to a different randomly selected port every week and the captain went off on his own to solve crimes. Overall I think that the writing never really managed to establish a solid concept for the series both in terms of what the capabilities and limits of the technology were, which is bad in sci-fi writing and also what the actual point of it was and what they were trying to achieve. Which along with somewhat vague production design made the whole thing a bit disconnected from anything relatable. This was further reinforced by the fact that there was never any real sense of what the Federation was actually like as a place to live, the fundamental politics and economics were only touched on peripherally which again left the motivations of the characters a bit vague. This wasn\u2019t helped by the episodic writing which mostly left everything wrapped up in a single episode often by an inevitable deus ex machina and character development was slow and linear, if it happened at all and indeed most development seemed more like the writers working out what they actually wanted to do with a particular character rather than any really credible trajectory and the whole thing just felt a bit lacking in purpose.

            "answer_text": "First - and I realize this may be somewhat controversial, but I would have completely eliminated the character of Lwanaxa Troi from both TNG and DS9. The character of Lwanaxa Troi is a fine example of the narcissistic and/or entitled character that does little to justify their existence much less make them self likable or add anything of value to the show or plot of the episodes in which they appear. At best Lwanaxa is an unnecessary or superfluous character and at worst she is the type of character that makes you fast forward, or wish they had cut, the scenes in which she appears. Second - while on the topic of Lwanaxa and Deanna Troi I think Deanna\u2019s whininess and ability to be overly dramatic in the first 2 - 3 seasons should have been scaled back. I think it may have helped if Deanna had cut contact with Lwanaxa pre season 1 and never looked back. Third - I would have utilized Guinan more and put her in more episodes. She was a character who appeared in too few episodes and, sadly, was very under utilized in the episodes in which she did appear IMHO. Plus, I love Whoopi Goldberg as an actress. Fourth - while I would not have completely eliminated Wesley Crusher, I would have considerably reduced the number of episodes in which he appeared in favor of Guinan. Wesley was an example of a character who would have been great in the odd random episode but added little of value overall to the show. I think Wil Wheaton seriously overestimated the importance of himself and his character to the show. The exception here is the episode \u201cThe First Duty\u201d. Fifth - I would have eliminated the Katherine Pulaski character in favor of keeping Dr. Crusher. I realize what they were trying to do with Dr. Pulaski and Data \u2014 recreate the Bones/Spock dynamic from The Original Series \u2014 but it just didn\u2019t work. Sixth - I would have added a Quark like character to the show as I think it would have livened up some of the episodes. Plus, imagine Captain Picard or Commander Riker having to deal with such a character. Seventh - I think a multi season story arc, like what DS9 had with the Dominion War, would have proven interesting Eighth - and I realize this may be another somewhat controversial one, but I found Tasha Yar to be a rather dull character who was not a fit for the security/tactical officer position. While I didn\u2019t like the way the killed her off \u2014 drowning in a tar pit, essentially \u2014 and would have changed that as well I think she would have worked better as the navigator or the helmsman rather than security/tactical. I would have rather seen Worf in that position sooner. ",

In doing so I would have enlisted personnel and an hybrid senior NCO/warrant officer hierarchy of about4\u20135 grades so that you had a chief of the boat, Chief of the watch, Chief of Department, and Chief of sub departments. 2 TNG red uniform departments people keep just referring to it as \u201ccommand red\u201d but it also includes flight control and possibly tactical. Both commanders Shelby and Worf are wearing red when they were filling the roll of tactical officer. Thus I alway felt that In that Worf in his combined roll of security and tactical chief should have had two subordinates one for security matter and one for operating the ships weapons the equivalent of a gunnery officer and captain of a marine detachment in a conventional vessel 3 officer of the watch we only see this occasionally most obviously when Data commands the Night watch or when Troi finally get certified as a bridge officer and takes a watch every now and then but we also see it in the episode where Riker is an exchange officer and Worf dresses down the Benzite. In this moment Worf appears to be the officer of the watch despite the presence of the Captain and acting XO Data 4 a more realistic career path for officers in the Navy not all Captains are of Captain Rank. as one progress through rank ones position jump back and forth between Commander/XO/Department head depending on the size/status of vessel one is attached too. it\u2019s inconceivable that Riker went from being a Department head of a lesser vessel to the executive officer of the flagship class of the fleet.

Knowledge of the Prime Directive becomes a card to play for the manipulative. Picard and company should have merely emphasized non-interference as a desire, as what they planned to do in the here and now. The one time I think he was justified was to the planetary leader in the (episode) \u2018First Contact\u2019 to emphasize their good will and willingness to accept his final decision. But in most circumstances I can recall, it just leads to the most scheming party sitting there taunting them about it. While they are overcome, it also complicates matters. By revealing it, they seem like this awesome power that goes out of its way to hamstring itself. By merely stating the same principles as what they prefer to adhere to, it reassures the positive parties and disarms the underhanded. So obey this law without broadcasting it every time. ",
