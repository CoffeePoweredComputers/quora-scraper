            "answer_text": "Each cell tower can be identified via its \"CID\" (Cell ID), and there are several apps available at Google Play which make use of this. A few examples include: 1:Opensignal Here the compass gives you the direction to the cell tower. The app has additional features as well, e.g. it can plot cell towers and WiFi APs. My favorite in this area however is RF signal Tracker, which has comparable features. It can show you on a map in live-mode cell towers you have been recently connected to (including those you are connected to currently) and their coverage (measured while you've been connected to them).
