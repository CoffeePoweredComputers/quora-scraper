            "answer_text": "Short answer: copper is a better conductor than air Accurate answer: It depends. All other things being equal, with two competent operators deliver similar type of service with similar age technology - DSL will be about 5x-10x better But that might be the case. If you compare the latest LTE-Advanced MIMO wireless, with heavy investment, to ten year old ADSL, then wireless could be better. One important point: wireless serves an area (a circle around the BTS), DSL serves a customer. When DSL advertises 100Mbps (which is not impossible with new technology eg g.fast) and Wireless boasts of 200Mbps, remember the latter is shared So, in general, yes, DSL is better. But not always.
