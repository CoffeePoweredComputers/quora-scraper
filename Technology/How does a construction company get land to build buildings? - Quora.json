            "answer_text": "A lot of these answers are fairly one dimensional and are about as vague as the question is with little to no context. Procurement. Generally speaking for large commercial or multi-family projects, this is the phase in which a Developer procures (acquires) the parcel of land to be developed. The Developer may be acting on behalf of a Client or the Developer will actually be the Client. And this may involve a real estate team, but more likely involves land purchased and sold between two companies or between a company and a government or community entity. Procurement doesn't happen in a vacuum, however, for multiple reasons. The key issue is feasibility, meaning that a Developer will want to know what and how they can develop the land. All land deemed appropriate to build on will be governed by zoning laws, as well as cultural and community easements or resource management standards which dictate what can be built. For starters, the total volume of land - the footprint perimeter of the land extruded vertically - will be capped at a certain height. This will obviously differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; for example, in Washington, DC, the cap is below the Washington Monument, however in NYC, Chicago, and Dubai, the cap appears to be set just below Heaven. The total elevation is then further volumerically defined by the amount of impervious surface area of a site that is allowed to be built upon. Further still are Floor Area Ratios (FAR), better known as shadow laws. These dictate how much of the volume of land and be be occupied by building floors and how their overshadowing will effect the neighboring properties. And so on and so forth. To understand these restrictions and to get the most bang for their buck, Developers often hire and Architect or Civil Engineer to present the feasibility of a site. This will oftentimes occur before closing on the sale of the property, but will also happen during and afterwards with certain contingencies to either end. It all comes down to the gamble a Developer is willing to make. Once a property is procured, it can then be designed. Sometimes this will include the same feasibility study Architect, and sometimes include a different Architect. Sometimes a General Contractor or third party Construction Manager will be brought on by the Developer to put some real numbers to the draft budget. This will run concurrently to Schematic Design and then into Design Development. Depending on the size of the project, the base budget may undergo tens of iterations. And we'll go ahead and stop here. If you're still reading, you're probably wondering about the processes of design and construction and management. But that's a wonderfully complicated story for another night. Sweet dreams my young prince. ",

            "answer_text": "First, there may be a misconception buried in your question. In the US, most companies that build buildings build them for other parties who have already purchased or otherwise acquired the land upon which the buildings are constructed. In the case of a construction company that builds a building for its own purposes, they would purchase the land from a willing seller or have been given it by a generous party. Real estate agents are often involved in connecting willing land sellers with willing land purchasers. ",
