For me, I think oppo, vivo are over priced. Nokia x6 has a little better processor than other 2. But, remember it may or may not be launched in India. In china, millions phones were sold out in flash sale in only 10 seconds Processor of other 2 phone is same and leads to apporx equal benchmark value Redmi note 5 pro camera is good compared to Asus. But installing google camera in Asus(by rooting) leads to nearly same quality Purchase the 6 gb variant coz it is in your range and to future proof your mobile. Purchase the 4gb variant, if you are not a heavy user, just use 5/6 apps at a time. 4gb will be enough for this and you will save some money. You must be thinking \u201cmy money is my money, none of your money\u201d Too much clich\u00e9 Asus has nearly stock android and will provide update till Android Q and has massive 5,000 mAh battery For gaming or heavy use, Samsung phones within range are not value for money. If you have 35,000 money, blindly go for one plus 6 or wait if they will launch one plus 6T ",
