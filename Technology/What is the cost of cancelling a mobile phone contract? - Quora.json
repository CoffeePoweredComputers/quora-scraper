            "answer_text": "That really depends on the specific contract - its length, terms, the cost of the phone, and whatever penalties the carrier has decided to impose.  Generally, the whole point of a fixed contract is to help offset the cost of a new device, while allowing the user to get that new device at a much lower price. So if they give the phone to you for substantially less than retail, they'll naturally want you to keep paying them until the cost of the phone is covered.   If you should break your contract and keep the phone, most carriers will want you to pay off the balance of the phone's value.  Some may add extra penalties.  Many will allow you to \"buy out\" your contract before it's done, too.   If you want an accurate answer, you should read the fine print of your contract - guarantee you, it will all be detailed in there.  Or you could simply contact your carrier and ask them what the penalties are.  Again, every carrier has their own rules around this, so it's not possible to give an accurate answer here. ",

            "answer_text": "If you had a \"free phone\" you need to pay off the whatever value it had left. If you did not buy yourself a phone outright you are actually making payments on it each month. If you just got into the contract it is basically the cost of the phone. If you have been with the company for a while it will be less as you have made more payments. However much they charge you for breaking the contract which varies by provider. If you find a much better plan with another company it could be worth paying even if you had a while to go. If you only had a few months left you might be better off riding it out. Some companies give you a buyout cost of your contract when you log into you account. ",
