            "answer_text": "All right, but talking about termodynamics \u201cEnergy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather it transforms from one form to another\u201d. So, there MUST BE a way to do it. What you call \u201closs\u201d I call \u201cenergy that can be used\u201d. Besides, if we can create a system that can keep transforming energy nonstop we would also had created the way to stock energy. THEORICALLY speaking, Heat Motors are 100% eficient, because the cold would turn into heat due to other molecules exchanging energy, plus the motor keep running. What if we place the 3-part-motor-generato inside a vaccum chamber so it only exchange energy from each other? Now, there is a molecule (called Vanadium Dioxide) recently researched by scientists at Barkeley University that can transmit energy with almost no heat. And because the electric energy is more eficiently transmited on higher voltages, the heat would be significant BUT also too low on the % that could perform both processes perfectly. ",

            "answer_text": "Best attempt is Combined Heat and Power where the heat from generators is piped out as hot water to heat homes. Other examples of using the heat is where a ship uses waste heat in freshwater generation. Ref the thought about \u201cwhy cant I use the heat\u201d ; imagine you could put an electric generafor in a perfectly insulated box. Out of it would come some wires with electric power and a shaft that was rotated to drive the generator. To not loose any energy from that box you would need to convert all the energy inside to electrical power without any losses. The difficulty is that every type of device that can convert heat to electricity hascheat losses. So the box will get hot and need cooling hence energy loss. ",
