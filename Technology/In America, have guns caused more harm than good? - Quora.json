            "answer_text": "If you mean in the United States, then no. Crime data shows that about 14,500 people die on average a year from guns in the US. The US has 331,000,000 people. Living here you have a 0.000043806% probability of being killed, on purpose, by someone with a firearm. Another way of saying this is out of every 100,000 people, 4.5 will be murdered with a gun. Not great odds really. This probability drops off even further if you follow three rules. Don\u2019t get involved with illegal drug activity. Don\u2019t get involved with gang activity. Steer clear of neighborhoods run by people who are involved with the two former rules. If you do that, your chance to die from a gunshot becomes so negligible it\u2019s hardly worth considering. However, the counter statistic people don\u2019t discuss is that somewhere between 350,000 to 600,000 people every year are protected from criminals by the lawful use of a gun. Either to protect themselves or others. This number has such a wide margin because we simply don\u2019t know how many go unreported. The number doesn\u2019t include instances where people thwart a criminal by simply brandishing (holding the gun in a threatening manner that is visible), claiming to have a gun, even if they don\u2019t, and unreported instances where the user might not report the act to the police because the act or the weapon or both is in violation of local laws and statutes. It\u2019s easy to say that guns are bad, but they kill far less people than they save. They kill far less than say drunk drivers. Hell they kill less than sober drivers. A person driving a car is far more dangerous than a person with a gun. Oh, and doctors kill more people due to malpractice every year than people with guns. I\u2019d say that guns are a good thing to have around, and if you don\u2019t buy that line, then maybe you can settle for them being not as bad as you think. ",

            "answer_text": "In America, the elite still speak respectfully of \u201cthe American people\u201d. Elections are still being held. The complicated work of keeping an open society functioning still continues. America is still (barely) in the hands of the American people. This is at least partly due to our leaders knowing that there are over 300 million firearms in the hands of the American people. Any officials, cabals or political networks who have ever had plans on taking control of the country by force recognize that gun ownership is an obstacle. When demands and appeals are made to restrict their ownership, firearm owners take notice. Contrary to what the hard Left claims, Americans are basically a good and fair people. Most Americans would never consider using a gun to commit a crime. It\u2019s a testimony to this personal responsibility that there are so few gun crimes and accidents, relatively speaking - especially when compared to other ordinary causes of death. Are there problems? Absolutely there are problems. They are social problems - caused and perpetuated by faulty and abusive public policy that was enacted by self-interested politicians. These are problems that manifest as the abuse of the rights and privileges of our open society. The current narrative is that the social problems justify restriction of gun ownership. Politicians caused the problems and now they come to Americans with \u201cthe solution\u201d. ",
