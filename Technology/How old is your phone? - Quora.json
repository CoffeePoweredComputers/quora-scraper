            "answer_text": "I have not only one but two phones to speak about. i own both of them about an year but they are much more older because they are passed to me by my father and mother. perhaps these phones are more than five years old since my family owned them. the firs one is spice dream uno ( android one)  this phone is amazing. being 6 years old this phone is still kicking and you know what? this phone is reviewed by many giant tech communities considering this little beast as a small version of nexus. After 6 years of when we bought it i.e. 2020 you might not find it pleasant in terms of battery, screen or memory\u2026 but when it comes to performance, bug-less and snappy experience it can still wreck many budget offerings. believe me it still plays heavy titles such as asphalt 8 so well. if the battery wouldn\u2019t be an issue then i could have used this device as main device as my daily driver. Now it comes to the second phone i have which my mother used to have is Motorola G play  Initially this device was good out of the box when we bought it at 2015. the device felt snappy but can\u2019t game. the battery backup is humongous and the device is a tank. When it comes to durability this device has survive a lot of drops. i have dropped this device a several time in water and i am surprised that how come its not water damaged yet. In 2020 the performance of this device is crap and the multitasking feels almost herculean task for it but soon this problem got solved as i realized that the problem was the in software not in hardware. i flashed in miui 8 rom and now its working sufficiently fast.

            "answer_text": "(Answer date: 18th Nov, 2018) My phone just celebrated its 4th birthday this Diwali. Not just it, we both celebrated our lovely togetherness. It\u2019s a great phone for my requirements. My first smartphone. My phone is Redmi 1S. My beautiful, simple, faithful Redmi 1S is still alive and kicking as it was in the first year of purchase.  (Image courtesy: MI.com) You won't believe but this phone gets a lot of credit for my poetic endeavor. I tried writing something in my notes one day, and it accidentally started my poetic journey. Just like this phone, I am also now a four year young poet. In these four years, I have never used any screen guard or any body cover. It hardly gave any issues. Its battery is still working properly. Screen is pretty much scratchless. It did try summersault for the love of being adventurous and for kissing floor 4\u20135 times, but nothing happened. It's a tough nut just like me. :P Do you know how much it costed? Just \u20b96,000. 4 years and just \u20b96000 is just too good. Just over \u20b94 per day. Yeah, you may think it's way too old and it doesn't have much RAM and hardly any space, but not for me. I am happy with it. If it stays alive for one more year, I will be way too happy. After all, I am minimalistic and conservative. Recently, Quora app stopped working on my phone. But who cares! It's a shitty app anyways. :P  Edit 1: This answer is selected for Quora Digest. Yay!! Update (April, 2020): My phone is still going on the way it was even after 5.5 years. Hurray! I hope to update this answer sometime next year. Update (July, 17, 2020): My phone took its last breath today. Just a few months shy of completing 6 years. But nevertheless, it was a wonderful companion I could have ever asked for.  Love! \u263a :) [math]\\ddot\\smile[/math] Shail 'The Conservative Flash ",
