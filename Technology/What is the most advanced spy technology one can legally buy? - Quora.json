            "answer_text": "I won't describe it as the most advanced but I will certainly place it as a spy equipment that is easy and legal to obtain: software defined radio (SDR). You can do almost anything with it such as: 1. You can confirm the presence of data transmission anywhere from almost DC to 6 GHz of frequency. 2. With a lot more knowledge you can record it, demodulate it, characterize it, and decode it. 3. With a high gain antenna you can infer direction. All that can be done with only a SDR receiver. This is another way of saying that you can listen to anyone using wireless communications such as cellphones, radios, wifi, satcomm, etc. that is very very illegal to do but no one civilian will ever know you are doing it because you would be sniffing at the physical layer.  If you had an SDR full duplex transceiver you can build portable radars, and much more that could be put in the \"spy equipment\" category. All SDR I know are unregulated and legal to obtain. The illagal part can arise from its use as you cannot transmit on licensed frequencies but that is a risk that the user should be aware of. ",

            "answer_text": "I think most advanced is somewhat overkill but as someone stated you can use very simple devices like the Motorola C123 with a modified baseband to create a cell tower where other devices can camp on. Of course it's not as easy as it sounds but you will basically be well on your way to \"spying\". In addition, technology has advanced quite well to transform some hardware into eavesdropping devices eg the USRP, HackRF etc can all be modified to tune into certain frequencies and equally into transmitters. There are legalities around transmission because you could interfere with legitimate users of the allocated frequency. As for full blown spying equipment, you'd better be ready with say $75,000 and above and also have a government backing. Here's an example of what is available out there. The secret devices the government uses to track you through your phone  ",
