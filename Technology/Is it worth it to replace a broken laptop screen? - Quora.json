            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Is it worth it to replace a broken laptop screen? This depends on how much you have invested in the laptop. My current machine is maxed out on RAM and HDD space completely with full-sized docking station, so the cost of a screen is well worth it rather than having to duplicate the same set up with all new hardware. Obviously, I\u2019m a DIYer. I just need to pop some screws, find the exact model number of the defective display, and I can usually find it on eBay between $50 and $150. As long as that screen ID is matched properly, the damaged one just unscrews and the new one requires swapping a couple of connections and then reassembly. Downloading the relevant Service Manual PDF for your particular model will give you precise instructions, and youtube searches will turn up very similar machines having such replacements done, so you can use these as confidence builders. Even very old machines (again, depending on ROI) can often have their screens replaced, because the very same model screen could still be current in industrial applications. And even if a lack of documentation, some of those older machines are far more easily serviced. Caution: Detaching the screen escutcheon can be a little tricky, requiring removal of multiple screws and hinge covers and popping many plastic clips\u2014so make sure all those little parts are put into a container out of reach of prying fingers. If DIY doesn\u2019t appeal, paying an extra $100 to have a tech do it for you is probably still worth it. A good-quality, high turn-over tech is going to be far more reasonable in price, because apart from waiting for the new screen to arrive, the whole job only takes up about ten minutes worth of bench time.  However, if the laptop was really crappy in the beginning and is just a struggling to get by device, $100 on a replacement screen could be worth more than the total of the PC\u2014I\u2019m specifically bad-mouthing netbooks here. Yeah, you paid $400, but it\u2019s about $40 worth of parts. That same $400 spent on an ex-business fleet machine that has been refurbished is probably a much better purchase. You\u2019re usually better off in the long run by spending more money on a decent and hopefully fairly rugged machine and getting all your data transferred (which is DIY capable, or a tech can do it for a very nominal fee). Even if you feel you need assistance the first time, you\u2019ll find that some of these repairs are embarrassingly easy and satisfyingly cheap\u2014you just need to invest in the actual service time (less than half an hour) and wait for the replacement part to arrive. Sometimes, you can pick up an identical model with a good screen on eBay, craigslist, etc., that, because of another fault is being offered fare more cheaply than the new replacement screen. Now you have a small supply of spare parts until you give up on that model completely. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends wholly on the age of the system and what your financial situation is. If your laptop is under 3 years old, a screen replacement is usually warranted. If it\u2019s over 5 years, it\u2019s not. If you have a laptop with a broken screen and don\u2019t have the money to replace the laptop, and the laptop is under 6 years old, it might still be worth it to replace the screen, if the laptop was originally higher end. Average cost of a screen (not including labour) is $120 CAD. ",
