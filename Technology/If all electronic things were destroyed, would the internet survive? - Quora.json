            "answer_text": "Would the Internet survive? Almost certainly. Yes, all of the currently deployed electronics would somehow (magically) be toast, but that wouldn\u2019t stop us from building out new gear. In particular the content is stored on rotating rust (iron oxide). The electronics for the controllers would be replaced and the data would be recovered. All information is stored somewhere. It\u2019s not immortal. The devices that they are stored on have a finite lifetime. We\u2019re pretty good about doing backups and/or replication, and we\u2019re very good at replacing things when they go bad. It\u2019s just a matter of redundancy redundancy. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s break this question down first: What is the internet? The simplest answer is that the internet is basically just a bunch of computers that have data on them and can communicate together. Think of two computer linked together, only WAY bigger. Now that we have that out of the way, let me answer your question. \u201cIf all electronic things were destroyed, would the internet survive?\u201d Safe to say that when you said \u201celectronic\u201d you meant \u201celectric and electronic\u201d. Anyway, so if all electric and electronic things were destroyed, we can kiss computers, switches, routers, etc\u2026 goodbye. But if all those are gone, then analogically its similar to saying \u201chey i have this car here, if I take away the tires, motor, body, all the gadgets in it, will it still stay a car?\u201d Well no, you\u2019d just be left with a couple of seats, depending on what car you started out with. The electric and electronic things you are destroying are the fundamental infrastructure that make up the internet, so if they aren\u2019t present anymore then no, the internet will not survive. tl;dr; NO :) ",
