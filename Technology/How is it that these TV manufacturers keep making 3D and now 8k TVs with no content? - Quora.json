            "answer_text": "When the first HD TVs came out, there was no content for them either. Yes, eventually Blu-ray Disc and HD-DVD, HD cable and satellite, etc., came along and started supplying content for the displays, but at least at first, there wasn\u2019t any content that made HD TVs a \u201cmust have\u201d. Yes, part of it is people buying on the basis of ever-bigger spec numbers, which the TV makers definitely lean into. But some of the buyers did know what they were getting into, and were willing to take the risk on the new fancy tech. Sometimes you get HDTV. And sometimes you get 3D TV. (Or Smell-o-Vision.) ",

            "answer_text": "Because a proportion of their sales aren't led by customers who ask the right questions. People will buy the biggest numbers even if they are meaningless. There are people who will buy the \u201cbest TV\u201d so they can show off to their friends and family or just because they can. People didn't really want 4K and 3D as much as sales figures would indicate, they got those features because they are on the top end TVs from the major brands. ",
