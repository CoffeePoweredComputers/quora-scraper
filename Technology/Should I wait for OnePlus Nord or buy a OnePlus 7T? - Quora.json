            "answer_text": "One plus 7T is a premium flagship from OnePlus, while with the Nord, OnePlus is making an ambitious play in the mid-range segment. The phone has solid fundamentals and offers reliable performance and the value on offer makes it one of the best phones for under 25,000 ( 6GB RAM, 64 GB Storage). With the OnePlus 7T now selling for 37,999 ( 8GB RAM, 256 GB Storage) , let's find out if you should pick up the Nord or opt for last year's bestseller. Both the OnePlus Nord and 7T deliver outstanding value.  The Nord has the distinction of being the first OnePlus phone to be available for under 25,000 in over two years. The phone absolutely nails the basics, offering a 90Hz AMOLED panel, solid performance, 30W fast charging, and clean software with regular updates. The OnePlus 7T is a particularly great choice in 2020 \u2014 it edges out the Nord in a few key areas. The OnePlus 7T also delivers the exact same features, and you also get outstanding gaming performance thanks to the Snapdragon 855+ chipset, a metal chassis, and more usable cameras. DESIGN:- Let's start with the design. Both phones have a similar design language with flowing lines, but the OnePlus 7T has its own identity because of the camera housing at the back. The Nord has an oblong housing that's similar to the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, but the DSLR-like design for the cameras on the 7T makes it stand out. Then there's the fact that the 7T has a metal chassis with a glass front and back, with the Nord instead featuring a plastic mid-frame. This was one of the ways OnePlus cut down on costs with the Nord, and while the phone has a chrome finish that's meant to mimic the feel of metal, it is made out of polycarbonate. The OnePlus 7T has no such shortcomings, and it feels more premium. There's a similar difference at the back, with the 7T offering a wonderful matte texture that makes it a delight to hold the phone.. The OnePlus 7T comes with gradient finish (Glacier Blue and Frosted Silver ), while the Nord comes in solid colours including Blue Marble and Gray Onyx. DISPLAY:- Nord has a wide hole-punch cutout because of the dual cameras, and it is more distracting than the waterdrop cutout on the 7T. Thankfully, both phones have displays with flat edges, and you don't have to worry about curved screens here. The Nord has a 6.44-inch display while the 7T has a marginally larger 6.55-inch panel.Both phones feature AMOLED displays with 90Hz refresh rate, under-display fingerprint sensor, supports HDR 10+ & protected by Gorilla glass 5 and they're evenly matched in this area. The 7T, however, ekes out another win because it comes with stereo speakers, with the Nord offering a single speaker at the bottom.  HARDWARE:- Nord excels at the basics. There's a Snapdragon 765G under the hood, and it is just as reliable as the Snapdragon 855+ on the 7T for most day-to-day tasks. You'll only see a difference during extended gaming sessions, with the Snapdragon 765G not quite able to keep up with the SD855+ in this particular area. The Nord offers reliable performance, but the OnePlus 7T is the outright winner here. Otherwise, the Snapdragon 765G is a reliable workhorse. But if you are looking to pick up a phone for playing games, the 7T is a better choice. The 7T also has newer UFS 3.0 storage modules, with the Nord using UFS 2.1 storage. Neither phone has a 3.5mm jack, water resistance, or wireless charging. The OnePlus Nord is available in 6GB/64GB, 8GB/128GB and 12GB/256GB options in India. The 7T starts off with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and there's a second variant with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The Nord has a larger 4115mAh battery where 3800mAh on the 7T, but both phones deliver roughly the same battery life. You get 30W fast charging as standard, so there's not much to differentiate between the two phones here. The Nord also has 5G connectivity, so if you must have a 5G phone in 2020, it is the default option. CAMERA:- Both phones have the same 48MP Sony IMX586 sensor at the back, but the Nord is missing the ability to record 4K video at 60fps. And while OnePlus outfitted four lenses at the back of the Nord, you'll only ever use the 8MP wide-angle lens other than the 48MP module. The 2MP macro lens is not worth the hassle, and the 5MP portrait lens is limited in its use. OnePlus Nord has six lenses, but the OnePlus 7T has cameras you'll actually use. OnePlus 7T has three cameras at the back that are actually usable. The main 48MP camera takes great shots in just about any lighting condition, the 16MP wide-angle lens holds up just as well and retains the same color profile, and the 12MP zoom lens gives you lossless shots at 2x zoom. As for final image quality, there is little to no difference between the two phones when it comes to the 48MP sensor. 7T wins out is the auxiliary lenses, with the wide-angle and zoom lens delivering vibrant shots.  Up front, the Nord has a 32MP primary camera with an 8MP wide-angle lens, and the secondary lens makes a huge difference when taking group selfies. The OnePlus 7T has a single 16MP shooter that takes decent enough shots. Interestingly, the Nord has 4K video recording at 60fps for the front camera, but the sensor itself has fixed focus. SOFTWARE:- OnePlus continues to differentiate its phones by delivering bloat-free software, with both the OnePlus Nord and 7T offering the same OxygenOS 10.5 build. You get the same set of software features on both phones, and the UI is optimized to take full advantage of the 90Hz panel. As for OxygenOS 10.5, you get Android 10's default gesture navigation, system-wide dark mode, and powerful notification management. Combined with OnePlus' own features like Zen Mode, gaming mode, native screen recorder, and all the customization options, you get powerful software that sets the tone for other manufacturers. OnePlus Nord vs. OnePlus 7T:- Look, there is no wrong choice here. The OnePlus Nord is a fantastic phone if you're looking to maximize value, and with the device available for just \u20b924,999 in India, you're getting incredible value. The only other OnePlus phone that comes close to it is the OnePlus 7T. So, My opinion is, Get the Nord if you want to maximize value; buy the OnePlus 7T if you want better performance. If you plan on buying OnePlus is selling the 8GB/256GB model, which is available for \u20b937,999..  ",

But if you can spend more to buy OnePlus 7T, then, you don't need to settle down for the cheaper OnePlus Nord according to OnePlus's own tagline \u2014 \u201cNever Settle Down\u201d. So, if you have enough money to spend, then, buy OnePlus 7 T rather than OnePlus Nord.While, Oppo Reno 10x Zoom with Snapdragon 855 is a great and better alternative to OnePlus 7T. Reviews of Oppo Reno 10x Zoom are better than that of OnePlus 7T. Oppo Reno 10x Zoom has better cameras, same performance, similar display at INR 37290. But softwarewise, the Oxygen OS of OnePlus is the best Android skin, while, ColorOS of Oppo is good as well. So, I think, if you can spend more, then, don't wait for OnePlus Nord. Buy OnePlus 7T or Oppo Reno 10x Zoom according to your choice right now. Thanks. ",
