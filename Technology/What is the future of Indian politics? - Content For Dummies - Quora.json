            "answer_text": "Politics in India or for that matter anywhre in the world is fraught with negative connotations. Why? The answer lies in the fact that it is an arena where there are no rules. Mao Zedong once famously said, \u201cPolitics is war without bloodshed, and War is politics with bloodshed\u201d. History has shown us that every great empire and every great dynasty has perished with time, because nothing is permanent. What remains partially permanent is the \u2018Ideaology\u2019. There are basically three ideologies working politically in India-: The Right, The Left, and The Central. Since Independence Congress ruled for the better part with a strong centalist ideology and left little space for \u2018The Left' and for 'The Right'. But with Congress, there was a problem, that it was somewhat leaned towards 'The Left'. This gave space for the BJP to take charge and rise as the best known Rightwing force. Political pundits predicted that it was a short lived tryst with destiny for the BJP when the Congress was back in 2004. But with the Narendra Modi juggernaut, old calculations and predictions have extinguished like fire in the rain. The Centralist ideology is all but over. Now, let me come to the core of the question. The future of Indian politics will be between the Rightwing (Centre-Right) and the Leftwing (Centre-Left). And this can be assuaged with the somewhat Leftward shift of the Grand Old Party. It is happening not because of a coincidence, but because of the BJP and it's Rightwing ideology. Whenever there is a dominant viewpoint, there is also always a counter viewpoint, and that's the beauty of democracy. If we analyse the current political scenario, the opposition is fragmented into various Left leaning parties, countering the BJP. One thing is for sure, till the time \u2018the left' depends upon dynastic politics, there can be no credible opposition. There are many claimaints for the Leftwing ideology, but it will all depend upon their public appeal. With the BJP posturing itself into Centre-Right and the Congress into Centre-Left, time will tell which ideolgy gains traction. Afterall it is the people who choose in a democracy. Let me know in the comments section if your liked the article. Disclaimer: I am politically partisan. I like every ideology as far as it helps humanity. ",

            "answer_text": "Politics and Bollywood. These two things if seen distantly are by no means related to each other. The things that adjoins both of them together is their potential of being into Media's headlines for some reason or another. Let's just not incline towards B town as the question is all about the future of politics. If seen with a lens of optimism, one can extrapolate the pros of multi party political system of India. It serves us many option out of which we can choose what we feel by our perception of being right to hold such a crucial position of world's largest democracy. We are accorded the power and paramountcy to choose our leader by our own choice unlike the Monarch and Theocratic states. India leads it's politics by equity by offering it's people to what they actually need and to allow them to have the weapon of voting to choose or discard the name of any candidate popping on the EVM. The power is devolved upon each and every indian citizen above 18 years. Sadly, nothing comes with all the flowery positives. Nor the Politics. After every 5 years, we hear every Govt's campaigning to catch votes by offering bait of populist ideas to the people. Right wingers and Left wingers are what we mean if any person talks of BJP or the Congress. With the center ideology teetering in the middle and finding less space between the two. By what I mean by saying only BJP and Congress is that Indian politics take its regular turns around turnstile of these two major parties. BJP is in power since 2014. With Congress almost struggling to even form it's opposition. It's not a thing to celebrate when a Democracy is not equipped with proper opposition. \u201cPower corrupts, Absolute power corrupts absolutely\u201d is a saying that one should always bear in his mind next time he goes ahead to celebrate any party's mammoth victory with no chance of opposition being made. Now, the future what politics hold is still blurred as it's not definite and also not right time to view this by any one angle. India is undergoing a major transitional period. With new generations coming out to be more liberal and tolerant but at the same time we can see major chunk being stringent about their political and religious holdings. The Right, or Centre, or The left, whatever holds the potential to get ingrained in the minds of young indians is what will inscribe the wall of new political India. It's like a ongoing gestation out of which it is difficult to predict what the time will bring out until the majority populace gets proclivity towards any such political idea or ideology. In this transitional era, politics of india is undergoing some congent modifications, what will come out of it is yet to be seen. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly will be good. Most of the corruptive, divisive politicians are at the fag end . Now citizens are fully aware of the evils of nepotism favouritism and dynasties will gradually disappear. Hereafter graduation alone won't help. Need to be highly qualified skilled hence people will focus on in these aspects. So political parties will find it very difficult to lure youth for joining into politics so as to spoil the lives of youth. So marxists fake fraudulent liberals leftists will vvanish.Every indian now realizes that they only save themselves not by sloganeering and rabble rousers. ",
