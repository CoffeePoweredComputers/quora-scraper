            "answer_text": "One major aspect that influences cost is, surprisingly, part orientation for printing. If the part is at an angle, then a significant part of the cost is building supports then cutting them away after production. Tough nut to crack, as sometimes you just cannot make the part without internal supports needed only for printing. ",
