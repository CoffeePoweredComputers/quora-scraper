            "answer_text": "I\u2019d assume you are speaking of as a foreign national who wish to start a business in China. In Shenzhen or Generally speaking in China, every company that is controlled by a quota equal or superior to 25% by foreigners is considered a FIE (Foreign Invested Enterprise). Among the FIE there are two most common types of entity: WFOE (Wholly Foreign Owned Entity), and the Joint-Venture. WFOE (Wholly Foreign Owned Entity), that is, as the name suggests, a legal entity completely owned by foreigners. The type of WFOE used in the great majority of cases is the LLC (Limited Liability Company), where the responsibility (or \u201cliability\u201d) of each partner is limited to the capital they invested in the company (as in the US or in Europe). This is also the amount of registered capital required by the local government when submitting company registration application. The Joint-Venture, on the other hand, is a company controlled by both foreign and Chinese partners. If you want to operate your business in a \u201crestricted\u201d industrial sector considered by the government (such as mobile and data service in telecommunication,development of pieces of land in real estate industry), a Joint-Venture is your only option. Likewise, there are also industries which are \u201cencouraged\u201d or completely \u201cprohibited\u201d for foreign investment. For detailed information, please refer online to Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries by the ministry of commerce in China. It is highly advised to seek the help from a trustful professional when deciding to incorporate your business in China. It\u2019s even much more so when it comes to the corresponding legal and fiscal matters.
