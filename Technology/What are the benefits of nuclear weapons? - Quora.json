            "answer_text": "Rather than seeing it as an actual military weapon, nuclear weapons are viewed more as a political tool, as means of preventing aggression and warranty from defeat in a conventional war, as well as a tool of becoming a regional leader. \u201cPeace through strength\u201d means that the power of weapons is a necessary component of security and peaceful coexistence of international forces. The presence of nuclear weapons in the era of bipolarity and mutual assured destruction has guaranteed a tense but stable world, which creates a basis to talk about nuclear deterrence or about misplacing balance of power with \u201cbalance of terror\u201d.

            "answer_text": "The use of nuclear weapons for war have been of limited use, but have worked well as a bargaining chip to prevent world war. That perception seeme to be fading a bit with all the conventional religious wars ongoing now. A younger generation of leaders should never forget the power of a \u201csmall\u201d nuclear weapon in WW II, compared to what today\u2019s weapons can do. They have been a relatively inexpensive check on our enemies expansionist dreams but are useless saints thode anxious to get to heaven. ",
