It completely depends on usage and how a person handles any phone in that case. My friend bought iPhone 6s the day it released in India. His phone got screwed up within a year and now happily owns an iPhone 7. So I\u2019m not making the point that iPhone doesn\u2019t last but it solely depends on usage. I own Micromax ninja A91 which I bought back in 2013 and it still works fine. Few of my friends are using iPhone 5s it\u2019s working fine. Thanks for A2A Rifhad. ",
