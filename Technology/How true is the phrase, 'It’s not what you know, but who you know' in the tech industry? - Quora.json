It matters very little what you know as long as you have connection. I\u2019ve had so many employees and coworkers that doesn\u2019t do crap at work but doesn\u2019t get fired either because they know the right people. But if you\u2019re talking about interpersonal ability and growth then it is about what you know. Cause it\u2019s not about economic success but personal success. ",

Conversely, there is also little value in knowing everyone with nothing to contribute. They both matter, and things like how to network and get along with people (\u201csoft skills\") are a part of what you know. If you're weak in those areas, you can learn.  ",
