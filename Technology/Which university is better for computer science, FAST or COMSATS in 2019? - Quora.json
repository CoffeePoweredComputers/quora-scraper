Secondly , your coding skills will improve rapidly . Even though my coding isn\u2019t that good but whenever a friend of mine from other universities gives me some sort of coding problem to solve i do it with ease . ",

            "answer_text": "Ok So Lets Decide Comsats Vs Fast right? I am currently studying in Comsats Islamabad in BSCS program. When applying for universities I did the research too which you are doing now. I don\u2019t know much about FAST but I can surely tell you much about Comsats. (1) As Comsats is a public university and currently semi govt it enjoins the favours of HEC which includes higher ranking. (2) Comsats surely has some great faculty for CS but that doesn\u2019t matter much as wherever you go the faculty will just teach you basic concepts and the rest depends on you. I have heard that FAST has a bad reputation for torturing their students for assignments etc. Don\u2019t think much just join any one of them and learn. Because in the end you will only regret the chances you didn\u2019t take. Enjoy!!! Need any help regarding Comsats you can contact me on FB. https://www.facebook.com/zain.laghari.10 ",
