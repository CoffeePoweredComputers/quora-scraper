            "answer_text": "Outsourcing, when done right can solve a multitude of problems for businesses. However, there are risks associated with it when contracting tasks to a 3rd party organization. Hidden costs - Some BPOs offers low cost with lots of contract agreements. This eventually leads to paying higher-than-expected transaction costs.Loss of Control - Hiring a 3rd party vendor typically mean turning over some functions over to another company. So you don't have 100% control and your bpo provider might not be driven by the same standards that motivates your company.Reduced Quality - Some outsource provider caters to multiple organizations at a time. In such situations, they may lack complete focus on your company's tasks.Security risks or Confidentiality Issues - Companies had to disclose some confidential information to their third party vendor, naturally, BPOs will have access to internal and/or consumer data and this poses a security riskCommunication Barriers such as language, time zone, and culture barriers. Misunderstanding may occur if you and your BPO partner do not speak the same language, also cultural differences may also lead to miscommunication which may reflect to not meeting the expected results. Time difference could also be quite a challenge especially when you need to communicate with your staff outside their working hours or vice-versa.These are just a few of the risks of outsourcing. However, if you find a reputable outsourcing provider, such as Cloudstaff, the risks associated with it are reduced and you'll be able to reap the key benefits of outsourcing. ",

            "answer_text": "Outsourcing generally has the following effects: Increases competition: Outsourcing offers companies an entry into a sector that they were hitherto unable to access because of high running costs, on account of the availability of cheap labour cost and increased specialisation of outsourced workers.Competitive edge: Not only does access to a sector improve when a process is outsourced, but also the organisations ability to stay competitive and innovate. Cost savings from outsourcing means that the organisation can spend money to improve their product or their technical talent, or find newer, more effective channels of marketing and distribution. All this means that the company that outsources holds an upper hand over those that don\u2019t, when outsourcing is done correctly.Focus on core competency: When back-end functions are outsourced, it frees up in-house talent or allows for hiring more technical resources to focus attention onto and develop the product or service the organisation provides. This translates to a better product, that better satisfies the current customer base and also increased market share gains.Erodes Company loyalty: A major drawback of outsourcing is that since the workers dont directly work for the company and are distances from the final product itself, they may not be as loyal or possibly work as hard as an in-house employee. An outsourced worker typically works or has worked for multiple companies and focuses on completing their jobs efficiently, without necessarily finding ways to improve the company\u2019s product or building an attachment to it.To get a free Quote on Outsourcing Services click here ",
