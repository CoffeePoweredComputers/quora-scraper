            "answer_text": "Regarding production of technology, two correct answers have already been given. Regarding daily usage of new technology (often as a gimick), South Korea is much more advanced than Germany. Koreans are smarter with smartphones, play e-games more enthusiastic, use e-payment more often, have doorbells playing music, have a more advanced ticketing system for public transport, have a much better internet coverage, use high sophisticated toilets, are building roads, bridges, airports, railway lines much faster and at minor cost. Korean weapons are in a better state of maintenance and military budget is much higher. Korean schools are better equipped. Cars are still a status symbol in South Korea (in Korean villages I remember very poor cottages, but with a brand new Kia SUV in front of the door). At all, Koreans show a more positive attitude towards daily use of new technology than Germans. One reason for this is, that Germany is more overaged than South Korea (which will drastically change for South Korea within coming 20 years!) Another reason is, that Germans love \u2018Gemuetlichkeit\u2019, a special German way of life, which cannot be translated into other languages. Germans would refuse to live in uniform scyscrapers and to scurry through overcrouded mega-cities and hate the restlessness that is typical for Korean daily life. German lifestyle has no need for technical gimicks. Therefor our economy is not dependant on producing those gimicks. Suicide is on a medium level. We do not panic for Corona virus, as we know that masks are a kind of gimick and rather useless and because every year 25,000 people in Germany die from ordinary flu, while worldwide death toll from Corona virus is less than 3,000 so far.
