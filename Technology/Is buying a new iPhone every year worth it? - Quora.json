            "answer_text": "I can give you the answer for me, but I don\u2019t think it will be super useful. For you? Well I don\u2019t know you. How much do you enjoy just having a new phone? Are you good at (or enjoy) selling the old phones? Do you have people you want to give phones to, but can\u2019t unless they are \u201cdoing you a favor\u201d by getting rid of old phones for you? Are you an iOS developer & need current models for testing? Do you have enough money that an \u201ciPhone habit\u201d is no problem? Do you like specific things that Apple happens to put in phones more or less yearly? For me personally I\u2019m an iOS developer. I write iOS apps. The apps need to work well on \u201crecent\u201d models of iPhone, and really should work well on all models that still support whatever minimum version of iOS the app supports. The newest phones however get more press, especially if anything is being done that might get you featured on the App Store, which sometimes requires using the current phone..and they always care about it working well on the current device. So lots of reasons I benefit from the current device, and should keep old devices until they have very little resale value. Fortunately I do that work for someone else, and they pay for a new iPhone each year. So for me right now (and for the past decade!) it is worth it. If I didn\u2019t write iOS apps, I like the iPhone, and each new one is nicer. Most years I would get one, but not every year. Maybe every other. For example I would definitely have bought myself an iPhone X. The Xs was great, but not super exciting since I already had the iPhone X. The 11 Pro\u2019s camera was specifically interesting to me, I probably would have bought the 11Pro even if I had had the Xs. Earlier in the iPhone\u2019s life every new phone was an awesome upgrade. The CPU was never quite fast enough so having it get faster was great. The GPU likewise getting faster made everything feel faster. The network getting faster was great. I would have had a much better case for \u201cmost people will get a lot by upgrading every year\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it is if you\u2019re tech-savvy, heavily invested in the Apple Ecosystem, or just want the best features, and I feel this is the perfect time to answer as the new iPhone 12 is rumored to come out soon. I am 15 years old, and make most of my money from a $20/week allowance from my parents. So, if this method works for me, it should work for you, adults, as well. I get the new \u201cPro\u201d iPhone every year. For example, my last upgrade was the iPhone XS to 11 Pro, and this year it will be 11 Pro to 12 Pro. Buy new iPhone UNLOCKED and pay OUTRIGHT - If you don\u2019t pay outright, while it may seem more expensive, most monthly plans last two years, and you want to upgrade every year. So, to avoid having to pay it off when you upgrade, just buy it outright. While you\u2019re technically spending $999 at once for the \u201cPro\u201d iPhone, you\u2019re really not, which I\u2019ll talk about in my next tip. Also, for my next tip, it is best to buy the iPhone unlocked, so it will work with any carrier.Sell old iPhone on Swappa DO NOT Trade-In - Apple and many carriers try to promote their trade-in deals. However, the purpose of these big companies is purely to make a profit reselling the iPhone as \u201cRefurbished\u201d. To solve this problem, use Swappa. It\u2019s like eBay for used technology, but it\u2019s a lot more scam-proof as every listing is manually approved by a moderator. Because of this, you can sell your iPhone for a higher price than eBay. Swappa also has no seller fees. Instead, the buyer pays a $20 sale fee on top of the base price that you set. On Swappa, I was able to get nearly $700 for my iPhone XS ($680 minus the Swappa fee), making the total cost of ownership just slightly above $300. This is about the equivalent price of a budget phone, or only about seven monthly payments! This is a huge bargain compared to the iPhone Upgrade Program (requiring 12 monthly payments) or any trade-in.If you want to use AppleCare+, pay MONTHLY - While you should pay for your iPhone outright, if you want to use AppleCare+, pay monthly. If you get AppleCare+ outright, you will be stuck with it for two years, and it follows the phone, not you, meaning that you will need to re-purchase AppleCare+ with every iPhone you purchase, and the buyer would unfairly get free access to your AppleCare+ that you spent $199 on. As outright AppleCare+ costs $199 for two years, that means you\u2019re wasting nearly $100/year. To solve this, pay monthly. AppleCare+ is only $9.99/month, and you can cancel at any time without contacting Apple Support, meaning, you\u2019re not wasting money, as you simply cancel your AppleCare+ subscription on your old iPhone as soon as you get the new one.So, there you go. This is my method of getting a new iPhone every year without breaking the bank. As I said earlier, I do this all with the money I earn from my allowance as well as selling the old iPhone. This proves that this method can work with any income, and you could treat yourself to a brand new \u201cPro\u201d iPhone every year. ",
