            "answer_text": "Archival standards for data storage usually define the format. Tape (the gold standard) will last about 10 years with high quality tapes. CD/DVD (outside of specialized archival types) max out at about 3-6 years. SSD's max out at about a year. Note, that the article is specifically about long term storage for legal purposes. Legal holds on electronic records are really serious business, and the costs of accidental data destruction when it is under a legal hold are really, really high. Essentially: if electronic documents are under legal hold and you are using offline storage, they should be on high quality tape in multiple locations until the end of legal proceedings. ",
