            "answer_text": "You say that like it\u2019s a bad thing. Honestly, we grew up in an entirely different world; we weren\u2019t born with an I-Phone attached to our hand\u2026. I\u2019m being a smart-ass, please forgive me. Things - new things - are so much easier to learn when one is young and the mind is still flexible and accommodating. Computers became a common household thing in the late 90s - I had been using them at work for several years and I was still in my 30s, so it wasn\u2019t a hard leap for me to get used to that. I will admit I had a lot of trouble in visualizing the concept of the internet - that really blew my mind, and I thought, what a remarkable thing, to have all that knowledge so readily available at any time. No more trips to the library to read the Encyclopedia Britannica, or Who\u2019s Who. No more letter writing and using snail mail - instead of a horse and carriage, we now have access to a speed boat - how fucking, how absolutely fucking AWESOME! I didn\u2019t get my first cell phone until 2005, and I felt like William Shatner every time I had it in my hand. It took a lot of getting used to, and I never really mastered all of the technology I had in my hand. Fifteen years later and there are still features that I am figuring out. My stepson was 3 years old when he first sat in front of my home computer with Windows 3.1 and a slot for floppy disks, and started playing software games on it. This kid wasn\u2019t even in kindergarten yet and here he was, showing off, the little upstart\u2026. I was so proud of him. I don\u2019t know for sure why it\u2019s difficult to grasp all this stuff. Maybe we\u2019re just being subconsciously stubborn and resisting change. Maybe our minds are brittle and set in their permanent state and there\u2019s not enough room left to hold all of this limitless knowledge we now have at the touch of a button. Maybe we all just miss playing kick ball outside with all our friends until the street lights come on and we have to go home. But I think we\u2019re trying to get up to speed with it, even though technology is moving a whole lot faster than we are physically able to these days! There is hope, however. My mother is turning 97 this year and I love going to her house and seeing her e-mailing people on her I-pad, and using Facebook and sending photos to the relatives. She always has questions for me about computer stuff, but I don\u2019t mind helping her with what I can. It does my heart good to see this woman who grew up in a time when television was in its infancy, and the telephone numbers had exchange letters like TR6\u20133131 and no area codes. If she can use technology, then so can I. Just give us a break - we\u2019re slow, but we\u2019ll get there. ",

            "answer_text": "I am 72, almost 73. Today I bought a new Apple TV streaming device and made it work, though it did not come with a manual. Does that count? Last week I downloaded and installed, and played with a free schematic capture and board layout software package, KiCad. I used to use a very expensive commercial one. I scrapped the $800 one I owned for years because it was no longer supported. Free is better. Last week I watched a long lecture about black hole theory not found on the shelves of Barnes and Noble. It was by a popular, old college professor. His audience was other professors, grad students and post docs. It was graduate level stuff but he was kind enough to limit the math for those of us watching from far away through glass. He is \u201cold people,\u201d as was about a third of his audience that I could see. Last fall I made a 574 ft. loop antenna and strung it up about 35 ft in the air from eight trees. I climbed each one to be able to do that. When I finished I used my Sark 110 analyzer to define the resonances on the antenna through my double L balanced tuner. It loads up on every ham band from 160 to 6 with return loss so low it doesn\u2019t matter. I custom designed a high current, regulated power supply with over-voltage and over current protection in an old 100 Watt hf transceiver a friend of mine cherishes, then I aligned the entire radio. I have a used Steppir Big IR vertical with 64 radials buried beneath the grass. It is fed with 164 ft of LMR400 encased in sprinkling system tubing. I installed it all in a few weeks last summer. Everything but the vertical is hidden below the grass/dirt. Hard technical work. Old technical people work. I really want a new Siglent spectrum analyzer with tracking generator. It\u2019s $1400 but my wife doesn\u2019t understand so it remains a wish. I could go on because I\u2019m not dead yet, but hopefully this \u201cold people\u201d has given you pause to reflect on your mistaken assumption. ",
