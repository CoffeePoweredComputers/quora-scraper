            "answer_text": "The biggest disadvantages of owning a Xiaomi Redmi or Mi or ther sub-brand phones is - you don't have the opportunity to spend extra money on just brand value. You can't just spent extra 2000 or so on for just their brand name. Xiaomi works with a only 5% profit policies. Now if you ask me about Chinese Phone brands then there is a risk of data privacy I must say. Its happening all over. Surely you can't say you are totally secure with US products also. So this is life! ",

            "answer_text": "I'll say none. With all the security flaws people are claiming on Xiaomi devices . I'll say it won't concern most of the people. Just don't use mi cloud and mi browser. The company has made their own browser for chineese variants where most of the browsers are banned. But in other countries you can use any browser u want. And the situation with mi cloud is that it's servers are based in China. Well the company is from china so obviously they'll host things in their own country. If u really want to be secure just don't use mi cloud. The best thing about Xiaomi devices is that they are value for money. You can easily install a custom rom on Xiaomi devices inorder to get the best out of your device. The Xiaomi development group is large. U don't even have to be tech savvy to install roms on your device. I have owned over 4 Xiaomi phones in the past and they all lasted for atleast 3 years without any issues. I'll say for Indians it's the best company as it doesn't loot its users for brand value. ",

            "answer_text": "In the current situation the biggest disadvantage would be the privacy issue. Xiaomi is a Chinese tech giant so most of our data is stored on chinese servers. Also, most of the system apps on MIUI request unnecessary permissions to access or personal information. Apart from that issue, I think MI offers value for money products. Try to avoid using the Security Manager app on MIUI devices if you have one. ",

They might create problems than resolving them.Since these days Everyone has Xiaomi Redmi devices. So there's nothing special.You can't get accessories of Xiaomi devices easily in the nearby markets but they are readily available in Online e commerce sites and mi stores.Lacks of spares and late repairing in some rural Mi service centres.",
