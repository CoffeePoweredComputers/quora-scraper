            "answer_text": "The main advantage of audio-visual communication is the ability for one to convey what they are communicating in an effective way. There are two main types of audio-visual communication, live communication at an event and communication through published content. The use of audio-visual aids can help one communicate in both instances: Sound: the most important part of communication is for the listeners at a live event to hear what is being said, if they can\u2019t hear what the speaker is saying clearly it makes the communication rather useless.Visual Aids: the use of presentations on a screen can aid with communication greatly and can provide another platform for one to share their thoughts and ideas with an audience. It is much more interesting for the audience if they can view and comprehend what is being said through means other than speech. Visual aids, such as graphs, diagrams and photographs, also help display information concisely and help the audience retain the information after the event.Video Content: videos are a really great way to communicate something to an audience, they are able to clearly inform the viewer in a concise and fun way, much like visual aids. Being able to deploy videos of recorded events as well as videos in general definitely helps with user engagement or distributing content to a much wider viewership in the case of advertising.Recording and Broadcasting: AV systems can usually support the recording and live broadcasting of events. This can be very useful for engaging with a wider audience by providing the content to people who are not able to be at an event in person.Lighting: through lighting one can make an event much more fit for purpose, whether it be stage lighting for productions or lighting in a filmed video. Lighting can help the viewers focus on what you want them to and makes an event much more interesting as opposed to having no lighting variation.Signage: the use of signage around an event can be a great way to communicate to the attendees, providing the latest updates (through a live Twitter feed for example), photos and information (such as social media links or the schedule for the day) to them live. From experience Planet eSign is a really great solution for this.And there are many more examples of audio-visual communication, such as posters, video-conferencing and telecommunication that you can research the benefits of in your own time.However, the underlying disadvantage of audio-visual is by far the costs and expertise associated with developing an infrastructure necessary to provide these aids. It goes without saying that if you want a high quality AV system you will have to pay a fairly large amount of money. The pricing for this can get as high as six-figures depending on the size of the system you are trying to implement. Maintenance and management are also other costly factors, in many cases the solutions implemented do not run themselves and require someone to be present on-site in order to run the system - especially if it is a hall. The cost of maintaining a system can be very high for audio-visual communication systems, especially if using projectors, which tend to break or require maintenance (e.g. replacing bulbs) very often. Also remember that you need space to install an audio-visual system and in some cases the system may require special requirements such as cable routing, installation of ceiling lighting, mounting of wall speakers or a dedicated audio-visual desk to name a few. One of the other disadvantages with audio-visual communication is the high standards associated with it. If an AV system is not working properly because it is a cheap solution that has cut corners, it is nearly as useless as having no system in the first place. You only have to look as far as the classroom to see this in reality; if a projector in the classroom is experiencing issues or the sound from the computer is not working, the teacher will most likely just not use the whole system altogether. When implementing an AV solution it is important to ensure that it works and it works well, the last thing people want is to have a system that requires an expert to use and manage on a day-to-day basis. Even with audio-visual communication through published content, people expect the content be of very high quality, for example video content is expected to be in 1080p and have clear sound without any background noises. People do not want to see a live broadcast that is having buffering issues or a video recording where the filming is unstable and the person filming takes time to move the camera. In conclusion, audio-visual communication is great at getting across information with clarity, however, it generally comes at a high cost to execute properly and effectively. ",

            "answer_text": "Audio is defined as anything related to sound in terms of receiving, transmitting or reproducing or its specific frequency. An example of something that is audio is a stereo. Visual aids are defined as charts, pictures or images that help to make a point or enhance a presentation. An example of visual aids are bar graphs and pie charts that are used to illustrate percentages of products sold and the change in sales over time. Some companies offer these kind of professional set up services. It was easier to understand the dialogue through the surround-sound system, and the voices sounded more fleshed out.\u201d This is likely because the speaker drivers in the soundbar are much smaller and thus can't clearly reproduce the lowest frequencies of the male voice (a common soundbar issue) ",
