            "answer_text": "What exactly about virtualization were you looking at learning?   Deep technical (PCI-Passthrough-SRIOV)/benchmarking/comparisons etc? Do you want to learn a specific virtualization technology or do you want to learn what virtualization is in general? There are some courses out there, but as far as I know, not about the ins and outs of what it can do.  It's more about the APIs, Management panel and SDN..and even storage. A lot of it is reading If I were you, I would start out with these sites: Main Page - KVM Welcome to xen.org, the home of the Xen\u00ae Project which develops hypervisor, the powerful open source industry standard for virtualization. Oracle VM VirtualBox That should start you off on the right foot.  If you have something specific to ask, let me know. ",
