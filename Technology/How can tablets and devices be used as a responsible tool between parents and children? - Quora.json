            "answer_text": "You have to think beyond it\u2019s a device and entertainment purposes. They use them in school. Even preschools. My daughter has been using an iPad in school since preschool. They can be very educational. I would recommend finding a \u201cchildren\u2019s\u201d tablet/device. It doesn\u2019t come with all the bells and whistles as a regular one does. It\u2019s strictly made for kids. Easier to monitor access. On my seven year olds, she doesn\u2019t even have the ability to chat, google, search other internet engines, etc. With COVID and school buildings closes, that\u2019s how she did school was online. Plus the learning is fun and not so rigid. At the beginning of the school year, her teacher(s) usually give us a list of recommended educational sites they use in the classroom as well. When my daughter was 3, I downloaded ABC Mouse for her. She loves Science and Math. Those are my two worst subjects. At age three, she was telling me all about pyramids, planets, animals I didn\u2019t even know about. Some of that stuff I had to look up myself. ",

            "answer_text": "My daughter is 14. She doesn\u2019t have a phone, iPad, or any sort of device. We have laptops, iPads at home but she has to use them with permission and they stay downstairs. She plays games on them for about 40 minutes per day. Instead of this for entertainment, we play board games. We are really competitive and spend hours doing these things. We bake, cook, and read. My daughter reads at the YA level, 1 book every two days. I would hate to see her waste her life behind a phone chatting away. She has friends that come over or she can socialize with them at school. Just because you can afford them, doesn\u2019t mean that children to have them. They need to be able to do things that do not require a device. ",

Young people should have their own technological devices (especially when trying to research something for a class project or some such assignment). Mr Google, as a friend of mine calls it, is very handy when you\u2019re stumped. Heck the internet wasn\u2019t even a thing until I was in college and it took forever for my parents to let us have it at home, but it would have made my life in middle and high school a LOT simpler ",

If the parents want to provide the use of devices for their children, they should make it clear that the child doesn\u2019t \u201cown\u201d them but that the parents do and are allowing the child to use them, and that permission can be withdrawn.
