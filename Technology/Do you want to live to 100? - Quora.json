It\u2019s not a physical ordeal I just don\u2019t enjoy it and neither does my girlfriend who is 20 years younger than me so my uncle proves in some ways age not that relevant but by 100 almost everyone will be struggling. As a researcher into aging I am often asked to define what aging is so here is my definition - Aging is the progressive and inexorable accumulation of molecular and cellular damage which leads to loss of physical function increasing infirmity, elevated risk of chronic illness, and ultimately death -. Once we address those issues by repairing the accumulated damage we will be pretty much home and dry and living a long life will no longer automatically go hand in hand with infirmity and suffering. Throughout our history if there has been a route by which we can lead healthier, happier and more productive lives we have tended to take it and that is the reason why anti-aging medicine will progress down exactly the same route and why arguments such as we are interfering with nature, it\u2019s morally wrong etc simply do not have any validity at all. As soon as we had the means, historically we have tackled all of the diseases which tended to kill people, for example, polio, smallpox \u2014 which used to kill millions. Infections which were one of the main killers before we had antibiotics because you must keep in mind that people could simply cut themselves while they were working in their backyard or women could suffer an infection during childbirth, which would kill both her and the baby. Even worse, something simple such as an infected finger or toe could lead to amputation of the whole hand or foot because there was no other route to bring the infection under control, even that frequently didn't work because there was no way that you could actually prevent infection which could arise from the amputation itself. These days not only are there antibiotics but we have retroviral drugs to tackle AIDS, we have insulin to manage diabetes, Ace inhibitors and beta-blockers to tackle high blood pressure, the list is endless. Add in all the surgical procedures such as cataract surgery, new joints and all sorts of other interventions such as cardiac surgery, for example, a heart bypass or stents which increase the person's quality of life and the trend is pretty obvious. As soon as we can bring aging under a decisive level of clinical control, clearly we will. The most bizarre thing in my mind is that we seem to try and tackle the main diseases of aging such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, arthritis and neurodegenerative diseases individually but what we seem to fail to grasp is we're not actually attacking the root cause which is aging itself we are simply attacking the end result. Tackle aging and you would inevitably address the diseases of aging because these conditions mainly affect old people and do not frequently strike at the young. We don't know at this stage exactly how far off the first effective anti-aging therapies are but what we can reasonably assume is they are probably no less than 10 years away and probably not much more than 30 years so for many people alive now being confronted with many of the diseases of aging will not arise because the conditions will be under a decisive level of biomedical control. My final comment is that once aging is under a decisive level of medical control I will opt for as many years as I can get but 500 might do for starters and when I get to 500 in the middle of this century I will take it from there, call me greedy but I reckon I would want more :-) ",

And here\u2019s why My relatives will miss me less since I\u2019ll live longerMy friends as wellI\u2019ll have more time to have fun in this life until I am reincarnated againMy plan to live to 100 or 110, is great. Most weekdays (except Friday), I shall follow this diet (changes may be needed on US Federal holidays. Like Independence day or Thanksgiving). 9 cups of water a day. For Breakfast, an avocado, a garlic bud with a bit of cloves, and 3 Brazil nuts. For lunch, a tomato, a yogurt container, and green beans. For dinner, a cup of yogurt, and rice with coconut oil. Laughing (lower stress and blood pressure), a cup of coffee with turmeric and cinnamon mixed in a day, meditate and do yoga, and get sunlight in moderation. On Friday, my diet will be different. For breakfast, I'll have a cup of milk, a plate of kale with vinegar and a bit of grapefruit slices, for lunch, nuts and a bit of date palm, and for dinner, a bowl of Thyme & basil covered with canola oil. As well as avoiding smoking or alcoholic drinks, as both are addictive. This is because getting smoke through lungs is a fast way to get effects going. So, when I'm stressed, I'll just exercise instead. I'll avoid prescription drugs unless as a last resort in order to prevent side effects, and I'll treat it naturally with fruits, vegetables, water, essential oils, herbs, spices, and tea. When I reach my 40's, I'll replace milk with water, to lower calories, fat and cholesterol. And instead of chocolate cake on my birthdays, I'll have carob cake. Carob is a plant found in Arabia, Israel and Turkey. It is like chocolate, but has less calories, more fiber, calcium and potassium, less sugar, but also less iron, and NO caffeine. For exercise, I'll walk a mile a day, and visit the gym 3 times a week. Now, the holiday meals4th of July-For snacks, watermelon slices and baked potatoes. Other than that, my style of vegetarian breakfast for dinner type night. Breakfast burrito with jalapeno pepper slices, Spanish rice, and black pepper, and instead of syrup for the waffles, it'll be honey mixed with turmeric (as honey has less calories than syrup, and 1 tablespoon of turmeric has 15% of DV Iron, and has been shown to prevent Alzheimer's and skin cancer) ",

And I have a good to excellent chance of making it, because I\u2019m in excellent health at this time, taken all around, and I\u2019m doing all the right things in terms of diet, exercise, family, etc. I\u2019ve given up all my bad habits that lead to early death, such as riding motorcycles and drinking more than an ounce of alcohol once in a while. That small an amount is apparently not a serious risk. My chances are good to excellent because all my known direct ancestors, other than my mother, lived into their late eighties or nineties,excepting the ones that were killed in accidents of one sort or another, and Mom made it into her early eighties. A number of close relatives have made it past the century mark. IF she had been under the long term care of a COMPETENT physician, she would easily have made it into her nineties as well. But she developed diabetes in her middle age or maybe even younger, and it wasn\u2019t diagnosed by ANY of three different physicians until we got a fourth one when she was already old. So I\u2019ve hit the genetic lottery in terms of living a long life, and I\u2019m counting on drawing a couple of good cards by way of advancing medical knowledge as well. ",

I wouldn\u2019t like it if I had to receive daily attention or be with people all the time either. That would make me feel suffocated. Plus, I think the people who want to live to be 100 want to do it just to say they did it once they reach that age. I\u2019m not here to gain championship of who can live the longest. I want to just let life take its course with no definite plan about how long I want to live. Plus, life is just more effort than it\u2019s worth to even want to live to be that old.

She was about 80, (in 1980), and I was trying to tell her about how computers were coming into our own homes, and she said she did not want to hear about, that it was just too much. She explained how she remembered gas lights in the streets, she saw the first cars come on to the road, the first electrical coming into homes, the advent of sound theater and then later, TV\u2019s in the home. She watched her beloved horses fade into history. She watched 2 world wars and all the technological advances that came with that. All her knowledge, all her skills, all her experience and know how had become hobbies. For her it wasn\u2019t the physical limitations, it wasn\u2019t the loss of husband and friends, it was those things that had made soul tired and ready to move on. Even though I have kept up with the trend in personal computers, I am most definitely not ready to have talking machines around me. We all have lines we draw in the sand and I can see, by the time another 30 years has passed, I will be more than ready to move on. ",

The real question is about my health at that age and what I will still be able to do and not, but even if I can only tell stories it would be enough for me. Another point is of course the population pressure on the world: is it sustainable if everybody is living to 100 or older ? I can intellectually imagine that if human reproduction rate is too high compared to death rate, the earth can become even worse than now (it is probably already too high given the amount of resources people are wasting today). Anyway I\u2019m not designed to willfully resign and end my own life just to save the world or merely leave others waste a larger share of the world. Consuming less resources is okay for my, and I\u2019m doing that (I of course can improve). ",

After that, her eyesight deteriorated from macular degeneration. Then her hearing. Then she began the long decline into senility. She survived a minor stroke in 2008 and was able to remain in her own home, with input daily from careers and five times a week my wife and I drove the fifty- mile round trip to see her even though she was often truculent or downright abusive. I would not wish her final years on anybody. Her intellect gone, all her friends dead. No thanks, I would sooner check- out before everything goes haywire.

After all, by leading a healthy and unadventurous life one is only adding years on at the wrong end - one cannot have a second childhood, so I'd rather enjoy the one I do have and perhaps live unhealthily and knock a few years off at the end. I know lots of very active 100+ year-olds, but ultimately they are not as active as I am now. I would not object to reaching 100 in itself if I did happen to achieve it, but I would ensure that I would still be doing as much as a 100-year-old could possibly do. ",
