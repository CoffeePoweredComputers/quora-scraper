            "answer_text": "Sure. You can program it in all the popular languages. But you may find difficulty in finding libraries for few languages. Raspberry pi is basicully runs with Linux operating system. It is a minicomputer. If it is a computer then you can run in any interested language. All you have to do is install appropriate tools for your language. And use it. ",

            "answer_text": "You cant use a hammer where you need a screw driver ! Java can definitely be used on Raspberry Pi and even web servers like Tomcat, but I wouldn\u2019t use java to interact with GPIO. There are good libraries for GPIO with Python, why make life harder by using java .You can use java to write any complex logic or algorithmic operations and let python intreact with I/O and other hardware and if you\u2019re into driver and systems programming get down to the venerable \u2018C\u2019.
