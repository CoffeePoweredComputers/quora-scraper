            "answer_text": "Beyond networking, as mentioned by Anton Carver, there\u2019s also the physical requirements of shipping servers and disks to the data center, and the need for people to work at the data center. Norway has a population density of 15 people per square kilometer. That might seem ridiculously low\u2026 but Alaska\u2019s is 1.3 people per square kilometer. As a result, Norway has much better transportation and communications infrastructure than Alaska, and has a much greater number of potential workers for the data centers to select from. ",

            "answer_text": "The laws of physics are quite strict about imposing a speed of light limitation on all computer messaging. So basically one wants one's datacenters reasonably near to one\u2019s customers to minimize network latency. Siberia has a considerably lower population density than Northern Europe, so not good prospects for finding customers there. ",
