            "answer_text": "Interesting question. I did some digging and found this university that describes its Major in Construction Technology like this: \u201cStudents of construction technology learn the basic engineering principles and technical skills necessary to help engineers and other professionals supervise the construction of buildings and other structures.\u201d Based on this definition, I would say that a construction technology is any type of engineered system that helps professionals build structures. Therefore, you could have technologies in the following areas: DesignCAD: computer-aided design, a type of software that helps render two-dimensional buildings.BIM: see Nick\u2019s answer in this tread.3D modeling: rendering of buildings in three-dimensions. The newest technology in this field is 3D printers, you can create a very precise miniature version of a building.2. Planning Estimating: when a customer request a quote for a building, you can draw the specs and use a software to tell you exactly how much materials you will need to complete that project. MBS is an example of a software that allows you to give an accurate pricing of your building.Scheduling: you are a metal building manufacturer and you need to deliver a project at the end of the month. You can use a software to schedule the production phases in the upcoming weeks, the teams who are going to work on phase A, the ones on phase B etc.3. Supply/Purchasing MRP: stands for Material Requirement Planning. According to wikipedia, it is a \u201cproduction planning, scheduling, and inventory control system used to manage manufacturing processes.\u201d It means that it is a system that helps you purchase quantities of materials based on your production schedule. Like the wikipedia article explains, you could do this by hand, but it is mostly done by software, which is more accurate and efficient.4. Execution Integrated job sites: use of construction or ERP software to connect personnel on-site with project timeline, budget, workforce schedule, materials available etc.Construction phase: you could use a construction software to manage the following steps of the project within one place:Preliminary schedulingCommitting resourcesControlling tasks and resourcesMonitoring costsManaging contracts and documentsEngaging subcontractors5. Finance Accounting or financial software: which can be a dedicated software or an ERP. It helps:Monitors cash flow \u2013 revenue from clients and outflows to vendorsMaintains financial recordsCreated ledgers to track profitability of both project and businessERP software are particularly great at keeping track of the profitability of a project, since all material used, workforce hours, and administrative costs are affected towards the overall cost of the project. It allows you to know every minute how much you have spent on your construction project, which you can use to compare to your selling price. 6. Selling CRM: according to wikipedia, CRM (or Customer relationship management) is \u201can approach to manage a company's interaction with current and potential customers.\u201d You can look up CRM software as a great technology to store your contacts, potential buyers, and execute a strategy to sell your construction products or services.",

            "answer_text": "As far as computer/software technology, BIM (Building Information Modeling) is a technology that is advancing very quickly. BIM is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. Building Information Models are files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be exchanged or networked to support decision-making about a place. Current BIM software is used by individuals, businesses and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain diverse physical infrastructures, such as water, wastewater, electricity, gas, refuse and communication utilities, roads, bridges and ports, houses, apartments, schools and shops, offices, factories, warehouses and prisons. Traditional building design was largely reliant upon two-dimensional technical drawings (plans, elevations, sections, etc.). Building information modeling extends this beyond 3D, augmenting the three primary spatial dimensions (width, height and depth) with time as the fourth dimension (4D)[18] and cost as the fifth (5D).[19] BIM therefore covers more than just geometry. It also covers spatial relationships, light analysis, geographic information, and quantities and properties of building components (for example, manufacturers' details). Source: Wikipedia ",
