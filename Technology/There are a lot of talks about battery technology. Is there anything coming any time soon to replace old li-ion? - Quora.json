            "answer_text": "Define \"old li-ion\"? Lithium Ion is not that old, it was first commercialized in 1991. But was not popularly used until it was further developed and dropped in price in the 2000s. Within lithium ion exists also different cathodes and annodes (not all lithium ion is the same). That behave differently. The one that you are most likely have greatest contact with is LCO cathode and graphite anode  based lithium ion which is used in most electronics. Electric vehicles use other chemistries such as NCA, NMC, LTO, LMO and LFP. Now as far as replacing things go, not that simple. The issue is more complex than it seems. There are plenty of promising contenders to lithium ion. The problem is that not only do these contenders have to beat lithium ion of today, they also have to beat lithium ion of tomorrow. See, technology does not just sit still, in the case of lithium ion, it is improving at an average of about 7-8% per year in energy density. It also improves about the same in cost. So if you have a technology that is 50% better than current lithium ion in the lab, if you can't commercialize it in 5 years, your technology will already be behind lithium ion. Add in the fact that lithium ion will have higher economies of scale (thus much lower cost) and it is no contest. To put it into perspective in the real world, NiMH got commercialized in 1989. That is a 2 year difference from lithium ion. And it took lithium ion 10-20 years to catch up in most application. Some applications we still continue to use NiMH to this day. That is how much difference a 2 year lead makes. So you would have to wait for 1 of the following scenarios: 1) Lithium ion reaches close to the end of its technological improvement (so the rate slows down giving more time to catch up, this is effectively what happened to NiMH)  Lithium ion still has plenty of room to improve, so don't expect any slowdowns for at least a decade, maybe 2. 2) The technology can be produced on same equipment as lithium ion (thus making it easier to mass produce without intensive investment) 3) The technology has multiple breakthroughs which lets it leapfrog lithium ion   ",

            "answer_text": "We see stories of new \"potentially revolutionary\" battery technology every week. What technologies are the most promising to replace or improve on lithium-ion? There is room for improvement in the current chemistry. https://pushevs.com/2019/03/30/catl-achieves-304-wh-kg-in-new-battery-cells/ Solid state batteries seem promising, although, I wouldn\u2019t bet on a scientist who is 97 years old, even if is name is John B. Goodenough. Every new technology has to match Li-Ion in:- capacity per volume and weight (currently 220\u2013250 Wh/kg), - number of cycles until reaching a certain point of degradation (well over 500 and up to 10.000 to degrade by 20% (1), depending on the depth of discharge), - Coulombic efficiency (>99%), (2)- charge rate of 2,5 C in consumer (automotive) application,- discharge rate of 5C in consumer applications, technically going well beyond 100C (3)- fairly low self-discharge (<3% per month). Everything else is currently still in early R&D stage, there are no working prototypes that I would be aware of - and every technology I encountered is really bad at some topic.Essentially they are currently more like vaporware. And last but not least - every new technology will be measured by price per stored kWh ($120-$160 / kWh in consumer batteries in bulk from Panasonic, LG Chem, Samsung SDI, CATL). And even if all previous points are met, the last one will be really hard.
