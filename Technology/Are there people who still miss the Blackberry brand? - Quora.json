You got a great keyboard, a better Operating System, far better email, and that lovely flashing red light to say you had messages without having to turn on the screen. They were pretty robust too, if you dropped Blackberry it basically split apart into the main unit, the battery, and the battery cover, but you reassembled it and it was fine. Cracked glass screens are a new thing, that just didn\u2019t happen to pre-iPhone smartphones, they were more intelligently made out of plastic, which doesn\u2019t shatter. I don\u2019t care about the brand, but modern smartphones are a regression compared to the phones Blackberry made. ",

I was a big fan of BB10 and while it definitely has room to evolve, in general it was more refined and intuitive and smooth than Android and iOS at the time. Of course the app selection was terrible. BB10 with Play Store or App Store behind it would have been a serious force. ",
