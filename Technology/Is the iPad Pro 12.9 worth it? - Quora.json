            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a loaded question. By \u201cworth it,\u201d what do you mean? Is the value of the technology worth the money you spend on it? That depends on what your income and cost of living is. Is it a capable machine? Yes, it is. I bought one close to the launch day, and loved it from th start. The large screen is fantastic for watching videos or having several programs running side-by-side. I can do everything I need a computer for except a few things for a blog I contribute too (renaming photos because the web master likes them named a certain way. That\u2019s truly the only thing I must have my Mac for.) Do I find it huge and a bit scary to carry around? Yes. It\u2019s a huge pane of glass that wants to fall out of your hand to its death. Yes, I use a case much of the time, but I rarely use a keyboard-type one. I find typing on an iPad an easy thing to do. (I\u2019m typing on a 10.5\u201d iPad Pro right now, with the onscreen keyboard. This is the third answer I\u2019ve written just sitting here. Why should I walk back to my office for my laptop, or a keyboard, or even a stand? Or the larger iPad? I\u2019m good, thanks.) Most folks buy a laptop because they have always bought a laptop. That\u2019s what you buy. But what do you truly need a computer for? Reading and writing on Quora.FacebookEmailOnline bankingWatching video (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, YouTube, whatever.)Twitter/Instagram/other social networksPlaying music through AppleMusic/Spotify/PandoraPlaying gamesWriting and printing documents of all typesI have been using iPads for all of these since the first one. They are most definitely \u201cworth it\u201d to me. I rarely carry my MacBook around, but I do have to schlep my work Thinkpad home a few nights a month. Those are sad times. When I worked for Apple Retail, I always tried to get folks to understand the power of this device. Some folks would \u201cget it\u201d and take the plunge. Some took a while before they finally came around. And every now and again, I\u2019d meet a kindred soul, recommend an app or keyboard trick that only power users know about, and I\u2019d get the look. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same one that psssed between Steve Jobs and Jef Raskin at the iPhone launch. ",
