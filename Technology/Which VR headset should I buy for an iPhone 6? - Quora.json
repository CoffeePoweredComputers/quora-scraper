In the end (as others have noted), you\u2019ll need a better phone. So go cheap now and wait until you get some better technology for it. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I think this one is among the best \u2014 and I have tried many HMDs: Amazon.com: HooToo 3D VR Headset with Magnetic Trigger: Home Audio & Theater If you have an iPhone 6s Plus, or later, the VR and 3D is pretty good. Honestly, the resolution is better than the Samsung Gear VR - you will not see pixels on those devices, as the pixel density is much higher. I am sure that the iPhone 8 will have an even higher resolution for these purposes. Enjoy! ",
