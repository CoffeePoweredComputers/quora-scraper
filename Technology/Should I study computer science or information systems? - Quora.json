            "answer_text": "For me personally this question was very easy as I choose between two things. A (Do I want to sit at a desk most of my days writing code and not talking to people much outside of meetings with promotions only being to senior dev and team leads) or B (Do I want to be in constant talks with management and devs in order to teach, implement, discover, install, fix and everything else that comes with technology). One way you can think of IS vs CS is by thinking of big companies like Google and Facebook. Both companies start out as IS projects (All the OS, server, front end and back end programming) but end up as CS projects as the companies deal with big amounts of data, and start to add complex algorithmic theory into their sites. To me IS gives a much easier way of going up the ladder. For you however I encourage you to look through the jobs available in your current area, the area where your college is, and the areas you may want to end up living to see the jobs available for IS compared to CS. For me in MD, IS has more entry level jobs at the 70k + mark than CS, for the nation as a whole CS has more job openings but not by much and those are only specialized software developmental jobs. There is also a difference in what each job asks for to prove that you can do the work. IS will ask for certifications unless you want a software development job in which, like CS, they will want a portfolio of projects using the things they want. Also while job hunting, unless you want to work for a startup, heavily avoid posts that say fast work environment. It\u2019s a code word for our company is unorganized and we are going to ask you to do a lot that you aren\u2019t paid for and give you hours you may not want. ",

Computer Science-------------------------------Business Intelligence                                                       |                                                       |                                                       |                                                       |                                                      ITIT is the median degree that teaches \"some\" science( based on what school you are at) and computer application to business processes. This is what a lot of consultants at Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, etc. do. They figure out the business challenge that the person is having and use computer software/technologies to make the processes and business in general more streamlined and/or automated. If you're in the services industry, a lot of the computing might be used to gather data and perform analytics to improve upon the services and add new features. You don't really need to know much about how a computer works and how its internals are structured in order to implement business intelligence machinery. However, with computer science, you will be solving problems with the use of a computer. Problems that require you to know how to program computers and write software and programs to manipulate data. Another area of computer science is the design of Algorithms (Artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc). This requires you to know discrete mathematics and general statistics and calculus.  If you want to design algorithms that allow machines to learn and think for themselves, then you would need to do at least a MS in computer science since an undergraduate degree will only teach you the basics of programming, some discrete math, stats and how programs run on computers. If you want to use computers to create efficient Businesses and stream line processes, then you should focus on IT. To give you an example, when SAP was first launched, there were very few people who knew how to migrate ancient IBM mainframe software suites and Lotus business intelligence software to SAP. SAP was a highly integrated solution that allowed networked intelligence and also integrated change management with other aspects of the business such as product lifecycle management. Any IT professional that had knowledge of how to do this migration was very highly paid. This is where Accenture paid a lot of money charging businesses exorbitant fees to cut over to a new software. Last Words: Computer science is not easy. Its very technical and you have to love math and solving problems in general. If you lack patience and are of short temperament, then this field is not for you. ",
