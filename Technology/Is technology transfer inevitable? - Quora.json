            "answer_text": "In my opinion, it depends on the circumstances of the origin and the destination location. Let us consider these points to get started: Technology will be transferred only if there is demand for it. However, it will transfer in stages:Business user levelThis is the most superficial level of technology transfer use to support a business. Examples: ready-made oil drills and platforms, software packages. Professional services that may be required to install or otherwise get the technology set up for use can be hired from abroad. Technical user levelThis is the level where there is a significant gained knowledge by a local (or destination) party so it can start replacing the professional services from abroad. Development levelThis is the level at which the local (or destination) party\u2019s technical knowledge becomes deep enough to start extending features (e.g. plug-in software modules, or custom spare parts), or even develop in-house designs of the same technology platform, essentially becoming a competitor of the origin technology. If the cost of transferring that technology is currently prohibitive or expensive, depending on local \u2018climate\u2019 (import policies, R&D grants, etc.), this may create a local opportunity to recreate that technology locally.Some countries or regions may or may not welcome technological breakthroughs, due to various reasons. Yes, there will always be people who reject technologies in favour of old ways. Once this local tech matures, there is no more need to transfer technology. See point 1.c. above.- But then, this is an overly simplified hypothetical answer. Actual development level, again, depends on many variables: Local political climateLocal opinions of the technologyLocal demand from specific marketsDiffering policies (or lack thereof)Possible cultural conflictsAvailability and quality of talents who will absorb and possess the knowledge\u2026Usually a feasibility study is required or recommended in order to determine whether it is advantageous to build businesses that will either obtain the transfer of the technology or otherwise develop it.
