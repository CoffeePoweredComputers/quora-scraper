            "answer_text": "The typical phones out there, using default JPEG settings, deliver 10\u201316 MB files for their 48 megapixel mode images. Most phones offer the ability to select quality options for JPEG shooting, so I\u2019d expect you have some ability to trade quality for storage efficiency. A raw image would run 48\u201360+ MB, without any sort of compression (lossy or lossless). An 8-bit TIF would run around 150MB without any (lossless) compression. ",
