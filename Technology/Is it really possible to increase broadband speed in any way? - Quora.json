This my friend is very possible and quite easy too you see right now I'm on gtpl broadband with a speed of 512Kbps or 64KBps and I did a very small thing which increased my speed to 2Mbps or 256KBps this is very easy to do and you have to just follow my steps Now if you have a very big company as your ISP then log on to its website if not then just call the person who provides you internet.Now tell him you want a better package such as a 4\u201310 Mbps plan.The op will become very excited and will be happy to help you to do soNow what's left is to check your speed I recommend ookla speedtest app if on mobile.Enjoy ;-) P.S.- This was a sarcastic answer and I very well know what the asker wanted but because the above is the only way to do so I recommended not down voting my answer\u2026 ",
