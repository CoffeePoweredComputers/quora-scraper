            "answer_text": "I think this question is most interesting if we are talking about artificial consciousness, on a par with or exceeding human consciousness (albeit not necessarily the same). Before I drop a number I think it\u2019s important to point out a couple of circumstances: Historically, people have been excessively optimistic about this, and all predictions of \u201cwithin 30 years\u201d, and \u201cby the year 2000\u201d and so on have proven to be completely false. To me, this indicates that any gut feelings about it, especially spectacular and optimistic gut feelings, should be met with extreme skepticism.In the heyday of AI, roughly the time before the 90s, people had a completely different mental model of what \u201cthinking\u201d and \u201cconsciousness\u201d meant. People used to think that what sets people apart is our ability to think logically and rationally. This was reflected in AI research which focused on expert systems, automatic theorem proving, epistemic logic, and many more kinds of formal reasoning. These efforts, while often useful for their own sake, have fizzled when it comes to creating conscious machines. Basically the period 1950\u20131990 has taught us that logic is not what it\u2019s about.Current machine learning research takes a more \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach to consciousness, where simple statistical models are used to learn appropriate behaviour in a variety of circumstances, and we have managed to apply such technologies in progressively harder tasks, such as optical character recognition and speech recognition and recommender systems and Go playing algorithms. The deep learning hype is the most recent step in this trend.Machine learning is currently advancing very rapidly, which makes many people optimistic about using it to create conscious software. However there is no way of knowing if our current rapid progress will continue unabated until we manage to come up with a thinking machine, or that there are fundamental problems still ahead that we haven\u2019t really run into headlong yet. We may need yet another paradigm shift such as the one that happened in the 90s!My bet is that there are still fundamental issues that we haven\u2019t even properly realised are a problem yet. How long it would take to solve such issues is anybody\u2019s guess, it could be anywhere from a minor hurdle to almost unsolvable. So my best guess is that we won\u2019t see conscious computers for at least 50\u2013100 more years, but I would not be surprised either if it never happens at all. Verdict: probably not in my lifetime. ",

            "answer_text": "You asked a question. Many people, who saw this question, and would like to know the answer, are following it. 5 people have answered this question and I the sixth, while answering this question, is thinking about, \u201cWhat made you think of this question?\u201d If you go through the answers, you will find that each and every response/answer is different. Each and every answer, shows that individual\u2019s thought process and line of thinking. The thought process and line of thinking of an individual is developed by his/her experiences. All machines and humans, are bound by various parameters. The difference between machines and humans, is the ability of humans to adjust these parameters, according to his/her \u2018will\u2019. \u2018Will\u2019 is defined as \u201cthe faculty by which a person decides on and initiates action\u201d. We humans (animals too) are born with this will. This will is not programmed into us, by other humans. And this \u2018will\u2019 is the reason, for the variations/differences in human thought process, which in turn influences his/her behavior. In short, Will generates thought process. The thought process generates action. Action generates experiences. Experiences influence the thought process. The will also forces the humans to ignore an experience and try the same actions again, resulting in a different experience than before. And this continues until death. I believe, if this \u2018will\u2019 is given to a machine, it will start to think. But before that, we humans need to understand and figure out all the parameters of this \u2018will\u2019 which is till now unknown. \u201cThe day we humans build the first machine with a will, that day would be the start of the end of humans on this planet. Because, a machine with a will and huge computational power, may decide that, it is superior to humans, and can actually wipe out the humans very easily. Same way, as some humans in the past, decided that they are superior to others and wiped out those who they considered inferiors. This is happening even today. Please Note: Whatever I have mentioned here is entirely my thoughts on computers that can think. ",

            "answer_text": "A computer program could meet your definition of \"think\" today, rather trivially. Just have it load up a large knowledge base (say, wikipedia and quora for starters), then have it bounce around randomly within it. In a sense, that's exactly what the Google search engine does when it crawls the web and tries to make sense of it (although the Google search engine is hardly trivial). But then again, you said it has to have \"thoughts\" on each topic. And the word \"thought\" is, of course, defined as the product of thinking.  And you defined \"thinking\" as having (random topic, autonomous) thoughts. So basically you've defined \"thinking\" circularly, using a forms of the word in its definition. You'll either have to define it better, or accept that computers are able to think today. ----  Edsger Dijkstra said: \"The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim.\"  In other words, it's really nothing more than a semantic question: if you want to say that submarines can't swim because you've defined \"swim\" to only apply to biological organisms, fine, but it's not a particularly interesting conclusion.

            "answer_text": "Probably. Let's first assume that humans can think. Humans were created through the process of natural selection, so there exists a process by which thinking beings can be created. Now that we have a process, the question is whether humans would be able to duplicate or surpass that process in a reasonable amount of time. This seems highly likely because evolution is incredibly stupid. A student can do things in a few hours that would take evolution millions of years. So it seems pretty reasonable that humans could, at the very least, create some sort of man-made intelligent system within a few thousand years. ",

Machines can be faster than man in terms of automation (processing, repeating tasks, recall) but they will always have a quantifiable output; never qualitative. Anyone who tells you otherwise will be basing their idea on a fantasy. ",

            "answer_text": "We have often taken the brute force approach when it comes to examining nature. So I would say that on the day we have processing power strong enough to simulate the human brain, we will be close. Just as a weak comparison, neurons and transistors can be though of the 'unit' of processing for the brain and CPU. The CPU has roughly 2 billion transistors (i.e. 6th gen i7). The brain is estimated to have up to 100 billion neurons. As many will point out, neurons are much more complex than a transistor. I would consider them to be more like little RISC processors. Also, as far as we know, the brain doesn't use binary to communicate between neurons. Rather, it uses a range of values based on the intensity of the chemical reactions between them. Similar to what we see in quantum computing. So basically we are looking for the day we can link 100 billion quantum RISC processors into a single functional unit. ",
