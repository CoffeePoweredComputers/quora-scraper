            "answer_text": "Here is a list of UX Design Blogs and Resource Websites for reference, and I just picked some of them. Hope that\u2019s helpful. No.1. Smashing Magazine A comprehensive website provides high-quality articles with the UX employee on Design, Coding, Mobile, and Word Press etc. No. 2. UXbooth A professional UX website. The difference between it and Smashing Magazine is that Uxbooth focuses more on the aspect of user experience design. No.3: UX Magazine Articles are short and forceful with popular design case to explain the theoretical knowledge, and inference in the articles are very convincing. No.4: Lukew Lukew, a senior UX expert, also the founder of several companies. No.5\uff1aDesign Modo You can find lots of great articles on the category of \u201cDesign\u201d, including UX design, Responsive design, Website design and App design. No.6: Web Designer Depot What attracts me on this website is it\u2019s outstanding visual design. Subscribers can receive the ultramodern information on the visual design which deserves sustaining attention from visual designers. No. 7: Net Magazine Net is the online version of it\u2019s entity magazine. Wide coverage of the article content is a big advantage for subscribers to expand horizon. No. 8: Mockplus Blog The interface of this blog is very simple and clean. Articles are all surrounding the topics of design tools, resources. All of the websites and blogs are in no particular order, just name and list them. Hope that\u2019s helpful to you. :) ",
