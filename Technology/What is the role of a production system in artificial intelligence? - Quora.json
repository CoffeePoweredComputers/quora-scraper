            "answer_text": "A production system (or production rule system) is a software that has some form of artificial intelligence. At its core, it has a set of rules to demonstrate certain behaviors but it also has algorithms that make it follow those rules. These rules are called productions. There are 4 major features of a production system: SimplicityModularityModifiabilityKnowledge IntensiveThe global database is the central data structure that an AI production system uses. The production rules operate on the global database. Each rule usually has a pre-condition that is either satisfied or not. When this pre-condition is satisfied, the rule usually applies. However, the application of the rule changes the database. Here are a few benefits that production systems offer AI: Unique tools for structuring and restructuring AI programsThe system is profoundly modular since individual rules can be changed independentlyIt is expressed in natural formIt recognizes the act cycle (plan, do, check, act) which allows it to separate knowledge from controlA general mapping onto state-space research. It could be data or goal-drivenProduction system uses pattern directed control, this offers better flexibility than algorithmic controlA great way to model the state-driven nature of AI-based machinesRemarkably helpful in real-time applications",
