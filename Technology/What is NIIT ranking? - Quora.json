            "answer_text": "NIIT University was established in year 2009 and since then it has managed to come under 200 national colleges list in many magazines. NU never promotes or advertises itself like other universities do. I suggest you not to go by the rank if you want to find the most suitable college for you rather search different educational forums and platforms, talk to the seniors of that college and if possible, take a visit to the college, doing this will help you knowing about a college in a better way. PS: I am a third year student at NIIT University, feel free to DM me if you have any queries regarding NU. ",
