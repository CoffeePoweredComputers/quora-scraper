            "answer_text": "They are American made. Their power and drive trains are not failing in any large amount. But they\u2019re poorly designed small production luxury cars. they have expensive small number production parts. Limited resources and experience to test and predict problems. Luxury cars are always, to a one (now a days) unreliable. American ones doubly so. So it fits the mould. their biggest problems seem to be on delivery. They are basically it seems, delivered in bad shape and it\u2019s up to the owner to decide what they want to spend the time getting fixed (under warranty). the windows and roofs blowing out at speed may be rare but are catastrophic. life expectancy on a big screen tv mounted in the sun in a car, can\u2019t be more than a couple years, but they installed one. Glass roof on a flexible box can\u2019t possibly survive, but they installed one. Super low profile tires on light weight wheels can\u2019t possibly survive, but they did it. electric door handles being the only way I. Or out must fail, but they did it anyway. They\u2019re just trying to be too luxury. Other cars with such engineering mistakes fail even more often. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the question is making an invalid assumption. I've owned many cars and driven for lots of miles. My Tesla Model S has more than 92,000 miles. In warranty, it had a couple of weak points. Two door handles and two window regulators were replaced under warranty. The drive unit was also replaced for backlash. All of these repairs are pretty common on early year Tesla Model S vehicles. The only repair it has had since the warranty ended was a 12V battery. It hasn't had any maintenance since 61,000 miles. That maintenance was its last yearly check. Tesla doesn't even recommend them anymore. Any of my other cars at this mileage would be facing fairly expensive maintenance including brakes, timing belt, tune up, water pump, and likely an alignment or two. I'm amazed that my Tesla hasn't even needed an alignment. It hasn't had its first brake work either, but I expected that.I For the past 30,000 miles, I have found my Tesla to be remarkably trouble free, at an age when most other cars are starting to ramp up their repair and maintenance expenses.

            "answer_text": "That is a complete FUD and nonsense. When it comes to reliability, Tesla or any other EV will always be better in reliability than a gas car. This is coming from owning a Toyota for 11 years. It has much less moving parts and subsystems to fail than a gas car. In my third year of owning Tesla and over 50,000 miles, the car as seen service center only 3 times and that too for tire rotation nothing else! My Toyota had done 10 services with oil, brake and multi-point inspections to keep it running in that mileage. So there is no comparison even. The drive train is tested for a million miles, and the battery over 400,000 miles. So not sure what makes in a unreliable vehicle. ",
