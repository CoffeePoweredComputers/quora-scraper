            "answer_text": "The OnePlus 8 is no different and has a great build quality and aesthetic appeal. The company has changed the front and rear panel design. Gone is the circular camera module, which was found on the OnePlus 7T and the brand has opted for a design similar to the 7 Pro. The triple rear camera setup is encased in a vertically stacked pill-shaped module. The device has a prominent camera module, but it at least doesn\u2019t have a very bulging camera bump like 8 Pro. It features a 6.55-inch full-HD+ AMOLED panel with wide color gamut, HDR10+ support, and 3D Corning Gorilla Glass protection. OnePlus could have added support for QHD+ resolution like the 7 Pro to further justify the big jump in price. The panel at least supports a 90Hz refresh rate for faster and smoother transitions, which consumes more battery. We will take about this later. There is a Vibrant Color Effect mode, which you can turn on for more vivid colors and contrast in videos. The handset sports a trendy hole-punch cutout, which is not the tinniest that we might have seen. The OnePlus 8 price in India starts from Rs 41,999, which is the price for the 6GB RAM + 128GB storage model. The price of phone is high but the truth is there is no phone as good as OnePlus 8 under Rs 45,000, except for the iPhone SE 2020. Phones like Realme X50 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite do offer high-end Snapdragon processor and other features, but the OnePlus 8 definitely has an edge over these phones. Here, I am not only talking about general performance, premium design, and better cameras, but also the software part. The latter is one of the most important areas for consumers when it comes to buying a phone and OxygenOS delivers a great experience on that part. The OnePlus 8 phone also offers a great display and a good enough battery life with 30W fast charging support. ",

            "answer_text": "The OnePlus 8 is expected to come with similar specs to the 7T, adding the new SD865 chipset and the X55 5G modem. These hardware additions drastically increase the pricing of the OnePlus 8 series (likely north of Rs 45k). Since 5G is absent in India, and with the unfortunate epidemic temporarily stunting progress towards a 5G network, it doesn't make sense to pay a premium for it, especially since 5G is at least 3 years away (my own estimate, don't take it too seriously). So unless you are planning to travel to a country like USA which has begun 5G roll-out (T-Mobile), there is no need to buy a OnePlus 8, especially if you are currently on a fairly new device. Don't forget to look at other devices such the upcoming iPhone 9/SE(2020), Realme X50 or Oppo Reno3 Pro devices before making your final decision. Feel free to A2A and Comment. Upvote and follow if you found this useful. \u262e Update: The iPhone SE came in at US$399, making it a great deal and worthy contender (keep in mind its poor battery life, though). But in international markets where the gap between the OnePlus 8 and the iPhone SE is narrower (in India, the OnePlus is only US$32.82 more expensive), it makes more sense to opt for the OnePlus 8, due to its 5G capability, bigger screen, higher storage in base model, better battery-life, and more versatile camera setup.
