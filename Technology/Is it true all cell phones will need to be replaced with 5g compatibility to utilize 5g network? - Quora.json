            "answer_text": "Yes\u2026 and no. Because the networks are operated by mobile phone companies, they won\u2019t be swapping antennas and base stations overnight due to cost of it, and when they do, they will be making sure that the transition will be seamless, because until 5g mobiles and other devices become more common, which won\u2019t probably be tomorrow, they will also need to be able to support 4g devices. But in order to be able to provide decent service for the 5g, the mobile companies need to upgrade their core network, mainly but not limited to the uplinks from base stations to the core network, so 4G users will also benefit from that, because they\u2019ll have more uplink capacity to share between the shared medium of the base station. So\u2026 in order to use the actual 5g part of the network, yes, a 5g mobile will be needed, but because 5g is much more than just the radio link between the handset and the cell tower, it\u2019s also an infrastructure upgrade, no, to benefit from 5g one doesn\u2019t need to update the mobile phone. But to get the full effect, yes. ",

            "answer_text": "No, that statement is not true. It is actually impossible to \u201creplace\" or \u201cupgrade\" one of the older devices for 5g capability. Either they were manufactured with it, or without it. I have a Note 9 I bought in November. It is not 5g compatable. I will not be able to utilize 5g, even with a software or firmware update. The phone was not manufactured with the capable chipset. I have a perfectly good smart phone, it just can't run on the new network. The question is, how do I get 5g? The anwser is, when my next upgrade comes, I can then trade my device in for a 5G note. Samsung might have a promo for the note 9 users coming up, I dont know. Time will tell, if they toss a great promo(like 600$ off the note 10 on trade in that will pay for most of the remaining contract on my current phone), then perhaps, I will upgrade to the note 10, otherwise, I'll wait for the 11. That said, it is always good to wait a little bit for the device to be thoroughly tested (remember the note 7?). They are adding new features, they could have problems (though I think samsung learned). ",
