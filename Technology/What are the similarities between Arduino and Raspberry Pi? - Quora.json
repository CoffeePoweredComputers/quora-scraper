            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s see - An Arduino is a self contained microcontroller. that can drive lamps or motors and connect to sensors. It has about the same processing power as the Sinclair ZX81 as it\u2019s Z80 CPU was clocked at 16Mhz (Not Ghz) and has 32KB (not Gb or MB!) of ram. ZX81 - Wikipedia It came out in 1981 and was a lot of fun! A Raspberry Pi 3B is a fully functional computer with a 4 core ARM processor clocked at 1.2 Ghz and shares 1GB of ram with its graphics. It supports monitors, keyboard, mouse, sound, 1080 HD Graphics, 40 pin GPIO, I2C bus for expansion to numerous devices, Supports SD Cards, LCD screens, Cameras, USB Hard drives, SSDs, Printers, MiDI keyboards, WiFi, Networking, has a full operating system based on Debian, Ubuntu, RISK, Kodi, Windows 10 IOT, and much much more. (Imagine a powerful smartphone that could connect to almost anything). The PI is better in performance than an \u2018old\u2019 Intel Pentium 4 PC and much cheaper.Pentium 4 - Wikipedia In 25 years in Electronics I never found a component or product that had no practical application. There are thousands of applications for Arduinos in embedded or portable systems where the weight, heat and power/battery consumption of the PI would be less practical. Imagine a robot, drone, weather balloon or rocket where space, weight and power is at a premium, the Arduino wins hands down! It is almost disposable and is a superb education introduction to programming. Both are so universal that I could go on all day about uses for them. ",

            "answer_text": "The only similarities that I see are: They both expose a number of general purpose digital IO pins that allow the device to generate and detect signals.They are built around Computer on Chip products.They are fairly low-powerThey are cheapOtherwise they are completely different products for completely different applications. The Arduino boards are development boards for micro-controllers. The Pi is a full-blown single board computer. ",
