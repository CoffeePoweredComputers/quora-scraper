            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll try to cover as much influence as possible from the Tang, but I must explain what happened to these influences as both nations evolved. And because of this, it is impossible for me to avoid telling a little of their history and later development, so you should expect to read more than just the Tang period from my answer. Classical Japan  Prince Shotoku flanked by younger brother (left: Prince Eguri) and first son (right: Prince Yamashiro), drawn by unknown author. [Wikipedia] Tang China  The popularity of the yuanlingpao (\u5713\u9818\u888d; round-collar pao) followed by the Sixteen Kingdom period came as a result of Sianbei (\u9bae\u5351) influence. By the Sui period, the yuanlingpao had been internalized by the Chinese and became the dynasty\u2019s dress code for officials and many other social classes. The Tang continued the code, which was then spread to Japan through Japanese envoys (\u9063\u5510\u4f7f). The yuanlingpao could also be worn by both genders.  The nubi caste (\u5974\u5a62) in this period often wore yuanlingpao with some stylistic difference while they were accompanying their masters.  Modern reconstruction of Tang dynasty yuanlingpao  Another reconstruction based on paintings and artifacts. Classical Japan  Because the Tang was a cultural giant in East Asia, Chinese fashion trends swiftly made their way to the Korean Peninsula and Japanese archipelago. The clothing for Japanese women often followed the Tang ideal, and the Chinese preference for certain use of color was imported as well.  If you had been paying attention to the minor details, you\u2019d even notice many accessories like the Tang style fan became everyday items for Japanese women. Tang China  Another thing is that the fashion trend of the Tang dynasty was continuously evolving, and the beauty standard for Chinese women was changing in different periods of the Tang. Whenever a new trend in China occurred during the Tang, you can assume it would have made some impact in Japan as well.  This was the form it took during the middle Tang period. Tang With the introduction of round-collar, cross-collar garments did not disappear. Cross-collar clothing remained the staple wardrobe item among the commoners, even though officials and warriors have adopted round-collar as their uniforms and work attires. Since the start of the Zhou dynasty, it had been a significant social rule in China to leave your right lapel in the front. The opposite of which is left lapel and it was frowned down upon as an barbaric practice. The Chinese used to look at this habit to distinguish a civilized person from an \u201cuncultured one.\u201d Furthermore, the ancient Chinese believed the afterworld was a parallel reality, almost like an alternative world in the mirror, and so the deceased would have to overlap their lapel to the opposite side so that the collar would appear back in the right position in their next world. Confusing?  This seemingly insignificant social rule was a great deal to the ancient Chinese, and battles had been fought to preserve this tradition\u2026 The tradition became laid back under the Liao founded by the Khitans, Kin (\u91d1, not Jin \u6649) founded by the Jurchens, and Yuan founded by the Mongols, and many statues created in their time reflected this opposite trend. However, once the Ming dynasty overthrew the Yuan, the new dynasty removed as many left-collared statues as possible and replaced them with the right ones. Japan  In the Kofun period, the Japanese did not care or paid much attention to whether the left or right lapel should show. In fact, the most common way to wear a collar dress was probably with the left side out. With Chinese influence, however, the new lapel rule spread to Japan through Korea, and gradually integrated with Japanese clothing culture.  Early Classical Japan began to receive tremendous Chinese influence, but the right lapel practice did not come through until the Taih\u014d Code (\u5927\u5b9d\u5f8b\u4ee4) was put into place in the late Asuka period. Since the introduction of the code, right lapel started to gain ground and set out to become the dominant practice.  The right lapel had remained so as the proper way today in traditional Japanese clothing, meanwhile the left lapel has become a Japanese taboo. And like the Chinese, left lapel Japanese clothing in the traditional contexts are usually seen in funerals.  Whether you wear the formal kimono or yukata does not matter, as long as you wear wafuku (\u548c\u670d, Japanese wear) with cross collar then the right lapel is the right way! You will always be on the safe side if you follow this rule. But I must point out that the right lapel rule does not apply to you unless you wear traditional Japanese clothing. Even so, people in Japan will most likely forgive you for not knowing the taboo. Japan  Sumo has become a part of Japanese culture today, but it was profoundly influenced by the Tang. Tang China  (Dunhuang mural painting) The Chinese had wrestling since the Warring States periods, and the tradition continued to the Tang. The sport was called jueli (\u89d2\u529b) in the earlier periods and xiangpu (\u76f8\u64b2) in the Sui-Tang, and it was a common sport among all social classes; nobilities and commoners alike. Chinese wrestling as a popular commoner sport dwindled in the Yuan dynasty, but quickly returned to popularity in the Ming. However, the Manchus who founded the Qing released a decree forbidding the Chinese from learning martial arts (\u7981\u6b66\u4ee4) for two centuries, and finally put an end to the tradition. Modern Chinese wrestling is instead largely based on buku (\u182a\u1860\u1874\u1860), the Manchu wrestling technique which was influenced by Mongolian b\u00f6kh (\u182a\u1825\u182c\u1821). Japan Karakami (\u5510\u7d19) is the craft of creating high quality paper with aesthetics in consideration. The word karakami literally means \u201cTang Chinese paper\u201d and, just like the name tells it, the technology to produce paper came to Japan from China during the Sui-Tang period.  While karakami still exists in Japan, China no longer has the tradition to craft paper like this. Modern China simply doesn\u2019t have a counterpart to this art, although the making of paper is wide known.  Japan Seiza (\u6b63\u5ea7) or \u201cproper sitting posture\u201d became a common practice in Classical Japan, and it\u2019s still observed Modern Japan (particularly in Japanese martial arts and tea ceremony). However, ancient Japanese prior to contact with Central Plains culture did not always think of this as the proper way to sit.  Traditional Japanese homes kept their furnitures minimalist and low-leveled with \u201cfloor culture\u201d in mind.  Tang China  Seiza, known as zhengzuo (\u6b63\u5750) in Chinese, had been the default way to sit as early as the Zhou dynasty. The Chinese considered this the \u201cproper sitting position\u201d and \u201cthe Chinese way\u201d once upon a time when floor culture too thrived in China, and it\u2019s highly likely that zhengzuo had made its way to Japan earlier than the Sui-Tang period.  However, sitting on the floor was feasible only because both Chinese and Japanese kept their furnitures and houses at a low eye-level, otherwise it\u2019d be impractical to constantly having to stand and sit again.  Unlike the Japanese though, the Chinese eventually went through the transition to chairs in the Tang-Song period as taller furniture pieces were introduced from the west (not Western Europe, think nations like Persia instead).  As opposed to sitting in zhengzuo, another way was to sit cross-legged. Although sitting cross-legged was considered a huzuo (\u80e1\u5750) or the \u201cbarbarian\u2019s way,\u201d the casual position became the more popular choice at the end of the Song period. By the Qing period, the Chinese no longer prefered to sit on the floor inside their houses and Chinese furnitures had evolved into taller pieces. The transition to chair was completed by then, but floor culture did not vanish from China. The culture survived and evolved in older Chinese houses in Northern China. Starting from the Ming period, what used to be the sitting area had become an elevated, heated area called kang (\u7095). This little area in fact spread to Korea as well, and it\u2019s a common feature in rural houses of Northern China.  The East Asian floor culture that was shared between China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam had all taken different turns. Japan Before Japan had any systematic exchange with the Chinese in the prehistoric period, Japanese architecture was comparatively less advanced than cultures in mainland East Asia. The Japanese had limited interaction with the Chinese until later on.  In the Asuka period, an influx of knowledge came into Japan. One of the most significant technologies transferred to Japan was architectural knowledge from China.  Chinese influence on Japanese architecture reached its peak during the Tang period, so much so that the Japanese created a replica of the Tang capital, Chang\u2019an (\u9577\u5b89). Tang China The technology, knowledge, and skills to construct these traditional architectures had not been lost and Tang architectures can very well be recreated, but it is the style itself that had fallen out of favour along with the collapse of the Tang dynasty. The Song had a nice run of development, but China soon saw a forceful change of aesthetics with the Mongol invasion. When the Ming dynasty was founded, the Han Chinese aristocrats indeed had an attempt to restore the Tang and Song style architecture, but the new dynasty had to keep on some of the features introduced in the Yuan as a basis.  The Shaanxi History Museum is a passable reconstruction of Tang style architecture, and you can in fact find many more Tang style architectures in mainland China. They are all excellent, but the flavour has changed quite a bit. To be honest, oftentimes it\u2019s just certain features that ruined the aesthetics .  Hong Kong also has several Tang reconstructions that come very close to the original feel, were it not for the highrises always in your face.  However, the architects behind these reconstructions sometimes looked for reference in Japanese buildings, so ironically there\u2019s now some Japanese influence in recreated Tang architectures.

            "answer_text": "Jimmy Liu's answer is only partially correct. He is correct in saying that Japan was not able to implement Tang's centralized political system in the long term. But note that politics is only a small part of the whole package that Japan imported from Tang. And the OP asked \"How much was Japan influenced by the Tang dynasty?\" not how much was Japan POLITICALLY influenced by the Tang. The Tang's influence on Japan was TREMENDOUS. This should be evident to anyone who studied both the Tang and Asuka Japan. The Tang culture that Japan almost wholly imported built the foundation of classical Japanese culture upon which later periods (Muromachi, Azuchi and Edo) developed a distinct Japanese culture. But if you look at almost any aspect of Japanese culture, be it dress, language and literature, philosophy, architecture, customs, just to name a few. You can almost always see the shadow or traces of Tang or earlier Han influence. And this doesn't just apply to Ancient or Medieval Japan, it applies to the Japanese culture today, which would be wholly different without Tang influence. And Japan did absorb a large amount of Chinese philosophy, unlike what Jimmy stated, both prior and during the time of the Tang dynasty. This is why Japan today still embraces Confucian values such as respect for the elderly, social harmony and emphasis on education. And it is ironic to note that many of these elements of traditional culture have disappeared in China, for example, they no longer sit on their legs but use chairs like Westerners while Japaneses have preserved it, most Chinese (afaik) see Ikebana or Tea Ceremony as Japanese practices even though Japan imported them from The Tang. In fact, Chinese culture was greatly transformed soon after the collapse of Tang, in a period known as the Tang-Song Transition, after which many elements of the Classical Chinese Culture were lost or abandoned. If we were to use Western terminology, from Classical Culture to Medieval Culture, this would be akin to the transition from Greco-Roman age to the Middle Ages, that witnessed the shift of Tradition Chinese Culture from that of a nobility culture to one of peasant/commoner culture (which sounds derogatory, but it simply means that the cultural emphasis has shifted from the nobility to the commoners and their everyday life). Being Chinese does not provide any legitimacy to Jimmy answer in any way whatsoever. I'm not Chinese but I have a minor in East Asian Studies, i.e. I spent 3 years learning about Chinese, Japanese and Korean history and culture. ",
