            "answer_text": "Twin Towers - America just didn\u2019t believe it would happen even though all the indicators were there with the perpetrators training at US flying schools and espionage agencies all over the world advising it was going to happen. Piper Alpha - oil rig in the North Sea. The well supplying Piper Alpha was programmed to increase production if the pressure dropped. The pressure dropped owing to the release of oil and gas (which ignited), so the well fed the fire instead of shutting off the production. Would\u2019t have prevented the problem but would have mitigated it. Tanker oil spills - Better training and watch keeping standards. Whilst STCW has tried to do this, shipping carries 90% of everything around the world and it\u2019s difficult to police properly. Even so, rules have tightened up and tanker oil spills are now not common. Deepwater Horizon - various things went wrong which were noticed but no one did anything about it. Texas City refinery - unbelievable laxity in a dangerous environment. Seems most of the operations staff were half asleep over the years it was in operation. In short, all accidents are preventable - even though many of them are in hindsight! The only ones that aren\u2019t are the likes of natural disasters. Typhoon Yolanda - preventable if you move everyone permanently out of the North of Philippines and the Visayas. Not really practical with a population of over 100 million. Earthquakes - such as are experienced every day for the last few months of 2019 in Mindanao. Again nothing to be done other than to weather them as best you can. Pretty obvious why they are known as \u201cActs of God\u201d ",

Cause of disaster an old, unwisely modified and poorly maintained dam/reservoir owned by a millionaire sportsman/fishing club. It was unable to hold after several days of heavy rainfall, releasing over 14 million cubic meters of water when it failed. The club was never held legally responsible. ",
