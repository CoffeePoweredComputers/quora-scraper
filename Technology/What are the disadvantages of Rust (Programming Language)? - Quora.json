            "answer_text": "Here are some disadvantages of rust programming language: it does not have the level of monkeypatching supported by languages like Python or Perl.You cant develop code as \u2018fast\u2019 as scripting languages like Python or Ruby.You will have lots of \u2018fun\u2019 trying to get your code to actually compile.Because it is a new language, people still complain about syntax.its not webscale. /sIt\u2019s usually considered harder to write code that can\u2019t rely on garbage collection, even with the borrow checker helping you.Compared to C++ and especially C, Rust often produces larger binaries and less efficient code; the compiler is also considerably slower. I think Rust can overcome all of these issues in time, but for now\u2026",

            "answer_text": "At the start, let's say that we have more Advantages than disadvantages. And now, we\u2019ll talking about them. 1. IDE. Yeah, we have JetBrains for rust, some editors, etc. But we haven\u2019t equally comfort with them, like we have it with java (eclipse-jee, intellij) or C++ (visual studio, eclipse-cdt). 2. Standartization. Strict standard for this language. Yeah, you may see the pretty documentation with colored examples, but it isn\u2019t the same. 3. If Rust is your first programming language, it\u2019ll be easy for you, in my point of view, to learn it, and used to syntax. But if you\u2019ve already known java/C/C++/swift/python/etc. - you\u2019ll find that the syntax of Rust strange, at least. 4. Big base of development in enterprise systems. 5. When we\u2019ll have about 100k big/completed/succesfull/maintained/proprietary projects in Rust, we can talk about how we can get the profit with the knowledge of Rust. ",
