            "answer_text": "The real question is whether they actually are monopolies as things stand. From a Google perspective, I can\u2019t think of anything other than search that doesn\u2019t have a successful competitive product in their portfolios: Android has iOS, Gmail has Office365, and so on. Even with search, there are alternatives including duckduckgo. With Amazon, their EC2 infrastructure has Azure as a competitor, Amazon music and Video streaming have multiple competitors - but where it starts to get tricky is in the Amazon retail platform and with the Kindle e-reader. There really are no competitors. You could get through the day without using a Google product with no qualitative impact, but Amazon would be harder. From a purely tech perspective, I think the answer is no - but from a consumer retail perspective I think Amazon may need a closer look. ",
