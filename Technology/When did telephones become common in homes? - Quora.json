            "answer_text": "Alexander Bell developed the first phone which could electrically transmit intelligible speech to a distance in the 1870s. By 1880 there were about 48,000 telephones in the US, which had a population of about 50 million, so there was approximately one phone per thousand people. Pretty rare. Few people had seen one or talked on one. Not that commonplace. The exchanges were mostly in big cities, but some private lines were run from a businessman to his office. In 1900 the Bell Company alone had 600,000 phones in a country of 76 million, or one phone per 126 people. Still pretty rare, but most people had some familiarity with them, like seeing one in an office.

            "answer_text": "In Finland in 1917 telephone connection cost half the wages of a telephone operator. Th operator in question could get one only in 1937. In 1971 48% of households had a phone so 50% was reached in the early 70s. Land lines never reached the popularity of mobile phones. Land lines peaked in 1997 when 82% of households had them. Mobile phones passed that already in 2000. In Finland phone companies typically were co-operatives so you got the phone by buying a share of the company. It was possible also to get a rental connection which was more expensive. ",
