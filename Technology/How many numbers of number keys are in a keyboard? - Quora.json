            "answer_text": "Zero to nine - so ten numbers. Of course, there can be multiple key sets. Accountants like a keyboard with a \u201cnumeric keypad\u201d, and the IBM PC keyboard had that, so two sets of \u201cnumber keys\u201d. Some laptops have a \u201cfunction key\u201d that converts part of the keyboard to such a numeric keypad (eg. Dell). Some keyboards have no \u201cnumber keys\u201d at all, and others (eg. Baudot coding) have a \u201cnumeric shift\u201d. Or just letters or other symbols. A morse code sender has no letters or numbers \u2014 just a switch. A four or five finger chorded keyboard also has no explicit letters or numbers. That means: 0, 1, 1 1/2, 2. ",
