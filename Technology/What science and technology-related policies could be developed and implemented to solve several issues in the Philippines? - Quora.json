            "answer_text": "Some suggestions I dreamed up while in Manila: Rent some Tunnel Boring Machines and find Yamashita\u2019s Gold.Establish a Data haven, as forecast in Cryptonomicon. Mostly for off-shore banking.[The suggestions above are straight from the pages of the aforementioned Cryptonomicon. For better of worse, the suggestions below are mine.] While the TBM is still in the country, dig some tunnels for a subway (above sea level, for starters). This might ameliorate traffic conditions in Manila to increase the efficiency of everything.Build a spaceport on the near-equatorial land to lower the cost of launch vehicles.Build an Equatorial Platform aka observatory. Also, be the first (or next) country to claim overhead territory in Clarke\u2019s Orbit. Invite bids to lease the unused slots in the orbit, to other countries.See if NASA needs another deep space tracking station in the Pacific Ocean.Invite the US Military to return to the country on Philippine terms. Once again, become America\u2019s unsinkable aircraft carrier off the coast of China.Expand the Philippine Air Force and Navy, to protect foreign-flagged vessels through the pirate-infested Strait of Malacca. Charge ship owners for the service. If they decline, they bear the risk themselves.In 50 years, invite the Japanese to invest in the country, a la the American example. (50 years being enough time for the WWII ill-will to (literally) die out).Check into the deep-ocean manganese nodule mining industry. The Philippines has a lot of ocean territory. Some of said territory is contested by China. Recover the manganese before they do.Develop and expand the indigenous Jeepney production industry. Expand and diversity in order to compete with auto manufacturers in the Pacific market.Finish construction of the Bataan nuclear reactor and resurrect the Philippine Research Reactor. Reduce the demand for foreign energy.Take advantage of solar energy: build photovoltaic power stations near the equator to further reduce dependency on foreign energy.Solicit bids for semiconductor device fabricators to relocate to undeveloped land.Construct additional fish farms for the export market.Most of these ideas are admittedly far-fetched. But for a country with a high level of education and an ideal location in the world, you should make the most of these opportunities. ",
