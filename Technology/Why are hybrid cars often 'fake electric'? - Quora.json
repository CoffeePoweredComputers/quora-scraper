            "answer_text": "Why are hybrid cars often \"fake electric\"? Because Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) advocates don\u2019t understand the purpose of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), and can\u2019t think of a criticism that correctly addresses that purpose. The main such criticism is that they can't drive very far on eletric power only. The reason it is invalid, is because they can quickly replenish the battery, and do it again. If distance is to be the metric, they can drive between 10% and 50% of a journey on electric alone. One point needs to be made clear: HEVs are electric vehicles. All that means is that they use electric motors for propulsion. There is nothing \u201cfake\u201d about them. But most manufacturers understand that this misconception is prevalent, and so refer to their hybrids as electrified, not electric. BEV advocates want \u201celectric vehicle\u201d to apply only to what are properly called \u201ccharge-depleting\u201d EVs. That is, to those that acquire energy from an external source as charge in a battery. And then deplete that charge in the process of driving. An important measure of a charge-depleting EV, is how far it can drive doing this. HEVs are \u201ccharge-sustaining\u201d EVs. They don\u2019t acquire energy as charge, they acquire it as fuel in a tank. Their strategy is not to use up that charge, it is to maintain an average level of charge, and use it to improve some measure of performance of the internal combustion engine. Usually efficiency. They do this by optimizing the efficiency of the engine, with respect to power and rpms. Traditional ICE cars can only optimize it with respect to rpms, and can\u2019t do that as well as HEVs can. They can also, just like BEVs, use regenerative braking. But this is not the only way to increase charge, and not all that important of a way. What they do, is alternate between two modes. One where they generate more power then the car needs, at a more efficient rate, while raising the state of charge in the battery. Then they use up that charge while using little or no fuel. So the state of charge goes up and down, usually within a small portion of the battery\u2019s full capacity. Some of this may be on electric power only, but how far an HEV can drive on electric power is completely irrelevant. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Because they aren\u2019t used as electric vehicles. Consumers who purchase hybrid vehicles choose to do so based on the convenience of gasoline with added benefit of increased gas mileage. With an upsurge in PHEV\u2019s (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) due to stricter emission rules in the EU and massive subsidies by countries and companies, an interesting fact has appeared. PHEV\u2019s don\u2019t reduce emissions nearly as much as advertised. They, in fact, produce nearly 3 times their rating for emissions. Why? Because owners don\u2019t use them like electric vehicles. Plug-in hybrids called a 'wolf in sheep's clothing' as study claims emissions are higher than thought Hybrid owners simply drive like normal and fill up on gas. Even when the option to charge up on cheaper electricity and gain maximum economic benefit, they don\u2019t really do it. Those hybrid owners who are truly interested in electric vehicles often move on to full EV\u2019s with their next purchase. Owning an EV is a lifestyle change. Range anxiety and charging are main components of the EV lifestyle. Much like 20 years ago most people would have thought it ridiculous to arrange your lifestyle around a phone and keeping it charged, it is mainstream today. EV\u2019s are the same and require a different thought and lifestyle than using a gas powered vehicle, hybrid or not. So while hybrids and PHEV\u2019s may have electrical components such as electric motors and batteries, they don\u2019t require a shift to an EV lifestyle. This is why they are considered \u201cfake\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is because they have a very short all-electric range of just a few miles, certainly less than 10 miles. Those with longer ranges tend to be plug-in hybrids, so short range electric cars with gas engines of ranges of 10\u201320 miles, up to 50 miles in the Chevrolet Volt. The plug-in hybrids are transitional cars. They try to balance fuel savings and clean air against the high battery cost. Hybrid cars are very interesting. They have a small electric motor to do several things for you. It will get the car rolling from a standstill up to about 15 mph then the engine takes over. Doing so bypasses the engine\u2019s least efficient operation speeds. The electric motor functions as a generator when braking lightly which recharges the battery. The electric motor can provide motivation in parallel with the engine because the engine is usually smaller than what would be in a conventional car. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s because hybrid cars are mostly just gasoline powered cars with electric assistance. It helps you save fuel - in my 2014 Honda Accord Hybrid, I got as high as 60 mpg on the highway and 45 mpg in the city, even when I had 4 passengers and a trunk full of stuff we didn\u2019t need. But, chucking in an electric motor alongside an ICE won\u2019t do anything. Most cars actually have electric motors in place, for things like the front and tail lights, and the battery, and the dashboard. If you want a car to be more fuel efficient as a hybrid, it has to actually do something. Most moderate hybrid cars have electric motors to kick in at lower speeds, or while the engine itself is lagging. Although, it is very hard to find a non-plug-in hybrid that has any sort of electric range at all. ",
