            "answer_text": "I\u2019m afraid the short answer is that most teachers do not use technology well because they 1) do not understand technology, both in the larger sense but also in the sense of how to use it, and 2) they are not trained in how to make meaningful use of it in the classroom. Most training that teachers receive in technology use is about how to use a given tool, for example the Smartboard. They are not trained in how to meaninigful integrate the tools into their teaching.

            "answer_text": "I've only had one professor in recent memory that used technology so well that it enhanced the quality of the class. My accounting professor was able to disseminate material and return work to is incredibly quickly due to his facility with technology. Even though I've had one professor who managed to integrate technology very well I have had plenty of excellent teachers. Technology does not necessarily correlate with quality of teaching.  Most teachers I've had have used technology simply to operate PowerPoint...not very exciting and frankly not significantly value adding. ",

            "answer_text": "My basic philosophy is that technology should be used as a tool of construction and not instruction. In other words, technology should become like the pencil in the classroom, not the teacher. The important thing to look at is what direction the information is flowing in its final step. Does it flow from the student to the computer or from the computer to the student. In the end, how is technology used in the workplace? The worker uses it to create whatever it is that he needs to create. When we use technology for instruction, we are not using technology in a way that reflects how it will be used in the student's future life. When the student uses technology as a tool, the student becomes the center of the classroom, the classroom begins to reflect the work place, and knowledge is created not instilled. ",

They post their work on google docs, and can make better powerpoint presentations than some of my clients. They are so much more tech-savvy than me, it's embarrassing. Earlier this year, they even used ipad apps in gym class. Can't imagine what they'll do in high school! So, um, yes, my answer would be yes. ",
