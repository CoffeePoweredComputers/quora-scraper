            "answer_text": "The difference between 2010 and 2020 smartphones is huge. As en example this is a Samsung Galaxy i9000 S for 2010.  This is an iPhone 4 from 2010.  This is an iPhone 11 Pro Max from 2019.  This is a Samsung Galaxy S10+ .  The 2020 phones haven't come yet as of 19/1/2020 but you get the idea. Everything from the inside out, the shape, the size, the abilities of smartphones have all increased in explosive succession. We are and have been for a while at a more plateau now. Similar to the computer industry as they reached that plateau several years ago too. The comparison is also like the computers from the mid 90s with 223 Intels with MMX technology to the i3, i5, i7 Intel cpus today. Everything has changed and gotten better. Today you can buy a low priced phone for around 100\u2013200 dollars and have power on that phone similar to flagships 5\u20136 years ago and they run well. You couldn't do that just a few years ago. A 100 dollar smartphone was barely that, smart. It was crap then and couldn\u2019t even run well at the time. That is how technology of today will trickle down to lower devices later. Devices today have so much power in them from the cameras, the storage options, the graphics abilities, the screen resolutions and clarity, and to the construction that they are literally a computer in your pocket. Many people don't even own a laptop or tower and their smartphone is their only computer and are comfortable with that. So how have they changed, when was the last time you drove your Ford Model T to the grocery store, across the state, or for a motorway spin? When you have and then do the same with a modern BMW, Mercedes, Ford, or other then let me know how much they had changed in their abilities. That would be a similar context. ",

            "answer_text": "The smartphone industry in India is a growing market with around 36 percent of all Indian mobile users expected to own a smartphone by 2018. The global smartphone penetration forecast shows that around 50 percent of mobile users worldwide are projected to own a smart device by 2018. In comparison, 59 percent of Chinese mobile users and 87 percent of U.S. mobile users are forecast to use a smartphone by 2018. As of 2015, 18.21 percent of India\u2019s overall population owned a smartphone, a figure that is set to rise to over 25 percent by 2017. Android was the most commonly installed operating system in India in December 2016, with the Google-backed company holding almost 77 percent of the country\u2019s smartphone OS market share. This increase in smartphone penetration in India is mirrored by the fact that India\u2019s share of the global smartphone market is forecast to more than triple between 2013 and 2017 to reach over 10 percent. In the last quarter of 2016 alone, over 25 million units of smartphones were shipped in India, a figure that stood at just over 10 million in all of 2011. A survey conducted in 2017 showed that 9 percent of mobile users in India listened to music on their phones and 49 percent visited a social network. ",

Every 18months, size will reduce to half and no. of transistors in them would double. So in 10 yrs, size would have gotten to (0.5)^6.67 of size in 2010 No. of transistors pnp or npn must have gone up by 2^6.67 times. But nowadays this time frame for the rule has shrinked. So a good thumb rule is never upgrade your phone for atleast a minimum of 1.5yrs whenever u buy, if you dont want to waste money for nothing much significant increase in its hardware. ",
