            "answer_text": "Some giant data centers consume as much energy as a small town, for power supply systems, cooling systems, network connections and security systems to be functional. They use an estimated 200 terawatt hours (TWh) each year as of now. That is more than the national energy consumption of some countries. Some analysts predict that in the next few years the information and communications technology (ICT) ecosystem would end up using 20% of all electricity used, with data centers feeding on a third of that amount.

            "answer_text": "why do you translate \"20% wind/solar\" to \"20% more expensive\"? in any case, power is an important part of the operating cost of a server farm.  if you take a typical 1U dual-core server, it might list for $3k and run 3 years.  it'll burn about 250W, so will wind up costing about 10% of purchase-price per year.  making that 12% isn't any kind of huge change, though of course no one would pay more by choice.  enabling agressive clock/freq throttling during idle times, or tuning the chillers might well make up for 20% more expensive power.
