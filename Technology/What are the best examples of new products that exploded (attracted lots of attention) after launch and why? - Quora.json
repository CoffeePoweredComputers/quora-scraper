            "answer_text": "Ello. You did, after all, ask which new products recently \"attracted a lot of attention\" and that's something that certainly qualifies Ello.  A few key things drove the Ello onboarding craze: Exclusivity - even the best of us are suckers for the psychological effects of the \"invite-only\" strategy. (Disclosure: I totally fell for it too and skipped to join, as soon as my friend Ana emailed me an invite - I'm https://ello.co/_rebecca). We pretend like we don't care and don't want to be in the club when we aren't invited to be a part of it... but, as soon as someone gives us a glimmer of hope that we might get on the list, we trip over ourselves to run in the door and wave at our pathetic friends still waiting in line. I mean, acquaintances. I mean, I don't even know those people - who'd they come with?Great timing & a great promise - Ello is perceived as \"the anti-Facebook.\" On the heels of Facebook's PR issues with mandating \"real\" names, which put many in the LGBT community on rightful edge (Facebook since apologized: Facebook Apologizes For Name Policy That Affected LGBT Community), Ello claimed to be \"ad free\" and the founder even claims to have \"no exit strategy,\" despite taking nearly half a million in venture funding (see: Why Paul Budnitz Says Ello is Not the Anti-Facebook). The aspirational vision came right as Facebook's perception was floundering.Trendy aesthetic & lots of padding - Looks can be deceiving. An advisor of mine once told me if you make something look really beautiful, the expectations of its functionality are going to be even higher than if you made it ugly. Ello set the bar high with minimalist colors, the still-trendy flattest of flat designs, and (gasp!) serif Courier-like font. How retro! Unfortunately, the product design didn't live up to the aesthetic and Ello quickly disappointed many. A couple articles that illustrate some of the issues in Ello's design:Ello: a design disasterEllo's 5 Biggest Design CrimesEllo might end up being a highly used product, loved by the masses (not just a parking lot of reserved usernames). For now, they remind us that attention, something startups are taught to crave, isn't always good. Especially if your product isn't ready for it.  No one said it better than Public Enemy: Now here's what I want you all to do for meDon't believeDon't, don't, don't believe the hype ",

            "answer_text": "There are many, but I'll give one of my favorite examples. Let's not forget the Tamagotchi!  The Tamagotchi pets, if you don't remember them, were small little electronic pets which you could fit in your pocket.  They had a very simple and clean interface which allowed the user to interact with their own pet.  The idea behind the Tamagotchi was simple, just feed, water, and play with your pet or else it will die!  But the combination of such simplicity and ownership is what got kids hooked.  On top of that, there was in fact a consequence for not doing so.  The pet will die! On a more professional note, the Tamagotchi pets were an ingenious mareketing ploy as they gave the user their own sense of ownership with a feeling of risk.  The Tamagotchi pets played on children's emotions, giving them a need to keep playing. Also consider the demographic, all children (boy or girl) want some sort of companion.  Whether it be a cute doll or a crazy-awesome monster from outer-space.  This ingeniously packed both of those requirements into a sleek package which, of course, was easy enough for a child to use. Even more so, it was cheap enough for a parent to buy for their children without feeling guilty, so children of many different economic demographics could grab it as well and have satisfaction!  From the child who just wanted a friend; to the bossy kid who needed to tell someone what to do.  Even the lonley little girl who just wanted a replacement cute stuffed animal or dolly. I barely scratched the surface on such an ingenious design, but I'd rather keep this short.  Basically, they did everything right. ",
