            "answer_text": "The two space programs have different goals and motivations. Therefore, it's hard to compare their achievements. For example, China has put a man into space with its own technology; Japan has no plans to do so, but instead found a cheap way to send satellites into orbit. Which one is more advanced? China's technology is still largely based on Soviet 1960s tech, but the same can be said for the Russian spacecraft, and the Soyuz is still supplying the ISS just fine, so it's the case of if it ain't broke, don't fix it, rather than being out of date. Both countries have recently put an orbiting probe around the Moon. Both have advanced satellite and space probe research. Currently Japan focuses on precise scientific projects, like the Hayabusa probe, and on more commercial orbital projects, while China's aims are altogether grander: independent communication system, explore the Moon to the point of a manned base, build a space station. So you might compare the Japanese space program to building an iPhone, and the Chinese one to building a mainframe server: both are advanced technologies, but you can't really tell which one is \"better\".
