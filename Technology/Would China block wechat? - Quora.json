            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Would China block wechat? They block several similar services today today. Not all - I use wechat, Skype, and several other IM clients with people in China from the US all the time. But some chat clients are blocked right now.  As for wechat specifically, China will block it if the government believes it is being used to undermine the government in any way.  So do not say anything anti-Chinese-government on wechat! Will they block all chat clients? Possibly. But it would be very difficult technically to block every possible way to chat without blocking, well, everything else too.   EDIT: A couple others have pointed out the company who owns wechat is closely tied with the Chinese gov't. This absolutely makes it less likely China will block wechat. For now. A lot (most?) of China runs on relationships, not the 'rules'. But relationships can change. If power changes hands and someone's brother's cousin's wife's college roommate has a competing service - and greases the right palms (despite that being a capital offense in China) - wechat could fall out of favor. A trivial excuse could be easily found, e.g. a user bitches about the gov't in a private chat, which I am certain happens a lot, and wechat is no longer protected. It could end up blocked, or worse. Seen it happen. I've had 3 companies be suddenly dissolved in China because someone at a competitor had a friend in the right place or someone in the gov't did not like one of the executives. In summary, wechat is not likely to be blocked today. But do not think it is an impossibility anytime in the future.  ",

            "answer_text": "WeChat is a business run by Tencent, one of the biggest Internet companies in China. Also, WeChat has been one of the most successful instant messaging apps on China's market. I doubt the government would block it without an explicable cause. Another thing is, WeChat has been under tight surveillance and control from both Tencent and the government. Both have been cooperating to achieve a 'win-win' situation. That way Tencent could make money, while the government would maintain a good image, if any, of \"supporting innovations\" all over the world. As a matter of fact, What I've been more worried about is Weibo, a Twitter like app popular in China.   ",
