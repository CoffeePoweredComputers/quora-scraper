            "answer_text": "To avoid accidentally downloading any trojan horses or malicious plug-ins, then break into your computer systems, I recommed you to use formal but free software \u2014Syncios Manager, to download videos you want. You\u2019re supposed to copy the videos url from Dailymotioni, next open Syncios Manager, go to its \u2018Video Downloader\u2019 module and paste the url link to the box. Then start to download. By the way, the videos will be downloaded to your computer, so if you want to watch them on phone, you need to use Syncios Manager to export them from computer to mobile phone later. ",
