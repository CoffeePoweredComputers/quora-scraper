            "answer_text": "Internet is not the thing that can be stored as per my knowledge. It\u2019s the term given to global interconnection of devices distributed all over the world using either wired or wireless mediums and started with it\u2019s primitive form what we so call as ARPANET. [Note: World Wide Web(WWW) is mainly used to refer interconnection of web pages distributed all around the world mainly with hyperlinks.] \u201cInternet Access\u201d is the term that mainly refers to our connection with the service providers who link you to global network. In fact, we are paying for the infrastructure and maintenance cost which service providers pay for the leased lines that they are paying for or installation charge of other intermediate networking devices in between. Thus you cannot literally store internet and it\u2019s bandwidth(data transfer rate) but I believe your concern is to store content (music, videos, files, etc.) from the Internet so that you may browse them later in absence of active connection. There are lots of applications that download part of website or even whole website at that instance(static content) as listed below: HTTrack Website CopierGetleftPageNestCyotekWikimedia dumpsIn case if your concern is about technology that store internet so we could access it wherever we are just like a power bank storing power to charge our phone in absence of electricity, i won\u2019t say it\u2019s impossible: IT MIGHT BE FUTURE TECHNOLOGY THAT NEEDS LOTS OF INVESTMENT AND RESEARCH. IF IT HAPPENS SOMEDAY IN FUTURE, BELIEVE IT, THAT WOULD BE A BREAKTHROUGH IN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY. Thanks ! ",

            "answer_text": "No, but... Bandwidth is the flow of something, not the thing itself. When you turn the tap on water comes out but bandwidth isn't the water, or the pipe, it is the size of the pipe and its affect on the flow of water. You can't save up bandwidth because bandwidth is particular to any moment in time. What some people do is download stuff they know they will need later when their connections will be limited. An example of this is that I might want to download a video when I am at home on WiFi, then I can watch it later when I am on the train where connecting might be more expensive or unreliable. In places where internet access is very limited download reference material such as Wikipedia or other educational materials. They can download these in a city, then take that content with them to some remote village that doesn't have internet access, or where it is very slow. The RACHEL-Pi project shows how this can be done: http://Pi.worldpossible.org/ So, you can't save bandwidth, but if you know what you want to watch or read later you can sometimes fetch it now and consume it later.
