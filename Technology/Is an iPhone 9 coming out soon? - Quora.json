The only people calling the next iPhone by that name are the rumor mill and people who are gullible enough to believe rumors without question. The COVID-19 pandemic isn\u2019t having an impact on Apple\u2019s product releases. Just this week Apple released new models of the iPad Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini. And there is no evidence Apple will change the release timing from what previous iPhone models have used. So you can expect the next new model to be released around the same time of year. Finally WWDC hasn\u2019t been cancelled either. It\u2019s simply online-only this year. There will be more workshops than ever for developers this year. Nothing of substance has been cancelled. ",
