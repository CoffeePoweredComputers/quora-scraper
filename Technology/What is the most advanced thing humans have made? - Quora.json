            "answer_text": "These Scientific Discoveries That May Change the World Soon 1. The first successful head transplant surgery  You will probably agree that this piece of news sounds like it was told by someone who returned from the future. But the future is actually now. This is what our scientists are trying to prove. Chinese surgeons, managed by Sergio Canavero, performed the first head transplant from one corpse to another. The surgery took 18 hours and the result was the successful connection of the spinal cord, nerves, and blood vessels. 2.Scientists will find a cure for oncological diseases soon  Modern medical experts are on the way to making people forget the word \u201ccancer.\u201d Of course, it is impossible to cure cancer completely, but it might become as easy as curing a cold. In 2017, several ways of fighting cancer cells have been tested but the most progressive one was the method for treating cervical cancer. Sperm with a special drug were sent to the necessary areas and when it reached them, the sperm emitted the drug. As a result, more than 90% of the cancer cells there were removed. This method allows patients to avoid chemotherapy. 3. Genetical editing to treat a patient  In August 2017 bioengineers changed the genes of a living person. Experts at Oregon University made their first attempt to genetically modify an embryo by removing a gene responsible for the development of an infectious heart disease. The surgery was successful. 4. Chinese scientists cloned a monkey  The first successful cloning experiment happened when molecular biologists managed to grow 2 clones of the same monkey. Born from a surrogate mother, these monkeys have the same DNA. The experiment will help humanity find a cure for cancer, avoid genetically inherited diseases, and clone extinct animals. 5. Israeli eye ophthalmologists invented eye drops that restore the eye cornea.  Can you imagine that very soon glasses for eyesight correction won\u2019t be necessary anymore and their job will be done by regular eye drops? This is what a group of Israeli ophthalmologists are working on. The scientists have already tested the drops on pigs and the result was amazing. The drops are effective at fighting near- and far-sightedness. And according to the scientists, the drops can completely replace glasses. 6.Scientists created a vest that can warn you about a heart attack several days in advance  Smart Vest looks quite simple but on the inside there are special sensors and electrodes. They allow you to track your own ECG, registering blood pressure and heartbeat. And all this is done 24/7. Someone who owns this vest can download a special app on their smartphone where all the data about the heart function will be stored. The creator of this invention says that the application can give a diagnosis and even predict serious heart issues because the abnormal activity of the heart can be noticed on the ECG 2 days before the heart attack. The vest has already been successfully tested on volunteers. Thanks for reading With \u2764\ufe0f DP \u270d\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "The CERN Large Hadron Collider, the largest particle accelerator that tested for the Higgs Boson particle. Confirming its existence and value. Confirming the standard model of particle physics. In future, it may explain dark matter. It cost over $5 billion for its original construction but has since had upgrades. It cost about $1 billion a year to operate. To find the Higgs Boson it cost $13 billion. The next collider will cost $15 billion and be ready in 2050. Currently, the ITER international fusion reactor will also be a very expensive project. It is under construction now and will be finished in 2025. It will use super magnets that are extremely large and will create plasma many times hotter than the sun. It will cost $20 billion. But working fusion reactors are still very far ahead. Decades before we will have practical fusion energy.  Fusion reactors. Much smaller than the ITER.  Down the bottom is a person to scale. This will be an extremely powerful device able to make plasma hotter than the sun. It is a research reactor that may lead to working reactors in the future. Using the same fuel as the sun. Hydrogen but mostly it will be a heavier form called Tritium. The reactor will produce neutrons to make more tritium form hydrogen. This will be far safer and cleaner than any fusion reactor. Only aN MSR or LFTR fission salt reactor can come close. Due to its very high efficiency and fuels it can use. Current enriched Uranium, Pressurised water reactors used today are very inefficient and create to much waste. An MSR reactor could use that waste as fuel. Even using unwanted nuclear weapons material as fuel.              Before that Molten Salt Reactors, MSRs could be in production at far less cost. China is developing a prototype MSR reactor. And other Gen 4 reactors. Prototypes are also being developed. China has in part using US research and designs. MSRs and other Generation 4 reactors are designed to be highly resistant to meltdowns. And have other advantages. China has just started up a gas cooled reactor prototype that is very safe to operate. It can remain safe if power or pumps fail. It can be turned off easily without fear of a meltdown. Some Gen 4 fission reactors will also be as safe and cheaper to build and operate. Using mining and nuclear waste as fuel. This could be a vital option for low carbon energy. And we will be able to buy them cheap from China. Currently, government policies will not allow them to be built in the US. ",
