            "answer_text": "Mostly this problem comes when your OS doesn't have those drivers which is required to run your connected device. I\u2019m covering your query in two Situations : *Situation 1 - If your USB device is a mobile/Smartphone then mostly latest ones automatically identified by the OS as Media device and no problem will be there transferring data between them. But if your device is older then you\u2019ll definitely need a driver to create a interface between your device and your OS. Solution - Search for your mobile/Smartphone drivers on your product manufacturer\u2019s website and download it, install it and then try to connect again. *Situation 2 - If your device is a UFD (USB flash drive). Usually UFD doesn't requires any specific driver to install additionally on computer. Solution - If your device is a UFD (USB Flash drive) then try to connect it to other USB port of your computer. If you have doubt whether your computer\u2019s USB port are damaged then to confirm the problem just try connecting different USB devices to your computer\u2019s USB ports and If none of them will work then definitely your computer\u2019s USB ports are damaged and you\u2019ll need to replace them by your own or from your reliable computer shop.  I hope this might help you :) Feel free to ask!! Thanks for asking! ",
