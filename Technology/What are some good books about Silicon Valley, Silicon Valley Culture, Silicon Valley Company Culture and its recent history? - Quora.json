            "answer_text": "I think the two books that best describe the recent Silicon Valley milieu of the past 10 years in unvarnished, brutally honest fashion are Chaos Monkeys, by Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez and Reset, by Ellen Pao. Both begin as stories of optimistic young people who came to the Valley to participate in the great internet revolution, and reveal their journey as they grapple with difficult realities. Fans of both books tend to fall into somewhat opposing cultural camps, but this is perhaps why the two books together speak some fairly uncomfortable yet illuminating truths about the Valley and what it has become (or always was). Read them both - the stories they tell are richer than what the one-dimensional reviews and critics would have you believe and you\u2019ll find a lot of surprising insight. ",
