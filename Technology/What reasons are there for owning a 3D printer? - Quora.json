            "answer_text": "If you have to ask, probably none. If you need (or want) to make one-off generally small items out of plastic (perhaps pieces for a chess game that you designed to be futuristic looking) then an AM (additive Manufacturing, the official name for 3D printing) system might suit you. If what you want to make requires the strength of metal, though, then you likely don\u2019t want to spend the money on a laser sintering AM machine - better to go to a place that will print as a service.

Lord help us if we run out of resin. ",
