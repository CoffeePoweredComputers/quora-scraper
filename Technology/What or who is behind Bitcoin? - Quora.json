            "answer_text": "Who and what is behind Bitcoin? Satoshi Nakamoto is possibly a pseudonym for an unknown person or group of persons. Who is this person or group? No one knows. I have a few strange things to share with you though. Did you know the internet was developed by the US Department of Defense (DOD) in 1969, known then as Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET).Did you know the DOD with DARPA developed a project called LifeLog. Quoted as having the ability to \"take in all of a subject's experience, from phone numbers dialed and e-mail messages viewed to every breath taken, step made and place gone\".LifeLog was started in 2003 and abandoned in February 2004. FaceBook was started in February 2004.Did you know the DOD along with DARPA developed the Tor anonymity network in early 2000. Tor is used as a means to browse the normal and unindexed internet anonymously. It is commonly associated with illegal things online such as buying drugs.These major steps in information technology all originate within the United States of America\u2019s intelligence and defense agencies. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re behind Bitcoin - but I am saying Bitcoin is a major step in information and financial technology. What do you think? ",
