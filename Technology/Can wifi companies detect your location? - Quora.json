            "answer_text": "Yes. The range of a WiFi base unit is under 100m, and often much shorter if there ware walls in the way. If you connect to WiFi, they know exactly which access point you have connected to. Since the range is so short, they have a pretty accurate idea of where you are. Of course, somewhere busy like a train station that might mean several hundred or even a thousand people are in range of each base station, so the location will not be that helpful. On the other hand, connecting to the WiFi in an otherwise empty restaurant will instantly identify the sole user. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Google was criticised that their street view cars recorded wifi access points locations. A modern multiantenna access point can (theoretically) locate (what a intelligent rock crystal on Star Trek called) \u2018ugly bags of mostly water' from the effects on its microwave signals. Geolocation can also work from knowing which regions ISP's use which ranges of public IP addresses. But normally companies get your location from their app on your phone, where you gave them permissions when installed or upgraded. ",
