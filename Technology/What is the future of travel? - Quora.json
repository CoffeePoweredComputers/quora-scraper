            "answer_text": "I believe that the future of travel, although still being more than 30 years far down the line, lies on self driving cars. Us humans have always dreamed of flying cars because who wouldn't wanna fly? I know. However they just are not feasible and flying a car sized object for hundreds of miles per refuel(charge?) is still nowhere near as cheap as driving it, let alone having that kind of technology available for mass production. I am not even starting on the safety issues... Also, when you think completely analytically (i.e. ignoring the joy of driving a car, deeming driving an undesired activity) driving  is such a waste of precious time in 21st century's busy life. For people living in large cities and commuting to work, more than an hour is lost everyday doing nothing but sitting down behind a wheel trying to make it somewhere. When you alienate yourself from everyday norms and concepts, driving starts to look so primitive! Besides, let's not forget that almost all of car crashes, just like plane crashes, happen because of human error. Us humans seriously are incapable and inconsistent creatures. Machines we make however, although still being a bit inconsistent sometimes due their creators' genes, are not so much. Imagine the time you'd save if your car could drive itself. It's like taking a cab everyday but the driver doesn't talk and it's your personal space. Imagine all the new car cockpits designed to make your life more efficient. Last but not least, most of the traffic jams are due to us humans as well. Self driving cars would keep the traffic flowing at the same pace, connect with each other and help some of them take other routes to prevent traffic. A world in which people don't drive cars sounds too good to be true. I can already imagine an all electric self driving futuristic vehicle that looks so much more different than today's conventional car designs thanks to the shattered need of controlling the vehicle. Cabin could be a tiny bedroom/living room helping you travel large distances overnight without breaking a sweat while you are enjoying a regular night's sleep. (without being nowhere near as bulky as an RV) Hope I live to see those days and live life more efficiently. Sometimes my commutes take more than two hours a day and that is so much time lost. I also think however that driving will stay as a hobby for some people, probably rich. Because we are humans after all. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not an expert, just someone who looks at the future and asks questions about this...because I love to travel across continents and feel my conscience compelling me to not pollute the atmosphere.  So, this is a moderately informed opinion.  From what I understand, air travel in the future is most problematic if fossil fuel is out.  You can drive a car that's electric but a plane that runs on solar energy is pretty limited in the number of people it can handle.   Within a continent, rail travel is the best solution, provided you can get around the hurdles of finance and government.But to go from LA to Hawaii, or New York to England, at some point will be really different from how it is today.  The experts I've talked to say coming up what an alternate fuel is not as easy as it is for land travel. ",

A vacation on Europa would be nice.Interstellar travel will become common in the distant future, unless the human race destroys itself before we can develop the technologies needed. ",
