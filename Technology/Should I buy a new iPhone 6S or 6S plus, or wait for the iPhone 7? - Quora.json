            "answer_text": "If you got the 6S instead of the 7 then you are not missing enough to feel that you made the wrong decision. Unless\u2026 Water resistance, a very quick processor, and stereo speakers are at the top of your lists of needs that fit your lifestyle and what you use your device for. It's also a nice little plus that the 32GB model is now the base storage for the same price the 16GB 6S was. I'm grateful for this since many people don't know what's good for them, and the 16GB 6S\u2019 is not good for any user besides someone who uses their phone solely for mobile calls and texts. But customers who only use their phone for the most basic should purchase an SE or 6 over a 6S or 7 in the first place. I'm thankful I don't have to tell \u201cI told you so\u201d (in my head at least) when a customer comes back to complain and sometimes even try to blame me for letting them purchase a 16 gig (10 available) phone. If you got the 6S or 6S Plus over the iPhone 7+ than I would say that it was a mistake. The 7+ dual camera setup is genius. Having optical zoom and dual image processing technology is magnificently implemented. Auto Portrait mode (auto bokeh) has been many of my clients favorite additions. They are so happy to come show me their professional looking photographs of their children and family and so thankful that I advised them to wait that it makes me feel good and makes my day to see and share my customers extreme passion and that I know I have impacted a clients life in an emotionaly artistic and meaningful way. I really do love seeing my customers come in just to thank me and share with me their precious professional family looking photos and slow motion videos of their children scoring a goal in soccer! The wider color gamut and more vibrant screen also helps show off their photos that they are proud of snapping. The water resistance also adds to some great photo captures in and around water! The Matte Black is my personal favorite (the Jet Black is a fingerprint magnet and scratches much to easily). And the retracted antenna lines make the 7+ a downright gorgeous delight. The sexiest set up in my view is the matte black 7 with the clear/black mophie magnet case with gray magnet accessories (card holder, wallet, battery etc) and titanium luxe glass on the front. The only thing you may miss is the auxiliary port and some consumers complain about the non physical home button. But after following up with some of them, they usually start to prefer it after getting acclimated to the Taptic change. And not to mention that the lightning EarPods including in the case produce better audio for your ears since they are digital over outdated analog audio. Even if you have a pair of headphones you love that aren't wireless and use the general 3.5mm jack you will still be able to use them with the included auxiliary to lightning port adaptor. If you lose them you can get an apple branded product replacement for under $8, and they also offer a aux port/charging cable adapter so you can charge and listen at the same time. The battery life is improved, and it's nice to see Apple\u2019s first foray into releasing a quad core processor on an iPhone. Overall im a little jealous that Apple hasn't offered me an upgrade to the 7 for my vendor device but I'm not going to complain about being given a free 6S 64GB to use. I am going to try to trade in my 6S for the 7+ as soon as they offer it to me. I have never been a phablet or an iPhone plus fan, but the 7+ is a step above any other iPhone. So I hope you are happy with your purchase. All models are great, but the 7+ is possibly the best cell phone to ever be released! Here is the rose gold luxe glass with a beautiful speck transparent rose case on a rose gold 7 that a customer fell in love with tonight. She was not thrilled about getting a rose gold phone at first but it's always a good feeling when you can change their perception with a few good cosmetic additions with accessories.   And my 6S with the Titanium Luxe HD Glass (something quite sexy about that black button surrounded by a silver bezel.  And my space gray 6S \\U0001f615 with the mophie magnet case with my empty business card slots.  A Matte Black iPhone 7 would look much better in that case, but still pretty nice customization.  I guess these photos represent that no matter what phone you get, as long as you have fun with it and make it to fit your own personality, you will enjoy whichever model you purchased. Because the 6S to 7+ will give you an excellent user experience!! ",

            "answer_text": "From the tech blog Chocobospore.org iPhone 7 release date Apple\u2019s pretty predictable in it\u2019s iPhone launches once a year. There was some speculation that Apple was going to change all that but the expectation is that the iPhone 7 will be out in fall 2016. The Specifics(Special Features) The Camera Apple, has one of the greatest smartphone cameras on the market. It seems that for the past three years Apple has been trying to develop an even better dual-lens for the 7. From the rumors, it wouldn\u2019t be ready for the 6s so it would be pushed to being manufactured in the 7.Specifically the camera will use multiple sensors to improve image quality. This means it can measure depth, add a boost to it\u2019s auto-focus or focus pictures after you\u2019ve taken them. It\u2019s going to also be able to look at objects in 3D and give correct measurements, too. Overall it will be a smaller, smarter camera that makes clearer and more defined pictures.iPhone 7c It\u2019s expected that Apple will make new 4\u201d iPhone named 7c. The details claim that AUO is working with Apple to produce new 4\u201d smartphone screens. From the deal, screens will be shipped in the first quarter of 2016, fitting in with a launch later in the year, most likely with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. This information also seems to confirm that the screens will not be ready in time for an iPhone 6c launch, suggesting that we will only get two new handsets this year.A10 chip With a new SoC in each generation of iPhone, it\u2019s assumed that the iPhone 7 will incorporate an A10 chip, after the A9 that is in the iPhone 6. Basically this will mean a reduction in the required size of the components( i.e. more space in the case for more components or a large battery). Secondly, it take less power and battery life will improve. Thirdly, it will not make as much heat and that\u2019s great for running the gadget at a faster speed with better performance. which either means you can get away with less cooling or that you can run the SoC at a faster speed to increase performance. Charging Wirelessly? With the iPhone 7, Apple may also incorporate wireless charging to the iPhone 7; we can all get rid of the Lightning cable yay! The rumours unfortunately haven\u2019t been confirmed, but we\u2019re definitely crossing our fingers on this one. WIth other companies incorporating the feature it seems like the next big step in smartphone development. It is so much simpler and less stressful (God forbid you need to recharge your phone and can\u2019t find a charger or an outlet).Improved Battery Life?  There is a job ad looking for hardware engineers to develop new battery designs and iOS engineers. It can be derived that Apple wants iOS engineers to investigate what drains battery in real-time, and develop tricks to save power.  No Increase in Battery SIze TheiPhone 7 will probably use a consistent battery size, unless there will be extra room for it.  256GB iPhone? Another rumour is that the iPhone 7 would have a storage option of 256GB from the current 128GB max in the iPhone 6. Adding storage to phones would not be cheap and to most people a 64GB handset is sufficient.  Apple may release a 256GB in the iPad before an iPhone debut. ",
