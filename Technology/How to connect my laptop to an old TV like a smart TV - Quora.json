            "answer_text": "While it\u2019s possible to purchase an HDMI-to-Composite Video converter to allow signal to pass from your laptop to your old TV, I\u2019d recommend not wasting your money. If your old TV only has a composite input (the yellow RCA video input), then the TV most likely only has a native resolution of 480i (720x480). Even if you get a higher end converter with a built-in scaler, any resolution that\u2019s moderately useful on your laptop would look pretty horrible on your low resolution TV. The TV\u2019s pixel density just isn\u2019t dense enough for you to get a very sharp image if you\u2019re scaling the signal, especially if you\u2019re planning on reading a lot of text on this TV. If your TV has a YPbPr input (also known as component video and looks like a red, green, and blue RCA), it might support higher resolutions, but it really depends on the age of the TV. This would require an HDMI-to-Component Video converter. One last word of warning. If you decide to ignore my advice and purchase a video converter, make sure that you\u2019re getting an HDMI-to-Composite converter and NOT a Composite-to-HDMI converter. Since you want to convert a digital signal (from your laptop) to an analog signal (on your TV), the circuitry involved only converts the signal in one direction. ",
