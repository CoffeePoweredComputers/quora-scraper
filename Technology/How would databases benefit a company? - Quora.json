            "answer_text": "Let us start with the supposition that data benefits the company. For, without adequate data, the companies would be flying blind. If you are a manufacturer, you need to know what us the outstanding customer orders, what is the current inventory, what needs to be manufactured, what resources are required to manufacture it, what us the available resource, who are the suppliers of resources, what us the lead time to procure resources and lead time to produce what the customer needs . That's just the operations part. The process both requires a lot of data and generates lot of data. Then you have marketing, human resources, finance all of them require lots of information as part of their decision making process. All use data. Now, this data can exist in paper files (like it used to be, some 50 years ago), with an army of clerks to maintain the paper files and tabulate the data as required, spending days in that process. They can be in lots of computer files, be they spreadsheets, text files that are read by disparate computer applications. They still need certain numbers of operators to maintain and anytime information needs to be cross tabulated (like, how much cash is required to procure additional resources needed to manufacture the required quantity of items needed to fulfill outstanding customer order) it involves multiple people from sales, purchasing, manufacturing, warehouse and finance to piece together the information from what they have in their own files. Now that is a tremendously laborious process that is highly error prone and not easily cross checked. Databases are geared to convert information from different sources into a uniform format and maintain it in a centrally accessible location that can answer such requests easily and lot more accurately. They also help perform additional analysis like forecasting demand, determining customer profitability, performance of manufacturing division, projected cash flow and lot more. No wonder databases have become critical components of a company. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it is the heart of any company. They cant even crawl without databases. All companies have in-house database admins or have outsourced database work if they have adapted cloud as a platform to host their databases. How much the technology grows or new technology captures the market and change the industry trends but DATA and Databases(Structured or Unstructured) would always be there. New platforms may be build and you might need to upgrade yourself technically with ever changing database platforms and versions which keeps getting update every 3\u20135 years but industry would need a DB admin. And YES, they are always on the higher side of the salary range when you compare them to Developers :) But then they have greater responsibility and have to think twice before making any changes to production as it is the bread n butter for the company. You can understand if a Bank\u2019s website is down, how much money they would loose in 10\u201330 minutes and would receive so many user dissatisfaction mailers and reputation would be on a toss. In short, companies get benefited by their business and their idea but the Data and Database is the backbone of any company. ",
