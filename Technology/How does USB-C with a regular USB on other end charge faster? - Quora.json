            "answer_text": "By regular USB on the other end, I\u2019ll assume you mean USB-A which is the most common USB interface we use today. USB-PD is spec\u2019d to be able to be done over USB-A at up to 5A and 20V, so you could easily have a charger that supports that, but you\u2019d want to use a dedicated USB-A to USB-C cable with wiring that\u2019s going to support that 5A current. That said, that\u2019s not going to be common. What is fairly common is chargers that support IQ fast charging and USB-A port, which means they\u2019ll do 9V 2A or 18W charging on devices, though those devices aren\u2019t limited to USB-C, plenty of micro-USB devices and iOS devices with lightening plug support IQ fast charging as well. The charger and device are going to dictate it\u2019s charging speed capabilities not the cable that\u2019s going in between. ",

            "answer_text": "You mean regular USB type A on other end, in this configuration You need to understand the pin configurations for both the USB type A 2.0 has 4 wires or bus from the name Universal Serial Bus with 1 +vcc 2 Data 1 ground wires USB type A 3.0 has 9 total with 4 lines same as type A 2.0 for backwards compatibility and 5 additional lines The USB nomenclature now is very confusing as gen 2 and gen 3 goes And type C is a standard with 16 lines with no way to figure out if that's a fast charge or turbo charger with little \u26a1symbol for both fast or thunderbolt port type C The lines in few type C ports are high power lines capable of powering a display with the display signal both on the same cable But if there is USB type A port on other side with only two power lines it will not be utilizing it's full potential but will charge the phone as desired by the manufacturer ",
