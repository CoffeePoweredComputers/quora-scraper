            "answer_text": "Swear down, it\u2019s a pain in the ass. I am majorly left behind. I\u2019m STILL stuck on the 360. And even on Black Friday/Boxing Day sales, it\u2019s still tons of money to buy one. I got my 360 two years ago for \u00a3110, bear in mind this was when Ones and One S\u2019s were still gradually crawling up the market. Now, considering the One X has been out for a month or so, the One is still too damned expensive. In the UK they don\u2019t seem to sell the console by itself for under \u00a3200, and the bundles start at \u00a3250-ish. BUT in the USA, they sell consoles (with no added games) for $199 (\u00a3148)! Makes no sense at all. I really don\u2019t want to get a second hand one, cos then if something goes wrong then I\u2019m screwed. I know that quite a lot of people are still on 360, and no, I\u2019m not stuck on it cos I don\u2019t have a job. I have a part time job, as a paperboy in a small village, and get \u00a315/week and every two weeks or so I don\u2019t have the wages as I use it to get to a football match (at a club where I am a season ticket holder) and no matter how much I save, I still end up falling short by the time Black Friday comes around and am still short by the end of BF. Why can\u2019t they just reduce the price on the old Xbox One, cos that has been out for 4 years now, then, they\u2019ll get more sales from 360 players who finally have the chance to upgrade. Apologies, this was more of a rant than a question. But still, reasons why Microsoft won\u2019t put prices down would be nice ",
