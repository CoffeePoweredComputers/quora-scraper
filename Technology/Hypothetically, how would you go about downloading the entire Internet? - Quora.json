            "answer_text": "Disclaimer/confirmation: Since I am the 'hypothetical' best hacker for the situation, not all the stuff can be explained in the easiest way.I am allowed to use current technology available and there are no restrictions on what tech I can buy and get with the provided money.I am not responsible for downloading the dark web or any sites that are inappropriate or illicit/illegal. Those companies/websites are solely responsible for their own behavior since I do not support themWhile the NSA is unable to stop the virus, I would imagine they are putting all the efforts in to slow it down so that it doesn't get rid of the whole internet in one day.Method: Get a list of all the IP addresses of all the good sites of the web including those to servers and storage for websites.I would use the provided money to buy a HUGE server room. Maybe somewhere around 1000 zetabytes of data.Start our by using software to download contents of servers and storage devices that the websites rely on.Next download websites , if they were not downloaded already by websites..All the servers where the internet is being download are highly encrypted and are only accessible through tough security enforcement .After all the download is finished I would reorganize everything and make sure that everything is ready to reupload after the end of the virus.I hope that gives a good view of my plan of it. Like I said, lot of this is very brief and explained in simper terms. Thanks for reading. ",
