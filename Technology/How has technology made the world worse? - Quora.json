            "answer_text": "Technology is not ruining our world, we are. There is no point in blaming the tool; if there is blame, it is attached to the user. In fact, we could not live without technology, given our enormous and ever expanding population as well as the fact that so many of us live in huge cities. One may think of technology as the TV, the laptop and the cell phone, but it is also and especially the truck that brings our food and other supplies to the city and the store where we buy such. It is the plane that brings professionals to share information and the trade negotiators to arrange the wherewithals of supply. It is the electric cables and the sewers, without which we would live short and nasty lives. It is the vaccines and medications that enable us to prevent or treat illness. Tech is essential to our continued survival; if the tech lapsed, most of us would be dead. So what is ruining the world? it is what we do with some of the tech, perhaps with all of the tech. We adapt the tech to weaponry and destruction. We misuse it by creating complex, badly engineered, lacking quality control products because failure means repair or replacement, and repair or replacement mean greater profit. It also means increased requirement for and usage of irreplaceable resources, greater wastage, more energy converted into heat, and therefore ruin for the earth and extinction for us. But please, do not be misled. No nuclear bomb cried for its production. No balky fridge or washing machine asked to be made badly. No auto wanted to be fitted with an unreliable transmission, air bag or inefficient engine. No computer wept for a bloated, fractious system replete with bugs exploitable by hackers that is updated mostly for the benefit of advertisers but does little for ordinary users who hate the ever changing configurations. The tech has nothing to say; we do all the talking, do all the doings, make all the mistakes, and bring closer to ourselves the inevitability of ruin. Tech is not our enemy, it is our benefactor and life saver. As Pogo once said, \u201cI have seen the enemy, and he is us\u201d. ",

It's Not Just Beards \u2014 the Whole World Is Covered in Poop \u201cThe Journal of Applied Microbiology, co-authored by Gerba, examined the kitchens and bathrooms of 14 homes over 30 week. \u201c The results were about the opposite of what you might expect:\u201cThe highest concentrations of faecal coliforms \u2026 were found in the sponge/ dishcloth and in the kitchen sink drain area while the lowest concentrations were found on the bathroom counter top, on the bathroom floor and on the toilet seat,\u201d the authors write. Also, the cutting board you use to prepare your beautiful, Instagram-worthy meals is likely filthy, too. Gerba has said the cutting boards he\u2019s tested have, on average, about twice as much fecal bacteria as what\u2019s found on toilet seats.\u201d your phone is pretty gross: A recent study from London School of Hygiene &Tropical Medicine researchers found fecal matter on one in six cellphones they swabbed. That same study found fecal bacteria on 16 percent of the 390 hands tested. \u201cThere\u2019s about a tenth of a gram of poop in the average pair of underwear,\u201d Gerba once told ABC News\u201d \u201cThere are 99.000 deaths each year in USA from HAI.\u201d \u201cIn the presence of an antimicrobial, microbes are either killed or, if they carry resistance genes, survive. These survivors will replicate, and their progeny will quickly become the dominant type throughout the microbial population.\u201d The more the microbes are the bigger the chances for them to develop drug resistance.
