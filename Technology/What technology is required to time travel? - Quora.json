            "answer_text": "A lot of energy to push a rocket ship to the speed of light. I wrote these out to help, these explanations, and thought experiments might help you with this specific question. If you have a time machine, you need to be able to lock up the time period you left from causality effects, effecting it. Imagine if the time machine you had could move things from the past, from the future. Move a quark out of place in an atom in a grain of sand, on a beach 1000 years ago. Something as little as this, is enough to change the whole history of the earth from that point on. If you watch videos on the grandfather paradox it is a misconception that you can have enough time to stand in front of him to pull the trigger, let alone have a conversation with him.  You cannot go back in time and get the winning lottery numbers, you cannot kill Hitler, stop Pearl Harbor attack, you cannot save JFK, or stop September 11th. Even if you went back in time short term like 1 minute into the past, ripple effects of causality would travel right from you, right up to the guy who presses the button to start the lottery machine. Basically the lottery numbers would be different every time you went back in time to get them, you could win the lottery this way, but by chance accident only. You can only change these things if the time machine can lock up causality effects (keep the time period you came from from causality effects effecting it) But the changes would never count in reality you came from, just the other dimension you went back into, and messed around in. If a machine can do something as amazing as recreate the past, then locking up causality should be no problem for the time machine to do. Maybe people from the future go into the past in the technique I described above, or have the technology to view the past from the future on a television monitor, without causing any causality effects. These are the only two ways I can think of that do not effect causality.  In the diagram above just imagine timeline 2 is the recreated past in another dimension, where anything you do, and change does not effect time line 1, the timeline where you came from. SO after doing what you wanted to do in time line 2, you just go back into timeline 1, a second after you left to be safe, because the same matter cannot occupy the same space. In another causality experiment I thought if its the interactions with people, and other things which cause causality, then what if you went back in time into a solid thick steel container, that was buried ten miles deep down in the in moons crust, it would be one mile thick in every direction up, down, left, right, forwards, and backwards. So if you go back in time into the container on the moon, it should not create any causality effects, because you do not interact with anything. The ripple effects of causality have been subdued. There would be dampening systems in the container to stop your vibrations, but it may not be enough, and not work at all. Just interacting with the air molecules could be enough to cause causality, even the space in the container. Dark matter, and energy is still not understood, and time travel into the past into the steel container could have an effect on the way dark matter, and dark energy effect other objects, to maybe cause causality.  Unless the aliens have a time machine, but they are not going to share, because we are about money, greed, exciting our excitatory neurotransmitters, and power, and cannot be trusted, even if we can understand the time machine technology they created, if explained to us by them.  Aliens explaining how their time machine works to us, It might be like explaining calculus to a ape. Maybe we are just not smart enough to understand it. The most visited place by a time traveler if possible, would be the bookstore depository where Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK, or the Dinosaur period.   Maybe there is some clues around there of future time travelers, especially in the Zapruder film of JFK being assassinated.   Some people think this lady present at the JFK assassination is a time traveler, they call her the Babushka Lady. Some people think time will stop, or reverse when the speed of light is broken. I think that time would continue to stretch with time dilation. Speed of Light (c): Light travels at a constant speed of 1,079,252,848.8 (1.07 billion) km per hour. That works out to 299,792,458 m/s, or about 670,616,629 mph (miles per hour). That is just a random number. If you could see a light clock, on a light beam exceeding 670,616,629 mph, I doubt you would see it freeze, and stop, but this is my opinion, I could be wrong. As for going back in time, by exceeding the speed of light, I doubt that would happen also. If you could see the behavior of a light clock as it travels at the speed of light. You would see the the beam move from the top of the clock to the bottom, and back to the top again, to complete 1 second, as the light clock moves forward through space. If you are not familiar with what a light clock is you can see how a light clock works in this video below, you can skip to 20 minutes, and 30 seconds to see the explanation about how a light clock works.  So you see the light clock create a V shape, as it moves from the top to the bottom, and back to the top again. So no matter how fast you are going the V shape is just going to get longer, and longer as speed increases, from point A to point B, even if the distance from point A to point B is googolplex long amount of distance in light years. The V shape of the light clock, would never stop growing longer as speed is constantly increased, or stop, or reverse, why would it, it can't. Even if it takes a googolplex amount of time in light years for the light clock to move vertically by 1 cm, time has not stopped, message me if I am wrong. In this other thought experiment it is possible to double the time dilation rate you would get, because it is not possible to travel faster than the speed of light. I emailed the thought experiment to a physicist at Princeton University and he confirm it to be correct. He said \u201cI was free-styling with the laws of physics.\u201d Now this though experiment is totally impractical, and just as impossible from happening as traveling faster than light, but it is a way of doubling the time dilation rate. Say there are three identical twins, called twin A, twin B, and twin C, and they are all the same age 20 years old. Twin C lives on earth, twin B is on a rocket ship traveling at light speed, and twin C is in a small rocket ship, small enough to fit inside twin B\u2019s larger rocket ship. If twin B travels for 1 year at the speed of light in his rocket ship, from twin B\u2019s perspective his brother, Twin A on earth will be 70.4 years older because of time dilation. So after the trip twin B is going to be 21 years old, and twin A is going to be 90.4 years older. Now this is the complicated part, imagine for a minute that twin B\u2019s rocket ship is really big, and long horizontally, long enough for his brother twin C to travel at the speed of light inside of twin B\u2019s rocket ship, in a westerly direction. So what is going to happen is that twin C is being already carried at the speed of light, in twin B\u2019s rocket ship in the north direction, so as he travels at the speed of light in a westerly direction he is getting double the time dilation rate. Remember twin C is already being carried at the speed of light, as he travels at the speed of light in the westerly direction inside twin B's rocket ship, this it what doubles the time dilation rate. Or you could just imagine the blue circle below is the path twin C traveling at the speed of light in long circles inside a very large, and very long horizontal space ship if this is easier.   If twin C travels for a 1 year from his perspective, his brother twin B is going to be 90.4 years old, and his brother on earth twin A is going to be 160.8 years old. If twin A could live to be 160.8 that is. Totally impractical, but it works, and it is a way to double the time dilation rate without traveling faster than light. In this last causality thought experiment which really cannot be confirmed to be correct. Imagine a really long line of people, standing on a platform, stretching from earth to Pluto.   At there closest Pluto is 2.66 billion miles away from earth, it would take light just over four hours to get to Pluto. So the last person in this huge line of people would be standing on Pluto, if you placed a camera on the last person, at say 12:00pm, and recorded exactly what the person was doing, for say 1 minute. So if you went back in time to 11:55am, to the front of the line of people on earth, and you did something different, like say hello to the first person in the line. Would the ripple effects of causality travel through the whole line of people from earth to Pluto instantly? So at 12:00pm the last person in line who is standing on Pluto would the person be doing different things, than before in the 1 minute camera recording. If you you recorded the persons new actions on camera for a 1 minute would they be different, or exactly the same? You going back in time has sent ripple effects of causality through all those people, right up to the last person in the line, for the person to be doing what he was doing differently. The point is this is a instant change, in a straight race between the speed of light, and causality effects traveling through people, and other objects, from going back in time, are ripple effects of causality faster? So ripple effects are they faster than light? Causality ripple effects are an invisible force, but they do have an effect on things. Things like dark matter, dark energy, air, gravity, sound are all invisible but you can see the effects of them on things. So why are causality ripple effects no different, the change of what the last person in line was doing, after going back in time, is proof of a change, and an effect on something even though the force is invisible. So what's faster the speed of light, or ripple effects that travel through people from going back in time, and changing something. What do you think? Short term time travel though like 10 seconds into the past, I am unsure about the outcome, in this thought experiment it might help you. The time is 11:45 a.m. a time traveler decides to visit himself in the past, he would go into the past at 12:00 p.m. exactly, back in time to 11:50 a.m. He would go back in time from across the room from himself, (because both time traveler's cannot occupy the same space). So at 11:50 a.m. he knows that he will see another copy of himself appear from the other side of the room. But he says to himself before the time travel experiment, that no matter what happens, it must be set in stone that he must go back at 12:00 p.m, because if he does not, who is the other person standing across the room from him. So can the time traveler visit himself, have a conversation with himself for less than 10 minutes, before going back in time. I am unsure to what's the answer? Will time and space, not be able to handle this paradox, and causality would instantly kill him.Causality would thrust him instantly somewhere else, but not kill him.If it is allowed a endless loop would be created, where time would never go past 12:01 p.m. ever. Because it was set in stone that the time traveler would always go back in time at 12:00 p.m. no matter what happens. So what the 4th possibility.Orbiting a black hole to time travel into the future is a lot safer than using a neutron star, because of gamma waves, would be tearing your rocket ship apart, and there would be a problem with the landing, because the fastest-spinning neutron star ever found has been discovered in a crowded star cluster near the center of the Milky Way, a new study reveals. The star rotates 716 times per second, and has an escape velocity of about 33% the speed of light. Which means that any object caught in a neutron star\u2019s gravity would be accelerated to a tremendous speed. If you are not ripped apart during your descent (you would be), all of your atoms would most likely be destroyed upon impact, for the most part you would be turned into a pile of neutrons. It just is not possible to make a man made neutron star, to then keep adding matter to it to cloapse it into a black hole, to try and use the black hole as a natural time machine. Because there is just not the means on earth technologically, to force electrons, and protons into neutrons to make a man made neutron star. Like a medium sized star does with its strong gravity. Then there is the problem of getting the material to build a neutron star. There is more material (atoms) in a 20 kilometer neutron star than all material in the solar system. Let's say you could get enough material, and force it together with enough force like in a medium star, to make a fairly small stable peice of neutron star matter, you could park it next to a star to get the rest of the material to grow in mass, to collapse it into a black hole. The material from a star would be neutronified, by the small peice of neutron stars gravity, and the neutron star matter would grow in mass, then collapse into a black hole. This is probably the closest thing humanly possible to ever to building a time machine, and even then its impossible to do currently. Even then you would only be able to time travel into the future orbiting the black hole. There is also this YouTube video below, of Stephen Hawking explaining how to a black hole can be used to time travel into the future, by orbiting the black hole. Also look at Ronald Mallet's idea for a time machine on in the YouTube video in the link above, but it can only send information back to the point when it was switched on. Hope this helps.  ",
