            "answer_text": "I think I came in when technology made its biggest gains in the classroom. My first classroom had a 1993 computer and a blackboard. That was literally it aside from 40 desks. This was in 1999. By the time I reached the school where I currently teach in 2001, technology had massively improved. I had a computer from 1994, a whiteboard, and a 24\" CRT. My classroom now has an desktop (2010), a laptop (2010), a whiteboard, a mounted LCD projector, and usually has 36 touchscreen laptops in a mobile lab which I share with my building (2014).  How has that changed teaching? Let's compare: Back in 1999, when we were learning about mythology in order to prep for The Odyssey, I had no way of giving my students any visual stimulation aside from a handout made on Office 95. It wasn't pretty, but it got the job done. I made a huge mural on my blackboard in colored chalk depicting the various pantheons. In upcoming years, I would have access to a color printer which I'd use to create overhead sheets for use on an overhead projector. When students wrote a research paper, they wandered the library, looking for books which would work for their papers. They would hit the encyclopedias. They would often hand-write their papers and then type them up in the computer lab, print them, and receive (in my case illegible) hand-written feedback. A lot of computer labs weren't even online; they were just networked to a printer. Students had no access to their grades aside from me. They had to take their grades on faith. Some teachers were still hand-calculating their grades. Attendance was taken on Scantrons.  In 2016, I have access to a lot of presentation software and a mounted projector. Some classrooms not only have LCD screens, they have touch boards or Smart Boards. I can throw a presentation together in a few minutes and throw it up on the screen within moments. With Google Docs, I have the ability to keep that presentation forever, plus I can publish it to my website. I have access to YouTube (which is now, thankfully, unblocked) which has lots of great educational resources. My students also have access to presentation software, which is a far cry from those old poster boards.  Writing a research paper is now easier on them, but that just lets me require more. Papers are written completely online via the cloud. I no longer accept encyclopedias now, since it's so easy to go to EBSCOHost or Google Scholar to find real information. I would argue that our ready access to the internet has changed our initial starting point in the learning conversation so that encyclopedias have less of a place in a high school paper. Papers are now submitted through an online plagiarism checker which also has grading, peer review, and reflection plug-ins. I can verbally record feedback, which massively increases my speed. Finally, my ability to reach parents and students with information is practically limitless. I routinely text students to remember assignments, tests, and materials. I have a CMS which handles parent and student communication, publishes materials and educational links, and allows students to look at their grades. On a final note, my students also have access to Quora, which is pretty useful for some of our AP assignments.  But it isn't all a bed of roses. We have technology overloads. Students often think a research paper is a matter of copying and pasting from various websites. Cell phone abuse is rampant, and then there's the issue of what Google does to our ability read in depth.[1] These are just new challenges, though. Good teachers adapt.

            "answer_text": "Really short answer:I spend far more time managing technology than using it. Short answer- It has completely altered classroom management.  Technology is so user friendly that it has degraded computer literacy. And access to technology has negatively affected attention span.  My answer may veer into a tangent of how technology has changed students and how to teach them because of those changes. Disclaimer- I love technology.  I wrote this post on a computer I built myself that runs two operating systems.  I am starting a robotics team right now for this upcoming fall season.  My time in the classroom is with students with behavior problems.  I see the worst of technology. On the classroom management end of things technology has made teaching far more difficult.  Disagreements that would be left on the streets or in the hallways filter into class through social media posts.  Students send each other nudes and my instruction has been interrupted by naked pictures of a female being texted to all the males in a class.  Early research is showing that cellphone/technology addiction is similar to drug addiction in many ways.  Their fix is right there in their pocket.  I wasn't able to find a peer reviewed article backing that up at this time-but the rehab industry is marketing to cell phone/technology addicts. Cell Phone Addiction Similar to Compulsive Shopping and Other Behavioral Addictions  The pragmatic reality of classroom technology is that at this point I feel that classroom techology so good that students do not need computer literacy to use it.  The districts I have worked in use chromebooks.  Chromebooks save files automatically and do not require knowledge of how to navigate a file system.  I would venture to say that 40-50% of the students I work with cannot save a file in a folder on a hard drive and retrieve it later.  Most time is spent in web based applications and often students do not learn offline applications.  I graduated high school in 2002.  To watch movies I had to build a computer with a video card (after making the money) and download the movies.  To get to pornography I had to sneak around AOL parental control (it wasn't literally of the girl next door appearing unsolicited in my inbox).  These actions made me learn how to USE computers, not just surf the web. Most of the students we have now have had access to tablets since early ages.  I believe that access to this technology at an early age skews children's sense of both reality and time. This is a common opinion among teachers. How Teens Do Research in the Digital World.  I am waiting for some solid research to quantify shorter attention spans among the tablet generation.   How does technology affect my teaching?   When I am not cleaning up the messes that social networking creates or yanking cellphones out of kids hands, I use technology occasionally.  I use my smartboard, it's nice to  have.  I put students on computer based intervention systems for math and reading.  Today we used youtube to learn how to build a lithium ion cell phone charger.  But I spend far more time managing technology than using it. ",
