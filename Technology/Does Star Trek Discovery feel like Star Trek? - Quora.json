            "answer_text": "Does Star Trek Discovery feel like Star Trek? Through most of season 1, I had grave doubts. By the end of season 1, I was wondering if DIS had dug a hole too deep to get out of with its freshman season being dedicated to a Mirror Universe story arc. That might have been a bold stroke if it had been done well, but, it wasn\u2019t. In fact, just about any fan of Trek could\u2019ve pointed out the major pitfall in using the MU that early: The point of the Mirror Universe is to compare and contrast beloved characters and traditions in Trek with their Bad Guy versions in an alternate dimension. Trying to do that with a new set of characters and traditions just robs the whole idea of exactly that: Its contrast. So when the USS Enterprise showed up at the end of the last episode of the first season, it was a declaration of Make or Break Time. The TOS Enterprise is the single most iconic symbol in Trek. Bringing it to the forefront meant that DIS was either going to put up or shut up and skulk away in shame. The latest episode, \u201cAn Obol For Charon\u201d is what\u2019s known in Trek as a bottle episode because all of the action takes place aboard ship. Back in the 60\u2019s that was a way of saving lots of money. All they needed was the standing sets, a guest star or two and the actors they already budgeted for. And the typical motivator for a bottle episode in Trek is to introduce a threat to the ship and off we go with all the main cast of characters getting to show their mettle in the face of existential threat. Obol is not exception but the threats are multiplied and go from something that grabs the ship out of warp that trashes the entire computer system to blob that wants to eat a crewman\u2019s face with a little fugitive Spock, alien-pal-dying thrown in. Ok, SPOILER WARNING. If you haven\u2019t watched the episode, stop reading here. You know that this old Trekker gives it a thumbs up without knowing any more than what the previews showed. I doubt I am the only viewer who knew that Saru wasn\u2019t going to die. It\u2019s the old bit where no matter how dire the circumstances, yeah, no, the studio didn\u2019t invest all that money on practical effects to make the already-a-bit-alien Doug Jones into a Kelpien only to toss him into a dumpster. The one bit of FX that did bite the dust was his ridiculously spastic and creepy Death Fringe that popped out any time he sensed a threat. Good riddance. Along with losing the stupid fringe he lost what was supposed to be a racially-disposed tendency to cowardice, a move that was done to effect in that it worked both as major character growth and a bonding moment for two of the leads of the series. Maybe the first season writers never read Larry Niven\u2019s Known Space stories and so weren\u2019t aware of the Pierson\u2019s Puppeteers, Niven\u2019s alien species of herbivores who value safety and security over all. If they had they might\u2019ve had a better idea of how to sell an alien species of innate cowards as something other than marginally useless explorers. And if they had they would\u2019ve seen that job one in introducing such a species is to justify how individuals of that species might be motivated to set aside their own safety and security for the greater good. The Short Treks mini-episodes laid the ground work, but not nearly enough. Obol did a much better job. Another common gambit in Trek is to introduce this Big Scary Thing to threaten a planet or, in this case, a ship, and then have it turn out to be, if not completely benign, then at least understandable in its actions. They didn\u2019t entirely make clear how a big organic object in space could gather information on, well, anything over the course of 100,000 years, but that was what the expository lumps declared, so, I guess that was in keeping with tradition too. A few lines of dialogue finally paid a little service to retconning the differences noted in DIS over TOS canon, in ways that were far, far better than the previous \u201cOh, by the way, Klingons shave their heads when they\u2019re at war,\u201d stab at it in earlier episodes. If I remember correctly, Pike made two references, one a seeming matter of preference, the other a ship\u2019s captain\u2019s declaration of \u201cGet that damn nonsense off my ship!\u201d when it came to hologram communications. So that\u2019s why TOS\u2019s Enterprise has viewscreens, not holograms. Tilly\u2019s psychotic eye and ear worm ups the stakes in why the spore drive is unknown in TOS, but in kind of a hamhanded way when the parasite declares that its use is mucking up the spore environment. Stamets jumping on board with, \u201cOf course we\u2019ll stop. Right now!\u201d was a bit too much of a jump to the foregone conclusion, especially given that it\u2019s been established that, officially, Starfleet is way, way more cynically pragmatic when it comes to magical wish machines. They had no problem when it was going to kill a giant tardigrade or even a human navigator or even if it could inadvertently take a whole ship\u2019s crew to the MU. Overall, this episode had Trek written all over it in terms of both character and storylines. The showrunners appear to be dialing in the changes awkwardly. It\u2019s almost like the TOS movies writ small with every other episode marking time with the rest making admirable improvements. But then every Trek series has had that problem at some point. ",

            "answer_text": "What does Star Trek \u201cfeel\u201d like? Star Trek the Next Generation and the Original series certainly \u201cfeel\u201d very different from each other. The sets, the special effects and even some of the themes are extremely dated. Turnabout Intruder is an episode where they imply that women in Starfleet can\u2019t be captains. Star Trek, one of the most progressive science fiction shows out there, did not allow women to captain a ship some 200 years in the future. Think of all of the ways that Next Generation is different from TOS. The temptation to make a version of the Original Series with better special effects must have been almost overwhelming. Instead of a dashing ladies man, our captain is a stuffy renaissance man from France (with a British accent?). And you\u2019re telling me no one suggested that there should be a Vulcan somewhere on the bridge? Why do the Klingons look different? What\u2019s with the uniforms? Why did the colour for \u201ccommand\u201d change? If there was an internet for people to rant on fans would have definitely said that the show didn\u2019t \u2018feel\u2019 like Star Trek.  And then you have Deep Space Nine. If anything didn\u2019t feel like Star Trek it was that. It was on a space station instead of a ship. Cultures came to them, instead of being discovered. There was a war, there was gray morality. The show had a lot more serialized storylines. The uniforms changed again (Why is Starfleet so self-conscious about their uniforms?). Oh yeah, and there were a lot of space battles. Had Gene Roddenberry been around for the finale his head would have exploded. Surely this war torn galaxy didn\u2019t feel like the \u201cWagon Train to the Stars\u201d utopia he had originally envisioned. But, DS9 is regarded by many as the best, or at least the most complex, Star Trek series.  The Star Trek movies certainly had a more militaristic feel to them with their new uniforms and submarine like ship interior. Voyager did a kind of lost in space thing. Star Trek Enterprise jumped on the prequel bandwagon and certainly tried to \u2018feel\u2019 more like Star Trek with a Vulcan first officer and \u201cCaptain\u2019s Best friend\u201d with a southern twang. And that is the least successful Trek series so far. The effort to change things up is what I think makes Star Trek so enduring. It never does the exact same thing twice. (*looks scathingly at Force Awakens*). When they make a new Star Trek show, they need to find a new angle. Think of Force Awakens. Luke Skywalker, a desert dwelling kid with an ominous destiny becomes Rey, a desert dwelling kid with an ominous destiny. Switch Vader for Kylo Ren, switch Grand Moff Tarkin for General Huxley, BB8 for R2 etc . . . This is lazy and boring. This is why I haven\u2019t bothered watching the Orville. My understanding is it just retreads territory that has already been covered by Next Generation. That\u2019s not to say that it might not be good, but I\u2019ve already seen Next Generation and if I wanted to watch a show that \u2018felt\u2019 like Next Generation, I would watch Next Generation again starring Patrick Stewart instead of Seth Macfarlane and spare myself MacFarlane\u2019s shitty dick and fart jokes. What makes a Star Trek show or movie feel like Star Trek? Well, it has all of the trappings of a space opera, with alien races throughout the galaxy dealing with various conflicts. Star Trek always wears its progressive politics on its sleeve, at least progressive for its time. It\u2019s about different cultures trying to get along. It\u2019s about how can we make things that don\u2019t work, work better. How can we improve life for all beings while being reverent of their culture? Those things are all in Discovery. And like any Trek series, Discovery tries some new things. The main character isn\u2019t the captain. The character of Michael is like a first officer in that she always goes on adventures but she also has elements of the \u2018outsider\u2019 character like Spock or Data because of her strange Human/Vulcan heritage. They updated the special effects and changed the Klingon makeup again. The show deals with a central conflict. But, they go back to some Star Trek staples like the mirror universe, Klingons, Vulcans, Starfleet . . .  Don\u2019t get me wrong, the show has its problems! But I actually like it for the most part. And anyone who\u2019s being honest with themselves wouldn\u2019t hold the first two seasons of Next Generation in very high regard. Even later seasons of Next Generation had 8 or maybe 12 good episodes if you\u2019re being generous. DS9 had a rough time getting out of the gate but it built to something that is my favourite Star Trek and easily one of my favourite television shows of all time. Season 2 of Discovery already improved on a lot of things that didn\u2019t work in the first. They kind of transition from the main storyline to do shows that feel more like the traditional one-offs of earlier series. They try to dwell more on other characters. It\u2019s all a step in the right direction but they don\u2019t do any of these things consistently enough. I have no idea what to expect from season 3 as they left our crew in a very strange situation. But for anyone who\u2019s been watching, we can all agree that Christopher Pike played by Anson Mount is the best thing about Discovery so far. I think it would be crazy if they didn\u2019t bring Pike, Spock and the Enterprise back in some way. Make Michael and Co. part of the Enterprise crew. Or just make a new Star Trek series starring Pike. But, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten that good stuff, if we hadn\u2019t given Discovery a chance. So, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what\u2019s next. I just hope it\u2019s new and different enough to be relevant. ",
