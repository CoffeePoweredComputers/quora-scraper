            "answer_text": "Most lotteries like Powerball and Mega Millions in the States and EuroMillions and EuroJackpots in Europe are actually \"lottos\".  They really are designed to solely to generate profits and are actually not a lot different from most forms of gambling - they generate sales by tricking the way our brains work, through visualization.  By this I mean it is easy for us visualize winning and what we would spend the $100,000,000 on.  Its also easy to visualize the small $1 or $2 we spend on a ticket, which to be cliched, is less than a cup off coffee.  This low cost to huge potential pay out, combined with highly publicized news stories about winners, tricks our brains into making it seem like a good deal.   However, our brains have a much harder time visualizing the odds and obviously big lottery companies never promote this.  When people give us examples to help visualize the odds it is simple to see how absurd the lottery really is - like for example, if you laid actual lottery tickets end to end they could stretch across the United States and back and you would still likely not win a jackpot!  That being said, I think because of its nature playing the lottery is much less addictive than other forms of gambling, although of course you do get some people who spend more than they can afford on lottery tickets.  The fact that many big lottery companies seem to direct their marketing at the poor I think make many people feel the lottery is unethical. However back to my original point, these are actually lottos, not lotteries. Traditional lotteries are actually a lot more like raffles, with no rollovers and a finite number of tickets.  These are far more ethical I believe, they are obviously also for making profit but they really act as a means of wealth distribution.  The most famous lottery is probably the Spanish Christmas Lottery - Spanish Christmas Lottery available in the UK!.  The chances of winning are 1 in 5, the chances of winning a jackpot is 1 in 100,000 and over 90% of the Spanish population take part each year on Dec 22.  I dont find this nearly as unethical since almost everyone plays and its not 1 player taking home a huge jackpot, its literally hundreds of thousands of players winning smaller prizes.  There is a lot of ceremony and dun surrounding the event as well, so even if you don't win there is a days entertainment value for just taking part. ",

            "answer_text": " It all depends on how you look at it \u2013 lotteries are a game a chance. But, if you look life in a broader perspective \u2013 life is all about the chances you get.So, to consider lottery unethical, does not make sense to me. If you look at one of the most iconic movies of Bollywood, Malamaal Weekly, it focused on a village changing its lifestyle, because they won a lottery. There are many examples in real and reel life, where people have managed to become winners and improve their lives, all because they played and won the lottery.With lotteries, you are risking a certain amount of money for the anticipation of a big win. The amount you bet is very small, and if you hit the jackpot \u2013 you will become an instant millionaire.You can play international lotteries with Lottoland, without worrying about the ethics \u2013 it is your money, and as long as you gamble responsibly, you stand a chance to become a millionaire.People try and associate lotteries will ethics when it is just a game \u2013 which you can plan and play forever. And, the day you hit the jackpot, nobody will be talking about the ethics; each one will be more interested in asking your advice on how you chose the lucky numbers.Thanks For Reading!

            "answer_text": "Agreed. Most lotteries around the world do give a large portion of proceeds to worthy causes. Here in Florida it funds a scholarship program. When I lived in Europe they had similar programs. Although I don't think that makes it ethical necessarily. There are plenty of unethical people and companies that donate money to charity ect.  I think the big issue is how open companies are with the way the system works. Meaning if people know they have very slim chances of winning and they are almost guaranteed to lose money but chose to do it anyway. Plenty of people know this but do it for entertainment value. That is ethical. But if it is not known the odds of winning and people are playing while viewing the system as a type of investment with a probable positive net return, then the game is unethical. Using that as a criteria I would say most all modern lotteries I know of are ethical. ",

            "answer_text": "Lotteries are unethical when it comes to their advertising of the overall odds. They make you think that winning a prize is right around the corner. They started this practice with the scratch off tickets advertising what the overall odds to win a prize was on the back of that ticket. Now days they place on the front of the online tickets such as Mega Millions and Powerball the overall odds. To win a prize For Mega Millions it would be 1 in 24 the overall odds including the $2 prize for a \"Mega Ball\" only win. This is a misleading statistic because it gives lotto players the impression that there's a winner in every 24th ticket purchased which is farthest from the truth. The Mega Millions jackpot odds are still the same 1 in 302,575,350 million. ",

Maybe I am socialistic, however, we need to get everyone off the street in this country! I think it is scary but possible that a lottery winner could win more than all the people in Congress earn in a year. And that, eventually, we could have a dictator. Is that what people in this country want? ",
