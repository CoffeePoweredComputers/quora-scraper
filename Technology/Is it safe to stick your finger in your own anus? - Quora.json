It's important that you understand the landscape of your anus and rectum to discover where you get the most sexual sensations. Cleanliness is next to godliness. If you want to rinse after a complete bowel movement: Leo Ambrose's answer to What is the best way to purge one's colon before anal sex? Wash your hands really well with soap and water, not sanitizer. Make sure your nails are trimmed and smooth. Put some hot anal porn on. Imagine you're the bottom being opened when you're exploring yourself and masturbating. Wet your middle finger with some silicon lube. A little baby oil, coconut oil or Vaseline will do in a pinch. Make sure whatever you use is clean and uncontaminated. Put whatever you're using on your dick so you can masturbate and cum while your exploring. Rub some into your taint and your nuts, too. Take your time and go slowly. Use a light touch until you know what feels good to you. Gently massage the outside of your hole. Press against it with the pad of your middle finger. Tap it. Play with it. Push like you're pooping and insert your middle finger into your anus. Find your prostate by turning your finger so it's facing up and aim toward your penis. You'll find a small lump when your have your finger inside to between your first and second knuckles. That's your prostate. Start to make \u201ccome here\u201d motions on that lump. Brush against it sideways, too. Stroke your dick too if you're hard. Don't forget your nuts. Use as much lube as you need. When you're relaxed and your finger is sliding freely in you, add another finger. Take your time. After several sessions you should be able to use three fingers. Be playful with your hole. As long as it doesn't hurt you can finger fuck yourself pretty aggressively. When your hole\u2019s nice and sloppy and loose, really grind in there with all three fingers. Turn your fingers palm up again toward your nuts. Find your prostate again and give it some \u201ccome here\u201d and sideways motions. Grind some more. You should be loose enough to try four fingers if you can. Get in there really deep and keep hitting your prostate. When you're whimpering and moaning like a girl, cum all over yourself.

            "answer_text": "Yes it is safe to stick your finger in your anus. But keep in mind the following: Use some personal lubricant on your anus and your finger. Going in \u2018dry\u2019 can be difficult and painful. Trim and buff your fingernail. At the entrance to your anus are two sphincters. The sphincter area is very sensitive and fingernails are a likely cause of pain in this area. Doing it yourself means that your hand will be curved around to get into the anus. Keep in mind that this is not the most comfortable position to be in when fingering. Inserting fingers straight on is preferred, but you need another person to do that. When finished remember to throughly wash and scrub your finger in warm soapy water or some antiseptic solution. Wipe down anything you have touched with an antiseptic wipe. This is to ensure you and others don\u2019t get infections from any faecal material. ",
