People have different preferences. The midnight green colour introduced with the iPhone 11 Pro lineup was a huge hit.  But when viewed from different angles and varied lighting conditions, the midnight green would seem as space grey. I suggest you to get hands on experience at the Apple store or any other retailer for a better judgement. I personally prefer the Gold variant as it looks more vibrant. Here\u2019s my iPhone 11 Pro   Good day! ",

The color which seems appealing to some might not be the same to others. If personally saying, I would prefer: Space grey > Midnight green > Silver >Gold. :) ",
