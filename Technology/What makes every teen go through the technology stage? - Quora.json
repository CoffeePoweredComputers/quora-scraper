            "answer_text": "It definitely has to do with the changing world we live in. Maybe 15 years ago, smartphones were thought of as useless devices that would flop in the market, but it is quite apparent that they have definitely not. Because of the convenience and the potential of technology and the internet for example, it is being more regularly implemented into the daily lives of many people. Learning has also been affected by this introduction of new technology and many schools and teachers take advantage of this as much as they can, simply because it is easier. There are so many possibilities with technology and is also where a lot of teens may find new hobbies, maybe coding or gaming, so that could be a reason why they do this. Another reason may be because of the need to feel included, for example on social media, peer pressure has always existed and people have always (well mostly) been conscious of what people think about them so they may feel the need to join in to feel accepted. A final reason is that technology is definitely the future of humankind, computers can lead the way to automated lifestyles and getting used to technology is better than struggling later. Every year, electronic devices become more and more available to children worldwide, so eventually, I think that it will stop being a \u2018stage\u2019 and be more of a lifestyle. ",
