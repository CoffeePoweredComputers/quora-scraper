            "answer_text": "There are many points for which people may go for OnePlus Nord. Display: The display used in OnePlus Nord is simply top-notch when you compare it with other competition in that price. FHD+ 90Hz refresh rate and in-display fingerprint scanner which makes OnePlus Nord a better deal.OxygenOS: Simply OnePlus' OxygenOS is way better and ads free, bloatware free, premium experience smartphone which melts any other competitors.Camera: OnePlus Nord packs quad camera which includes 48 MP Sony IMX586 primary camera, an 8 MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 5 MP depth shooter, and a 2 MP macro lensm Though OnePlus Nord have got camera from its older flagship which are very much optimized to produce good looking better colour production Photos. And OnePlus Nord also has OIS support in its video recording which enhances the video quality drastically. On the front, the phone will feature a dual punch hole camera set up that will include a 32 MP main sensor and an 8 MP ultra-wide.Feel: OnePlus Nord has glass sandwich design which makes OnePlus Nord feel premium and some small small things like haptics feedback are improved in OnePlus which has a edge over other competition.Conclusion: Clearly Snapdragon 765G is no way near Snapdragon 855/855+ but OnePlus Nord focused on some other minor hard to notice changes which makes OnePlus Nord premium feeling, better experience smartphone even though it's processor is slightly less capable than other competition. (I would buy Realme x3 or Redmi k20 pro any day over OnePlus Nord) ",
