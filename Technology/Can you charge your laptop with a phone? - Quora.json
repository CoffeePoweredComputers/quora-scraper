            "answer_text": "Can I charge my laptop with my phone charger? The short answer is \u201cnot really.\u201d If your laptop is designed to accept USB charging (this will often be a USB-C port, but not all USB-C ports accept charging - check your laptop's documentation), then \u201cmaybe, possibly if you're lucky.\u201d Most laptops consume upwards of 20 Watts, and, quite possibly, a lot more, especially if you're doing something CPU-intensive. A \u201csmall\u201d (meaning \u201clow power\u201d) laptop charger would provide at least 50 to 60 Watts. \u201cPowerful\u201d laptop chargers deliver around 90 Watts. The most powerful laptop chargers deliver 120 watts or more. Compare that with your average phone charger that delivers 5, 10, or 12 Watts (depending on the model of charger), and you can see that there's no way your phone charger can charge up your laptop while the laptop is in use; the laptop battery would still discharge with the phone charger \u201cpowering\u201d (if you could even call it that) the laptop. If the laptop is powered OFF, then your phone charger can, at best, trickle-charge the laptop battery. If your \u201cgood\u201d phone charger delivers 12 watts of power, that's a fraction of what most laptop chargers can do, so it will take that much longer to charge the laptop. Let's say your laptop came with a charger that delivers 80 watts and, with the laptop off, can charge the battery from 0% to 100%\u2033 in about 3 or 4 hours. Theoretically, if all things are equal, that means your 12 watt phone charger, in the best case, will take 6 or 7 times longer, so your charge time just jumped to something around 20 hours. But things are not equal - you didn't think it would be that easy, did you? Most laptop power supplies push 18 to 24 volts (while delivering that 80 watts); your phone charger provides a paltry 5 volts. The reality of charging your laptop with a phone charger could easily take days (plural). There's also a distinct possibility that the laptop would \u201cignore\u201d such a low-power source, and not charge at all. Not ever. If the laptop does take a charge, but the phone charger doesn't have adequate protection against too much power draw, the phone charger may overheat, potentially leading to a fire. So, like I said in the beginning, it's not really possible to use your phone charger this way - and it might even be dangerous, depending on the specific phone charger. ",

            "answer_text": "Highly unlikely but depends on your laptop make and model. As far as I know no laptops charge from mini or micro UUS. Some laptops do have USB-C chargers though, with more coming out all the time. Some newer apple laptops have them, and a lot of Chromebooks and Samsung notebooks have USB-C charging. Plenty of newer laptops have the ability to charge your phone through it's USB-C ports, and almost all can charge through basic USB 2/3. However just because a laptop has a usb-c Port doesn't mean it can reverse the flow and charge the laptop from it. For those that can it depends on 2 factors. Cable and charging block. Now technically all usb-c cables are the same. In reality some are much poorer quality. They just don't support the higher amperage needed to charge a laptop and they wear down from cheap construction. The protocol indicates that it is universal, but buy quality and you are fine. Much more important is the charging blocks. Again, most charging blocks that support usb-c to usb-c are high enough amperage that it shouldn't matter, but some are lower than others. They will say on them. Just grab it and check the label. Older basic USB charger will have between .5 amps up to 2.1 amp. If it does charge a laptop it's not likely to do it fast, if at all. It may just keep it powered or slow the discharge. Newer usb-c will have plenty of amps to support it. Read more here Charging via USB-C for laptops: Here\u2019s what you need to know ",
