            "answer_text": "No, your iPhone will not alert you if someone unlocks and opens the messages on your Apple Watch. First, it is assumed only you know the passcode necessary to unlock the Apple Watch. If you have shared it with anyone or suspect someone else knows it, then change it. Second, if someone knows your passcode and unlocks the Apple Watch, how would the Apple Watch know it was someone else and not you? (Answer: it can\u2019t. And you would find it pretty annoying if you got an alert on your iPhone every time you opened a message on your Apple Watch.) Third, if no one else knows your passcode, then no one else can unlock your Apple Watch \u2014 which means they can\u2019t read your messages on it. ",
