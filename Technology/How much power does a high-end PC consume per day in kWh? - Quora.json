            "answer_text": "Let's assume it's extremely high end and has like a power consumption of like 1000 W (v unlikely but easy math) So for every hour the machine is running AT FULL load, 1000 Wh (1 kWh) of energy is used. At full load is like when you're taking synthetic benchmarks and what not, so not very representative of actual consumption. Just go on some website which tells you your power consumption depending on your components. It will be in watts. Divide that by 1000 for kW. Finally multiply that by twenty four hours to get your kWh figure for a day. Actual usage will be lower as a PC is not constantly on load or even constantly turned on. If it's just one PC, don't worry about electricity costs, they'll disappear when you compare it to that time you left the air conditioner running for far too long. ",

            "answer_text": "The consumed power can be based on how long, the length of time the PC is turned on and operational! The PC has a power supply rated to provide the full operating potential or capabilities\u2026 Knowing the full power supply rated capacity, we can use that figure as the basis for calculations to estimate how much energy will be consumed\u2026. example\u2026 Assuming the rated power supply capacity of the PC is 500 Watts\u2026 Leaving the system ON fully operational for the whole day = 24 hours\u2026. Will give a value of 12000 watts, or 12 KWH for one whole day.. Assuming a 100% operational efficiency! ",
