            "answer_text": "Startup is a fashionable word. The larger frame is \u201c Entrepreneurship\u201d , which is a very important engine for growth of any economy. Entrepreneurship need not necessarily be through a startup route ( of course startup route makes it easy for small entrepreneurs ). Forty years back , economies were dependent more on Natural resources than human resources. Then Technology has changed the equation , countries with better intellectual capital who can develop better and productive technologies or better skill base started prospering. While technology development was mostly dominated by big corporate giants , with the advent of internet , Individuals /small groups could find methods of increasing Productivity , value to Consumers/Enterprises without much infrastructure, investment and within a short time. Startups do create some economic activity , provide some jobs . But if the success rate of startups is say , one in ten . This will lead to disruptions in terms of loss of some capital and jobs . While people can always get jobs again , it would be harsh on some people . The case of success stories also ends up many times by acquisitions and in turn some churning , consolidation and loss of jobs. While it is good , the general feeling is that start -up route is the fastest route to prosperity . While everybody has a right to attain this this prosperity , it should not become a cess pool into which best talent gets sucked . It should not happen that we will miss genuine Entrepreneurship which can bring more value to the world at large ",

            "answer_text": "All businesses contribute to the economic growth of a county. The significance of a startup's contribution in its true essence is quite debatable though. Like all businesses, startups generate employment, create economic opportunities for partners/ ancillary businesses and some drive influx of foreign currency into domestic markets. While all this is true, the success of a startup in today's economy is measured in the amount of dollars that it raises through a series of funding rounds. All this circus means that the chances of a startup succeeding is in small fractions\u2026. And the government policies in India make it make it all the more interesting. Well, that brings us to the sustainability of a startup. We have seen a major rise in the fall of funded startups over the years. I reckon our top B schools set people to raise money, but as results have shown us, true entrepreneurship is being able to create a self sustaining business. This is where things start going South owing to low or no experience in running a business of our young Entrepreneurs, who definitely start with a disruption but seldom keep the momentum going to create businesses that eventually turn cash positive. Most factots point towards a volatile ecosystem that could swing either way. Disruption, innovation, IoT, AI, ML and a few other dangerous sounding words will continue to rule the roost the coming years. All this sounds glum. And it is. A deep dive into the sinister world of startups will reveal a lot more. But yeah! To answer your question, startups do contribute to the economy. Cheers ",

It helps in improving the technology advantage of a nation for future development and growth of the economy. It improves the wealth levels of a nation and revenue streams for the government to initiate its welfare and other citizen endowment programs. Without innovation a capitalists system will degenerate, so startups helps in building good and efficient r&d, which is necessary in this direction of political philosophy of wealth creation. More startups keep the economy healthy. ",
