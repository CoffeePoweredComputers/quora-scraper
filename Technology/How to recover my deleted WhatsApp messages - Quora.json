Method 3: Ask The Reciever It is the best and simple way from which you can recover your deleted message, images, videos and any other data from WhatsApp. If you can ask the receiver to send that particular message, images & videos so it will be the easiest method to recover any data. Mainly it is helpful when you have to use the option Delete For Me, as the messages are deleted from your side only not from the receiver side. So, you can ask them to send it. But in some situations, you are not able to do this. Method 4: From Any Software I will not prefer to install any third-party app for any reason. This is due to privacy reasons. Recovering deleted files has become very easy and simple. Nowadays there is a lot of applications/software that is present on the internet from which we can recover our messages and media. Below is the list of some applications. You can go through this if needed. I have not tested this method because we need to install a third-party app for that which I will not prefer.

            "answer_text": "How do I restore my messages? Summary It is possible to restore messages.First, uninstall and then reinstall WhatsApp.Click Restore when prompted to restore your message history.Your missing chats should appear in WhatsApp!Backing up your messages If you have a Blackberry 10 device, your WhatsApp conversations are saved automatically every day at 4AM (your local time). Backup files are saved by default on the phone's internal memory but only given that there is enough free space. You can also manually back up your chats at any time: Open WhatsApp > Application Menu (Swipe down from the top of the screen to see it).Tap Settings > Media Settings > Backup conversations.Restoring your messages If you are deleting and reinstalling WhatsApp, you will be prompted with a message to import your backup after you first open your new copy of WhatsApp. Tap Restore and your chat history should appear. Make sure you import your chat history before the file expires, as backup files are only valid for 7 days after last saved. Restoring older (less recent) backups Before attempting to restore messages from an older backup, please note: Current chat history will be lost upon restoration.There are only up to 7 days worth of backup files.Any new messages sent/received after a backup, and deleted before the next backup, cannot be restored.If you run a manual backup, it will overwrite the most recent automatic backup file.Also recommend: If you do not want to lose your current history (newest messages), create a manual backup by going to:WhatsApp > Application Menu (Swipe down the top of the screen) > Settings > Media Settings > Backup conversations.This manual backup will create a backup file in the folder: /device/misc/Whatsapp/backupThe backup file name is \"messageStore-YYYY-MM-DD.1.db.crypt, rename this file as \"messageStore-YYYY-MM-DD.1.db.crypt.current\" so you do not get it confused with other backup files during the restoration process.To restore from a backup, follow these steps: Uninstall WhatsApp.Decide which backup file you want to restore.Rename that with the most recent date in its name.Install WhatsApp.When asked to restore, tap Restore.You will now be able to see your restored messages.

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Yes Whatsapp creates daily backup of your chats at 2:00 a.m. by default. This backup is saved locally in InternalStorage>WhatsApp>Databases and also in Google drive if you have opted for it.  Process to recover: Take a manual backup of your whatsapp chats by going in Whatsapp>Settings>Chats>Chat's backup.  Access the backup directly mentioned above with the help of some file managers. Sort the .crypt12 files in Databeses folder by date. Copy and store the most recent backup file in different directory(This step is being done if you want to get your WhatsApp in most recent chat format, don't worry you will get to know what I mean by this). Now, here is the important part: Delete all backup files except the file corresponding for the date before you deleted the targeted chat with someone. So that remaining backup file contains that chat. Uninstall your WhatsApp and reinstall it and make your account on it with the same phone number which you were using before. On proceeding further you'll asked to check for backup. Opt for local backup. It will automatically start to backup your chats. When you reach the default screen of WhatsApp you'll have the chats of the day you have opted in backup files. There will be no chats of further days. It will be like you haven't used WhatsApp from that day onwards. Don't worry, no one on the other side will know of this. But while chatting keep your conversations in mind that have already happened. Using this method you can have your deleted chats back. Now if you want to restore your WhatsApp to most recent chats then repeat the above steps after placing the most recent backup file(which I asked to store in some other directory in start of the process) in Databeses folder. Fails: If you are using some memory cleaner app then there is a definite chance that it has already deleted your previous local backups as they consume a lot of memory. Or, if you yourself have manually deleted your previous chat backups to free some memory then there is no chance of recovery. This method will also not work using online backup on whatsapp as during daily backups in Google drive it automatically deletes previous backup files in drive folder and keep the most recent one. Disclaimer: This is what I have discovered and may not work if all steps are not followed properly. It may stop working in future if WhatsApp updates its local backup policy. I take no responsibility for your lost data. If you have any doubts, feel free to ask in comment section. P.S.: Suggestions are always welcome. Edit 1: Added some image for assistance. ",

            "answer_text": " A security hacker is someone who seeks to breach defenses and exploit weaknesses in a computer system or network. Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit, protest, information gathering,challenge, recreation,or to evaluate system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against potential hackers. The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the computer underground. In computer security, a hacker is someone who focuses on security mechanisms of computer and network systems. While including those who endeavor to strengthen such mechanisms, it is more often used by the mass media and popular culture to refer to those who seek access despite these security measures. That is, the media portrays the 'hacker' as a villain. Nevertheless,parts of the subculture see their aim in correcting security problems and use the word in a positive sense. White hat is the name given to ethical computer hackers, who utilize hacking in a helpful way. White hats are becoming a necessary part of the information security field.They operate under a code, which acknowledges that breaking into other people's computers is bad, but that discovering and exploiting security mechanisms and breaking into computers is still an interesting activity that can be done ethically and legally. Accordingly, the term bears strong connotations that are favorable or pejorative, depending on the context. Security exploits Main article: Exploit (computer security) A security exploit is a prepared application that takes advantage of a known weakness.[29] Common examples of security exploits are SQL injection, cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery which abuse security holes that may result from substandard programming practice. Other exploits would be able to be used through File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), PHP, SSH, Telnet and some Web pages. These are very common in Web site and Web domain hacking. Techniques This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Vulnerability scanner A vulnerability scanner is a tool used to quickly check computers on a network for known weaknesses. Hackers also commonly use port scanners. These check to see which ports on a specified computer are \"open\" or available to access the computer, and sometimes will detect what program or service is listening on that port, and its version number. (Firewalls defend computers from intruders by limiting access to ports and machines, but they can still be circumvented.) Finding vulnerabilities Hackers may also attempt to find vulnerabilities manually. A common approach is to search for possible vulnerabilities in the code of the computer system then test them, sometimes reverse engineering the software if the code is not provided. Brute-force attack Password guessing. This method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used, because of the time a brute-force search takes. Password cracking Password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. Common approaches include repeatedly trying guesses for the password, trying the most common passwords by hand, and repeatedly trying passwords from a \"dictionary\", or a text file with many passwords. Packet analyzer A packet analyzer (\"packet sniffer\") is an application that captures data packets, which can be used to capture passwords and other data in transit over the network. Spoofing attack (phishing) A spoofing attack involves one program, system or website that successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data and is thereby treated as a trusted system by a user or another program \u2014 usually to fool programs, systems or users into revealing confidential information, such as user names and passwords. Rootkit A rootkit is a program that uses low-level, hard-to-detect methods to subvert control of an operating system from its legitimate operators. Rootkits usually obscure their installation and attempt to prevent their removal through a subversion of standard system security. They may include replacements for system binaries, making it virtually impossible for them to be detected by checking process tables. Social e Warning signs You are unable to log in to your computer or mobile device, or your email, social media and other online accounts. You notice new icons on your computer screen, or your computer is not as fast as it normally is. Files on your computer have been moved or deleted. Pop-up boxes start appearing on your computer screen. These may offer to help 'fix' your computer, or a simply have a button that says \u2018close\u2019. You have an unexpectedly large phone data or internet bill. You notice that amounts of money go missing from your bank account without any explanation.
