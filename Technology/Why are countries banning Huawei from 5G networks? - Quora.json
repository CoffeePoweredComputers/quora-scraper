            "answer_text": "The China-based company is one one the world\u2019s largest providers of telecommunications equipment, networking gear, smartphones and more. However, numerous countries allege that the company\u2019s products may purposely contain security holes that China\u2019s government could use for spying purposes. Also, some countries allege that Huawei steals intellectual property from foreign technology companies. U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) on January 28, 2019, charged Huawei with bank fraud and stealing trade secrets. In a 13-count indictment DOJ charged Huawei, its chief financial officer, and two affiliated firms with a laundry list of crimes including conspiracy, money laundering, bank and wire fraud, flouting U.S. sanctions on Iran, and obstruction of justice. Below is the list of countries, regions, businesses and organizations that are banning, debating or rethinking business engagements with Huawei Australia: The country has blocked Huawei and ZTE from providing equipment for its 5G network, which is set to launch commercially in 2019 Canada: The country as of early February 2019 was currently considering whether to ban Huawei from providing equipment for 5G cellular networks in Canada. However, at least one small Huawei 5G network rollout is under way in the country. Denmark: Danish authorities have expelled two Huawei staff after an inspection at the company\u2019s Copenhagen office showed they failed to comply with laws covering residence and work permits. The inspection had no relation to recent headlines around growing scrutiny over Huawei\u2019s ties with the Chinese government and allegations that Beijing could use its technology for spying, something which the company has denied. European Union: The European Union is considering proposals that would effectively amount to a de-facto ban on Huawei equipment for next-generation mobile networks (i.e., 5G Wireless projects). Germany: The German government as of January 2019 was considering banning Huawei from providing 5G equipment in the country saying security concerns are of \u201chigh relevance.\u201d The decision to ban Huawei 5G equipment would mark a shift from Germany, which has not been as vocal as other Western countries about security concerns. New Zealand: The country\u2019s top intelligence agency has banned controversial Chinese vendor Huawei from supplying equipment for the country\u2019s first 5G mobile network in November 2018. Poland: The country is set to exclude Huawei from its future 5G network in favor of European players following the arrest of an employee from the Chinese telecoms company on suspicion of spying in January 11, 2019. Huawei sacked the employee on January 14 United Kingdom: A UK government review involving a potential Huawei ban from UK networks should be completed in March 2019, although its findings may be too sensitive to publish. United States: Huawei and ZTE technology will largely be banned from use by the US government and government contractors, according to the Defense Authorization Act, which President Trump signed in August 2018. Deutsche Telekom: Europe\u2019s biggest telecommunications company, said that if Huawei is banned in Europe, it would delay its deployment of 5G networks by up to two years. To avoid such setbacks, Deutsche Telekom has suggested a new security certification process for mobile network equipment, which would allow telcos in Germany to continue to use products from Chinese vendors in their 5G rollout plans. GSMA: Mobile communications industry body GSMA has proposed its members discuss the possibility that Chinese network vendor Huawei is excluded from key markets, amid concerns such a development could set operators back by years. Verizon Communications: The telecom giant in early January 2018 dropped all plans to sell Huawei phones under pressure from the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter. The move followed AT&T\u2019s decision in early January 2018 not to introduce the Mate 10 Pro to the U.S. market. Huawei devices still work on both companies\u2019 networks, but direct sales would\u2019ve allowed them to reach more consumers than they can through third parties. Vodafone: Although it will replace Huawei from its core infrastructure, it will not replace the company\u2019s technology in radio access networks. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. There are so many myths surrounding 5G and even more surrounding Huawei. Some allege that Huawei is banned because of \u201cbackdoors\u201d. I have not seen any country allege this apart from the UK, and the testing that was done by Huawei itself, recommending several changes as per last years report[1] with a new report indicating that the UK \u201chas tools to mitigate risks\u201d and recommending a cap on the use of Huawei equipment[2] . Some allege that the US is stopping Huawei rollout so it can sell its equipment and dominate the market. The problem is the US doesn\u2019t make this equipment, and actually, it\u2019s a supplier to Huawei. The competitors in this regard are Sweden, Finland, and South Korea. Some allege that Huawei is \u201cblocked/banned\u201d because the US NSA[3] and Five Eyes[4] (UK, US, AUS, NZ, CAN) can\u2019t use Huawei networks for spying. Even the company\u2019s current chairman Guo Ping jumped on the bandwagon releasing an op-ed in the Finacial Times[5] and at a keynote speech at the world MWC conference calling out Prism, the NSA and hailing Edward Snowden[6] . That\u2019s kinda weird. But it would resonate with Iran, North Korea, Russia, and authoritarian regimes, terrorist regimes and so on. Along with conspiracy theorists. As for NSA, Five Eyes and so on, we elect those people, employ, pay, and hold those people under public scrutiny and most importantly they are our brothers and sisters who are also beholden to the same legal system we live under. We employ them to do what they are doing! And, when they f*ck up, we pull them legal courts and through open public courts of opinion. Why would any country want to use a network supplied by another country that operates under a different legal system and heralds the ability to block our own people that we employ to keep us safe? It scares me that Guo Ping isn\u2019t making a shout out to the free world, he\u2019s making a shout out to everyone who has tried to destroy that world over the past decades and into the future. If Huawei believes it can block the NSA, Five Eyes and so on with good intent and is asking countries to hand that power to China in the belief that China won\u2019t spy and will keep us all safe is a very, very, very big call. Many concerns are further driven by two pieces of legislation in China and two particular snippets inside those but not limited to those Article 7 of the National Intelligence Law (\u56fd\u5bb6\u60c5\u62a5\u6cd5) Any organisation and citizen shall, in accordance with the law, support, provide assistance, and cooperate in national intelligence work, and guard the secrecy of any national intelligence work that they are aware of [emphasis added]. The state shall protect individuals and organisations that support, cooperate with, and collaborate in national intelligence work. Article 22 of the Counter-Espionage Law (\u53cd\u95f4\u8c0d\u6cd5) When State Security organs carry out the tasks of counter-espionage work in accordance with the law, and citizens and organisations that are obliged to provide facilities or other assistance according to the law refuse to do so, this constitutes an intention to obstruct the state security organs from carrying out the tasks of counter-espionage work according to law. That in some countries eyes is the primary driver of why Huawei was not chosen for core network infrastructure. The fear of installing a system that will be the foundation of the very core functioning of cities and modern society as a whole is far too great to be handed to a third party that has laws and ideologies that are in opposition to its own. There are also questions about Huawei's involvement with Iran backing on from the ZTE case, which won't do them any favors in US circles. Such is why nations are being cautious. But it\u2019s much more than that. Also, consider that 5G is no ordinary network, it\u2019s the beginning of a new platform that the entire economy will be based on to some extent. It will also be the communication network that cities base the management of their services on (electricity, gas, public services and automation of such). It will also be the network that business and government is built upon, such as between stock exchanges, police and emergency services. It\u2019s the network that business will use to automate and deliver new services to consumers. It\u2019s also the network band that the military will use extensively. Understandably, Countries will be taking it very seriously. What do I believe? Huawei is a smart company and has a solid future in network rollout once they work through the politics and establish security assurances with each country, even the US. But the current rhetoric they are using isn\u2019t helping them. The different political and belief systems are probably the real hurdle and that is going to take time.

            "answer_text": "Huawei has been accused of collaborating with the Chinese government to include the ability for the Chinese Government to spy on all phone calls and all data that goes through Huawei 5G cell phone hardware. At this moment Huawei is the world\u2019s largest provider of cell phone (tower) hardware. Huawei also spent a huge amount of money in developing new cell tower equipment for 5G networks, so they are likely to get the majority of orders to upgrade the entire world to 5G. After the allegations about Huawei collaborating with the Chinese government to have backdoor spy capability built into Huawei hardware, the US government initiated a ban on Huawei gear for government purposes, then US phone companies followed that lead, Canada followed suit and now multiple western governments are joining in on the ban. Note that there is no public evidence being released of the Huawei spy collaboration, so it appears that the evidence of the allegations has been classified as Secret or Top Secret, by US spy agencies so we cannot see the evidence at this moment. It further seems likely that Huawei simply implemented a way to install spy capabilities at a later time, but has not yet installed any spy software/capability. It seems most likely that Huawei planned on including spy software as an update once the 5G hardware was installed all over the world. The only obvious way that Huawei will recover from this debacle is to release the source code to all their cell tower hardware, and release the source code for every software from them, from then on, including all updates. That way, the phone companies can check the source code for backdoors before they install the hardware and then again, they can check it for every update. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a died-hard tech guy, and having used Huawei as well as many other non-name brand devices out there over the decades, I can only blame it on massive paranoia to be frank. I\u2019ve owned and used many BLU devices as well, and they came under fire for spyware loaded firmware being sold through Amazon, but that was due to a mistake on the company supplying the OTA firmware updates, not BLU. I\u2019ve also owned and used many Huawei device, long before they were being sold here in North America. I still own a few different models and use them. They are great products and provide excellent value as well. Checkout the Huawei D Quad XL U9510E. Still a powerhouse today and useful even with Android 4.0.3\u20134.2.2. There\u2019s been no proof of any backdoors in their products, nor any proof of hacking either. When some finally surfaces, we can all examine it. They are going after Huawei as a manipulation tactic. Huawei is the only company that produces products for which they\u2019ve made in-house every single part used inside it. No other company can claim this. Years ago they started making all sorts of parts, and in so doing removed their dependency on other companies to supply parts for their products. Now they supply others with parts they use in their products. In this manner they\u2019ve been able to ensure that no outside people, forces, bodies, or companies can intervene with their business or manipulate them in any way. SO because of this many other companies and countries have become paranoid to their success and want to keep them down or control them in some way. ",

For instance, the UK has approved the rollout of 5G. However, most people may view this as a window to get support for Brexit. In the UK, both 2G, 3G, and even 4G connectivity were supported by Huawei, probably explaining why they are comfortable working with Huawei. Besides, the board directors are reputable individuals who have ever worked for the government. As for the US, it probably would be a trade war and nothing much since they haven\u2019t proved that Huawei is backed by the Chinese government to spy on them. The ban of Huawei 5G rollout in the US is politically instigated since there\u2019s no security threat proof given so far. Currently, Huawei is one of the biggest providers of tower hardware and being accused of creating \u201cbackdoors\u201d or loopholes only makes countries to be skeptical about them. Imagine if proven using 5G, which is going to control critical equipment like self-driven vehicles or hospital details data landing in wrong hands or another government? Well, with this theory in mind, most countries are bound to ban Huawei unless they prove themselves otherwise and distance themselves from the Chinese government.  Hope it helps!

It\u2019s the US government! It has been eavesdropping by GPS for a lot of years. If other countries use Huawei, the US will have no chance to eavesdrop on other countries.

There are two parts to this answer: The legal fiction: Huawei wants to install the systems and in the process of installing them would necessarily learn much about the clients. Huawei has a close relationship with the Chinese government and would divulge what it learned. The political fact: That hearsay accusation could be made about any installer. To wit: Boeing had to share its information with the US government when it wanted a huge tariff applied against Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier for unfairly competing in its sales in the US. Upon adjudication, Boeing was disqualified from even making that claim in as much as it did not make aircraft of the same type as what Bombardier makes. Ergo: The claim to shut out Huawein is fake and designed to avoid reciprocal tariffs or it\u2019s true and creating genuine threats to national security. ",
