            "answer_text": "Is the question regarding economic strength or military strength? Any which way, they are pretty close with China having an edge. But as Ramaswamy Subramanian mentioned, Japan has the support of USA that would compensate for the difference.  Japan's GDP (PPP) is about $ 4.85 t, Per capita is about $38200 and HDI is 0.891. GDP of Japan is 4th from the top. USA, China and India are higher than Japan's. China's GDP (PPP) is about $19 t, Per capita is about $13800 and HDI is 0.727.  China is the most populous, has a very large area and is nuclear armed. Japan's Self Defence forces is one of the most advanced and is NOT nuclear armed.  Credit Suisse has prepared a list of countries by military strength. They took only the top 20 countries by military strength. In their report, USA is on the top, followed by Russia, then China, and fourth is Japan. It is followed by India and then France.  Reference: Wikipedia, RANKED: The world's 20 strongest militaries.

            "answer_text": "We can recall the statement of a statesman, when the people questioned the country's, strength, during world war II. The answer was very simple, the leader said, that 'as long as US is on our side, there is no need to ascertain the strength of our army.' The then answer still holds good. As long as US is ready to support Japan, the strength, of China need not be compared. ",
