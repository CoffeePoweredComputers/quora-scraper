            "answer_text": "Interesting question. Amazon has two main businesses. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a Cloud Servie Provider and a pioneer in cloud technology (Iaas and Paas). AWS is surely a technology company. They make money by selling technology \u2018products\u2019 as a service. AWS represents is a small percentage of Amazon\u2019s revenue but the majority of the company\u2019s profits. Amazon.com is not a technology company, it is a retail company, as it makes money primarily by selling goods in physical and electronic formats (i.e. kindle, audible). As with most retailers, technology is an important component for Amazon\u2019s retail business and a key enabler of competitive advantage. That is different to being in a tech company. At one point, Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and CEO, suggested personalizaiton tecchnology ot be it\u2019s main source of competitive advantage. Today, one could argue their brand and logistics are more important for the business. ",

            "answer_text": "The term \u201ctech company\u201d is rather fuzzy and applied to many things. The term is sometimes applied to companies who sell technology. For example, Apple is a tech company because it sells phones The term is applied to companies that sell services that are driven by technology. For example, both Google and Facebook make money by selling ads. Ads are driven by technology. SO, they are tech companies The term is also applied to companies who main differentiator is technology. For example, even though AirBNB is in the hospitality business, it\u2019s main diffrentitaor from other companies in the hospitality industry, is it\u2019s technology. O, it\u2019s considered a tech company One analyst has defined \u201ctech company\u201d as \u201cA company that wouldn\u2019t exist if it weren\u2019t for it\u2019s technology\u201d. By this definition, Amazon is a tech company. ",
