            "answer_text": "Decentralized Apps (or dApps) are predominantly built to offer services and utility without actually owning the data, thus mitigating the opportunities to make profits from the services they extend. But there exist other means to raise monetary investments. Some of the ways decentralized apps can make money in the future are; ICOs & Token investment.Transaction fee.Premium content.Donations.Advertisements. dApps are designed to offer services based on a token economy. Users avail of these services via spending the tokens that are governed by ICOs. When users invest in the ICOs to obtain the tokens, dApps make revenue. They do not directly bring investment from customers but rather allow users to purchase tokens from the ICOs. dApps also charge nano-transaction fees for availing its services. Although minimal, they still generate revenues at a constant and stable rate as long as the users use them. Some dApps also provide premium features and services that can be availed by performing in-app purchases that in turn generate income for its developers. They serve as a reward for their initiative and efforts to improve the overall functionality of the dApps. Donations also generate money for the dApp owners from their user population, but they are donated to serve a higher cause. In rare scenarios, some dApps advocate advertisements, and promotion of a certain product or a service offered.

            "answer_text": "As we all know that there are various option of monetization for centralised app like trxn fees , ads revenue , referrals , subscriptions etc.etc\u2026.but in case of open source dapps , cant implement the above options or any other centralised business model. Ofcourse there are ideas and services coming out for the monetization of dapps but it depends on dapp developers (are they interested to implement that service or not ?). \u2026 Nowadays open source dapp developers come up with a token or we can say an appcoin related to their dapp\u2026\u2026 so if the users want to use the network then they need to buy this appcoin or token. In this way, owners of the dapps are paid in appcoins or tokens. In Bitcoin network , miners are paid with trxn fees directly from the users so that they can use the network and it's service. And now if the no. of users increases then the value of coins or tokens also increases. This model can be applied to any dapp and is being used currently. Here , a question comes \u2026. Do users need to pay to use any dapp ? \u2026 I'll say Yes and No because there are different ways to structure the model within dapps (users could recieve signup bonus of or dapp creator could monetize virtual assets within dapp..).
