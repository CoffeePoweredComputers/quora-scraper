            "answer_text": "Technology has enabled globalization in almost every single facet. If you are interested in a great book on this there is one called \u201cConnectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization\u201d by Parag Khanna. We are moving towards an increasingly boarder less world enabled by technology. What I mean by that is this; the world no longer has no vested interest in other countries. We are increasingly connected to each other through commerce. You may buy materials in one country, have them assembled in a second country, transported out of a 3rd countries port and then sold to a multitude of countries.Also, through travel. As we have developed more sophisticated transportation systems and vehicles this enables us to work in areas that aren\u2019t within walking distance of home. This has been part of the GDP and production explosionBecause of the standardization of shipping due to the shipping container, (Containers) countries have increased the amount of trading partners which is globalization.When the first pacific shipping routes, to utilize the new standard shipping container and container ship, were put in place. The USA was sending supplies to fight the war in Vietnam. However, these ships would unload and instead of come back empty, they stopped over in Japan and S. Korea to pick up electronics. This encouraged larger quantities, lower prices and new R&D.Lastly, technology such as the internet, cable, and phone have revolutionized the entire world\u2019s economy and further enabled globalization",

            "answer_text": "So many that it would be impossible to discuss here without writing a book long reply. In short though, technology enables globalisation and globalisation creates ever new opportunities for new technology development, which in turn extends the scope of globalisation. And the cycle goes on and on and on (until politics and other interests of a few interrupt progress for the many) ",
