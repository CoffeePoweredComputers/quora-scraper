            "answer_text": "Special Forces as well as the military in general, exist to serve the national interests of the United States. That being said, Special Forces was essentially created during the cold war years of the fifties based off of the experience gained by the Office of Strategic Services (O.S.S.) in WWII of inserting small teams behind enemy lines to assist partisan resistance groups in unconventional warfare against much larger conventional forces. The mission of Special Forces has since evolved to also include foreign internal defense (training our allies to better defend themselves), special reconnaissance, direct action (Delta type missions) and counter-insurgency operations. Special Forces will continue to evolve as techniques and training are constantly being modified for improvement based on the current as well as projected future needs. The basic model of a small team that can go into another country and be a force multiplier or perform a specialized mission undetected has been so successful that it is likely to remain the model for the future as long as the world continues to have conflicts, both big or small. It is also obviously more cost effective to use SF (in terms of both money and lives) compared to the use of conventional military force. Why use a lumberjack with a chain saw when all you need is a surgeon with a scalpel? ",
