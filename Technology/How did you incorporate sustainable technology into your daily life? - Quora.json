            "answer_text": "HOW TO BE HIGHLY SELF-SUFFICIENT SO AS TO LIVE VIRTUALLY FREE BY ACQUIRING OR INVENTING OR ADAPTING ALL 150 NEEDED ITEMS, PROCESSES & PLANTS FOR FRUGALUXURY & as a FARMLETT. Or we\u2019ll be dying off from pollution, wars, trash & hunger, thirst & over-population. We wouldn\u2019t mind if, as predicted imminently by great panels of US experts, that no: jobs, banks, markets, TV, medicals, utilities, car, fuel, energy (California is reportedly verging thus + massive bush fires), water, partner, security or happiness...? That is what I set out to prove. Our home could be claimed to be about the most Self-Sufficient in Australia (original $10,500 cost) where weapons luckily are forbidden. Best to live near the sea breezes & not down-wind from factories, mines, nor near potential nuclear targets etc. House should be high-set with garage & workshop under to save garden space & enable flood-fire-proof, also more insect-proof + better view + stronger breezes. Our huge west windows for noon till sunset = winter house-heating. Always have a sun-facing long wide veranda with warm climate verandas having windows down to floor for winter morning sun at winter breakfasts + my Cornish UK glassed veranda that heated entire home until long after winter sunset. DISASTER SURVIVAL IS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH DEGREE OF OFF-GRID SELF-RELIANCE LIFE-SUPPORT YOU HAD ATTAINED & MASTERED OVER SOME YEARS BEFORE SAID DISASTER - to the extent we now write plenty of books + eBooks + workshops + lectures re such survival & thrive healthy for 25 years off-grid on less than 5% pension at ages 85 & with ingenious Filipino wife 70 = never been so rich in our lives on this paradise island near Brisbane! Our mere 46 watt solar PV panel provides all 12 volt appliances: Here\u2019s a Sample, particularly off-grid including substantially own homemade Inventions & Discoveries extracted from total of 5,470: hose-reel solar pump - water finding, saving, pumping & purifying, also water from the air & fog - waterbag & country fish mini-dam, rain tank pipes reject 1st half hour of rain to clean air & roof - solar stills - alternative toilets as 1.5m ground hole with cosy drum + seat on top, like Mayans, Incas, Aztecs who after months when full, reused muck on gardens; but we plant a food tree there & dig another hole; though only piss around food trees in our 34 year Edible Jungle where bananas ripen midwinter - Standard Septic Toilet Systems (which we dig out after years using a bucket tied to string + stick to poke it down to fill for garden) - alternative garden-safe laundry, trivial chemical-free washing up - no ironing - LED lights + fans + mosquito-bug zapper - blender from a small starter motor - Insulate home floors with 3 layers thick cardboard under carpets, even on walls that face outside, also in ceilings as well as in tropics; there are millions of homes needing such!! - solar etc hot water, bathing & cooking, Hawaiian BBQ & many stove types including my small smokeless one-stick HELIXTOVE (far better than conventional \u201crocket\u201d stoves), wick stove uses cheap diesel instead of kerosene - Award-winning solar water heat & Universal stove, coffee warmer, wood fire pollution - cheap Cornish home warming like solar-heated glass veranda everywhere possible in Europe, USA, Canada, Russia etc to save vast energy & cost... - Methane digesters - wasteful giant lithium batteries + gravity type battery like grand-pa clock - salt water batteries, thermo electric generator works on stove when no wind, sun or hydro energy available - 3rd world battery welding - many 12volt appliances including gravity light & our blackout kit - Hindi oil lamp - natural coolers like power-free Bangladesh hut cooler - several best wind turbine rules - what doesn\u2019t need preserving, homemade most efficient 40L, 12 volt, 2.3 watt fridge that uses 30 times less energy annually than others, but under the shady house (never in kitchen), in the breeze & partially buried + bed warmer - computer & printer etc. Average Human Mortality rate in a sizeable city is 6 times that in the country from all causes. Unless folk live on at least 1/4 acre of deeply self-sufficient solar edible-jungle with own water etc like we do, they couldn\u2019t survive more than a few days WTSHTF, in typical 1-room apartment, in retirement village, or in concrete garden-free homes in Over-Crowded suburbs. Best home & land design formula, cheap room space savers, eco villages & sick homes, total radiation disaster - cheap quickies for home & business - tree-less envelope, floor filing cabinet - Kids & Students Education, Responsible kids, Bill Gates to kids - green & tech Bible quotes, Stress & anxiety, amazing Dalai Lama quote - Youngsters job bidding - Fashionomics showing non-stitch clothes with little cutting - making wines, jams, preserving fruit, champagne etc without yeast or sugar & no heat apart for some jams; making cold yoghurt; solar food dryers - commercial FRESHIELD vacuum food preservers + hand pump + many sized containers; ours for 1/4 century (sausages fresh for months; check weekly & pump again if the pressure rises slightly) - companion planting chart - eating nutritious Pine trees that also feed edible Russian foul - health, pill dangers, fake vitamin C - 5 thorough dental cleaning methods & 1mm paste scientifically OK - mower conversion into grass & brush cutter from hedge trimmer or have 2 sheep or goats, scythe, spine-saving bent-handle spork (spade-fork), Stock & wildlife conservation with animal trap, humanure officially now considered safe, multi-use hopfully dwarf food trees, \u201corganic\u201d warning, restoring timber forest with straight tall food trees - extreme winters, earth heat pumps, solar-heated winter swim pool - Farmlett Permaculture ideal, as a Pensioner, backups, living in tents, Our Good Life - WORLD VAST PLASTIC POLLUTION, recycle, reuse, restore - Our Nuclear Disaster Survival - unusual alternative energy samples - my Top-Up Rocket Space Shuttle, control entire factories hands-off in early 1960s, robotic machine tools, 1962 I managed world 1st LA city traffic computer control - 1698 mine steam pump plus my varied engines including incredible liquid-piston steam engine & solid such as metal or liquid expansion - waving proposed flag - SOLAR DESALINATION IS VITALLY NEEDED, AS IN PART OF S.AMERICA AGES AGO, ALSO via AUSTRALIA\u2019s CSIRO; VAST DESALINATION & PUMPING FOR THE WORLD\u2019S DROUGHT AREAS IS THE JOB FOR CHEAP NUCLEAR REACTORS, INCLUDING HEAT-EXCHANGERS, DISTANT PUMPING, EVEN DISTRICT-HEATING with plenty of salt as a by-product - All our medicals & doctors etc free here - Grave situation = permanent stainless engraved grave cross. ``These ENVIRONMENT type situations are frequent & with same sort of solutions here which, if carried out by everybody, would reduce most industries to lucrative Cottage or Village industries & vastly reduce our drag on the environment & on climate change. As well as my Awesome Library, the Maths Library is so small & simple to operate - diabetic maths treated because poorly in their journals. I forgot to mention that a huge motivation for being ecologist is being able to live virtually FREE, get everything for free, give big free grants & Do everything for free. Incredible Wedding 6 years ago after a Sunday Church service was entirely FREE; including everyone bringing a plate + transport on my 25-year dual solar trike that, being 1/4hp, needs no registration, license or insurance. Already we live on a paradise island so nowhere better than home for the honeymoon! Her dress was fabulous off the shoulder for $29 at IGA supermarket special price less big pensioner discount. Wedding ring like an electronic connector that she happily bought! VEHICLES: Dog can happily become vegetarian at any age so use one with nice harness to help pull your transport like my 1950s Dachshund pulling bike up hills + horse + carts for horse, sheep, & goats as popular ages ago in Australia. Amazing best new budget Chinese electric 50km-range micro folding scooter to effortlessly put on buses. Prize homemade 40kg, \u00bc hp, 3 wheel, 2-seat, 25year old 1WD dual TRICAR both needing no rego, licence or insurance on highways (but not on freeways), both solar-charged at home - electric & pedal bikes + trikes - human-hauled kids school bus - wood gas producers, WW2 gas bag van fuel + 13 things car mechanics wont tell + buying old cars - air crash investigations & Massive pollution put us off flying as it should everyone + safest seats & best way to survive a crash is facing backwards, etc - Lanier 1930s micro-wing ultra-stable & ultra-safe planes take off & land in 20m! + simplest glider & reliable paper plane - my 1965 Pacific sail crossing re home made sail self-steer on schooner & cutter sailboats up or down wind, big fast 1787 steam jet boat details operating in UK & USA that I found in a locked Brit Science Museum cupboard, Windmill & Flettner wind ships. ``Incredibly, when you Hitchhike in Fiji, all private & public vehicles including taxis can charge up to no more than the cheap buses for most anywhere at any time - unless you call for a taxi, else pick it up at the rank - about $1 which is massively emission & crowd avoiding! Of course here they would probably insist on a police good conduct card. But to see vastly less traffic, a taxi making more than usual single fare & private cars or trucks stuffed with 6 passengers is amazing any time day or night & anywhere is a miracle! Such effect if it became universal would be enormous. COMPACT FOOD GROWING & FARMING in our 34 year here + 7 in UK\u2019s warmest Cornwall having planted nothing that isn't edible, including ground cover (= sweet potatoes etc), on \u00bc acre edible jungle of extraordinary plants including sturdy native & medicinal like SAMBUNG & Bele. `` With largely tree food, greater efficiency than ground crops & so little work to do, apart from occasional pruning & edible clover grass-cutting, that I got mild diabetes-2. Tropical fruits are generally more nutritious than cool climate items. ``Preserving Fruit via water, cool, vacuum, jam, juice, wine, sola dry, preserves, pickles, vinegar & cordials. There are nutritious dirt-cheap tree alternatives to: bread, pudding (black sapote), butter (avocado), milk (white sapote, custard apple, Peruvian Cow Tree = Brosimum Alicastrum or better still B.Utile\u2026), greens (hibiscus, tree lettuce, mulberry & sweet potato leaf\u2026), sugarless jam, ice-cream (custard apple), drinks, many medicines, many native foods & bush-tucker... more Cuttings from all our food trees U could ever want. When tomato plants have given a good crop, rejuvenate them by covering the plants with rich soil. Land & home prices here are vastly less than on mainland. Could be worth taking metal chelating agent medicine to rid your body of metals. Try not to frequent crowded places or transport. Healthy greens come from many sources: hibiscus, peanut leaf, clover, tops of many vegies like carrots, & onions etc. Trap birds with black string loop on ground. We are close to the island sea so shellfish like oysters & mussels readily available + fish of course. 2 goats or sheep for milk + wool + mowing. Sugar cane for sweetness by splitting into 4. Last time I used a straw must have been about 1/2 century ago. We no longer use or carry around mugs for hot or cold drinks (or water), but slightly elliptical small mug-size jars to avoid rolling or spills, keeps warm, avoid dust or flies & portable, easier to stir. These jars originally sold containing coconut that has been made toxic with over 50% SUGAR! In my many Seminars I mention if someone drives or takes a bus Brisbane to Melbourne, as we often have over years, they would only see about 10 front-gardens with food trees!! So what\u2019s with world hunger & overpopulation?? Geese better than chickens laying less number, though greater weight of eggs annually. Natural-fed pigs, rabbits, birds, fish & lamb for meat, Water Chestnut, algae & our Bananas that ripen midwinter like warm-weather semi-swamp agriculture = Swagriculture; they also grow in geo-thermal Iceland. Perennials like pigeon peas & passion-fruit etc. Fertiliser: sewage, urine, waste, ashes, buried seaweed, mulch & volcanic rock dust which is amazing - without poisons, chem fertilisers, pesticides or GM foods. Try tree Grafting, we have 2 different mangoes on same tree. Try Gleaning society\u2019s or nature's unwanted food or things like veggie greens, leaves, seeds, cores like apple & pineapple, skins, naturally hardy native foods etc! Domestic Stock were once Jungle Animals - still can be. ``Work only 3-hours/week in small 0.1ha (1/4acre) Edible Jungle largely of dwarf food trees, including on verges, footpaths & driveways + native food trees + British Green Deserts group were growing fruit in Sahara. Plant most any 3 food-tree types in ONE hole = makes trees smaller, just as fruity. Without breaking off, snap high branches down to reach fruit, to better shade ground & to share sun. Perennialism has stupidly been bred out of most GRAIN crops for all the wrong reasons by farmers & \"experts\", even though perennial crops survive stress vastly more easily & energetically - as we found decades ago. Can grow virtually all food in pots as my sister-in-law proved. Also on flattish roofs. OTHER TREE/VINE/PLANT USES: plastics, cloth, lumber, some medicines, water storage, stock feed (dry country Kurrajong tree + mangrove leaves & seeds + grasses underwater at high tide!), shade, a place to put waste, a vine for passion fruit, wood for 1 fire-stick cooker, timber for repairs & making things, cash for fruit or gifting fruit to chapel, birthday presents, food for ducks & geese, sell cuttings, mini tours for a tea house + general Paradise Mini tours. \u2026 Set up a Public Edible Park (PEP) + share traditional Allotments. We also have a small 15 m x 2m x 4m deep dam that is filled by the water table = great for garden watering + emergency + swimming + fish: My homemade solar hose-reel pump without battery = windscreen wiper motor drip-feeds garden when sunny. TREES Easily save Environments. My favorite reforestation trees should originally have been climate-depending TALL STRAIGHT FOOD TREES like mango, mulberries, edible pine & palm, candle-nut & other nut, drumstick, avocado etc. Thus food gardeners should plant the 1st lot & so pick loads of fruit for years; then convert to foresters or loggers for any tree as lumber. Food trees seem less fire-prone than others. SALT-TOLERANT FODDER & GREEN DESERTS: Plenty of food & other crop farm plants acclimatise to increasing salty water (tomatoes, barley). Amazingly on this island's tidal wetlands, typical normally dry-land big trees grow prolifically in tidal water - including coconuts! On a smaller scale, an American farmer detailed to ABC-TV how his terraced paddocks have slightly salty top field water growing salt-tolerant food trees & plants like mentioned tomatoes & barley; increasingly salty water then irrigates the next lower area for even more salt-tolerant plants; until near the bottom, where salt is mined for commercial sale, he grows seaweeds or tidal greens as on this island which would be goat-suitable, yet don't taste salty! Also on this island in the tidal area are long tufts of very green grass that don\u2019t taste salty; ideal for feeding goats etc by digging little inlets where desert often meets the ocean. Buried seaweed is ideal desert fertiliser. During the 1970s a strong British group called Green Deserts grew normal fruit trees in Sahara etc by building a small mud brick wall around each plant; plastic under the plant held the water & seaweed, urine etc was another fertiliser. Very successful! Many of our local big areas are stuffed with rapid-growing impenetrable jungle. TO KEEP WARM IN COLDEST WINTERS: 3 layers of box cardboard insulates on floors under carpets. Also on walls behind Book cases & cupboards against walls facing outside + in ceilings. Long socks on your hands are wonderful in bed etc. Hotwater bottle covered in a knitted bag keeps bed warm all night. Our 46 watt solar panel provides total house power including summer fridge which if outside, will be OFF all winter, blender, fans, LEDs, pumps, TV & radio etc; but best of all a bed warmer comprising a rheostat - variable power resistor - inside a MILO or big coffee can which is placed in the bed. Save bathwater there till cold to warm house a little. In bed we have all 3 meals as well as watch TV, use computer & phone, read books, play & listen to music + radio etc. Our single-stick ait preheating & afterburning Helixtove with flu heats wonders with no wood chopping. Huge sun-facing windows with night curtains. Or like our Cornwall UK home having long sun-facing glassed veranda that over-heated entire winter home to summer temps; door to house had wide slit above & below, covered at night.Wellington gumboots are real warm outside; fill with water & walk around for a few minutes to clean boots & your feet. Migrate to warm Hawaii, New Zealand, Fiji, Vanuatu or Australia where we virtually have every day cloudless, no violence or guns etc & bananas that ripen all winter in Queensland State. KEEP COOL: The object is to cool the occupants not necessarily the house. Roof insulation + summer shade trees are essential. There is a passive breeze cooler consisting of square meters of bottomless plastic bottles in Bangladesh. We hand-spray our T-shirt with water, then have a small fan playing on the moist T-shirt in real heat waves, that usually gets too cold & we have to slow or redirect the fan. With 2 or 4 watt car fan playing on bare legs is much cooler than if fan playing on face, arms etc; fans can often save more than \u00bd air conditioning power that we find unnecessary even in Queensland. Ceiling cooling fans set on 1 or 2 are perfect. Our sea breezes via open windows & doors are generally sufficient. For low-humidity areas we have a tiny 12volt water evaporator; big home units are very economical & take little power to supply cool air ducted around to each room. For outside in the sun, my favorite is a white hat topped with a small solar PV panel powering a cute little fan built into the front brim. Air Conditioning: Simply have a fan blow air into a bucket of ice if available. Cool water drinks help + cool water swim or garden hose spray. All these replies are using the wrong type of inefficient fridge. Our old unit TOP-LOADING FRIDGE: Homemade most efficient 40L plastic trash drum = 12 volt, 2.3 average-watt unit under house, in breeze & shade + part-buried & never in hot kitchen, with 15 cms polyurethane foam all around; uses 30 times less annual energy than other fridges + good ice maker. Power from a car battery used for entire 12-volt house that is charged by the 46 watt solar panel. Fridge takes about 2 days to cool down. In cool climates, this outside fridge can be permanently off during winter. The unit uses a 12 volt DANFOSS Danish kit compressor system. ",
