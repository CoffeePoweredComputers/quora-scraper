            "answer_text": "Yes, I'm absolutely confident that Armenia does have a bright future, though not during the next 7-10 years. The only thing that keeps Armenia poor is the criminal government. With a proper government it would be the best place to live on the earth. Armenia produces the best eco food on the planet, has great nature, good weather, vast resources of drinking water, very friendly people, etc. Most people don't value these much, but I clearly understand that these are the most important things, and so do many others. There are about 12.000-20.000(and growing) software engineers in Armenia now. The number of software engineers was exponentially growing for many years, but the growth was slowed down by the high numbers of migrants leaving Armenia. The migration was crazy during 90s, because even the best software engineers were paid somewhere around 300$-400$/month, which was substantially less than a salary in US or Europe. Now the situation has changed, a good engineer can ask for 2000-3000$/month salary, which is perfect, taking into account the low living expenses.  During the last years, I personally started to see engineers return to Armenia. I'm actually one of them, I came back to permanently live in Armenia after working in Google's Zurich office. And many others did so as well. About 90% of software engineers who left Armenia dream to come back one day, and they will certainly do soon. Also the startup era has started here, and we've got a few startups that look great.  If we keep the exponential grows of engineers at a level of 30%/year, we'll have about 200.000 engineers in 10 years, which will be more than enough enough clever, free and relatively rich people to push the government for a change. Once the government is changed economy will grow exponentially for a few years, and lots of people who wanted to get back to Armenia will do so. This will result to even higher jump of economy and will be the start of the bright future of Armenia.  This is how I see it, and I'm pretty confident that this is what's going to happen. A lot of minor bad things will happen meanwhile, but I think the important thing to measure about a country, to predict its future, is the growth rate of the number of clever, creative and free people, which I think grows exponentially here.
