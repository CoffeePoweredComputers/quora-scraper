            "answer_text": "Satellite communications , is a field of communications that depends on satellites. A satellite is considered as a relay station , that receives data signals from a ground base station , amplify and process it , then send it to another ground station , or a user node / user equipment (UE). Some satellites are passive satellites , which only amplifies the received signal and send back to a ground station , while active satellites recieves the uplink signal , to decode it , amplify it , then encode it again , and send it to a ground station. Satellite technology is good for some places with no cellular of wired coverage of communication networks , so it appears as a cheaper and reliable candidate for such situations. ",
