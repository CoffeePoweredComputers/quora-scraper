            "answer_text": "AirPods Love or Hate them, they have very quickly become The Most Popular Wireless Headphones in the World. That\u2019s not even an exaggeration, they\u2019re everywhere now. Apple\u2019s AirPods aren\u2019t just a set of convenient Bluetooth headphones, they are a full-on millennial status symbol. I suspect not even Apple expected these things to get big the way they did. A sequel was inevitable and now we have got the Apple AirPods 2. These are Apple\u2019s second-generation AirPods, while these might look and fit the same as the ones we have had for years now. However, They pack a handful of subtle improvements inside these tiny white shells. You can Read Full Review Here  ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what is the definition of good means to you. The question itself is contradictory. if you want to know that should you upgrade it over the first generation, well, let's see why and why not? (the answer is hidden in the zest) The Airpods 2 has a few enhancements, major and noticeable one is \u201cHey Siri\u201d but I believe we can live without it, (lets put these hands to some good use). An extra hour of battery doesn't matter much to us, of course. And the wireless charging case can be bought separately for $79. (very easy if you have in-laws in the states). Rest everything is same as the first generation! ",
