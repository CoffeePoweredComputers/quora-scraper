            "answer_text": "Ars Technica publishes news and analysis and in-depth reviews in laid back, readable prose. Many know the site for it\u2019s artful, almost book-length reviews of each version of Apple\u2019s OS X operating system.  The Wirecutter is a sanity saver for geeks who are trying to focus their attention on business IT. The Wirecutter does the hard job of thoroughly reviewing and recommending the lesser evils in electronics, even in categories like those terrible smart TVs you really shouldn\u2019t allow on your home or office network. Harvard Business Review is perfect reading for someone who finds themselves in the peculiar situation of managing people. Published by a non-profit subsidiary of its namesake prestige business school, HBR offers something for most people who find themselves with the professional need to keep their minds busy with ways to improve how they go about helping people do their jobs. Because that\u2019s what leadership is, right? MIT Technology Review is what you\u2019d hope for based on the association with the university. It\u2019s indeed a popularized, yet deep thinking publication that mines the latest knowledge and insights in technology. One really good showcase of the publication is their coverage of automation, such as this story about its impact on the job market.  Smallnetbuilder is the site to go to before buying home and small business network gear. The sites features news, but is simply priceless for its in-depth guides and depth reviews of Wi-Fi routers, storage servers, switches and the like. Right now, we\u2019re really digging their smart home reviews. Anandtech is a long-running, in-depth site for tech people. Don\u2019t read Anandtech to get the big picture. Rather, open it every now and then and look for interesting products to see them reviewed in massive detail. For example, Andandtech\u2019s review of the iPhone 6S will probably teach you more about the market for mobile chips than other sites will for years. Hacker News is a brilliant, community run site with user submitted links to the best stories on programming languages, industry trends and culture. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I use Flipboard: The one place for all your interests, Pocket, WIRED, and Quora of course. The good thing about most of the services I use above are that they have daily or weekly email subscriptions. This sends you an email every once in a while with great articles about the latest news in technology and many other fields. On Flipboard, you choose your interest and it generates articles based on your interest. I find this extremely useful since there\u2019s always an article that tends to catch my eye and their daily emails are absolutely fantastic. I would urge you to combine Flipboard with Pocket and Wired to get the most out of it. With Pocket you can save articles to read later and their daily emails will send you a list of the most viewed and top articles which of course contains tech news. ",
