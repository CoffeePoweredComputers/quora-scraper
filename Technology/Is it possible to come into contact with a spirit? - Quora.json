            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by \"spirit.\"  Do you mean ghost? Or angel? Or demon? I tend to be skeptical of anyone who claims to come in contact with \"spirits,\" because, as was stated earlier by Marcus Geduld, we have no evidence of spirits, or ghosts, or whatever you'd care to call them. Now, if by spirit you mean the Christian Holy Spirit, or other religious moral agent, you may be able to make a philosophical argument (though people will most likely argue the exact name of this phenomena, possibly preferring the term \"conscience\"). But for those who do claim that spirits do indeed exist and can be seen/felt in the physical universe, they should be subject to the laws of science.  After all the \"sightings\" of ghosts or hauntings or spiritual beings, those who claim to have engaged with these beings bear the burden of proof, and I personally have not heard a convincing enough argument to suggest that there is such a thing as spirits, and we can come into contact with them.

            "answer_text": "Yes of course, but do you want to, what does contact in the real world doesn't provide you what contact with the spirit world would. And if you are capable to make contact with the spirit persons (which is not easy), they are people like us but then in spirit state, it is not without danger. If you contact a bad person, the chance is that he or he will posses you. Just to feel the warmth of the body, food, alcohol, sex etc. If he or she can, he or she will try to give you thoughts to fulfill their needs. To the point that they can take over the conscious control of your body. Or give you violent thoughts, just for their pleasure. Of course there are also many loving spirits. And many try to help their loved ones still on earth. But be careful. Maybe this book can be of help to you. http://www.theageofchrist.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=70_122_124&products_id=282 ",
