            "answer_text": "How are you able to gain subscribers on YouTube quickly? I'm a Youtuber 10 years until now, from my experience to get subscribers quite simple. Why do i say that ? There\u2019re various ways to get YouTube subscribers fast and views. To complete reach it, I am going to tell you a few different ways, then understand all these methods well and use them on your YouTube channel and on other videos. If you use these methods well, you will be able to raise your YouTube channel in the fastest possible time. 1. Create Amazing Content Inspired content is the kind the viewers want, regardless of the niche because no matter how much support you are getting from paid advertisement, your efforts are futile if viewers does not find it compelling. To get the most out of your content, you have to determine your audience. Create the kind of quality that revolves around them. Know what they want, and you will know what you have to generate. Exciting content does not have to come from you all the time. There will come a time when ideas escape you. If you are having a hard time coming up with one, you can scroll through the comments section. It is a pool of many ideas. If not, engage the viewers to leave ideas because that is one of the ways how to get the most views on YouTube \u2013 creating content that your viewers suggest, because that means, that is something would be interested in. 2. Allow Embedding You must be generous with your video is you want to reach more people. That is gained through sharing, and it can only be done if you allow your video to be embedded. This gives your viewers the chance to share your content on their blog or on their social media accounts giving you more reach to audience that you may not have intended the video for. However, these are always a welcomed addition. To enable embedding, just head over to your creator studio and click advanced settings. Under distribution settings, ensure that a tick is on Allow Embedding, otherwise, this will not be possible. 3. Use Other Platforms to Your Advantage Social media is the single most powerful tool in this day and age. Its use could make or a break an internet personality\u2019s presence online. In effect, it is also one of the ways how to views in YouTube. What this does is give you access to audiences from across the world who you may not have from within your locality. Also, it gives you a better chance of getting an audience, especially with the varied niches that you might be into. All you need to do is set-up a page for yourself, and just share constantly the videos that you upload. Once you are big enough, sometimes, they do it for you. However, if they do not, you do not have to worry because websites or applications such as Hootsuite and Buffer can help upload them on platforms based on a set date. Remember that the only way to maximize YouTube is to remember that it was never a standalone platform, and that is its networking power. 4. Quality Over Quantity Quality should always be at the forefront of your channel. That is why it is a must to have compelling videos, otherwise, viewers leave just as soon as they see what you have to offer. Why is this important ? In today\u2019s YouTube algorithm, Watch Time is more important than views alone. This is the span of time that a person stays to watch your video, and the better the quality of your video is, the higher the chance of your viewers staying. You may also want to refer to other videos or channels within your niche. The platform rewards this with \u2018Watch Time Credits\u2019, which is again, credited to your channel. 5. Building a Network You cannot bring in viewers on your own. You need a community to back you up. Nurture a community. Engage with the audience. That is another way how to get more YouTube videos fast. It does not matter whether it is by simply giving a reply to comments left in your video or referring to another content creator within the same niche. You may even drop a comment if you think you should. Starting a conversation creates momentum, and that in turn brings out others who may have the same interests. As a result, the viewer counts rises. 6. It Starts with a Name You would think that a video platform has no use of SEO, but it does, and other than playlist names, sometimes, it all starts with a video\u2019s title. SEO is just as important in YouTube as it is in articles because, at the end of the day, people find results through a search engine run by an algorithm. That is why knowing the right keywords to use is a way how to get more views on to your YouTube channel. You can find the appropriate keywords to use through the suggestion box that appears when you key in the words in the search bar. You can also use websites, or applications, such as Google Trends and Google Adwords Keyword Planner. Also, you may want to keep your titles the lengths of 60 to 70 characters and use only those which relates to your video. Otherwise, YouTube will penalize your channel. 7. Optimize the Platform The internet is not somewhere you hide yourself. It is the place to expose yourself, and you only build yourself, and a community, if you let them know who you are and where to find you. Again, exposure is the key. That is why, if you can, add your social media platforms on your channel, maybe include your website as well if you have one. Experts also suggest that you enable other related content on the platform. Disabling \u2018Related Channels\u2019 is a common mistake that amateurs do. Not only does this deny the community of valuable content, but it also takes away your opportunity to be featured on the recommended page of YouTube, normally found on a viewer\u2019s home page. Self-promotion is never enough. It takes a community to build a brand. 8. A Strong Impression A first impression is not something you would expect in YouTube, but it does. This is through the use of engaging thumbnails which are the first things that a viewer sees when they log on to the platform. Long-time YouTubers would tell you to create customized thumbnails. This gives it more personality and would reflect your brand a lot more, identifying your brand without having to read who uploaded it. 9. Promote the Platform If you have not surmised it just yet, avoid promoting the videos alone. Promote your entire channel, and the platform instead. This can be done by adding a widget on your blog or on your website, if you have one. This gives viewers direct access to your channel with content that they may not have known existed, and see them devour each one, one video at a time. 10. Do Not be Afraid to be Human To show a human side every now and then is how you get more views on YouTube because viewers love a touch of vulnerability. Showing that you are human, and not just another person behind the screen is a way to make yourself relatable which is a strong marketing too in itself, especially today. 11. Grab the Trend Always a last resort, you can get the attention of many others by creating content that is currently trending online. Uploading your own version gets people curious, thus it converts into views. Always focus on what got you there, and that is the niche that you are currently in because that is your way of showing loyalty to those who made your channel what it is. ",

More Tips: Earn From Youtube Without Creating Your Own Videos! Narrow your audience. ...Create a trailer for your channel. ...Create an interesting profile. ...Choose searchable titles. ...Create better thumbnails. ...Add a watermark. ...Use YouTube's free analytics. ...Create consistent content.I know how frustrating it could be when you have 0 views and 0 subscribers. Your youtube channel, you are getting started, no one knows who you are yet and what kind of content you produce. You spend all that time planning and scripting and filming and editing the videos and you're all excited. You upload to youtube, only a few people watch it. I remember back then when I had 0 views and 0 subscribers and I would upload a video and I would wait and I would refresh a few times hopefully to get a few more views. So I know what it's like when you're starting from scratch. And I know a lot of my fans, that I inspire you to start your youtube channel. By the way, if you start your youtube channel because of following my work, comment below and let me know. I might just check out your youtube channel. So how do you grow with 0 views and 0 subscribers? See, in the publishing world, I've done a number of books and there's a joke that we talk about in the publishing world. Well, how do you become a best-selling author? Well, it's easy to become a best-selling author if you already have a best-seller, right? So meaning it's easy to grow your youtube channel if your youtube channel already has a lot of subscribers, and also you're already famous. Then it's easy for your videos to go viral or to get more views and get more eyeballs when you already have a big youtube channel. But what do you do if you're starting from scratch? So today I'm gonna share 5 secrets with you. If I were to start all over again, growing with 0 views and 0 subscribers, what are the 5 things that I would do? So make sure you stay until the very end. I'm gonna share one secret with you that will explode your subscribers and explode your views, are you ready? Let's go. YouTube secret number one. Hey Jarvis, do you remember what secret number one is? I believe it's use compelling titles, sir. Right, use compelling titles. You don't want to be boring. One of the biggest sins you could commit as a YouTubers is to have boring titles. Yes I know, there are YouTubers out there that they have boring titles and yet they still have millions and millions of followers, if you are Casey, that's a different story. Casey breaks every single rule and still has a massive following. But for most people who are starting from 0 views and 0 subscribers, you wanna have compelling titles for your videos because people are searching you. They don't know you yet. So let me give you some templates, some examples, because I got started as a copywriter. Remember back then when I was doing copyrighting, when I was writing any kind of titles, any kind of headlines, we call them. That we wanted to make it interesting. And one of the litmus test is, we ask ourselves, would this headline work in a classified ad. Yes, I know, newspaper, I'm my age, I get that, okay? But newspaper, people are flipping through the newspaper and they can see, okay, would this headline be compelling enough for people to read, wanting to find out more information. So it's the same thing. Let me give you some proven headlines or just some ideas when it comes to titles. Number one, how to. How to is always a very, very powerful title because people go on youtube, they wanna find out how do I do something? How to, it's a very, very powerful title. One of my videos that went kind of viral is how to make a thousand dollars a day using your smartphone. So it has a promise and also tells them hey, I will learn how to do something. So how to is a huge category on youtube. Second, it could be a variation of that, like how I. How I have done something. Another video that went viral for my channel is how I retired at the age of 27, where I kind of share my story, what I've done, some of the lessons I've learned. So that's another example. Another good example is secrets of. Secrets of. So people wanna know, right Jarvis, people wanna know. People want to know, sir. They wanna know what are the secrets. Secrets of. So example of one of my videos, the secret to closing more sales, that's another example. The secret of or secrets of. And if you have a specific number 3 or 4 or 5, that's even more powerful. Another example, warning type headline such as, I have this video called don't start a business until you watch this or don't start your youtube channel until you watch this. It's kind of like a warning, hey, don't do that until you watch this video. You see how it's very much curiosity driven? Or, one more example and that is a headline, a title that is outcome driven. Example, the most dangerous animals in the world. Oh, that's interesting. You see, that has a very particular, very precise, very specific pay off. When your viewers click on that video before they even click on that video, they know exactly what they are going to get. Now when your channel is small, right? When you have 0 views and 0 subscribers, when you use a title like hey, my trip to Europe. Nobody gives a damn. Because no one knows who you are yet, right? And once you have millions of followers and subscribers, sure, my trip to Europe, your fans want to know hey, what is going on, I wanna know. Those vlogging type videos you will get attraction. But in the beginning, it's much more difficult to get traction if you are not well known. So why not focus a topic that people are already searching for, right? Using how to, using warning, using secrets of, right? Using those proven titles. That way you'll grow much, much faster. YouTube secret number two. Hook them with a youtube trailer. Think about your favorite movie, right, before it comes out. You're all excited. The movie company, what did they do, they release a trailer. They give you some of the best scenes from the movie so you're looking forward when the movie comes out. You should do the same thing for your youtube channel. So you have your first time visitor going to your channel, going to the homepage of your channel. They could click on it and they could see what your channel is about. Robert Cialdini, his book Influence, The Psychology of Persuasion. He talks about why you need to give them a reason to do something. People need to know, they need to have a reason why they need to do it. It's not enough to say hey, my content is fantastic, my videos are fantastic that you should subscribe. It's not good enough. So in your trailer tell them who you are, what you're about, how often you upload, why should they subscribe and exactly what you want them to do. Now would it be helpful if I give you some kind of a script for your trailer, comment below. Yes, here we go. You could say something like this. Hey, my name is blank. I am an entrepreneur, I'm a blogger, I'm a travel enthusiast, whatever it might be. I am a blank, right? When you subscribe to my channel, you tell them you're gonna get X, Y, Z. What are the benefits, why should we subscribe. Hey, you're gonna learn more about this, you're gonna learn more about that, you're gonna get this kind of value. You gotta tell people that, right? And also tell them every single week I upload one video, two videos or every single Tuesday and Thursday I will upload a video for you. Tell them the frequency of your uploads so they know what to expect. And don't forget to tell people exactly what you want them to do, don't assume because you have good content, oh, they'll naturally subscribe. No, you gotta tell them, so tell them hey, click the little button here, subscribe or click on the button there, subscribe to my youtube channel today. And make sure you hit the bell. Make sure you turn on the notifications. You got to tell them what to do. You got it? Secret number three and that is fall in love with your fans, not your content. One of the biggest mistakes a lot of YouTubers make, they make videos that they want to make instead of making videos that your fans want. You see it's very easy to forget that there's another human being behind this, watching you. You look at the thumbs up, you look at the numbers, you look at the views, you look at subscribers and you think it's just a digit, well it's not just a digit, let me tell you this. Behind this, there's a person. There's a human being with feelings, emotions and struggles. Never forget that. Don't ever, ever treat your fan like a digit. It's very important and I think one of the reasons why my series Boss in the Bentley did so well on youtube, because it's Q&A, it's my fans, you, submitting a question. And I answer them, I interact and I comment. That makes a huge difference. So you have to care about your fans. Another thing that you could do is as a creator, as a YouTubers, you could give your fans comment a heart. To let them know, and when you do that, your fan who left a comment would actually get a notification that you have given them a heart. Sometimes I know, when I read your comments, I give you a heart, and my fans, you're thinking, is that really you, Dan did you just give me a heart? Yes, it's really me. I think any YouTubers when they think they're too big and they're too popular and they no longer connect with their fans, they're not gonna last long. YouTube secret number four. Have a CTA in your video. What does CTA stand for? Call to action. Call to action, you have to tell your viewers exactly what you want them to do. Do you want them to share your video, do you want them to give you a thumbs up, do you want them to comment below on your video. You have to tell them exactly what to do. Never ever assume. You see, one of the things that I did when I started telling my viewers, you, to click on the button below and subscribe to my channel, I saw a significant jump in terms of subscribers that I get. At first I thought, hey, if you love my content, don't you naturally subscribe? People don't do that. And there are many ways you can do this. There are many ways you can insert a call to action. Example, you can do it before, during and after. So, in the beginning of your video you can say something like hey, if this is first time viewer watching my video or this is the first time you are visiting my channel, make sure you hit the subscribe button. You could do something like that. Or in the middle, right? During your video you could say hey, if you want me to teach you more about this, you want me to share more about this experience, you want me to make more of this kind of video, make sure you comment below and hey, don't forget to subscribe. Or you can also do it at the end, of course don't overdo this, you don't wanna do it three, four times, that's a bit overkill. But at the end of your video, you could say something like hey, don't forget to subscribe to my channel. Make sure you hit the subscribe button below and click on the bell. And turn on the notifications, it's very important that you ask them to turn on the notifications. It means that every single time you release a video, there's a chance that they will see it on their homepage. The subscribers feed. So then they are more likely to click on your video. So call to action. YouTube secret number five, and that is long term consistency trumps short term intensity. I think most YouTubers, they give up too soon. They upload some videos, or they upload a dozen videos and then they give up because they are saying to themselves, no one is watching my video, I'm not getting enough views, no comment, why? I spent so much time making these videos. I know how you feel. I know how sucky it is when you upload a video and you spend all that time, you're creating that perfect piece of content and then no one watches your video but you have to stay consistent. You have to think that this is a long term game. Think of it as like you're pushing a snowball uphill, right. In the beginning it's very, very heavy. And you keep pushing and you keep pushing but once you hit that tipping point, once you go over the mountain, the hump. Everything becomes so much faster. Like this snowball effect. I still remember what took me before, months, the amount of views it took me months to get, now I could get it in hours. Why, because of the snowball effect. I promise you, if you upload two times a week instead of one time, your channel will grow faster. If you upload three times a week instead of two times, your channel will grow even faster. My channel exploded the minute I commit to a daily upload. Now I'm not saying that you have to upload a video every single day, but that works. That long term consistency absolutely trumps that short term intensity. Do it long term, think of this as a long term game. You're investing, you're building an asset. You're building a platform. It is absolutely worth it. So those are the five secrets on how to grow with 0 views and 0 subscribers, I have so many more secrets I wanna share with you, in fact I'm doing a special online event. A virtual event that you could participate. Called youtube secrets. Click the link here, or here and get your ticket today. ",
