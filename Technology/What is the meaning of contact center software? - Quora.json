            "answer_text": "Essentially, contact centers provide the means for omnichannel support. They revolve around several channels - live chat, email, phone calls, or text messages, just to name a few. Such centers are usually seen as a core of a business, especially when its customers are demanding and active across various digital channels. Contact center software is what actually powers such contact centers.  In order to create your own contact center and offer a seamless service across the channels, you should choose between a single omnichannel support solution like LiveAgent (this way, you don\u2019t need to pay for more than one tool) and a few dedicated tools that can be integrated with one another. In both cases, you will be able to keep all the important details in one place and serve your customers in a fast & efficient manner - which is why contact center software exists in the first place.
