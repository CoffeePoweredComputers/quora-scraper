            "answer_text": "Well engineers have spent the last few decades examining markings in and around the pyramids figuring out where the scaffolding would have been placed. They also found evidence of basic pulley style cranes being used to move raw materials built into the pyramids then removed as construction advanced. This would have sped construction considerably compared to the original estimates making it much more likely to have a pyramid constructed within a few decades rather then over the course of an entire lifetime. Additionally the use of simple rolling logs or other rounded objects would have made moving large carved stone blocks trivially easy until they had to be moved up the slight inclined ramps setup surrounding the pyramids. Geologists have been examining the stone used to build the pyramids to determine its origins. The results have been intriguing as it appears that over time different stones from different parts of the empire were used. Limestone came from Giza, Basalt from the Fayoum Depression, Alabaster from Luxor, and Granite from Aswan. This suggest either a difference of taste over time or the various pharoahs trying to one-up each other. The use of natural rivers as well as simple canals and lock systems to raise them as needed is suspected based on the remains along certain water ways. Archeologists are determining who each pyramid was built for, when the gypsum was stripped off some of them for resale giving them their current appearance, when and how designs changed with the ages, and of course what purpose they served. In simple terms it seems the pyramids were used as a connection to the stars which the egyptians had charted and bore significance in their religion as well as being used to house items for use in the afterlife as per their religious beliefs. Sociologists meanwhile are hard at work discerning who specifically built the pyramids. We know the egyptians were the ones who commissioned them but it was long put down to slave labor based upon the myths found in the torah and the bible. More recent study however suggests that slaves only did a small fraction of the unskilled labor involved likely the quarrying of stone or the production of plasters or mud bricks. These would have been used both for the pyramids as well as many other projects around egypt. In actuality the main construction would have been done by professional masons who were effectively in the middle-upper class of egyptian society being well paid and trained professionals. But there is one thing they all agree on. The pyramids are an entirely man made series of structures created through the combined efforts of a lot of people. They use basic machinery like as mentioned pulley style cranes, scaffolding, and a heck of a lot of manual labor for the actual construction just like every other pyramid building society before or since. Additionally they were designed by very knowledgeable architects whose methods and understanding would end up being lost with the collapse of the civilization needing to be reinvented or discovered decades later. Nothing magical or alien about it though admittedly this is more of a time sink then anyone in the modern world is likely to willingly engage in which is probably what makes them seem so unbelievable.

            "answer_text": "Simple geometry and a lot of hard work. What gets lost in breathless accounts of the tolerances to which the pyramids are built and the fineness of the stonework is that those aren\u2019t actually very hard to achieve if you\u2019ve got decent stonemasons and you\u2019re willing to put in a vast amount of labor. The blocks which make up the pyramids are basically all built with straight lines and a lot of them use right angles. These are, in terms of the technological development of masonry and stone cutting, about the first things you learn to do. It takes a lot of chipping and grinding and polishing to get faces completely flat and even, but since it does take a lot of labor, it\u2019s actually pretty difficult to overcorrect and take off more than you need to. Flat surfaces: not that hard. The frequently over-stated quality of the masonry in the pyramids is often taken to imply \u201clost technologies\u201d or aliens or stuff like that, so when the topic comes up, I like to point to another building to illustrate how insanely precise hand-built masonry can get:  This is the Parthenon in Athens. Believe it or not, there\u2019s not a single right angle or straight line in the place. The sides bulge slightly, describing arcs which are sections of circles which are miles in diameter. The columns all tilt inward slightly, following lines which converge several miles above the building. And there are various other angles, curves, and other bits which are slightly off from straight and even. Why? The Greeks figured out that a building made with straight lines and right angles wouldn\u2019t look like it had straight lines and right angles. Strange but true. So they invented a bunch of optical illusions. This required vastly more complex and precise work than in the pyramids. Rather than following straight lines, which can easily be marked out with levels, taut cords, and the like, they had to come up with ways of producing very slight, precise curves and very slight angles. These techniques continued to be used in other Greek and Roman temples, and we know a lot about them from Roman architectural manuals. And it was all done like the pyramids: geometry and a lot of labor. ",
