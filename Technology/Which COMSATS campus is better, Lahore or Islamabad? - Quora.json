            "answer_text": "Better in what terms? The architecture of the place or the teaching criteria? Every department works differently according to their context. So maybe research the specific department in both the campuses and select the one that suits you. Only you know what you want. However I did architecture from the Lahore campus and I've visited the architecture department in Islamabad. The standard of work depends on the teachers you get that year and your peers. Although I find Islamabad department better apart from the never ending stairs. That could be a nightmare for an architecture student because we're always carrying lots of stuff around. The Lahore campus is more extrovert, more semi enclosed areas, wider corridors, no stairs. But it doesn't have any views as you'd get in Islamabad. Things like that matter if you're in a creative field. The department at Lahore allows more interaction as it's one big hallway surrounded by all the classes. You display your work there, arrange small events, or just sit outside of your class and work. The one at Islamabad is a bit enclosed in this regard with classes somewhat spread out. I'm terms of food and cafeterias, the one at Lahore wins by a long shot. You just have too many options. So research them both and decide accordingly. Be specific about what you're looking for. ",

            "answer_text": "Islamabad Campus:  Lahore Campus:  I would like to add few more points to this thread. Being the student of Islamabad campus, I have observed a few advantages of studying here as compared to the rest of Comsats\u2019 campuses: You will notice student diversity. You will meet students from all over Pakistan (from Karachi to Skardu).It has a competitive environment. Students are hard-working and grades don\u2019t come easily. Management keeps a strong check on education quality (Main Campus thingy).Faculty of Islamabad campus is highly qualified and most of them have foreign degrees.Islamabad campus is more serene and the weather of this city throughout the year makes it the more study-friendly place.A Few Disadvantages: The living is expensive as compared to Lahore. Hostel rent ranges from Rs. 7,000 to 20,000 (~Rs. 10,000 average) depending upon the facilities.Travelling expenses are way more than that. Because having a motorbike in Islamabad is never a suitable option. Roads are wider, hence, the traffic is speedy. Moreover, the winter season makes it more challenging to ride a motorbike in early mornings/ late nights.The campus is like 7km away from the main city (the sectors) so you don\u2019t really get to live in REAL Islamabad.",
