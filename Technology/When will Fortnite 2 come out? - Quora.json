            "answer_text": "Not for a fair few years after Fortnite is actually complete, which it technically still isn\u2019t. It\u2019s still in active development despite being out for 2 years and Save the World\u2019s story still hasn\u2019t been done. I can see it coming out of it\u2019s beta phase at some point in the next 12 months and maybe after that, they might start the very early stages of pre-production on a follow up but even then that means that a sequel could be 5 years plus out from that to account for development time. That could be pushed back even further if the success of Fortnite continues to last as it has rendering a sequel surplus to requirement if people are still playing their game. So for a guess with a liberal margin of error, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a follow up for another 6+ years. ",

They\u2019re just going to keep updating fortnite, theres no point in making a second fortnite because no one would switch over to that and start buying skins all over again. This is coming from a season 1 player with purple skull trooper that has spent a lot of money on the game. I cannot emphasize the word \u201c a lot\u201d enough in this context. ",
