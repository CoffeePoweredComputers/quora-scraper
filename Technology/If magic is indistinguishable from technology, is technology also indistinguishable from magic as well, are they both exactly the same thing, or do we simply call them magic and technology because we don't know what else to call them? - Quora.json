            "answer_text": "You\u2019re mistaken when you state that neither magic nor technology are distinguishable from one another\u2026 they are two completely different things. You may be thinking of Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s \u201cLaws\u201d: When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, they are almost certainly right. When they state that something is impossible, they are very probably wrong.The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.That third one may be what you\u2019re thinking of. Much of what we know and understand today used to be ascribed to gods. Thunder? That was the gods bowling in heaven. Lightning? Zeus was angry at mortals, so he was hurling bolts to punish them. The path of the sun across the sky? It was being pulled behind a big chariot. If you demonstrated a lighter to a caveman, you would amaze and frighten him. Who can create fire in their hands?!? If you pumped music from an MP3 player into a bluetooth speaker in the days of the Renaissance, Shakespeare himself would call it miraculous. Music without any instruments! Medical science is a great example \u2014 we can fix and heal things that would have caused certain death just a few years ago. We\u2019ve managed to leave the planet. We\u2019ve put men on the moon. If you don\u2019t understand something that\u2019s going on (or the technology behind it), it may well look like \u201cmagic\u201d to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology is the result of human invention, innovation and generally based upon accepted and understood principles. Magic (in terms of mysticism) appeals to a spiritual/supernatural understanding of the \u2018way the Cosmos\u2019 is. Perhaps Technology is based on that which is rational, demonstrable and accepted. Magic is subjective, not demonstrable in any consistent way and not widely accepted. Technology is chalk - useable, transferable and tangible which supports interaction with the physical Magick is smoke - nebulous, not easily graspable and apparently clouds interaction with the physical. Technology is the realm of the rational and objective. Magic is the realm of the mystical and spiritual. If advanced technology looks like magic, it is still technology even if of a type we don\u2019t understand (yet)\u2026 Magic is a system of beliefs and practices by definition sitting outside of the realm of science.
