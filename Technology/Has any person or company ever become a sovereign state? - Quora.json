            "answer_text": "The British East India Company would seem to come close.  By 1803, at the height of its rule in India, the British East India Company had a private army of about 260,000\u2014twice the size of the British Army, with Indian revenues of \u00a313,464,561 (equivalent to \u00a3225.3 million in 2018) and expenses of \u00a314,017,473 (equivalent to \u00a3234.5 million in 2018). The company eventually came to rule large areas of India with its private armies, exercising military power and seizing administrative functions. Company rule in India effectively began in 1757 and lasted until 1858, when, following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown's assuming direct control of the Indian subcontinent in the form of the new British Raj. However British law established that its legal sovereignty was on behalf of the Crown and not separate sovereignty in its own right. In particular British law was still supreme: the Company could not pass its own laws. In some areas, the Company administered civil law, but criminal law generally stayed with either the local ruler or the British government. Before that, Dutch Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (a.k.a. Dutch East India Company).  Some excerpts from the Wikipedia page: The Company, for nearly 200 years of its existence (1602\u20131800), had effectively transformed itself from a corporate entity into a state or an empire in its own right ... The company was historically an exemplary company-state rather than a pure for-profit corporation. and In its foreign colonies, the VOC possessed quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, strike its own coins, and establish colonies. The VOC had its own flag, which is a combination of the Dutch flag at that time. ",
