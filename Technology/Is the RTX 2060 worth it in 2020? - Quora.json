            "answer_text": "If the rumours about the upcoming next-generation \u201cAmpere\u201d based Nvidea cards are true then none of the RTX cards are worth it in 2020. The big feature of the RTX series is supposed to be real-time ray tracing. However, on the current-gen cards, games that support ray tracing have a lower FPS when you turn on RT than when you don\u2019t. It\u2019s as if the RT is a bottleneck within the card itself. If the rumours are to be believed then the next-gen of \u201cAmpere\u201d based cards the RT performance has been massively improved to the point where games with RT will run at the same speed with RT enabled as they do with RT disabled. There is even the suggestion that with RT enabled that the current-gen top-end card, the RTX 2080 ti will only perform as well as the next-gen RTX 3060 or whatever the base model ends up being called. However, with RT turned off the 2080 ti will trounce the 3060. If all this is true or some approximation thereof, then it means that the real-time ray tracing features of the current-gen RTX cards are more akin to a technology demo than a usable feature. When the next-gen is released and assuming the AMD RDNA2 technology in the next-gen consoles and Radeon GPUs is on a similar level, then it means games designed for the next-gen hardware probably will need next-gen graphics cards to be playable with RT enabled. In short, the RT features of the current-gen cards will need to be disabled to get a decent frame rate unless you have a 2080 Ti. That means that if you disregard the ray tracing features of the RTX series of graphics cards then they no longer compare favourably to AMDs 5600 XT and 5700 XT cards in the middle ground. If you want ray tracing features then wait until the \u201cAmpere\u201d GPUs are released \u00a3350 (or local equivalent) is going to get you a lot more ray tracing bang for your buck with the next-gen cards than the current-gen.

            "answer_text": "My evga gtx 970 has served me well for over 6 years. I play 1080p and haven\u2019t been interested in any new cards till now. I only upgrade when there is a need too. I have friends who upgrade just because something has been released lol. Like how folks by Madden games. More power to them. I will probably get a 3060 whenever they come out. Whichever model has 8gb of vid ram. It will be a great upgrade to the 970 and will last me another 6 years. The 970 was one of the few times that nVidia actually gave you more for the money (despite the ram speed debacle). Especially if 2k and 4k aren\u2019t needed. The 2060 in all its forms costs way too much, but nVidia is enjoying a no real competition zone now (lets hope AMD and Intel knock it out the box). As witnessed by their recent \u2018launch\u2019 or whatever you want to call that. They know they are heavily in demand and folks will shell out big bucks to get video cards that have 2015 size video RAM still. Then they will hit these same people with the TI\u2019s and Super editions which should have been the base releases. it\u2019s crazy but it works for them They don\u2019t care who buys their cards. Bots, scalpers, miners, actual gamers. Its all money to them. Prices will remain ridiculous. I\u2019d wait if you have a card that gives you a decent playing experience. Only games that give me trouble are games that are poorly optimized, like Ubisoft's stuff. But I can get a decent frame rates on high settings without losing too much image bling, plus I\u2019m trying to go through my back steam catalog now anyway and those games are less demanding. I refuse to purchase video cards every 2 years. Wild stuff. ",
