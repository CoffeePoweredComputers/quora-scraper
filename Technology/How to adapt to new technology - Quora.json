Connect with tech savvy people and ask them what\u2019s hot right now\u2026 Those are some of the OFFLINE stuff you could do. Listen to podcasts. Especially This Week In Tech \u2014 if you listen to this podcast, you\u2019ll be ahead of 90% of the people in terms of being aware of the latest tech. The key element around new technology is attention. If you observe what people pay attention to, you\u2019ll get clues into interesting trends. Uncertainty is the only form of certainty and you are already ahead of a lot of people by simply asking this question. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to go about that, same as it would be for learning a new language, is immersion.  I may be young, but even I find myself behind technological trends with the rate at which they change these days, and I've realized that the only way to keep up is to maintain awareness of what new things are out there through tech websites (Engadget, for example) and tech forums online.  Once something new comes up, the quickest way to learn it is through playing with that technology--be it an app, software, whathaveyou. You dive right in and learn as you go.  The most important thing is to just be willing to try, and keep an open mind. That same thing holds true for technology, and any element of society. Otherwise you quickly become a \"Back in my day...\" curmudgeon. ",
