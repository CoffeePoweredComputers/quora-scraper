            "answer_text": "The easiest method without rooting your phone, assuming you have Android or iOS, would be to use Mobizen.  There are other softwares and applications out there, but in my experience, Mobizen is the easiest and most reliable.  It'll give you full control of your phone via computer and is pretty easy to use.   Aside from that, there's also TeamViewer, Vysor Chrome app (Android and Chrome), and AirDroid.  Vysor (currently in Beta) worked alright, but again, I've never had reliable experiences with any of those.  Some days I couldn't connect, other days it worked perfectly, and some days it would connect then suddenly disconnect.  But again, these were my experiences, and things tend to change from phone to phone and computer to computer and person to person.
