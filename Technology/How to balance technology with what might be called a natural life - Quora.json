            "answer_text": "How about making technology, just a part of the natural life. That is what I am doing. I am not balancing a real and virtual world. I have very Earth and human loving tendencies in my heart. Instead of 'just keeping it in my heart', using the technology through a blog, Quora answers, website and an entrepreneurship, I am bringing it to the world and sharing it with all. I am making my 'natural life' expansive, it is encompassing even my virtual life. All embracing natural life! Moving from one thing to another becomes seamless. All the very best! Regards, Swaroopa.

What \u201cmight be called a natural life\u201d for humans \u2014 who are tool-users, after all \u2014 would be one where we clearly differentiated between the tools we need, and the tools we want. I have a whole basement full of tools, including probably a dozen different hand saws and at least four hammers. Realistically speaking, I only need one of each. But no, I\u2019m not giving up the others! ",
