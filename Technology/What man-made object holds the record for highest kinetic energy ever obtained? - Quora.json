            "answer_text": "The fastest thing ever implemented by the hands of human beings are the protons in the beam of the LHC. According to the LHC beams page they are moving at a top speed of 0.999999991 of c. Yet the beam \u201conly\u201d carries 362MJ of energy. That\u2019s a lot, enough to move an aircraft carrier, as the page points out. But we can do better. There are 5 human-made objects with solar escape velocity: two Pioneer program - Wikipedia spacecraft, two Voyager program - Wikipedia spacecraft, and New Horizons - Wikipedia. Each of these is moving at least 15,000 m/s relative to their launch point, and each weights between roughly 100 kg and 1000 kg. 15,000 squared is 225 million, so we have 1/2 * (m in kilograms) * 225 million. That gives an answer in the tens of gigajoules for each of these craft. But the ISS is going pretty fast too, over 7,500 meters per second. Squaring that gives 56 million. And it weighs more than 400,000 kg. So that\u2019s at least:0.5 * (4 * 10^5) * (56 * 10^6) joules,or about 100 * 10^11 joules, or 10 trillion joules. The right answer seems to be more like 11 trillion. That\u2019s probably the winner. ",
