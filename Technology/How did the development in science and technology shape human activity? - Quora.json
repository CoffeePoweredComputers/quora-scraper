            "answer_text": "Development in science and technology shaped human history in many ways. It enabled us to share ideas much faster around the country and then around the world. (Now we\u2019re transmitting messages into space in the hope that we\u2019ll contact someone there.) That started with the wheel, which also allowed us to establish economies with other places, carting our supplies to and fro. We developed boats that let us actually cross oceans, exchanging supplies and ideas and animals. When the technology became weapons, it enabled us to conquer other countries and kill far more people far more rapidly. Science enabled us to eventually save more lives. During the Civil War, Confederate prisoners who were wounded were more likely to survive than Union wounded, because we ignored the boys in grey and maggots cleaned up the bacteria in their wounds. Eventually Mr. Jenner discovered penicillin. People started washing their hands before sticking them in wounds. Millions of people lived who wouldn\u2019t have before the discovery of antibiotics and the use of alcohol to kill bacteria. Now, of course, we actually implant technology in the human body to fix hearts. This whole topic is too big for a mere question on Quora. I\u2019m sure books have been written on it. ",

            "answer_text": "Since you included technology as well as science, we\u2019ll have to go back a long time to find the beginning. At some point, we began to be primitive tool-makers and tool-users, as chimpanzees are today. Thus we began to distinguish ourselves from other social mammals and create a new destiny. We learned to carry fire and make fire. This was a huge step, as it protected us from cold and predators. Then we made the first really big, unique technological step: cooking. There have been many attempts to define humanity according to a single difference: tool-user (nope); tool-maker (nope, Lady Goodall found those darned chimps); language user (nope, chimps and parrots). But we are the only species who cooks our food. This was our first great technological development. And cooking changed who we are.  The first great technological leap of humanity: cooking. Image from www.camp-cook.com :: View topic Cooking changed the strength and shape of our jaw and remodeled our digestive tract. We use far less energy and time eating than, say, gorillas, who spend most of their waking hours eating. Less blood and oxygen and work going to the guts meant more for the brain. So the brain, along with color vision and hand-eye coordination allowed us to become thinking social mammals of a whole new order. We grew advanced languages and tribal cultures and literally covered the earth, migrating to every continent except Antarctica. And that was just with five technologies: tool-using, tool-making, fire, cooking, and language. This was all long before civilization. Thriving in these technologies, we reached a point where grandmothers and grandfathers could remain alive and pass down what they learned. This was the beginning of education, and, ultimately, the beginning of what we now know as science. We began to both learn about the world from others and also see the world for ourselves. What we call science today is just a refined, organized way of doing that. On the way from early technologies to science, we took two other big steps: civilization and conquest. Prior to civilization, we were hunter-gatherers, and often migratory. With the development of agriculture, we settled down, creating a local environment for our communities and connecting to particular lands.  Big step #2: agricultural villages. Image from Beautifully preserved: A 3,000-year-old lost world has been unearthed Another big step came along at the same time. It was a conceptual step. What if we wipe out the apex predator and replace it? All around the world, we wiped out saber-toothed tigers, dire wolves, woolly mammoths, and other major predators who either would eat us or compete with us for food. Then we either achieved uneasy peace or cooperation with the next largest predator. We stayed away from tigers, and they stayed away from us. Largely the same with lions. A lion will prey on herds of cows, but not on a herd of cows with a Masai warrior present. We domesticated elephants. We domesticated dogs and kept wolves at bay. This is the beginning of what we call civilization. We have settled agricultural homes. We still hunt. And we have time to develop new technologies. We go beyond stone arrowheads and enter the bronze age. Just before or as we entered the bronze age, we made a choice. We began to treat other tribes of human beings the same way we treated the apex predators we had eliminated. That is, along with the invention of agriculture and settling down, we invented a new kind of territoriality and a new expression of our nature called war. Along with war came prisoners of war, and, from this, slavery. We then created a self-reinforcing system of war, slavery, civilization, and technological progress that we have been creating and living ever since, and it is still with us today. We invest in technology of war first and foremost, and then use the spin-offs of technology for peaceful or humanitarian pursuits. Then we ran into one more problem: addictive substances and addiction. As we reached a point where survival did not require constant work, we created societies that had individuals - and in richer industrial societies, many individuals - who had more time than purpose. Addiction then fed into our economic system, and modern empires were born on the profitability of civilization enhanced (or degraded) by warfare, slavery, and addiction. Some elements of science are millennia old, but science as we know it today had very early roots around 1600 with the work of Francis Bacon, and even by the late 1700s with Benjamin Franklin, we really were still engaging in natural philosophy, and not what we would, today, call science. Science came in around 1820 as a concept. The US Civil War accelerated military technology to a great degree. The Second Industrial Revolution, with the development of feedback control and Thomas Edison\u2019s industrial engineering center of invention brought us into our current technological revolution, which then accelerated us into the information age. Essentially, science enhanced our ability for precise replicability of engineering results. This gave us greater control over greater power, and brought us to where we are today. The good news is that we have enough science and technology to create a peaceful world where everyone has enough clean water, sanitation, food, basic health care, and education. And we have had, for over 2000 years, the spiritual guidance of the Axial Age to create such a situation. The bad news is that we have not yet given up our addiction to war, slavery, and addiction, so the society and world we are creating (and destroying) is not the wonderful place it could be. ",
