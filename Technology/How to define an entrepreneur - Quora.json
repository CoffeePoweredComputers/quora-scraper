            "answer_text": "What Is An Entrepreneur? An entrepreneur, by common definition is someone who manages and organizes an enterprise usually at great risk. Consider this: what do have in your home? Fridge, freezer, microwave, television, the lights etc.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. These all came about because someone invented it. Imagine the thought process: a light bulb moment and trying to sell the idea to others. By nature, people are generally skeptical when someone invents something. Imagine the frustrations! One wonders why then do these people do it! If someone did not take the initiative, would we have the material things today which most times we take for granted? Whether you believe you can do a thing or not, you are right. -Henry Ford Here\u2019s a thought: Did you know that this creative urge exists in all of us? We all can be successful and create whatever it is that we want. In a nutshell when you look at yourself in the mirror, acknowledge the fact that you are looking at an entrepreneur. So, What Is an Entrepreneur? A simple joy: Find a seat in a mall or park or any place where people gather and use your powers of observation without being judgmental and notice people walking by. What do you see? How do they carry themselves? Are they at peace within themselves or do they seem agitated? Do they appear lonely or are they with others and seem happy? While you watch, become aware that everything you see played out before you is a product of choices and creations of the people living those lives. Now think of these people as entrepreneurs responsible for their own daily lives, family, friends, relationships and love lives. Then you can realize that to a great degree, in their daily experiences each individual encounters, is due to the risks and initiative they take at a personal level. A common misconception is that being an entrepreneur is only about career, business and finances. While that certainly is a large part of life\u2019s opportunity and challenge, it is only a small part of where you can apply your focus as an entrepreneur.  It can also be in the areas of Relationships, Family, Spirituality, Friends, Love Life, Health, or any combination including other areas in your life that are important to you. So, in conclusion, who is an Entrepreneur? The person in the mirror looking back at you, your friends, people you have already met and those you have not yet met. We are all entrepreneurs or at least have the potential to become one. So, what does it take? It takes willingness to take responsibility for one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choices. When you choose your North Star as mentioned in a previous article, you are beginning to see your vision become a reality. We all have choices. What are your choices? -www.alive4more.com ",

            "answer_text": "The way this question is asked, initiates a line of inquiry to find a persona. A commonly applied start in thinking is to exclusively look at the entrepreneur as a business owner, pro-actively engaging with and seeking value in the market. Describing what an entrepreneur is, so results in conceiving properties belonging to such a person exhibiting entrepreneurial acts like, being a risk taker, having excellent networking skills, being a financial wizard etc.   However, there are two problems with this approach. Firstly you're looking at behavioral characteristics or skill sets, which each actor is bound to have in more or less degree. This will never result in answering what is an entrepreneur. Secondly, exclusively observing the persona denies the fact that organizations, as in a group or network of people together, can also be labeled as entrepreneurial, without having someone who is specifically THE entrepreneur. Defining the entrepreneur thus requires more than a trait-seeking exercise, just looking at individuals. I would say it makes more sense to first look at what defines entrepreneurship, and based on that conclude what an entrepreneur is. If you consider entrepreneurship then you're looking at a function. So, let's look at this function. For one, this function involves decision making. Entrepreneurship is an act of deciding what to invest in, what to market, how to beat the competition, how to innovate, etc. The entrepreneurship function is deciding what to do, and how to do it.  However, a consultant is also involved in such decision making. So we need to define something about entrepreneurial decisonmaking which makes it more than \"gratuitous\" business consultancy. I would suggest that entrepreneurial decision making must come with certain consequences. \"Put your money where your mouth is\", is the often heard expression. Entrepreneurial decision making must be naturally tied to some form of asset ownership, ie. having a stake in the results of decision making, either through bringing cash, hard assets, or your time to the table.  Lastly, the conditions under which decision making takes place, matter. Making benign decisions which lead to incremental (efficiency) gains are usually not associated with entrepreneurship, and rightfully so. Entrepreneurial decision making more refers to a visionary decision or idea, based on reasoning, which in the extreme can't or very limitedly transgresses the domain of personal subjective thinking. This condition involves a high level of uncertainty. Under this uncertain condition nobody believes enough in the entrepreneur's vision to commit their own resources to the idea, or people think the vision is impossible to realize. Until the potential of the vision/idea is somehow proven, the entrepreneur will need to invest her own resources in demonstrating somehow that the idea is really bankable.  Now in summing up the bottom line of my answer to the question what is an entrepreneur, I would say the entrepreneur is someone executing the entrepreneurship function. And, what is the entrepreneurship function?: Deciding on making an investment with your own resources in an idea which involves such considerable uncertainty, that you yourself are the one who can best execute this function. Any person finding herself in such a circumstance, can be called an entrepreneur, regardless of whether this person is a risk taker, networker, leader, or financial wizard, etc. ",
