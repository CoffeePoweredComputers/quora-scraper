I find myself being in several meeting of some kind throughout the week, and I have also worked on the line at a factory, where you have time to check your watch but not your phone. I have found it to be immensely useful. I am also able to send calls to voicemail from my wrist, if needed, such as parents calling in the middle of a bible study. It may be just a nice toy for some but for people like myself, I makes keeping informed and aware of those trying to contact you, so much easier. ",

Each performs a unique function which will make smart watches nearly equal to smartphone. ",
