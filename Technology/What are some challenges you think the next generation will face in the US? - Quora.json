Authoritarian politics in an effort to regain control of uncontrollable events and consequences. Epidemics of tropical diseases spreading to the northern hemisphere as the climate warms. Wars for productive land and potable water that hasn\u2019t been poisoned. Reforestation efforts, attempts to both protect themselves from rising seas, and enhance the health of the seas and the creatures in them. Revolutions against the greedy rich, usually bringing a new set of thugs to the top to replace the old. Hard, hard times. We\u2019ve brought them on our own children by our stubbornness and foolishness and unwillingness to attack the root causes of these problems. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m old, and sorry that \u2014 since I think reincarnation is a real thing \u2014 I\u2019m going to have to come back and help deal with the mess we\u2019ve made.

            "answer_text": "There are two main things that I think are going to impact the next generation. #1 is the increasing acceptance of socialism. the lack of education in this area is causing people to think that not only is it acceptable, but that it is desirable. If we walk down the path of socialism our society as we know it will end. #2 is the lack of assimilation. People come from all over to become Americans. Some people embrace the idea of become an American, and an increasing number of people want to hang onto \u201chome\u201d and NOT become part of the general American culture. ",
