            "answer_text": "Is Bill Gates a genius? This question has no real relevance to anything important. What does it matter how Bill Gates is described: \u2018Genius\u2019 \u2018Capitalist\u2019 \u2018Entrepreneur\u2019 \u2018Cat Lover\u2019? The only TRUE measure of a man lies in what he has done to make this world a better place! Is the world a better place for the Microsoft Software? This is debatable, before Microsoft there were wars, famine, pestilence, poverty. After Microsoft there are wars, famine, pestilence, poverty. When will the Masses understand that Technology is not a Solution? When will the Masses understand that high IQ, in itself, is nothing to do with anything of any real importance? However, Bill Gates has done something that most certainly does make this world a better place: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill and Melinda Gates initiated the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and when launched, polio was present in more than 125 countries and paralyzed about 1,000 children per day. Thanks to immunization efforts that have reached nearly 3 billion children, the incidence of polio has decreased by 99 percent saving more than 13 million children from paralysis. India stopped the virus in 2011, and today, polio is found only in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. In 2016, there were fewer than 40 cases reported globally. Well done Bill and Melinda Gates! Is Bill Gates a genius? I don\u2019t give a fuck - he did something to remove some of the unnecessary suffering in the world. He probably had to waste so much of his life on Microsoft to finally realise his True Wisdom. Personally, I think that it was worth the wait. \u00a9 2018 Lawrence Goethe - All Rights Reserved - All Wrongs Forgiven ",

First, his being accepted to Harvard, second, his recognition that as badly as he had wanted to attend Harvard, that his time would be better spent starting Microsoft. Third, successfully starting and running the most significant computing company in the world and becoming the richest man in the world in the process, and fourth, his recognition by Harvard as being worthy of an honorary doctorate, which recognizes his meeting or exceeding the highest possible level of achievement they are able to recognize. This puts him in a very elite class; another person who earned an honorary doctorate from Harvard was Albert Einstein, in 1935. George Washington and Nelson Mandela did as well.  ",
