            "answer_text": "Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a traditional mechanism adopted by large organizations to scan and process texts, documents, and graphics. However, it requires human intervention to define rules and templates leading to high operational costs, time-consuming processes, and inaccurate results. Today, artificial intelligence services are opening new possibilities for global businesses to automate and optimize document scanning, processing, and verification. Here are some effective business applications of optical character recognition backed by artificial intelligence and computer vision technology. Government Organizations The current infrastructure of government organizations encounters a massive explosion of unstructured data every day. It includes military movements, investigation records, traffic information, census reports, social media posts, and more. Traditionally, manual labor was required to process and derive insights from these unstructured datasets which hamper planning and policy-making. With artificial intelligence, government agencies can now delegate the time-consuming process of data scanning, translation, and extraction to machines. ",

            "answer_text": "OCR, or optical character recognition as it is known, is the technology that grants computers the ability to recognize characters in a document. You can essentially think of OCR as the \u201ceyes\u201d of a computer. Similar to how we humans understand shapes, good OCR technology understands many different patterns of a particular character. Eventually, getting to the point where it can understand most, if not all, variations of a character even handwritten characters. The technology is mostly used in software that allows users to search, locate, and store copies of handwritten or physical documents on a computer. Typically, you can find the OCR technology used in contract management software, academic databases or historical archives. ",
