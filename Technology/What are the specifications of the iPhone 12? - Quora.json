            "answer_text": "It is reported that the iPhone 12 series of OLED screens will add new touch technology. The four iPhone 12 models of different sizes are expected to be equipped with OLED screens. Compared with the iPhone 11 series, the resolution is fully upgraded, but the improvement is limited. Among them, a major technology is upgraded to Y-OCTA technology, which can directly integrate the touch circuit on the OLED panel to reduce the thickness. As for the 120Hz refresh rate, it has not been confirmed.  The following is an analysis of the specific screen parameters of the four models.  Combined with the previously exposed news, the design of the iPhone 12 series has not changed much, and it is still equipped with a notch screen and face ID. However, the screen frame is slightly narrowed, the classic frame of the iPhone 4 period is adopted, all of them are equipped with A14 bionic processors, and support 5G dual-mode (Among them Pro series supports sub-6GHz and millimetre wave). In addition, the entire storage system is upgraded to 4GB and the initial storage is 128GB. The Pro series of cameras will add Lidar sensors to enhance the AR experience.  The iPhone 12 series screen production has been delayed for 6 weeks compared to the original schedule, and will be officially mass-produced at the end of July, which means that the delivery time of some iPhone 12 models may be delayed until October, which is consistent with the speculation of some previous analysts. As for the price, the iPhone 12 is rumoured to continue the pricing of the iPhone 11, starting at $649, the iPhone 12 Max starting at $749, the iPhone 12 Pro starting at $999, and the iPhone 12 Pro Max starting at $1099, all of which are US tax-exclusive prices.

            "answer_text": "Apple is slated to release the new addition in the iPhone series - iPhone 12 in the later part of this year. It is expected to include a bunch of new features integrated by the tech giant into its devices. The iPhone 12 is also expected to be priced considerably lower than its previous counterparts. At the same time it is also being said that the iPhone 12 will not come with Airpods and users will have to buy their own or use the ones from before. I am not sure about the Airpod aspect but I do think that iPhone 12 has capabilities and definitely seems like a promising device.  Features and Specifications of the iPhone 12 It has a 6.1 - inch display with a resolution of 1125*2436 pixelsIt is run by the Apple A13 Bionic processorIt has 6 GB RAM and 64 GB internal storageIt has a triple rear camera with the specs of 12 MP + 12 MP + 12 MPIt also has a 12 MP front cameraThe battery power is 3210 mAh which also supports quick chargeThese are the specifications of the iPhone 12 expected later this year. It will be accompanied with the iPhone 12 Pro as well as the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The iPhone 12 is expected to be priced at around 75k which is a decent price based on the prior prices as well as the brand value but based on the features alone, it is difficult to say if it will be worth it. I think it could be a good upgrade for existing users at a considerably lower price point and the processor is also expected to function and operate pretty smoothly as well. Overall, this will definitely be an addition by Apple that will be worth keep[ing an eye out for. I do think that the Airpods should have been included with the device rather than being excluded.
