            "answer_text": "In art, the ideal proportions for picture frames and rectangular structures has long (since Euclid and before) been thought to be the \u201cGolden Ratio\u201d, which is defined as \u201ctwo quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities\u201d, or in decimal form 1.618:1 (Golden ratio - Wikipedia). In entertainment, the aspect ratio of film and TV pictures started out at 4:3 (width to height), or 1.33:1, which fitted reasonably well into the round constraints of lenses and tubes that industry could manufacture, without looking too \u201csquare\u201d. Slowly, as technology improved, the horizontal dimension started to increase relative to the vertical; it has been shown that as the screens increase in width relative to the vertical the audience\u2019s sense of immersion in the action on screen increases (up to the limit of 360\u00ba full wrap-around cinema)\u00b9. Wide screen television has currently settled on an aspect ratio of 16:9, or 1.78:1. This is rather wider than the golden ratio, but allows cinema films at the commonest wide ratios to be shown with a minimum of chopping, letterboxing and stretching, so is regarded as a good compromise. Curved screens are a short-term fad, I believe; they increase the sense of immersion for people at the centre, at the expense of picture quality for people at the edges. If you typically watch alone or with one friend, they may be acceptable; less so if you have ten mates in to watch football. \u00b9 Wide Screen Cinema and Stereophonic Sound, Michael Z.

            "answer_text": "I suspect that a lot of the tinkering is purely cosmetic. When I first heard about the new wider form, 16x9 instead of 4x3), I hoped that it would eliminate \u201cletter boxing\u201d, that irritating black bar above and below the picture. Alas. To eliminate letter boxing we would need a much wider screen. I\u2019m deeply suspicious of the curved screen. I think it is believed that this makes games more \u201cimmersive\u201d and this might work for the blockbuster type of movie as well. I suspect that this is just a hunch rather than being based on research. I am also prepared to argue that nobody needs the 4K resolution until TVs get really huge. 4K on a 49\u2033 screen just sounds odd to me. To be truthful 1080p looks terrific on such a small screen. And suddenly there is 8K on the horizon for the billionaires. My next TV is going to be a 65\u2033 4K TV, probably mounted on the wall, just because. If only I could get my Samsung 50\u2033 1080p 3D capable plasma TV to die. I suspect that the plasma screen is getting darker with age. Night scenes look pretty murky. I turned on Dynamic Contrast during the infamous Game of Thrones night-time battle. This helped a lot, so I didn\u2019t leap into the fray the next day. The progress inside TVs is definitely not \u201cpurely cosmetic\u201d. I think back on the old TVs in their interlaced glory and shake my head. Big TVs cost an arm and a leg and they were simply making a mess bigger. HiDef was worth the confusion we all went through. I consider my Samsung TV the best money I ever spent. ",
