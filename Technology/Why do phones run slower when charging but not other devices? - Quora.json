            "answer_text": "Smartphones when charging get hot. As a result the cpu is throttling. Throttling is when the cpu gets too hot an in order to protect itself and the phone from catching on fire, they lower their clock speed thus getting slower. As for other devices if they have a CPU, they probably have better cooling solutions or the devices don't do much work thus the cpu doesn't get too hot, if not, please elaborate when you say \u201cother devices\u201d.

For your phone the possible problem could be thermal throttling as aswered by Thanasis Brs. The root cause could be bad phone design or using a fast charger. The phone should not get hot during charging. ",
