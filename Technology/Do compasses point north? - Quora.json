            "answer_text": "No, not really. Or at least not directly so. We map and survey everything to a world grid that is north and south and east and west precisely. But magnetic compasses align themselves with the earth\u2019s magnetic field, which is not at all aligned with the earth. The difference between the north seeking needle and actual north is called variation, and every area on the earth has had this error determined and is marked on local maps. In fact it slowly drifts a bit over the years. With the common pocket compass, it is the the needle that points north, and you rotate the housing to allign it properly. Even then, you don\u2019t rotate the housing so the north pointing needle lines up with the \u201cN\u201d, but with true north minus the variation, the number you get from the maps, and which basically you memorize if you use the compass a lot. Because your maps are shown with true north orientation. In this way, the compass becomes a useful tool, despite the differences from true north being as great as a few dozen degrees! In aviation, doing this math was just too bothersome, so the practice began where everyone simply used compass bearings and not true bearings. Of course that often meant that as you flew into another region, the variation was different and the error to true north also different. But it didn\u2019t matter, everyone, everywhere on the planet in aviation, used and still uses the magnetic bearings. In fact every runway in the world has a two digit number painted on the end for its magnetic compass heading, and all reference to that runway is by that heading. It becomes the very name of that runway. Tower will say, \u201ccleared to land runway 22\u201d, meaning you are cleared to land on the runway pointing to compass heading 220.  ",

Instead, it points to the magnetic north.\u201d Before the widespread usage of GPS, we depended a lot on a compass for driving, navigation, etc. When using a compass and map to navigate, the angle between magnetic and true north has to be taken into account in order to orient the north of the map (true north) to the compass direction (magnetic north). This is called magnetic declination. ( Magnetic declination - Wikipedia) I am not quite sure if any BOY SCOUTs teach a lot of reading a compass and relating it to proper orientation any more, due to GPS availability. I spent a lot of time in learning about this in the Korean Army, which I served for 2.5 years as mandatory requirement. I believe that military still place importance of using a compass, just in case that GPS may not be available in an emergency. All the fond memories of old days and life got a lot simpler due to GPS\u2026 All the best   Compass and GPS, from Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "A magnetic compass must point to magnetic north. Since the north magnetic pole is somewhere in northern Canada, this means that your needle will be off by quite a bit depending on where in the world you are. You might happen to be due true South of the magnetic pole, in which case it and the true north pole line up and your compass is pointing the right way. Otherwise you need to consult a local map to find out what the error is and allow for it - it varies from place to place and also year by year, but quite predictably. A gyroscopic compass, on the other hand, will point where it\u2019s told to point; the only issue is that it needs to be set from some reference point. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends what you mean by \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cshow\u201d. I\u2019ll explain: By common definition, the true north pole of the Earth is the bit of the surface of the Earth where the celestial north pole is directly overhead. If you were standing on it, and looked directly upwards, you\u2019d see Polaris. Therefore: \u201cTrue North\u201d is the direction towards that point on the horizon[*] that is directly below the north celestial pole (in a pinch, directly below Polaris). The \u201cnorth-seeking\u201d end of a compass needle points roughly in that direction most of the time. However, even in the best conditions, it does not point exactly there. What the needle points to is a magnetic north pole. Any magnetic north pole. The Earth\u2019s magnetic north pole is slightly to one side of the \u201ctrue north\u201d pole. However, if you understand this, and you also know something about your latitude, then the compass is showing you where true north is by pointing a bit to one side of it. That is because \u201cshowing\u201d and \u201cpointing at\u201d are different things.  [*] in the northern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere, true north is the direction towards that point on the horizon that is directly above the north celestial pole. Not very useful, so we use the south celestial pole instead\u2026 and true north is the direction opposite to true south. ",

Magnetic North is where the lines of the Earth's magnetic field converge in the northern hemisphere, formed by the liquid metallic core moving within the Earth; the pole constantly shifts position over time. The needle on a compass is magnetically a south pole which is attracted to the north magnetic pole of the Earth. True North and Magnetic North are geographically close, but they are not identical. ",

Else there will be a turning moment on the needle. We call the end of the needle that points closest to geographic north \u201cnorth\u201d. The point on the earth's surface corresponding to magnetic North (a free needle points straight down) is currently in the Arctic near geographic north. It moves around, faster in current years. When I was at school it was further south near Baffin Island. In geologic time it can flip completely and be near the geographic south pole. The earth's magnetic field is thought to be due to fluid circulation in the outer liquid iron core. The phenomenon is not completely understood. Not all planets have a magnetic field - a compass won't work on the moon. ",
