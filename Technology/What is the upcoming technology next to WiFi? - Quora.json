            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking this question. It's impossible to predict the future. But based on what I've seen and in some cases worked with I'm pretty excited about the developments in wireless world right now. Wireless is perhaps the most efficient distribution technology we have. It's easy to set up, it's flexible and it's universally accessible. Once you set up the infrastructure anyone within the network can enjoy the services. You don't have to run to each and every home to bring them the benefits of connectivity. This is a huge advantage as it reduces the installation complexity. Compare for example landline phones to mobile handsets people have today. It's because of wireless technology that we've been able to bring the benefits of connectivity to one and all. Long distance communication that was once an expensive privilege is now an expected commodity. Point to point fixed connection can't scale. They are a liability. Not just from the point of view of maintenance but also from upgradation. It won't be long before even the internet backbone goes wireless with advancement in satellite internet as well as ground based wireless backhauls. Until now wireless technology has been looked upon as a replacement or as an alternative to wired technology. This view is rapidly changing as wireless is fast becoming the foundation for tech of the future. Wireless beacon technology ,for example, that allows for offline application access is gaining popularity as the new standard for accessing informational services in places like airports, banks, stadiums and public locations. While fixed line internet has succeed in global communication it hasn't had much of an impact hyper local information exchange. Here too new kinds of wireless networks are replacing the legacy internet applications. Localized data accessible through high speed, on demand wireless networks have the capability of connecting people in ways never before seen. Offline social networks in restaurants, flights , hotels, tourist spots are ready for deployment. And if consumers adopt them we may get to witness the development of a new social interaction that will in turn open up even more opportunities,just like traditional social media did a decade ago. Wireless is not limited to just communication but is expanding into other exciting areas like energy transmission. One of the major roadblocks holding alternative sources of energy back, is the lack of efficient transport from the source to destination. Traditional wires are lossy. Even more so for battery powered energy. Technology exists that can transmit kilowatts of energy wirelessly over a range of a few KMs. Deployment of this technology will help in the growth of renewable energy generation as transmission losses and expenses of wire can be nullified. We will be able to create renewable energy generators like solar farms, dams and wind turbines and transmit energy directly to the grid. Over the air. Social networks, communication, entertainment, commerce, banking ,energy. The applications of wireless networks are many and more will be discovered in time to come. To realize the full potential of wireless networks we need more skilled people. All of wireless tech is based on the simple, well understood,century old concept of electromagnetism that is taught in all technical courses across the world. But due to diverging lines of business, professionals often forget the basics. Refresher courses have been published online on YouTube by eminent professors to help experienced people as well as newcomers get quickly up to speed. Since wireless is an emerging technology an immense scope exists for entrepreneurs to start new businesses. By being aware of the common concepts any one can identify and act upon opportunities as they present themselves. If you're comfortable in learning and applying your knowledge then time is on your side and the future is yours. Personally I'm looking forward to see how people solve problems and invent new things on wireless. ",

            "answer_text": "Sub 6 5G which penetrates walls, or verizon higher frequency 34+GHz 5G (which will not penetrate walls but which can be piped into a building or residence) will be/is faster than WiFi. The telecoms want you to give up cable, which is hard wired, to go wireless. The cable speed is fast, but the WiFi router is slow. They will likely offer television service and compete head to head wireless to broad band). The real solution is to have a local area wired network indoors. It will be more private and secure, more reliable and less expensive and potentially faster than wireless. You may not be getting the fastest cable service. Fiber optic cable ought to be able to provide up to 10 gig up and down. They don\u2019t offer this most places. They want you to switch to wireless. 5G is really about the internet of things. It\u2019s about tracking everyone and everything to introduce The fourth industrial revolution. ",
