            "answer_text": "Yes, business is technology, and technology is business \u2026 When a technology lacks business, it will lack what we called funding. It can be eaten by anyone who does not cook it. With business without technology is like buying hams and buns, selling it to market without paper bags without your store\u2019s name written on it, and only you may sell it. Or your neighbors may sell theirs too \u2026 without you as part of it.And much \u2026 much more \u2026. say \u2026 no hams or no buns too ;). No one thought of it. Or If the buns are made square even though it taste like hamburger \u2026 it shall be called sandwich \u2026 But for facts, without technology, people does not know burgers and sandwiches are the same. Or yet they choose to sell the paper bags instead with a burger on it, and does not realizes that a plastic container with burgers on it is much pleasing to sell. Without technology or coordination with business is like an iced tea without iceOr a hot fudge without the chocolate, Or an ice cream cannot be sold in a hot desert. God Bless ",
