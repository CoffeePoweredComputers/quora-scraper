            "answer_text": "What is a rood screen? A rood screen is a partition between the chancel and the nave of a church particularly in the Western tradition. (Visually, the iconostasis in Eastern churches is similar but of different origin). A chancel is at the liturgical east end of a church and is the area around the altar with the choir stalls a seating for the clergy and monks. The nave is the main body of the church where people sat. The rood screen was normally of open tracery in stone, wood, or iron. It was basically a see through wall between the clergy and the lay people. The rood screen was often surmounted by the rood loft which would have held a large crucifix with figures of Mary and St John at the foot of the cross. The rood screen was largely removed in Catholic churches during the Counter Reformation. So the easiest place to see one is in an Anglican church. Many of us may have encountered this during televised royal doings in Britain such as royal weddings. Many Chistians today are accustomed to worship in a very open space. So try to visualize this arrangement. The nave would be where people stood (seated today in pews or chairs). An elevated pulpit would be possibly in the front or near the front of the church for preaching. Then a rood screen would partly shield from view the altar area. It would have stalls, often elaborately carved, facing the aisle. These would be used by choir monks or the cathedral chapter. Then the altar was beyond that facing the wall of the apse. There would be seating for the bishops, priests, and deacons. So the ceremony of the mass was quite removed from the lay people. During the long history of church architecture this all varied a great deal. Since the 1960\u2019s even most Anglican churches have moved the main altar forward often in front of the choir. So it is rare to see the rood screen as it would have been in the Middle Ages. An Anglo Catholic church near me has a beam surmounted by a crucifix with Mary and St John a small reminder of an ancient custom. ",
