            "answer_text": "If you want to earn that amount, then you need to buy a house now in an area which is developing. Once you do, you can sell that house for a profit of nearly 30\u201350 lakhs. You can also invest in gold if you want to earn in lakhs in a couple of years. No bank will give you that amount of interest so a fixed or a recurring deposit is out of question. If none of these seem feasible to you, then you can learn about the share market and invest heavily in it. If you are a master or you are adept in the share market then you can earn 10\u201315 lakhs in a year. Or even more if you are smart. ",
