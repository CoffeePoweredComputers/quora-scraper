            "answer_text": "Hello,Dear Fresher, I believe it depends on your offer letter, something like 3.05 lacks PA. Which is something near to 20\u201322k per month which is excuding ur PF, incentive money, TDS if any. Mostly as long u r in Academy (training period) you need not worry about tax. After you complete the training, Dovetail exams & a year of service, ur CTC will be 3.55 & then the CTC depends on your appraisal. All The Best ",
