            "answer_text": "A way to accurately site water wells and boreholes! Simply put: a technology to allow us to know if there's underground water (and how much of it) before drilling a borehole/water-well.  Just this afternoon, we completed drilling a 105m borehole in a dry part of the world where water is scarce and prized. Until earlier this year when i started working in water supply development, there\u2019s a few things I didn\u2019t really know. The first surprise: Drilling a borehole is not cheap! In this corner of the world, you\u2019re talking about roughly $150 per metre. (Most boreholes go down to a depth of 60m here) And, that\u2019s not including the cost of a pump to get the water out of your 60m deep hole. The second surprise? In 2017, we still don\u2019t have a foolproof way to detect if there\u2019s actually underground water before drilling. Yes! We\u2019ve been to space and back, we can map the dimples and hills on the surface of the moon, and we have sent a space probe past Pluto, but we still don\u2019t have a way to know for certain if there\u2019s enough water 60m below our feet to justify a drill! Okay, to be fair, there\u2019s fairly accurate and oft\u2019 used methods to make intelligent estimates, but for 2017, I feel they don\u2019t cut it. For example: there\u2019s the electrical resistivity method (passing an electrical current through different rock formations and judging where water might occur based on the fact that water is conductive); there are a couple of electromagnetic methods (making \u201cguesses\u201d based on the electromagnetic conducting abilities of different rock formations); and there\u2019s even water-divining/well-witching (using two rods to find underground water by\u2026 Okay, this one, depending on who you ask, is hard to explain.) Each of these methods have different success rates. But basically, none of them are perfect. Which means it\u2019s totally possible to spend $10,000 to drill, and realise\u201460m into the ground\u2014that you\u2019re drilling a dry hole. In my naivete, I would have imagined that in 2017 we would be able to pull out an iPhone, tap the \u201cFind Water\u201d app, point the phone\u2019s camera at the ground, and get a response: \u201cNO WATER HERE! DON\u2019T WASTE YOUR $10,000\u201d. Okay, I guess I\u2019ve over-simplified it. But i still think it\u2019s unbelievable that we still haven\u2019t invented a technology to simply and effectively site boreholes. Today, after drilling 105m into the ground (It would take Usain Bolt about 9 seconds to run to the bottom of this well), obtaining a yield well-less that expected, and looking at the disappointed faces of the kids that had been watching and cheering on the drillers, I was challenged to study more on this. UPDATE: I\u2019m surprised to learn just how many people are interested in water development work. Yes, you\u2019d be amazed how scarce something as basic as clean water is many parts of the world.The questions I\u2019ve gotten the most in my inbox are: \u201cWhy is drilling so expensive?\u201d and \u201cHow\u2019d you arrive at the $10,000 figure?\u201d So, the cost of drilling around the continent varies depending on geography, location, general cost of living, etc. In the humanitarian/international development world, $10,000 is the most widely used average for drilling around sub-Saharan Africa. Since we can\u2019t know until we actually pick a location, that\u2019s the figure we\u2019ll generally use for budgeting, fundraising, etc. In some places, it\u2019ll be as low as $2,500, and in some places, as high as $15,000. Here\u2019s how it usually works: Most drillers charge a flat fee for drilling until 40\u201350m. In my part of the world, that\u2019s in the range of $7,000 to drill until, say 45m. You sign a contract, and the drilling dude comes to your house. He drills until 35m, and if you find water, good for you! But, you still pay the flat $7,000. If you don\u2019t find water at the 45m mark, then they start charging by the metre. In Mozambique, it\u2019s about about $100 per metre thereafter. So after 45m, they\u2019ll ask you, \u201cShould we keep going?\u201d You decide when to stop. You could cross your fingers and say, \u201cYes\u201d, but with every metre you\u2019re paying and hoping they find water. The whole thing has a cruel similarity to those TV game shows where you accumulate points by answering questions correctly in a chain, and risk to lose everything if you answer a question wrong. Most play it safe and say, \u201cNo more questions for me!\u201d After 80m of not finding water, you could tell them, \u201cPlease stop!\u201d but at the back of your mind, you\u2019re thinking, \u201cMaybe I was just one more metre away from water.\u201d What i gave as $150 per metre works out to be the average of the whole thing where I am (considering the cost and depth of the average well here) As to why it\u2019s expensive to drill in general, a lot of things comes to mind: The drilling rig doesn\u2019t come cheapThe drilling bits (the hard metal head that does the crushing through rocks)Casing the borehole with PVC pipes down to the depth of your waterCompetition (the less the people with drilling rigs, the crazier the prices are)Geography (Areas like Zamb\u00e9zia, Mozambique are laden with crystalline rock. It\u2019s just harder and more expensive to drill here)And other reasons that I\u2019m yet to figure out as I gain more experience.",

            "answer_text": "Designer phages for tumours and cancer treatment. Successful and marketable, I wish. A phage is a virus that attacks specific bacteria. The phage invades the bacterium and replicates and releases more phages until all the bacteria are gone. THere should be some point in technology were the bioengineers can manufacture personal designer phages for a particular tumour in a single person. One or two treatments should be suffice to kill a cancer or lesion. As long as there are tumours, the phages will continue to replicate. No more tumours, no more phage replication , and the phages die off and washout. Sort of a self manufacturing cancer treatment. The engine of replication is the target cell. Some phages can be designed to get through the blood brain barrier. So the tumour is biopsied, the surface chemistry analyzed, and a matching phage is engineered in the lab. Of course the phage would tested on the tumour sample. Once verified, the phage is injected into the patient. Might be very effective for peritoneal cavity tumours where blood circulation isn\u2019t the most conducive for delivering anticancer vectors. it\u2019s been thought of, and research is ongoing. Of course safeguard have to be made for mutations and such, but I think it can be done. Side note, I\u2019ve always wondered if some spontaneous cancer remissions and cures had been caused by phage invasions. It would be instructive to ask such a fortunate patient if s/he could be tested for viruses. Always wondered about that. There was a miracle cure in the bible, where mud was rubbed on a blind person\u2019s eyes, and he was cured. Did He rub in phages? They grow in and around mud.  credit Phages Carry Antibiotic Resistance Genes  Credit: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-description-of-phage-display-based-breast-cancer-precision-medicine-a_fig2_321693444 ",
