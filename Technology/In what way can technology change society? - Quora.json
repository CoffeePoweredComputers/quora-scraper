            "answer_text": "Personally I think technology makes society better in some aspects, and worse in others. For this answer I will be mostly referring to the technology that an average person has access to. Pros- Communication- we are able to communicate with almost anybody within seconds. This is something that wasn't even possible 25 years ago. Entertainment- once again this has progressed extremely fast in the past few years, and is continually getting better. Social media- I am on the fence with this one, so it will be under the pros as well as the cons. It is a good thing because I can communicate with many people at once. Access to information- I can literally open the safari app on my phone and have access to tons of information just in the palm of my hand. Cons- Time wasting- yes technology is time wasting, I will spend hours of time playing video games, or scrolling through pictures. Lack of privacy- with today's technology, it is virtually impossible to do a google search of your name and not find yourself. Random people can see what you had for dinner last night when you post it on instagram. I think that is a little creepy Social media- this is a huge time waster as well as an annoyance. People constantly snap chatting pictures of the floor and stuff is starting to get annoying. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology is neutral as any tool is like. It it the mind behind that technology we have to think about. A car can be driven on the road or mowed over people. A GPS can be used as a roap map or as a latest surveillance system. A computer can be used to do our things or to hack into government systems. So, don't think about the technology, think about the mind behind it. (Even outcomes of elections can be manipulated, if such minds function. You would have absolutely no idea. You would think you have your free will.) Good or bad? Lot of good, positive minds - good. Lot of deceptive, bad minds - bad. I also want to add, before introducing any new technology into the world, the innovator should have the capacity to project the technology into the future into the society/ world and see how it 'can' affect the world. They should have visionary that too in a good, positive way capacities. Vision can be for evil things as well. All the very best! Regards, Swaroopa Blog. ",
