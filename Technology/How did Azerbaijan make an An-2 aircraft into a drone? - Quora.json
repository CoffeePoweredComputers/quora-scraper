            "answer_text": "The hard part of making a drone is the business of making a good flying machine. So they took an existing flying machine. From there - there is plenty of OpenSource drone control software - \u201cardupilot\u201d for example - but there are at least 8 open source drone projects to choose from. You can add cameras pretty easily. To get the drone software to fly the plane, probably means altering existing autopilot hardware to make it accept inputs from the drone software. For my mind - the hardest part is the communications. Most cheap drones use WiFi or similar - but the range would be horribly short for something like this. Real military drones use an encrypted satellite feed\u2026but it seems unlikely that Azerbaijan would have the resources to do that. If they didn\u2019t need to get realtime video back from it - then they could probably just have it fly a fixed, predetermined route and maybe have it use a satellite phone to send update course and other commands to it and have it send back short position messages back.
