            "answer_text": "While there are indeed some efficient speech-to-text tools around, I do not think it's possible to expect from a software to create a subtitle file in the correct format. Subtitle files, as you know, have some restrictions, like character limit, and proper shortening of the actual transcript, to enable the viewer feel that they're watching a movie, documentary etc. and not reading an animated book. It's up to the subtitler to make the necessary arrangements and synchronization for keeping the viewer hooked on the image on the screen and thus, not diminishing the value of the visual presentation itself. And honestly, in all my years as an A/V translator, I've never seen a speech-to-text tool with 100% accuracy, so I guess we'll still keep our jobs for a long time. ",
