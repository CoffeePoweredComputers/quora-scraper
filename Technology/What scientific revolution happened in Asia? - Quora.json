            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat scientific revolution happened in Asia?\u201d There was no more a scientific revolution in Asia than there was in Europe. It\u2019s been a long evolution of several thousand years. Much of the early development of science was in Asia. Sumerian then Babylonian, Egyptian, Indian, Persian and others. Some early development also happened in Greece and other parts of Europe and northern Africa. The so-called \u201cScientific Revolution\u201d in Europe is a hagiographic fantasy about science by historians with limited understanding of science. The period it describes was largely one of Europeans catching up with science from elsewhere. It\u2019s standard definition is the 150 years between the publication of Copernicus\u2019 book and the publication of Newtons\u2019 Principia Mathematica yet Copernicus\u2019 work was based on earlier Greek work and Newton\u2019s science still fell short of the the rigour of modern scientific method. Aside of which, what kind of \u201crevolution\u201d is a gradual change over 150 years? Science is still evolving. All over the world. There was no scientific revolution in Asia any more than there was in Europe. ",
