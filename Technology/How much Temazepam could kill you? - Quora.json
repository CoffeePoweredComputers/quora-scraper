            "answer_text": "I don't think that's a healthy question. Also I'm not a medical professional. Benzodiazepines by themselves generally require very high doses to be lethal; in combination with other things this threshold drops dramatically. If you are a concerned and prescribed citizen taking what is recommended, I would say that if you don't mix and match with anything else you're very safe. If you're looking to abuse it to have fun, I would say, from many of my peers who I observed do this: don't. The practical results of abuse of this class of drug is a lot of anxiety and possible seizures that then become very difficult to manage medically because of the tolerance profile the abuse causes. I have seen folks throw in the towel with this stuff and spend years trying to get little pieces of it back. These things are a powerful medical tool for managing anxiety, and one of the only ones that work extremely well. You do not want to biologically ban yourself from these while simultaneously inducing a lot of anxiety. Don't abuse drugs, especially this one. ",

No real answer here and if you\u2019re asking because you want to OD quit reading this and call someone and tell them right now. ",
