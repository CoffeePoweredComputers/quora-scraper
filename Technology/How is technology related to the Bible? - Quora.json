            "answer_text": "2Ch 26:15 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong. This is the first description of ballistae and catapults we have. It falls within the time limits of the historic idea, that these war machines were first used by the ancient Greeks, at about the same time. I cannot say which was first - this is very much a chicken/egg riddle - and with Israel\u2019s international ties wrought by King David and his son Solomon, it is possible that either nation got the system from the other. Notice that the verse states that the machines were \u201cinvented by cunning men\u201d - it does not state necessarily Israelites, though the existence of the modern day \u201cIron Dome\u201d tells me, that this was most probably an Israeli invention that went through to the Greeks. Rev 13:16\u201317 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Now, there is a lot of dispute between Christian denominations, cults and sects, about what this mark is. Some say it is to worship the pope, some say it is to be a muslim, some say it is to be a protestant, some say it is to pray to Jesus instead of the Father, some say that this is a microchip. Imagine that: who would get this silly idea that a microchip could be implanted to allow you to be able to buy and sell? And who would be so silly to think that it could become law to insert a man-made object into the body - be killed for not accepting this? But this is a long, long road to travel in a few short passages: The UN is run by Freemasonry. Freemasonry is to be kept \u201cpure\u201d in the luciferian doctrine. Shriners (the highest tiers), swear an oath on a Qur\u2019An to worship lucifer. The Qur\u2019An is the (un-)Holy Book of iSlam. The god of iSlam is allah. the mark of the beast is the number of his name. 666 is said as \u201cbismillah/ bismallah\u201d in Arabic. Bismillah/ bismallah means \u201cIn the name of allah\u201d. In the past decades, there was a fervent push to create wars in the Middle East, to produce \u201crefugees\u201d in order to spread iSlam as fast and as far as possible over the earth. Those in the USA and EU that chose to stand against it, are slandered as \u201cislamophobic\u201d (which is not at all possible, since a phobia is an ungrounded fear of something that most probably will not or cannot harm you - see the freedom of the iSlamic world and how quick death come for one who dares contradict the Mufti). In Revelation 13, it is written about a \u201cBeast out of the Sea\u201d, a man who shall arise and lead the world astray after himself. Historical research has unequivocally found this man and system, to be the Roman Catholic Church/ Cult and its Pope: Without the Church, there is no Pope; without the Pope, there is no Church. The \u201cSea\u201d is Biblical symbolism for \u201clots of people (together)\u201d. There is a line of research that states that the Beast out of the earth, is the USA. \u201cEarth\u201d is Biblical symbolism for \u201cLands/Countries\u201d. But this does not make sense. What God would send people to the lake of fire for being born in a specific country - no matter that they had the Gospel and accepted it? I\u2019ll bet Ellen White is right now longing to get back out of her grave, to be able to repatriate to another nation and get out of this devilish system she lived in before she dies a second time\u2026 How about a religion that is measured not in people. but in countries? From which an image for the Beast of the Sea can come? How about Islam, that doesn\u2019t care about how many people are in the nation, as long as all are muslims? Being a South African, I had a chat concerning Christianity and Islam with a PAGAD-leader a few years ago. We were on friendly terms - I would not say \u201cfriends\u201d in total - and just as a matter of conversation, he said that , were we in a muslim country, he would have had to kill me for refusing to renounce Christianity and become a muslim. So how about the Beast out of the Earth, is Islam that does the Inquisition for the pope - the unholy father needs to give an image of being a man of peace, right? no matter the inquisitions that were aimed at removing all opposition to the RCC in as painful a way as possible - and the image of the Beast, is the Imam Mahdi that the world is waiting for? Islam has been injected into the modern church. Hinduism also, with \u201cChristian Yoga\u201d and \u201cPositive Mantra\u201d, but Hinduism must eventually make way for iSlam. The Muhammadan Murder Cult has no freedom of religion. I\u2019m not going to put the verses here, feel free to get a Qur\u2019An and research the 200 or so verses that demand the death of the unbeliever. So here we have the nation with the world\u2019s largest nuclear arsenal, about to be handed over to iSlam by Killary Clinton, and thank God - I mean it, thank Him - Donald Trump wins the Electoral College vote. So here is my interpretation of Revelation 13: The pope-church is proven to be the Beast out of the sea. History has proven it, no matter how people try to change it, there is only one man and one city and one system that fits. After it, comes the Beast out of the Earth, Islam that needs to take over the nations. And it shall eventually, but by God\u2019s Grace, hopefully not in our lifetimes. The Imam Mahdi comes - his point of origin has been defined as Iran, already - and demands all to get in league with iSlam, which in turn hands control of the earth over to the Pope. If this seems an absurd idea, consider why Francis took muslims to visit him in the Vatican, while Christian refugees were left in the camp? Why he calls Trump \u201cUnchristian\u201d for wanting to build a wall to keep illegal aliens out of the USA, while he lives a citadel with walls at places up to 20m high? And of course, the World Council of Churches and the Parliament of World Religions, are both tun by UN. The WCC is the section that tells the \u201cChristian\u201d churches what to do, what to say, who to allow in and who not. NO OTHER RELIGION, GETS ITS ORDERS FROM A LUCIFERIAN-RUN INSTITUTION (The UN). Which is also in part, why I am non-denominational. The Pope has his voice at the WCC. The Parliament of World Religions, is the UN\u2019s institution to try and find a single, all-encompassing religion that fits everybody. All religions are allowed to join and all are encouraged to betray their core beliefs in the name of UNITY IN DIVERSITY. There is no single Saviour for any single group of believers - all are \u201csaved by their own religion\u201d. Their god is a schizophrenic tyrant who cannot understand what he wants, because apparently this same god who demands the muslims kill all infidels who refuse to become muslims, is also the one who told Jesus to teach his people to live in peace as far as possible, because hard days and temptations WILL come. A bloodthirsty tyrants, is this god of the PWR, with whom I shall have nothing to do except call it what it is: evil in its highest form. The pope has his voice there. So now you have a world-wide influx of muslims into every Western nation, and eventually, islam takes over. All who turn muslim say the islamic creed and are allowed to get the microchip. (And yes, the chip is already in production, though not as widely spread as some conspiracy theorists will have you think. But it is telling, that I\u2019ve read testimony of people who found their newborns were injected with the chip, without their consent.) Those who do not say the islamic creed, are re-educated (indoctrinated), or locked away (for public safety) and eventually murdered as enemy of the state. The War on Terror is war against the public, founded on terror-ising them into submission. Islam means \u201cSubmission\u201d. Slavery. A slave has no say in his own life. Killary mentioned that people would have had to get used to living with some less of their freedoms, during her campaign. And after wearing the hijab in public, all makes sense. Hold the world hostage - \u201cbecome an islamic state or we nuke you\u201d - and give the chips to those who obey, kill those who refuse. A muslim who dies with infidels becomes an immediate martyr for allah. Preferably killing Jews and Christians. This is one piece of technology never seen before, that no-one would have ever dreamed of, that was described by the Apostle John as he saw in the vision on the island of Patmos. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology is only related to the Bible in the sense that, during a certain period of time (namely when the Bible was written), certain technology was available and it is revealed in scripture. Otherwise, technology is only related to the Bible in the sense that technology developed to test ideas put forward in the Bible and championed as truth. This hasn\u2019t always led to popular, or widely held, acceptance. Galileo Galilea built a telescope and, using formulae and results discovered by his predecessors as well as testing commonly held biblical beliefs, discovered that heliocentric, rather than geocentrism, is a more accurate model of how our solar system works. When the scientific model, namely testing concepts rather than accepting a priori assumptions, more technology developed. Unfortunately for the Bible and Christianity, that was mostly with the result of disproving a number of claims. ",
