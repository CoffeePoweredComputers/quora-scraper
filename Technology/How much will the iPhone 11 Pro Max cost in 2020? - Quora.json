            "answer_text": "You can find discounted or refurbished iPhone 11 Pros for around $800-$1000. But, on the apple website, the prices won't be dropped until the iPhone 12 is released. This will also prompt other resellers to drop their prices. It's best to wait until October if you want a discounted iPhone 11 Pro Max. ",
