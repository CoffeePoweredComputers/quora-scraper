            "answer_text": "The only real way is to develop a universal drive toward spiritual development to match our rate of technological development. Presently we are in a position in which there is a serious imbalance between our spiritual development and technological development. This is why we are using technology for the most part to maintain supremacy rather than to actually truly better our lives and reduce the problems presently caused by the incorrect distribution of wealth in our world. We need to get to the point at which greed no longer drives our technological advances, and we no longer allow huge corporations to manipulate entire societies and maintain them within the purview of their own monopolies. I am talking about Big Pharma and the Petro-Chemical industries and others which have a similar influence on our technologies. We need to acknowledge the extent to which such industries are actually fighting to hold back our technological development so that they are able to maintain their monopoly and stranglehold on society. Had it not been for this, we should have had technologies in place such as the electric car or hydrogen fueled vehicles long ago. There is no need for any of this. But we need to come to that conclusion universally, not just a minority of informed dissidents. That can only happen if we are able to evolve spiritually to a point at which we are able to see clearly what is happening and what is wrong with our society and understand why we cannot allow that trend to continue, and what is at stake if we do not decide to change. We need to completely change our attitude toward money and work and energy. The education system needs to change, so that instead of inculcating values geared toward the society we see today, we teach skills which enable our children to understand their true place in the Universe. We need to go through a complete social revolution in order to make the necessary changes, and this needs to happen all over the world. But if this comes about as a result of spiritual growth, there need be no bloodshed and no conflict in order to bring this about. It will just be a case of evaluating which technologies and social attitudes no longer fit in with our view for the way we want our world to function and agree to make the necessary changes for the good of everyone. We are coming to a point at which the stuff of yesterday\u2019s science fiction novels is today\u2019s reality. With A.I. fast becoming a major part of industries throughout the world, questions are already arising about the moral implications of this within society. Yet in my opinion there is a very real danger of allowing these decisions to be taken by today\u2019s movers and shakers, the heads of industry and government. This is because these people do not have the degree of spiritual development to be entrusted with such questions or decisions. These people lack the spiritual maturity to take the sort of decisions which must be faced surrounding the integration of A.I. in our future societies. And the result could be catastrophic, as we have seen in countless movies on the topic of A.I. and its integration in society. This is only the tip of the iceberg, there are many issues of no less importance which will require a spiritually mature governance, but which at this point in time does not actually exist. We need to find a way to make that happen, sooner rather than later. As I\u2019ve said repeatedly - it\u2019s time we grew up, and woke up, before someone decides to slap our wrist really hard to get our attention. It\u2019s as though we\u2019ve all been hypnotized not to see the world as it actually is and not to care enough to want to change it. ",

            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question as it can drag into hours of conversation. For me, the most important thing to realize is how there is no \u201cwe\u201d in human evolution. Evolution seems to be a personal journey. Surely, we tend to imitate others, or be influenced by others; but if we are not ready to evolve (whatever that means), there is no personal growth. According to an article on chopra.com[1], a child experiences evolution as a process of growth, so he/she doesn\u2019t have to choose to evolve. The trend changes, as the child achieves adulthood. As an adult, evolution becomes a conscious choice. Often I ask myself the following question (which serves as a simple test on the development of my own self-awareness): \u201cAm I expanding, or am I contracting?\u201d Many times we find ourselves going down a rabbit hole when buying into what\u2019s trending on TV, politics, and social media. Because distractions abound, we may go on for decades without making a dent on our personal evolutionary path. There are things we can do to accelerate self-awareness, such as taking frequent silent walks (leave your music box at home). Diet[2] plays a big role in maintaining focus and conscious awareness. It also helps getting into the habit of asking ourselves questions. They shake those sillies out. Footnotes[1] The Secret to Personal Evolution[2] What diet is best from a perspective of maximizing energy?",

            "answer_text": "We can make an evolutionary jump forward. Main problem in humans is the emotions. Greed and fear. What will people think of me? Out of fear arises anger \u201cWhat do you stare at me!\u201d and hate \u201cYou are inferior to me\u201d. Trump is a good example of a person who is driven by his emotions, but we all are, you yourself is the best example. When somebody tells me \u201cI don't like you\u201d, I have a lot of emotions. So this is the problem. Humans are emotion driven animals and this causes destruction. How to overcome this? Instead of fear and hate we can choose the power of love. This is a creative and healing force. Then we have to overcome the childhood hurts and be good. It may be a long and difficult process but it's the only real challenge in life. You learn to handle your emotions. Learn to trust, to care. Maybe most of all you have to love yourself, so grow the power of love into a steady force. It's really a challenge and will change the world. ",
