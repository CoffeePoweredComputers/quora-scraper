            "answer_text": "We can certainly be concerned with the effect of A.I. on the job market. The pandemic is slicing away huge segments of the labor market that will never come back and would have been lost anyway, but more gradually. Having millions unable to find work rewarding enough to support their families, that can give them some of the benefits of material plenitude, while most of society\u2019s wealth is monopolized by a tiny fraction of the population, is an unsustainable economic system. It is the pull of a maelstrom drawing us into a feudal dark age unless we do something about it. Technology improves faster and faster, replacing more and more jobs, and until now too much of the benefit has been sucked up by those super-wealthy few. This is supposed to be what we revere as Capitalism, while we are supposed to despise any alternative as \u201csocialism\u201d that would make the economic situation more equitable. It is very possible that you have ideas about how to deal with a continually shrinking labor pool and a grossly inequitable distribution of good and services. It is time for us to clarify what the alternative to neo-feudalism might be, looking at all the examples from other lands and other ages in an effort to come up with something that works for everyone. A.I. can be an essential part of generating surplus and leisure for all of us instead of being sucked up by ridiculous pseudo-royalty for a few while the rest of us face the question of how we will pay our rent and support our families in 2021 and beyond.

            "answer_text": "Only if there is a human telling it what to do, humans are monsters. AI intelligence should be above our petty ideas. And worrying about the job market is also pointless. How about ask the AI to solve how humans can have good lifes without jobs. Issue is not having a job, its about having money isnt it? So we just need to be able to have enough money without working, that is what we have to solve. Have machines do the work, so we can focus on hobbies, arts, and whatever happens to actually interest us, instead of having to waste our life working for someone else so they can get richer\u2026 ",
