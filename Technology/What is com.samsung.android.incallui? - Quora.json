The DNS ended up going backwards from that, because it was felt the site name was most important. Realize that at the time, there were only 4 TLDs (Top Level Domains): COM, EDU, NET, and MIL, so going in reverse from X,500 made sense. LDAP is in fact derived from X.500, including the use of BER and DER encoding. In any event, it indicates and \u201c:android\u201d component, from \u201csamsung.com\u201d called \u201cincallui\u201d. Or \u201cin call ui\u201d. It\u2019s the component that provides the UI you see when you are actively in a telephone call: keypad, speaker button, mute button, hang up button, and so forth. ",
