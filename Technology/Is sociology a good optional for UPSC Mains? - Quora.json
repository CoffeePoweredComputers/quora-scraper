            "answer_text": "Since I have sociology as my optional I am credible to give this answer . Yes sociology is a good optional for UPSC . It has very consise syllabus . Atleast paper 1 which has mostly thinkers part like Karl Marx , weber , Durkheim and etc . Syllabus is very less compared to other subjects . I have a engineering background and still I am pretty good in sociology. So no problem about your background . You can learn the paper 1 within 3 months with only 2\u20133 hrs of study . Their is Also no need of classes . For paper 2, syllabus is less but it is very vast. Anything from current affairs can come to exam . Like WHat are social significance of RTI OR MGNREGA . What are sociological contributions of Ambedkar or any social reformers . IT is very vast in these scenarios . It also helps you in GS 1 since we have Indians society as our topic so that\u2019s part gets covered in sociology syllabus .even history parts such as land reforms , land tenure system , globalisation is also convered . You will also get benefit in essay since atleast one essay is going to be social one and therefore you will have advantage over there . Sociology paper 2 has lots of caste studies , data , example that also you can use in any essay . Most of our syllabus is non changing I paper 1 . So it\u2019s mostly static part so you just have to ratta it. Though understanding will help your . It is quite easy to understand also . Books are available in market such as haralambos and ignou for paper 1 and Vikas ranjan And mohapatra notes and ignou for paper 2. If you want to join classes then Gaur classes in Delhi are goodbye for paper 1 and Mohapatra is good for paper 2 . But you should prefer Gaur sir . Overall It is a very good optional and very mark fetching also if you write it properly . Average marks are around 200\u2013230. Question is very straight forward but in last 2 years they came quite dynamic so in future that may happen . SO choose wisely. All the best . ",
