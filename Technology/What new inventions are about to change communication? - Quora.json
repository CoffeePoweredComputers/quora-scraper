            "answer_text": "I am not sure what invention might change communication, per se, but I can tell you about the most influential (and I hope not prophetic) book that I\u2019ve read which forecasts what could happen to humans, communication, government, well-being, and relationships. In this sci-fy young adult novel, the main character goes to the moon with some friends to dance and party. He and his friends are floating and dancing in the club when a \u201cterrorist\u201d disconnects his feed in such a way that it causes a ripple or shock to everyone else in the club who is already connected to the feed. You see, in the future, everybody on the earth or on the moon are continually connected to the feed - they got these compact packs attached to their bodies and it connects brains and thoughts as well as making everyone connected to messages and feedback from government and marketing. Even your perceptions and shopping behavior is fed back into the government and that data goes with you when you walk down the street or go to the mall. So back to the \u201cterrorist\u201d. This guy discharges his feed in the nightclub and the boy protagonist ends up in the hospital with his friends. They befriend a teen girl who was also affected by the feed attack and over the next few days they heal and are ready for discharge. The boys are released from the hospital and they return to earth and the girl stays behind because she has some more healing to do. You see, she acquired her feed not at birth but over a decade later. Her dad is retro conservative and in a futuristic way, a great communicator and sensible guy. We don\u2019t met him till later though. So the rest of the novel follows the teen protagonist and his new girl friend, now back on earth, through the stages of long distance dating, interaction with friends, marketing of consumer junk, and ultimately the marketing of healthcare options that may or may not be available to her depending on her attitudes, conversations, and shopping history. So you ask what invention can most impact communication? I cringe when I see articles about companies that require employees to have an RFID chip implanted under their skin. Is this communication? Absolutely. I really am concerned about the hardware that allow someone to track a friend (or child) with their cell phone. The apps should exist - YES - but apps can be used to track someone without them knowing, as in How to Track a Cell Phone Without Them Knowing. I am also concerned about the acceptance of children growing up with phones in their hands since age 2 or even age 1. This child knows no time in his or her life without that device and to assert a metaphor, the child is a \u201cslave\u201d to the phone. I am reminded of a biblical line with a slight modern edit \u201cthe cell phone was made for man, not man for the cell phone\u201d. In terms of impacting communication, we are just on the brink of a communications revolution. In 30 years, we transitioned from mainframe computers to pocket devices. Soon we will have devices in our skin, augmenting our lives and our communication (and tracking). Soon after that, we will be connected by brainwaves and thoughts will trace from one individual to the next. See Scientists Transmit Thoughts from one Brain to Another . My point is that this train is JUST leaving the station. We are seconds from leaving the platform and the journey is cross country or cross continents. Where we will be in 20 or 50 years in nothing compared to where we\u2019ll be in 100 or 700 years. Even though this is an exciting time to be alive, I am glad I live in a time in which the feed hasn\u2019t been invented yet. ",
