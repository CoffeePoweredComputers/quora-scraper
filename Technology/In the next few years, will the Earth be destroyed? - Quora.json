There is also something called Gamma Ray Bursts or GRB's I would reccomend you watch Kurzgesagts video on it. GRB are the most energetic form of light, which can be up to a million trillion times as bright as our sun. If it was a few light years away, it would destroy 1/3 of our ozone layer in a few seconds. And we wouldn't be able to see it, until it actually hits us, much like a virus. ",
