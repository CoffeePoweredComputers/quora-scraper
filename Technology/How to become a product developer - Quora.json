            "answer_text": "I started out in sales (IBM).After three years in the field, I realized that I enjoyed speaking to every department of my clients, so I asked my management if there was a job that would have me bridging any gaps between finance, service, manfacturing, techies,  marketing, sales inside of IBM. Eventually, I obtained a \"product planning\" job in an IBM lab.they needed people who had field experience, I was the youngest person in my department by at least a decade.I spent 11 more years there, helping to plan, develop, and launch products worth over $6Bn in revenue. Starting in sales brought me skills necessary to interview clients and prospects to determine future product function and value.  It also gave me credibility when claiming I spoke for the customer during planning stages. You are correct, product management is not a field generally available in higher education, as a standalone degree choice. But, each company has their own development process, so, once again, starting in sales for a drug manufacturer (for example, given your nursing background, phama is a natural choice), may be a quicker way into product development than any degree might be.

            "answer_text": "There are no 'Product Developer' roles; so you'll need to decide if you want to be a part of the process of ' building' or 'making' a product OR if you want to be a part of managing the process of how a product is conceived and taken to market. The former parts will usually require a strong understanding of the underlying technical aspects - biomedical engineers, industrial engineers and people with biology/chemistry/physics related fundamental skills tend to do well with those aspects. The later parts involve managing/leading the process of defining a product's market/customers and then taking the product through its lifecycle; these parts tend to have a marketing orientation or an architectural orientation - so an MBA-MPH with relevant coursework on new product development and a healthcare related specialization can help. Certifications can signal knowledge but they do not translate into job offers. 'Healthcare products' is a very broad generalization and you will need to make some choices within that. The best way to make a transition into the healthcare product industry is to identify what type of healthcare product you'd like to be involved in and then develop your knowledge and understanding of the customer issues and problems associated with that area. Product development and management expertise can take time to develop and you'll need a strong creative ability to solve problems based on your understanding of the customer. Personally, I do think that product managers tend to have strengths in personality traits associated with creativity, empathy, organising skills , ability to visualize ideas and communicate with precision.
