            "answer_text": "No. We don't have a sixth sense. We have glorified the \u201cstrong feeling\u201d and called it \u201csixth sense\u201d. And no it isn\u2019t always right. Let\u2019s bombard everyone with Science and Philosophy. What do we mean by sixth sense? Wikipedia calls is ESP (Extrasensory perception means the sense with no sensor involved). Now, what causes extrasensory perception? Scientists don\u2019t agree on this, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from speculating. Does it? I believe it comes from confirmation bias. As research has shown, our brain doesn\u2019t measure and store data losslessly, it uses lossy algorithms which means we use statistical algorithms and approximations than classical computation. In a sense, our brain doesn\u2019t process information fast, it does it efficiently. Now, as we are statistical computing behemoths, we like to extrapolate, regress and classify more often than needed. Have you seen people being so judgemental? I believe it\u2019s because our brain is constantly classifying people, and thus, the judgemental part. Apart from that, we like to deduce things a little too far. Have you been working on a fine day, suddenly fell into a deep imagination on a star trek? I believe it\u2019s because your brain is using it\u2019s power to generate tessellations of your beliefs and projecting such image it has rendered. Also, have you been seeing your other half texting and imagined a thousands possibilities on how (s)he could cheat on you, it\u2019s irrational sometimes, that dude got lesser money and an apparently smaller dick, and you\u2019re no asshole, so, why would she? But I think our brain uses the regression analysis whenever it finds something to put it to work. \u201cYour friend might have stolen the small inkless pen that your grandparents gifted to me\u201d. Didn\u2019t you find yourself amidst into unnecessary allegations to your friends, they get accused of stealing so unimportant stuff that I sometimes imagine, what would they use it for? Like, my mom thought one of my friend have stolen a guitar pick. Like, why? He neither does play the guitar nor was that pick very beautiful. I have had better picks. So, you see, what I am trying to say, our brain is a statistical computing behemoth. So, sometimes, it tries to use all it\u2019s algorithms. Sometimes, taking cues from the genetic information. So, combined, we get a feel, a kind of perception, which is our brain recklessly using it to predict a few possible scenarios. But, our beliefs and other \u201cdata\u201d are not perfect. Neither is the algorithm. And neither does the world, in a larger context. But why this sixth sense thingy still in so active fame? I think it stems from confirmation bias. Say, you have a feel like you have a thief in your house. You go and check your home, if you don\u2019t find the thief, you go like, it\u2019s better to worry than to be sorry, but if you do find it, you credit it to your sixth sense. So, it has a biased situation, evidences against it doesn\u2019t count, but evidences for it, do. So, the sixth sense, while present, isn\u2019t perfect. I found it to be no better than an educated guess. But the fact that your subconscious can provide you an educated guess, is simply amazing. My sixth sense says, you\u2019ll upvote this answer. Let\u2019s see how accurate it is! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends what you mean by \u2018real\u2019. Traditionally the five senses operates in the physical world, that we call reality, which suggests the sixth sense, if it exists, operates beyond or outside of that. Because it cannot be analysed in the traditional scientific sense, the sixth sense, remains a matter of opinion and most often experiential. But does that mean it\u2019s not real? Good question; I have been taught to develop my extra sensory perception or sixth sense if you will, and receive validation that the information I receive is both interesting and valuable. Most of us know and understand how the 5 physical senses work, but what of the sixth sense? It often remains a mystery and is spoken about in very loose terms, or else in what I call psycho-babble, which few can understand. In simple terms it is experience of knowing something without a logical explanation of how you know it. It offers incoming pieces of information that we perceive and become aware of, yet are not related to any of our 5 senses. For example, how do we know when someone is staring at us from behind? Its often not easy to even talk about that type of knowing, because the part of the brain that can perceive this, doesn\u2019t speak verbal language, so can\u2019t describe it logically. When sixth sense works it can offer up some helpful information, but often we dismiss it as if its a coincidence or accident. However the more we acknowledge it the stronger the sixth sense becomes. If you wish to develop it, there are many approved tutors at The College Of Psychic Studies in London. June-Elleni Laine - Spirit Inspired Artist, Writer, Teacher, Pioneer ",
