            "answer_text": "First of you need a product or service. Something that someone else is interested in. This can be in fact literally everything. If you can pick up a stone from the ground and someone on the planet wants to give you 1 million $ for it.. then you did business. The reality is a bit more complex, since stones are not rare and not delivering any kind of value that is worth much for anyone. So you first of need some kind of product/experice/service, that someone else would love to pay for. Good thing: Every person knows or owns something that someone else don\u2019t know and would love to pay money for, to save a lot of time and get the right solution from an expert. So you first have to identifiy what you are good at and what you literally LOVE to do. Something that you would do for literally free. You get no payment? Doesn\u2019t matter, you love to do it so much, that you still do it! I for my self love to support other people by their life journey. That\u2019s the reason I spend worthy time to write this instead of closing another 4\u20137 figure call. Why am I doing this? Because I literally LOVE doing this. This makes me so happy that I love to wake up every monday at 6am and be excited to help another person in his life. The fact that I love it, makes me keep doing it and repeat it like tons of time. That way I automatically get TONS of experience. You see.. you can say that I am an \u201cExpert\u201d in this \u201cjob\u201d. At first I wasn\u2019t even aware that this type of thing can be sold to anyone. You probably will struggle the say way. The reason is pretty is.. it\u2019s so \u201cself-evident\u201d for you and so easy for you, that you can\u2019t understand.., can\u2019t live the way.., can\u2019t feel how in the hells name someone else could struggle with this and would even pay a lot of money for it. It can be drawing, singing, dancing, training/petting dogs, marketing, coaching, advertising, development, fishing, computer gaming, house buying, consulting people to decide which Rolex they should buy, help people to lose weight, build up muscles, teach people to cook, there are people who teaching how to catch pikeperch fishes and he gets 2500\u20135000\u20ac for it every time and with the help of the next steps I will mention, he gets more than enough customers to become wealthy. Don\u2019t underestimate this task. It\u2019s a lot of work and going DEEP inside your brain to find that thing you love to do and can deliver value to others. After you found it, the next step is to position your self. You need to know ATOMIC PRECISELY to WHO you want to sell your product/service. If your answer is \u201cto everyone who needs it..\u201d, then you have to keep digging deeper. Let me give you an example with my job. I am a Business- and Motivationcoach. Do you have a slight clue what I am selling right now? Would you pay me 4\u20135 figures for that \u201cdescription\u201d? Let me change that \u201cdescription\u201d a little bit. \u201cI am support small and middle sized companies to increase their income by multiple 5\u20136 figures per month within 6\u201312 month, simply by directing them how to position themself correctly in the market, become visible to their perfect audience with the help of precise targeting and prevent them doing unnecessary, time wasting stuff by creating borders that stops doing them and a solid guideline that they simply have to follow step by step to reach their specific goal\u201d. 20\u201330 seconds pitch that is giving the most important information. For WHO is my service? Small- and Middle Sized Companies What is my service? Increase their monthly income to 5\u20136 figures In which time span? 6\u201312 month How am I gonna do it? Positioning, precise target advertising, creating borders and giving a step by step guideline Is this everything? No! There are TONS of more things that are giving so much value, but there is a saying that says \u201ca jack of all trades is a master of none\u201d, therefore you have to be VERY precisely digging deep into a single area. You want your target audience to EXACTLY know what you can deliver and those that see this will be \u201cOMG! THIS! EXACTLY THIS! This dude perfectly understands my needs!\u201d Imagine you are out in the desert.. you are thirsty.. really thirsty.. and there you see this cactus and from one of those Bear Grylls episodes you saw that they have some sort of juice in them.. so fuck it, you take your time and do everything, even hurt your self, just to get this juice! You really want to drink it! Imagine your nose is full of dirt and you really need to clean it.. you search for the very next best tissue you can find. In Germany we have a company named \u201cTempo\u201d that sells handkerchiefs. They made their brand such way that when you need to clean your nose, you ask for a \u201ctempo taschentuch\u201d => \u201ctempo handkerchief\u201d or just a tempo. If you can\u2019t find a tempo, you simply take the next best kitchen roll\u2026 you see? It\u2019s not the product, it\u2019s the result you get! No one cares about you, no one cares about your school degrees or your master of XXX. The only important question is: Can you solve his/her problem? Can you make his/her wish/dream/desire to become true? If you can find out their deep desire, you can sell them anything for any price. Literally. Let\u2019s make a quick summary: You need a product/service that you love to do and others would love to receive and pay for itYou need to position your self to a specific audience, even if you can do 1000 other really valuable thingsNext step is to become visible. Let\u2019s say you have the cure against the current pandemic situation. You could sell it for millions, but if no one knows you.. if no one \u201csees\u201d you. If you are literally invisible for the world.. you won\u2019t be ever able to sell it. So you need market your self and out your self as an Expert. People love to receive their solutions from an Expert in a specific area. The more and better you can describe and speak about your product/service, the more you out your self as an Expert. Quick question: If you read my initial example pitch. Before and after reading my comment explaining what you have to do. How much would you see me as an expert \u201cbefore\u201d and how much would you see me as an expert \u201cafter\u201d you read this all? Does what I am saying make sense for you or do you believe that I talk bullshit about something I have no clue about? You see.. If you simply using your experience and talk about it with a deep passion behind it.. there is literally no way that you can\u2019t be seen as Expert. This is simple Math. 1 + 1 +1 = 3 There is no deep complex and unnecessary bullshit around. It\u2019s simply \u201cService + People who wants that service = Sold service\u201d. The biggest mistake 90%+ companies do is to compare themself with big companies like Microsoft or Facebook. You are at least 10 levels below MS or FB! Strategies that they do for their company are 10000 times different than you NEED for YOUR company level. There is no sense in doing a 1 million $ marketing campaign, because you don\u2019t even own 1 million $! There is no sense in doing several hardcore funnel systems, with a 100 page blog, +100 episode podcast, email marketing and all those time consuming stuff and try to build a brand, when you are not even visible, don\u2019t have any reputation to build up a brand and can\u2019t even effort to build up a brand! You have to shut down your inner ego, which is like a hell of a job, and then you need to do the stuff that are good for YOUR company level. If you earn less or similiar to 10k per month, chances are high that you are at a very beginner level of a company. What you need to focus on is: Your product/servicePositioningBecoming visibleCLOSE!Let\u2019s come to the last step I am gonna reveal to you. It doesn\u2019t matter how many leads you can attract. The reason all this marketing stuff is usefull for you is the simple reason that you first of need to use up all the EXISTING sources of leads, BEFORE you going into the process of optimizing the lead generation. All those marketing stuff do work. Don\u2019t missunderstand me. They are very effective and help you to attract \u201ceven more\u201d customers. But they are EXTREMLY time consuming! All this work is not generating your self a single dollar! Literally! I could give you EVERYTHING of that and you could be the most famous guy on the internet. You get 0$ out of it. The only thing that those \u201ctools\u201d are made for is the fact to generate leads. Leads alone are worth nothing! You need to actually CLOSE them. You have to sell your product/service to them in a way that they accept you make a agreement out of it. You could have NOTHING, but just words and promises and you could \u201cCLOSE\u201d someone for real money. Some people are actually doing it this way. They promise things, sell the promise to someone and then buy the promise from someone else, with the money they just got from the closing. Does that matter for the customer? Who cares HOW you doing it, if in the end you can deliver what you promise. No customer does care about \u201chow\u201d. It\u2019s just a curiosity and being unsure if the person really can deliver the promise.. but if you can make it real.. they don\u2019t care at all. Countries literally selling weapons to finance wars in other countries. Do you care? I think it\u2019s morally terrible bullshit, but I am not carring enough to do more than \u201cthinking\u201d that it\u2019s bad. Water from Nestle.. people literally dying and starving from thirsy. Is anyone carring if their OWN thirst is getting solved by Nestle providing them water? How about you can deliver something without being a terrible person? Without being responsible about a full genocide? By providing REAL value just by your own experience? 1000000000 times better! So you see.. you first need to \u201cuse\u201d the existing leads and start having a simple start lead generation source, before you dive deep into the optimization process, which will increase your lead amounts. But if you can\u2019t even close the existing ones.. how are you supposed to close additional ones? Being a Entrepreneur is not only \u201cdoing\u201d something and the \u201cdoing\u201d part is already a full movie with 6 prequells, 8 seasons, 12 post-future seasons with several DLCs and different endings. But there is more, which also have their own full universe of things to know and to do. You have to keep up a high level of self confidence. You need a rock hard willpower, which sounds easier than it is in reality. In fact thats one of the biggest weak points of 95% of humans. Tons of wrong mindsets are holding us way under our potentials. If you asked your self why my initial job description contained the \u201cMotivation\u201d part, well here it is. It\u2019s EXTREMLY hard to find out how the hell you need to develop your own personallity the way, that it will actually help you instead of preventing you from success. Each new level of company will require your self to become a new version of your self. Your Person that made you reach Company Level 1 can\u2019t make you reach Level 2. If it could, it already would have made it. If you could do Millions by now, you would do it right now. That\u2019s a clear sign that you are not the person who deserves the million right now. So what you gonna do? You develop your personallity! Personal Development is what you need. It\u2019s like a big puzzle. It\u2019s really not that hard in the theoretic aspect. The only \u201cclose to impossible\u201d-hard thing is the psychologic practical part. But \u201cclose to\u201d implies that it is actually possible. In fact EVERY person could be wealthy. But not every person WANTS to be healthy. Not every person is HUNGRY enought and not WILLING to PAY THE PRICE. The price is so damn high that if someone would give you one million dollars.. it would take you a few months before you are deep into depths agains, because your mentality is still not on the level of a milionar. To make it short.. Conclusion to answer your question: You have to develop a new personalityYou need a service/productPosition your selfMake your self visibleCLOSE!You have to develop a new personalityRepeat",

            "answer_text": "The best way is to find a customer that needs a solution to a problem and is willing to let you develop it with them or wait for it to be ready. Some may probably give you some cash advance. Even when they only pay you in the end you will not be getting in debt so your failure risk is very low. But the main advantage of starting with a customer is that you will immediately be in business. Most company projects fail because they start by spending money instead of making money That is what I call a StartDown instead of a StartUp, You should see the profit graph go up before you call it a startup or a business. They spend money in all sorts of things that don\u2019t make money renting an office, buying a car (do you really need a car to deliver software? I\u2019ve seen it happen so I didn't invest in it), even small things like business cards, the website a logo will spend your money and time and make no money in return if you are a startup. If the money spent comes from credit then add the interest to the expense and you have a recipe for massive failure. This is a very real problem because most wannabe entrepreneurs can\u2019t sell anything to anyone so they will never get a paying customer to cover for all the expenses of the starting phase. But the real beauty of a tech company is that if it\u2019s software that you are making you can get all the tools for free, work from home and not spend anything. What you need to learn is to sell even before you have a product and agree with the customer on how and when you will deliver. That is how Bill Gates started Microsoft. ",
