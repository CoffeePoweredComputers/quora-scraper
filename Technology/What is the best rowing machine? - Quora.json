            "answer_text": "I have been asked this quite a few times so will share my thoughts - there are a large number of options out there (see Best Rowing Machine) but in short I believe that there are essentially there are 2 options - Concept2 or WaterRower: Concept2 Simply put, the Concept2 is the gold standard of rowing machine for rowing clubs and competitive rowers. All official scores are done on a Concept2, and this will keep the machine as the heart of the rowing world for years to come. The Concept2 has a sleek design and given it is built for rowing clubs who will be churning out the miles day after day, it is highly durable and reliable. As a home user, you will not be able to wear this out for decades! Measuring 54\u201d by 24\u201d, it can be easily incorporated into any living area and if space is a major concern, it features a quick-release frame lock mechanism that makes it easy to disassemble and store out of the way, best done so upright in a cupboard or in the corner. Available in light grey or black, the aesthetics of this machine make it very stylish and for those with an at-home gym, it is a wonderful addition. The Concept2 is a fan rower, and this will cause a bit of noise at home, so if you plan to use in a room around other people \u2013 they might not be too happy if they are watching tv! The good news is that newer models significantly cut down the noise. One of the greatest things about Concept2 machines is the display and the level of information you can get from it. You can track by speed, watts or calories. I personally only use speed, as my goals dictated so, but it is great at each. Using an approved heart rate strap also means you can get your HR up on the screen. I personally stick to a normal heart rate monitor (see my post about HR Monitors here). You can now even download your stats via USB if you are feeling extra keen. Comfort-wise, this indoor rowing machine takes mobility considerations very seriously. The footrests are adjustable, the handle is very ergonomic and the caster wheels means it can be easily repositioned. With a seat height of 20\u201d, little effort is needed to get on and off, which is ideal for those who suffer with knee complaints. Also, the seat is slightly tilted forwards which makes it a better option for those with lower back issues. All in all \u2013 for me, there is a reason that the Concept2 has been the rowing machine for competitive rowers \u2013 it has everything you need and is genuinely suitable for all standards up to Olympic rowers! WaterRower The WaterRower is relatively new to the market, and is causing a storm. It uses a very different method of power, but it is a great piece of equipment for those who have no intentions of moving to the river with their rowing! Aesthetically, it\u2019s one of the best looking indoor rowing machines you can buy as it is made of solid ash wood and finished with a honey-oak stain. This is great for those who need to keep it in their living room as it is unobtrusive and is more likely to match your interior d\u00e9cor. An added bonus here is that if it is incorporated into a living area, you\u2019re much more likely to use it. Even if it isn\u2019t out on display, it easily folds up without the need to disassemble it and it has been designed to be sorted upright \u2013 perfect for saving space. As the name suggests, this is water powered, and with the added fact that this machine is handcrafted from wood, it absorbs noise and vibrations. In fact, the only noise it produces is the gentle sloshing of the water in the tank. Much quieter than the Concept2 and could be a better option for a home gym in close proximity of others in the house. On the subject of the tank, this wonderfully smooth rowing machine features a patented water flywheel. Enclosed in a tank of water, the flywheel is not only very quiet, but is designed to simulate the feel of being in an actual rowing boat. In a way it does, as you can\u2019t just hammer your strokes out, you need to build the pace and be a bit more considered. However to those used to the Concept2, it is a very big change! The self-regulated resistance provided by this water flywheel means that the faster you row, the more resistance you feel. The computer on the machine \u2013 whilst not as advanced as that on a Concept2 which is aimed at competitive rowers \u2013 is very user-friendly. The monitor tracks intensity, stroke rate, heart rate, duration, distance and other statistics. For a home user wanting just to be able to track their progress over time, it has all that you need. Comfort-wise, the WaterRower doesn\u2019t quite match the luxury of the Concept2. The seat is tilted backwards which puts more pressure on the lower back and the footrests are made of moulded plastic that have sharp edges \u2013 not great for those who like to row barefoot or in socks. On the plus side, the flat rail gives less knee compression and so is a bit gentler on the knees. Conclusion All in all, the decision really comes down to the individual. Both of these indoor rowing machines are fantastic pieces of equipment and offer many benefits that make them ideal additions to any fitness-conscious home. If it\u2019s aesthetics that concern you, the WaterRower is definitely the best choice as the oak frame is very pleasing to the eye and it is far less mechanical than the Concept2. On the other hand, for those who are more serious about fitness, the Concept2 is definitely the way to go as the monitor provides more detail, and the Concept2 is the benchmark for comparing your times over various distances to others.
