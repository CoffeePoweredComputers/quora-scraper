            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t do it but my reasons may be different from yours. If I were to buy a CPU today, it would be either an AMD R5\u20133600X or R7\u20133700X. These CPUs are essentially new and if someone wants to sell it already, it might be because the silicon isn\u2019t up to par and it won\u2019t overclock very high. Now, of course, if the price is REALLY low then I might chance it. My current R7\u20131700 was an open-box special at Canada Computers and the price was lowered to just $20 over the price of the R5\u20131600X (that was like $80 off). That was a deal I couldn\u2019t say no to because I only overclock CPUs when they get old to get a bit more performance out of them while I shop for a replacement. However, I haven\u2019t really managed to push it past 3800MHz (although I haven\u2019t REALLY tried to do so) which tells me that it wouldn\u2019t reach the 4GHz that some first-gen Ryzens can. This isn\u2019t a huge issue for me because I haven\u2019t felt the need to overclock it yet but for some, it could be. If you get a really nice discount and don\u2019t care about overclocking, then used CPUs would be a pretty good idea. CPUs are incredibly resilient and I haven\u2019t seen one actually die in thirty years because they have safety mechanisms that throttle them or shut them down completely if there is a possibility of physical damage. As long as you don\u2019t care about overclocking, you should be perfectly safe as long as you can return one that is DOA. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes Ask about how much they overclocked, for how long, on what voltage, bclk or multiplier, etc. This is less of to see the life-span, but more to see how much performance you can expect. If you are satisfied, buy it. Use a payment method with buyer protection. Upon receipt of the cpu, take a look at the back. Is any pins missing or bent?(amd) No? Proceed Put it in motherboard. Check that dual/quad/whatever channel memory works.\\ Check that all pcie lanes work, at the correct speed Make sure the multiplier is actually unlocked. It is very easy to remove the heat spreader, and replace it with the k version of the cpu. Run your torture tests for EVERY part of the computer. A pin(or contact point) might not be working properly, but be physically there. A cpu can work without certain ones of these, at the expense of overclocking, dual channel, pcie lanes, etc. If every part works, you know for sure that every single one of those pins or contact points, and the actual cpu works. Ramp it up to the advertised overclock, voltage, and the cooling that is equivalent to what he used. Repeat above step. If it crashes, go to paypal, and ask for a partial refund, or a full refund, but you send it back, and you buy another one. If it does not, try going higher, and see what the maximum threshhold is for the cpu, it might be helpful to know. After that, go to whatever clock speed you want, and undervolt it as much as you can, while still being stable. After going through all these steps, you are either satisfied, or got a refund. It is a win-win either way. ",
