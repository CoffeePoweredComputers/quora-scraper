            "answer_text": "It actually depends on the capacity of the educational institution to afford. For example, in poor countries, most public schools are barely equipped with any technology to assist the learning process. Most of them are still using the old fashioned board and chalk. On the other hand, in average, at least a projector and desktop computer is available in every classroom. These are primarily used during the reporting activities wherein powerpoint presentations and videos are projected for the entire class. ",

            "answer_text": "Why make restrictions? My first thought was: if it will fit through the door, bring it on in. There are so many interesting pieces of machinery and history that children need to know about. Maybe they're used directly for instruction. Or maybe you can use them to teach ideas, principles, scientific laws, manufacturing techniques, anything. Probably the question is about the standard teaching tools, such as a projector.. But props are always good. Breaking the rhythm and changing the subject are always good. ",
