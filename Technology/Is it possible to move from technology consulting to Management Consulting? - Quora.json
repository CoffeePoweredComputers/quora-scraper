            "answer_text": "Yes, it's possible. However, I do want to caution you that the longer you wait, the more difficult it will be to transition into a strategy consulting role. If your end goal is MBB (or the like), you'll inevitably be asked why you didn't pursue those opportunities immediately after graduation. Additionally, after an MBA, you'll be applying for a more competitive position (e.g. Consultant) with fewer openings and thus the likelihood of receiving an offer goes down.  Ultimately, the type of work done in technology consulting shapes you into a technical specialist whereas management consulting requires a generalist's mindset that leans more heavily on thinking critically from the perspective of a CEO to successfully run a company. While there is some overlap, these are two very different skill sets and you will need strong relevant experience along with your MBA to facilitate the transition. The sooner you gain experience in strategy consulting, the better. All the best in your pursuits!  ",
