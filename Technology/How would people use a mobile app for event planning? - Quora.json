            "answer_text": "I'll chime in since some of these answers are massively outdated.  The event planning industry has seen significant growth the past 5 years.  Just this past year 86% of event planners are expected to have an app at their event which shows that mobile apps are essential at this point.    Some useful features  Create event registration formsCreate event invitationsExport guest data to create name tags/scan barcodesCollect payments Manage vendor registration Data collection, stats and analytics are all very important to anyone looking to stay in the event planning business.  How can you improve if you don't know the hard numbers?  If you are going to plan an event and not keep up with past attendees, either for feedback (Surveys, comments) or for future promotion you established that  event planning isn't for you.  The ability to collect emails to keep past attendees in the loop for your future events is worth it's weight in gold.   Using a mobile event planning app along with solid event planning skills will make any function go smoothly.   ",
