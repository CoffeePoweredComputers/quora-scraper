            "answer_text": "I think smartphones like Poco C3 are primarily meant for the students who are attending online classes while the schools and colleges are closed due to Covid-19 effect. And this is actually quite a wonderful smartphone that supports the latest features and is not even too heavy on the pockets. Starting at just 7.5k in India, Poco C3 has MediaTek Helio G35 processor that makes it great to work without lags and hiccups. Besides, with a 5MP front camera, you can attend your online classes without any hassles. Even the powerful 13MP triple rear camera is something that most of the people would love to have. Not just this, you would also love its huge 5000mAh battery that comes with 10W fast charging support and this is also a good feature for the students to last long during the calls. The other features such as display and storage are also good.  ",
