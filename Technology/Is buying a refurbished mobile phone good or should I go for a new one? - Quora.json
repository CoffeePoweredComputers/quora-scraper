            "answer_text": "Deciding to Buy a Refurbished Cell Phone The decision to actually buy a refurbished cell phone has several parts, including the issue of whether buying any cell phone is really necessary. Other considerations include price, risk, and what kind of cell phone is actually wanted. Sometimes the right cell phone will be a refurbished phone; other times it will not be. Reasons to Buy a Refurbished Phone The most obvious reason to buy a refurbished phone is price. A refurbished phone is less expensive than a similar new phone, everything else being equal. Everything else is not always equal, and it is sometimes possible to find a deeply discounted new phone that is a better deal than a refurbished phone would be. Buying a refurbished phone is also a good way to stick with a favorite model a bit longer, even after the company has moved on to a new design. There are people who really like having the newest, flashiest gadget, but there are other people who really prefer to stick with what works for them. Finally, buying refurbished phones is one way to help reduce waste. Though many electronics companies now recycle their used products, reusing an item as many times as possible before recycling saves a lot of energy. Precautions Necessary With a Refurbished Phone The most serious risk with buying a refurbished phone is that it might not actually have been refurbished. Phones also sometimes come with histories, such as an unpaid balance from the previous owner. Finally, many people buy refurbished phones as an affordable way to replace a cell phone that has been lost or stolen. In such cases, the refurbished phone has to be added to an existing cell phone plan, and not all phones are compatible with all plans. Here is a list of ways to deal with these kinds of problems.
