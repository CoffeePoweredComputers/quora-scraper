That\u2019s climbing more than 6000 vertical feet in the space of an hour. Note the era. Some of those \u201990s bikes were 18 lbs with tubulars. More in this case I bet?

            "answer_text": "It depends on the hill. I\u2019ve seen pros actually walk their bikes up the Koppenberg in the Tour of Flanders. It\u2019s up to a 22% grade in some points, and cobbled. And narrow. So cram a peloton of riders and a horde of spectators on that path along with an exhausted rider, and you might see the best of the best forced to dismount. If anyone can cycle up a grade that steep at more than single-digit speeds, I don\u2019t know who it would be. There are other climbs that are nearly as steep and are much longer (the Ventoux in the French Alps, for example). No one is going to set any land speed records up an ascent like that. ",
