            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. The question is, With the instant information now available on the internet, do people make better decisions or worse ones than before the worldwide web? On 6 August 1991, the Internet became accessible by the public for the first time. But from the summer of 1975 to summer of 1976 I was getting a computerized inventory system installed at the company I worked for and simultaneously I was urging my wife to have a department at the University of Michigan install a computer terminal in our house so that she could work from home instead of having to go into work to pick up results of surveys done by the U. of M. in the middle of the night. We got the terminal about a month after the first request. So I was already acquainted with the \u201cidea\u201d which became the Internet 20 years before it came into existence. I forget when I first heard of Project Gutenberg on the Internet. I was very happy to learn that I could download \u201cebooks\u201d as digital files without cost. (It was founded in 1971 by Michael S. Hart and is the oldest digital library.) But having knowledge has nothing to do with how well we use it. The Internet does not teach or promote how to use our minds. And of course that has resulted in billions of people anonymously displaying their lack of reasoning ability on the Internet. If we survive this, future historians will be recording what a clown show we\u2019ve put on since 1991. ",

            "answer_text": "Good decisions are a matter of maturity and confidence not the internet. Contrary to popular opinion, the internet is not the be all end all. Before the net, we have libraries, colleges, universities, excellent trainers and teachers etc. etc. etc. If the net shut down tomorrow, we'd have great decision makers because it's about people and not the net. Do you know how many people on here and everywhere that don't know how to use the net, let alone the library or even reading a book? I make suggestions about reading a book and people on here go brain dead. The ones who read what I suggest actually get what they want 99% of the time without too much effort. I suppose they could read it on the net. I don't really care where. I just hope they read it so they'll have a better life. I have to tell people how to use the net to get what they want. It's about people, not the net at all. Most people don't know how to do research at all. Scares me. I wonder how they will get what they need. My bf says enough folks will figure it out. I certainly hope so. Please know. I have nothing derogatory to say about the net. It's just not the be all end all. It is definitely a fast way to learn\u2026 no doubt about that all. BUT. If you don't know how to use it. It's useless. It's not about the net. It's is definitely about people. Good question. That's my opinion. Yours could be different. Ooooooo another way to make great decisions\u2026.differences of opinions. Bam. ",
