            "answer_text": "It's about as useful as \"32 MPG highway\".  What highway?   It's roughly some semi-relevant measurement, like the width of a transistor, or the center-to-center spacing between transistors.   There is considerable wiggle room in that measurement so the marketing folks sometimes stretch that figure to and beyond the reasonable limits. Reminds me of the NeXT laser printer, which was only 50% denser linerarly, but they called it 225%, going by dots per square inch.   Truly, the thing stacked up paper, and used thinner paper, so they could have used cubic dots and truly claimed nearly 300% more dots. ",
