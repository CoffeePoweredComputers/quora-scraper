            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no certain answer, in my opinion, but I have two possible reasons, one involving Ultron, and the other involving the events in Infinity War. First of all, we need to clear one thing up. That is that Tony Stark is just a man and feels like his abilities are lapped by a god, a world war super soldier, a rampaging and virtually invincible rage monster, a Russian master assassin, and the most accurate hand to hand combat bowman to ever live. This goes back to what he said in the third Iron Man STARK: I live in a world of supernatural powers, other worlds, gods, other dimensions, and I\u2019m just a man in a can. Of course it\u2019s been a while so I was paraphrasing as best I could, but he feels that since he uses his armor as a crutch, he doesn\u2019t have what it takes. Now by this point you might be asking yourself, what does this have to do with a vibranium suit? I\u2019m getting to that. So because of Tony\u2019s feeling of helplessness, he acts upon it. That\u2019s part of the reason why he risks his life throwing the nuke at the chitauri mothership. Well, the other part being that Fury told him to or else everyone in Manhattan would die. But what I mean is that from the look on his face when the nuke explodes most likely means, \u201cat least I was able to do something right\u201c. It\u2019s also this feeling that caused him to create Ultron. He knew being just a \u201cMan in a Can\u201d couldn\u2019t save the world from extra terrestrial threats, so he created Ultron as a program to do what he couldn\u2019t because unlike Stark, Ultron could be everywhere at once sort of like a shield (but little did he know that that was already a thing as we learn in Doctor Strange). But unfortunately as we see, through a huge misunderstanding on both Stark and Ultron\u2019s part, and perfectly quoted by Wanda Maximoff, \u201cUltron doesn\u2019t know the difference between saving the world and destroying it.\u201d And how does Ultron plan on saving/ending the world? Wait for it: Vibranium!!! First attempting to use it to give himself a better form which backfires and becomes Vision instead and also to use it to lift Sokovia into the air and then slam it back into the Earth, causing a blast of seismic energy so big it that it kills all of the human race if not all life on Earth. So my first theory is that since Tony has only encountered vibranium when its being used to destroy the world, he\u2019s just super hesitant to try because he doesn\u2019t want to make a mistake like he did with Ultron and the Avengers have to go through another very similar mess where the odds are highly stacked against them. So that\u2019s my first theory, but here\u2019s my second theory. In short, with views towards vibranium, he just doesn\u2019t see the use to making a vibranium suit. So probably what is thinking is this: \u201cWhat\u2019s the use. I don\u2019t understand. So my old-time lab-experiment super soldier frenemy uses a disc made of the stuff. So I accidentally created an artificial intelligence super bot made of vibranium. So what? My suits work fine, they\u2019re doing well, they work wonders, and more specifically they work the wonders I need at the perfect time, I just see no point to do it.\u201d Let\u2019s just remind ourselves that Stark has only encountered vibranium a handful of times. 1. Vision 2. Caps shield 3. Ultron\u2019s Sokovian doomsday device And there\u2019s one more time that he\u2019s encountered it. 4. Black Panther (Civil War) The reason that I separated Black Panther is because for the other examples Stark knew he was dealing with with vibranium. He was probably too busy in Civil War beating up Cap and his buddies to casually ask what T\u2019Challa\u2019s suit was made of. Also, if you think back, Stark has never actually been to Wakanda, and I\u2019ll bet that if he actually visited Wakanda, he would see the benefits of a vibranium suit, so for two reasons would he not see the use of making a vibranium suit. One already being implied, and another one I\u2019ll introduce. First because he hasn\u2019t been to Wakanda so he doesn\u2019t see the benefits. And second, what are all of his suits made of? Stark says it himself that \u201cIron Man\u201d was an interesting name because the suit was made of a gold-titanium alloy. Why was it made of a gold-titanium alloy? The same reason he was able to gain the upper hand on the Iron Monger. It kept his suit from freezing up and malfunctioning. But we don\u2019t know if vibranium has the same property. If I remember correctly, nothing vibranium ever left Earth in the movies. There\u2019s only four people who have vibranium anything. Vision, T\u2019Challa, Bucky, and Cap, but none of them leave Earth except after Infinity War, but the problem is by this time, T\u2019Challa and Bucky are dusted, Vision has a gigantic hole in his head, and the only time Cap leaves Earth, he doesn\u2019t even have his shield, so from what I\u2019ve seen, not an atom of vibranium left Earth, so they couldn\u2019t test if it worked like the gold-titanium alloy. Therefore he didn\u2019t make a vibranium suit because he didn\u2019t care and even if he did, he didn\u2019t know if it would allow him to work in space without malfunctioning like the gold-titanium alloy could.

            "answer_text": "In the 1940s, the US army used every supply of vibranium they had on Cap\u2019s shield.  Klaw had stolen a few supply of vibranium, he was probably selling it on the black market and Stark did not even know he had vibranium. Every vibranium that Ultron took from Klaw was used on Vision and himself.  Klaw would illegally get those vibranium by mob crimes, Stark is not a criminal.  On Earth, vibranium can only be found on Wakanda and the nation of Wakanda did not want others to know about it. T\u2019Challa would have probably allowed Stark to use some of the components but Tony is no more. So, Tony did not make a suit out of vibranium because he did not have the legal means to do so.   EDIT: He could\u2019ve melted Ultron\u2019s body but Ultron\u2019s body must\u2019ve have been lost in the debris at the end of Age of Ultron so Stark didn\u2019t really care to waste his time and resources on a futile try.
