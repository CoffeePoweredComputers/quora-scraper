            "answer_text": "I'll bite. The FCC can be under a thousand dollars, possibly free or much more. The CE can be had without cost dependant on who the manufacturer is and their attention to detail in as far as conformity goes. You the manufacturer only need to follow the directives as they apply for your device and self certification becomes a thing. The FCC pricing is going to be dependant on components used. The FCC Cert may be able to be used based on the modules used for the construction of your device. If you are able to assemble with premade components then skipping the CERT is a realistic possiblity. Skipping both of these is also CERTS a real possibility. Build and sell in less restrictive, growing markets and the regulations tend to disappear. It can take many weeks once you get to the door of the FCC, 12 or more. Your idea of simple might not be their simple. If this happens mortgage the house and keep going toward your dream. The FCC pricings can grow exponentially the more complex the device. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "If the device is equipped with RF functions,  the certificate cost will be much higher, schedule is longer, and the  process is more complicated. Assuming the product is a very simple electronic gadget without RF  functions: applying for FCC part 15B costs around $700 with 1 sample and  takes 1~2 weeks. Applying for CE: - EMC for  ITE costs around $700 with 1 sample and takes 3~4 weeks. - Safety costs around  $4,500 with 2 samples and takes 3~4 weeks. - Notified body fee is around $3,000  and takes 1~2 weeks.  To apply for Green product: the cost is around $5,000 with  3 samples and takes 4 weeks. ",
