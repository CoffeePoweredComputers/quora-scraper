            "answer_text": "By no means am I a professional, but I think I know enough to write this short tutorial. Step 1 - Gather your tools You\u2019re gonna need a screwdriver, screws, hard drive components, a computer, and a clean room. The clean room is very important. Step 2 - Open your hard drive Pretty basic. Step 3 - Throw it out because you didn\u2019t do it in a clean room, and now broke it Hard drives are complicated components which require a certain level of professionalism to repair. I believe that it\u2019s a step above motherboard repair in terms of complexity and difficulty. Since you had to ask the question on Quora, I can safely assume that you don\u2019t have the necessary skills to repair it yourself. This brings us to your second option. Step 1 - Contact your local data recovery experts Ask them whether they or someone else can fix your hard drive. Step 2 - Pay the hard drive place to fix your drive Ahhhh, much better. In the end, you would spend much more on the equipment you would need than the cost of paying someone to fix the hard drive. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm gonna go out on a limb here and surmise that your talking about a model ST3000DM001 drive. This model saw unbelievably high failure rates. In fact they are in a class action suit over it. But, unfortunately that doesn't mean they'll pay to get you data recovered. Most of these drives that failed was because of one of two reasons. One common failure related to the model's media cache getting corrupted and the drive would get stuck in a busy state. Typically, such cases can be recovered quite easily by by a data recovery lab. I know we do a ton of them and it's usually just a flat $450 for recovery. The other common failure has to do with the extremely weak read/write heads these drives came with. Recovery is often still possible in such cases but can get expensive as Seagate doesn't follow very strict manufacturing standards. Sometimes it may require several heads replacements to even determine the correct part that should be installed to replace the failed heads. Also since the heads are so weak they are prone to repeated failure. Either issue will require professional recovery, unless you plan on investing $10,000 in professional data recovery equipment. ",
