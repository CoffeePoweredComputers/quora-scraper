            "answer_text": "It varies enormously from commander to commander, the government sending the troops (chaotic? out of funds and resources? smoothly oiled machine with effective logistics, etc.?), the distance, weather conditions, livestock and wheeled transport availability, whether an ocean coast or river allowed water-transport-based supply, and even how organized (or present at all) their construction capacities were for bridges, roads, supply depots and bases, docks, warehouses, etc.. So some like the Romans did logistics extremely well while most did an abysmal job. Arriving with about a third of the troops you started with hundreds of miles ago was considered \u201cgood\u201d so losing 75\u201395% wasn\u2019t that rare. The most successful were able to get food and replacement supplies (footwear, armor, shields, arrows, spears, apparel, tents, etc.) by river barges and ships as it\u2019s the most efficient way to move stuff (even today) while oxen, mules, horses, camels, donkeys, etc. consume too much feed themselves to the point of diminishing effectiveness in a week or two. Eating the livestock that were carrying the freight happened routinely, sometimes by plan and more often just poor logistical planning or bad luck so destroying logistical capacity was very common. Wagons and carts were complex to make and the wheels and axles continually broke in routine use, let alone heavy loads in rough country (another overlooked advantage of the Roman road system is attrition on carts and wheels.) Sending herds of living livestock along to walk until they were eaten, living off of roadside forage, was very common, especially cattle, sheep, and goats. Living off the land is really \u201cwe have no plan for feeding our troops.\u201d Even those with good forward scouts and advance looting parties were fumbling about in the dark trying to find where the food stores were, let alone the trails, roads, river fords, etc.. Most of the food was stored at the thousands of small farms so raiding an individual farm would yield enough food for a few dozen to 100 troops for a day or two as the farms were inefficient and had a handful of livestock. Oddly, to the military commanders, the farmers and herdsmen would always try to hide or move their food and livestock rather than put out a nice buffet for an invading (or their own) army and then watch their family soon starve. The centralized food storage like grain was typically in fortified cities because everyone wanted food and with famines common, it could well be the citizenry. One army passing through an area had usually consumed most of the readily findable food so the next army passing through even several years later had far less food to steal locally. Logistics are complex and rely on a lot of data, math, accurate cartography, coordination communications, knowledge of food preservation and how repairs on everything are done, maintenance knowledge that takes a long time to learn, and a practical command staff. So most of it was bad guesses or completely ignoring it so troops died off or deserted, armies collapsed, invasions and sieges were abandoned, and governments fell. ",

            "answer_text": "Aa you might imagine this could vary by time and location, but \u201cliving off the land\u201d was common, i.e. stealing from peasants. But money was also created to force a population to accept soldier\u2019s wages as payment for supplies. Stealing from caches of the enemy and their supply trains was also common, and armies could travel with women and supplies in the rear of the moving armies. Clever merchants also could follow armies to make money (likewise prostitution). Roman soldiers carried 2 weeks food. \u201cThere were two types of military supplies: the supplies that the army carried in the field and the supplies that arrived from the home front. The Romans used two different terms to indicate the two types of supplies. The supplies that were transferred in a convoy along with the soldiers, the \u201cinitial supplies\u201d, were called impedimenta. These were moved for example via supply train or convoy. At least 1,400 donkeys and hundreds of wagons accompanied each legion (Roth 1998). The second type of supplies, those arriving from the home front, was called commeatus (Roth 1998). The impedimenta were an integral part of the army and followed it everywhere. As in other armies, this equipment was transported on wagons and pack animals, especially donkeys. It included the soldiers\u2019 personal equipment and food. There were several differences between the Roman military transport network and that of other armies in ancient times: the fact that every soldier carried quite a heavy load, the uniformity of the equipment, and most important, the type of equipment that every legionary carried on his back. The Roman legionary was probably the first soldier in history to carry, not only his personal equipment, but also additional equipment. In this he resembled the modern soldier more than the regular warrior in ancient times. Every eighth legionary (contubernium) received a donkey that carried the tent and accompanying equipment, something that recalls the transport of equipment carried by all-terrain vehicles in modern armies\u2026 We know that the Roman army had the means to renew the impedimenta. Each legion included professional artisans who were responsible for this task. Army camps contained ovens, pottery workshops, and workshops for the production and repair of weapons and other equipment. The soldiers cooked for themselves in their contubernium. This way, the legion and even the entire army could operate almost as a self-sufficient autarky. The only two missing elements were the raw materials, food and wood \u2013 for fuel and construction \u2013 in particular. The raw materials arrived usually through the supply lines.\u201d The Roman conquest of Iberia: logistics and supply difficulties ",
