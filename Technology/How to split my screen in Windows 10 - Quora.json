            "answer_text": "How to Snap Apps Side by Side in Windows 10  If you're using two different apps at the same time you can \"snap\" them to areas of your screen, so they each consume half of it.  To snap one app to the left of the screen, just use the mouse to drag the title bar of the first app to the left side of the screen. A transparent overlay will appear, showing you where the window will be placed. All you have to do is release the mouse button to snap the window there. Now, click the app that you want to see on the right side. Here you can see two apps, snapped side by side.   When you snap an app with the mouse on Windows 10, the new Snap Assist feature will pop up to help you out. Windows 10 then displays a thumbnail list of your open windows. Click one thumbnail, and its app snaps to the unfiled side of the screen -- you'll likely find it to be faster and more intuitive than the Snap feature on Windows 7 and 8.  But this actually isn't just limited to two apps, Windows 10 also gives you the ability to snap four windows at a time in a 2 x 2 grid. To snap a window in a 2 x 2 grid with the mouse, drag and drop it into one of the four corners of the screen. Drag-and-drop several windows in this way to get your 2 x 2 grid of open windows.
