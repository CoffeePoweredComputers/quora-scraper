Image analysis plays an important role in short-term forecasts, those that predict the weather in one to three hours into the future. Numerical weather predictions are more useful in 12-hour to three-day forecasts.\u201d fro m Wikipedia. ",

You can instantly see course and speed and intensity. This is a pic this morning of Gonzalo to the left and the coast of Africa to the right.  ",
