            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to answer this question with an experience from the past. Although the scenario and time frame are slightly different. August 14, 2003, the power went out, everywhere.... for 3 days. Everywhere being the majority of southern Ontario northern New York. What a 3 days to be alive! The majority of stores were closed, when the sun went down, it got real dark lol. The one thing I remember most, everyone was outside. It was a different world, for 3 days. People were on their porches with battery powered radios, candles. All the kids were out and about. We all wondered for how long we would go without power. I was a young teenager, so I am unaware of the economic impact it had, or the struggles of adult life with no power (ie: getting to work, is work even open, the food in the fridge etc). Back then we didn\u2019t have smartphones or Facebook, online shopping wasn\u2019t a huge thing yet.. but we did have our devices like the Sony ps1 and n64, we did have internet and stuff like instant messenger. Our use of these devices/services also wasn\u2019t likely as heavy as it is today.. however, a few hours into the black out I heard no kid complaining lol. As an adult now, I could imagine it would have been much more bothersome for those with responsibilities. I think if the internet stopped working for a year, the world would become a better place.. we are so connected now, I foresee a greater appreciation and sense of community if this were to happen. ",

Probably we will experience WORLD WAR 3. War for the internet. Internet. The thing without which the present generation can't survive even a day. But it will have some pros I guess. People will become closer to their families . They will learn the real meaning of relationships. Physical activities will increase. As there will be no internet to waste time on. Moms will be the happiest people then. As they wouldn't have to scream at us everytime to get offline . Those who are addicted to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and don't have any friends outside the virtual world would face a hell lot of difficulties. Maybe they'll be depressed. The most important thing I won't be able to use Quora. OH! Now that will be bad . Really bad. How will I read Sean Kernan's and Dylan Owens\u2019s answers? :/ And yes there will be no Netflix for one year too. Now that's like hell. But the TV shows will prosper a lot. Anyways , everything will be back to normal after one year. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a thought experiment that some have attempted to tackle in lectures and long diatribes on blogs and vlogs. It encompasses so many aspects of human existence that I cannot describe it without the best quote I have heard of it so far. Imagining today minus the Net is as content-free an exercise as imagining London in the 1840s with no steam power, New York in the 1930s with no elevators, or L.A. in the 1970s with no cars. After a while, the trellis so shapes the vine that you can\u2019t separate the two. Blake Snow, The Atlantic In his blog, he takes on the rather long and tedious task of not only life before the internet, but life unplugged after the internet. The considerations are economic, social, interpersonal, metaphysical, and global in their impact and importance. In considering the difference, it is easy to say it would be like the 1970s or \u201980s before the internet hit the mainstream market. But that is not true. To suggest that would be to suggest that removing a kidney would be like never having one in the first place. The two are not synonymous. If you have a thing, you are used to a thing. To have it removed it to experience the loss of the thing and the changes in life that come after. To have never had it is living a life without missing that which you have never known. So, I am going to stop here before I go any deeper down this rabbit hole. I encourage you to look up topics and papers and videos online about life unplugged from the internet or life without the internet or loss of the internet. The information you will find is astounding and you will not find a better answer here than you will in the wild. ",

So on a lower level you might lose all the connectivity to social site and no online activity. Internet of things is also becoming prominent these days, so all the devices that depend on internet to gather data may misbehave. Email, the most used method of communication these days will be rendered useless without Internet. You can forget about flickr, youtube,facebook, even quora. But these are just problem that are too small. Every second there are hundreds of millions worth of transactions that are floating as data in the digital form in Internet, just imagine what will happen if those got lost.There will be unimaginable economic losses,which may lead to a total economic meltdown(just imagine billions of worth transaction that are going on right this very second as you are reading).And that my friend is going to be an ugly scene to watch.

All the Internet industry will have to survive for one year at the expenses of the social system,  and the banking transactions would slow down significantly,  making the management of capital very difficult.  Phones will not work anymore,  and putting in place a new postal system will be impossible in one year. Many relations will be broken and forgotten.  However,  I guess that the world will permanently change: knowing it had happened once,  people will resist in returning to internet dependence after the year had elapsed,  and will build a stronger capacity of resistance to communication breakdown...
