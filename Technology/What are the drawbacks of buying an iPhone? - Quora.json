            "answer_text": "Advantages You get a smartphone which does all the stuff it is intended to do in the most reliable way. This is the biggest advantage of iPhone over Android, as we all know, Android we see in mobiles are customized by the Smartphone manufacturers and this brings in pain of instability in daily usability. Updates: yes you get updates instantly as Apple releases it. In Android you have to wait more even to know if your manufacturer is planning to roll out an update for your handset model, which is at times not a great feeling. Spotlight search: This is my favourite feature and makes my life a lot easier. Ease of use: I always felt Android as feature rich, but when it comes to user friendliness my vote goes to iOS. Hardware: iPhone has the best in class hardware compared to many Android smartphones available in market. Airdrop:This is a blessing to share pics/videos with other apple devices Mac, iPad or other iPhones. Warranty: This is the best advantage of having apple devices. Apple\u2019s service is the best. Many times you walk out of the service center with a new iPhone when your phone is still under warranty. This is super cool than going through the pain of waiting long to get it repaired. DISADVANTAGES If you are a normal user there is no much disadvantages you can find in iPhone, but for power users iPhone is a smart \u201cPHONE\u201d, and nothing more than that. You cannot expect a handheld computer, which is a more suitable name for an Android Phone. You have to live with the memory you got while purchasing the phone. I have a 16GB iPhone 6 Plus, so you can understand what I am talking about. 16 GB is very less memory and you will for sure get irritated by the storage almost full messages which pops up so often. iPhones with higher capacity are expensive and there is no way to increase your iPhones memory. Apple\u2019s closed ecosystem is at times a disadvantage. You need to regularly backup your phone, and always need an iTunes software or Photos app to do it properly There is no Custom MODs, live with what you got. Apple does not like people tampering with the aesthetics it created with so called the best product design team in the world. Cannot keep it in your back pocket ;), because it will bend. Many Android mobiles are also not so back pocket friendly. Quality of the lightning cable and earphones are not good compared with what many Android smartphones provide. Repairing an out of warranty iPhone is costly and all the accessories are costly Conclusion: Basically it all depends on what you look for in a Smartphone. If you are looking for a reliable phone which does not let you down in your important day to day activities then iPhone is for you. If you are looking to invest on a smartphone thinking to use for another 3\u20134 years, yes you better spend that money on an iPhone. If you prefer being able to do cool stuff with your smartphone like sharing music/films/videos with your friends, or having a customised UI to match your style or you get bored of a phone after few months of use then go for some good Android smartphone. Now a days it is not about cost of iPhones, because most of the high end Android smartphones are as expensive as iPhone ",

            "answer_text": "Look man honestly , My first smartphone was samsung galaxy s2. Probably its a famous smartphone everyone knows about it. So i used that phone and in 2016 just like you i was obsessed with iphone 6S and within no time i managed and got an iphone. And after that day, time by time, i really miss android freedom and feel like i am in jail and the jail in which there are alot of restrictions. Lets mention some of them: iphone does not allow to download anything like i did downloading in my s2 through Uc browser to download any kinda stuffI used to keep my backup on google drive in s2. So i decided to backup my camera roll in google drive in iphone and i came to know that iphone will upload your stuff only when google drive is on and your display is always on and if you minimize for two minutes everything thing will turn off due to iphone automatic ram optimization. While i remember in android i used to start my backup in g.drive and minimize the tab and start to play games or chatting meanwhileI am a music lover. This is main disappointment a android user feel after shifting to iPhone. You gotta buy music through itunes or you gotta sync music through laptop or pc. Dude who the hell do this in 2017? Meanwhile in s2, any time i like to listen music, i went to any music site and download through uc and it was just like simple and automatically s2 transferred it to music library.Not headphone jack. Means if you are not rich enough to buy a bluetooth headphones then you can't lisen to music or anything through headphones while charging.No dual simNo expandable memory (my s2 was 16Gb and then a time came when it was not enough to keep all apps and my data (images,videos and music) and then i bought an 32Gb memory card and i was again rocking with this much memory and all my data was fixed in it)No utorrent to download movies and music (though it is illegal but who cares) when in android you can do itCant access file managerMany apple apps are not available in my country pakistan like itunes and apple maps doesn't work in pakistan . More, they brought google maps in 2017 in pakistani app store. Dude what the fuck in 2017? I used in my S2 in 2012 in pakistan.These are the few which i can explain. I used to use my s2 as a computer. Means every shit i wanted to perform. S2 said yes boss i can do more than it while in iphone it says no bitch go and sit back. I am not for this i am just a phone finally. And i swear i miss android so much. But if you wana use what it offers. Then it is best than any other phone. Its design,oh, everyone in university or outside looks at me when i have iphone in hand but finally its just a phone. Thats it! ",
