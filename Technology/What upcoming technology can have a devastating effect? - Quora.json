            "answer_text": "Project Thor | The Rods from God! USA\u2019s Project Thor would Fire Tungsten Poles at Targets From Outer Space. On being dropped from Space, the rods would have gained so much amount of energy (Kinetic) that it could produce damage equivalent to a nuclear bomb but without the trouble of nuclear radiation and fallout.   It\u2019s a sort of the Dream Weapon for the saddist weapon manufactures and government officials alike. And since the 107-country Outer Space Treaty signed in 1967 prohibits only nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons from being placed in or used from Earth's orbit, excluding Kinetic Energy Weapons as in Project Thor, serious consideration has been given to the project. The estimated cost of lifting one single rod into space is about $230 million per rod to place into an orbit which when compared to another estimated cost of $212.5 million apiece for the next generation US Air Force's proposed intercontinental ballistic missiles, Project Thor looks like an attractive prospect, considering it can be used within a 15-minute notice. The plot of the movie GI Joe Retaliation revolves around the Cobra Satellite capable of sending Tungsten rods smashing into cities on earth. The main antagonist even threatens the world leaders with a demo of the strike on London.
