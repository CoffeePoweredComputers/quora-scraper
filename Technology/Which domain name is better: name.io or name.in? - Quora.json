The other part says \u2018it depends on how you define better\u2019. Better street cred in Silicon Valley? Sounds more local to someone in Bangalore? Sounds more local to someone in Mountain View? Ranks further up on Bing? Sounds nicer when you say it? (Imagine if LinkedIn were called LinkedIo. Or a betting company called http://BetAndW.in versus one called http://BetAndW.io.) Registrar has policies that you find better? WHOIS data comes in a more readable format? So the short version: your question doesn\u2019t have enough information for a good answer, and there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all answer. ",
