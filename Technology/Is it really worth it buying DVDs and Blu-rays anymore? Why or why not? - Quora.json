            "answer_text": "A very good question. Is it worth buying DVDs and Blu Rays anymore? What are pros and cons? I suppose this question is vis-a-vis streaming service and Cable/TV. I will also include Torrents - something that is illegal but many do it anyway. The answer is not straight forward and there is no \u2018one glove that fits all hands\u2019. Depends upon you personal preference and choice. Discs vs. online streaming First. The point about streaming service or VoD or Pay-per-View is that there is no ownership and there are limits. For instance, Netflix allows three downloads in 12 months, AFAIK (correct me if I am wrong). This may be good enough for most but there are a few movies that one likes to see over and over again. In this case buying the disc is cheaper. On Cable/TV, we have no choice on the movie that we wish to see and there are frequent commercial breaks. Secondly, not all titles are available in the service that you are subscribed to. Further, there are more restrictions depending upon the territory you fall in. Disney has become a giant and starting their own streaming service. Consequently, it is \u201coff-licensing\u201d many of the movies from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc. Point is - how many services will you subscribe to - just to watch all the titles you wish to watch? What will be the cost? Third. The streaming service content, even if FHD or UHD, is never the same quality as Blu Ray. Most people may not be able to tell a difference and certainly not on a TV of 40\u2033 or smaller. But on a large screen, it is possible to make out the difference. For instance, I swear, I can make out the difference between \u2018The Hobbit - Part 1\u2019 BD and from same movie from Netflix. Fourth is the HD sound. I am talking about 7.1 audio. This is possible with Netflix UHD service only (more expensive). If you, like me, own a home theatre with AVR and 5.1 or 7.1 channel speakers, you would like to get that. Only when subscribed to the highest quality paid service like Netflix UHD or Amazon Prime 4K, you will get it. These are in my opinion the most common drawbacks of a subscription service.  Now let me talk about discs. DVD: It is my opinion that DVD is something that is not worth buying today unless we are looking at a cheap \u2018buy\u2019 option. DVDs are Standard Definition. In today\u2019s age of moving to 4K, who watches SD? DVDs, in my opinion, are worth buying only if the title is not available on Blu Ray. The price difference between DVD and BD is not that high and for a slightly higher cost ($5 typical), I would prefer to get FHD any day. Blu Ray (BD): Blu Ray delivers stunning FHD quality, much better than online streaming services, TV, cable, etc. because of the much higher bit rate. Other use low bit rate to compress the size and manage the bandwidth restrictions. The BD also delivers uncompressed HD sound in DTS HD Master Audio 7.1 or Dolby TruHD 7.1. Netflix will provide compressed 7.1 in the UHD plan/option, and most cable/TV services will restrict to 5.1 Dolby Digital. 4K/UHD BD: These are fairly expensive at the moment but if you have a 4K TV, then to get the true visual benefit, 4K BD is worth buying for the ultimate video and audio quality. If you own a Dolby Atmos HT system then 4K BD will provide Dolby Atmos or DTS:X (uncompressed). Netflix and Amazon Prime also provide Dolby Atmos surround sound but only in the highest plan and it is compressed.  What are the cons of discs? The first drawback of discs is that they require storage space. I have over 500 titles and it takes a great deal of storage space in my small apartment. Some have over 1000 titles. I wonder what they do? The second disadvantage is that we require a player capable of the format we are buying. 4K BDP is a must for 4K BD playing. However, players are not that expensive (unless you want a region/zone free player). The third disadvantage is that once you buy the disc and tear/peel off the plastic cover, there is no return refund. You can only exchange it for a defective piece. With a streaming service, you have not paid for that particular movie; you have paid for the full month. If you watch a \u2018bad movie\u2019 you have only lost your time. The fourth biggest disadvantage is the cost. One disc will easily cost over $15 (typical). We pay about $10\u201312 for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, etc. With the streaming service, we can watch any number of movies and only restricted by the free time we have. This one single disadvantage is enough to chose streaming service for most.  Finally a word on Torrents. People download HD and even 4K titles from various torrent sites. I will not comment upon the righteousness of this but speak about quality. Torrent titles are heavily compressed. Imagine this - the typical BD (size 50GB, dual layer) has a movie that takes up nearly 30\u201340 GB. The typical torrent MKV/MP4 of the movie is 2 GB. While MKV is a good format, it is still heavily down-sampled to reduce the size. Torrents may be good enough for monitors up to 24\u2033 but they do show up the quality or the lack of it on bigger TVs. Secondly, most torrents have 2-channel stereo sound - certainly no good for a Home Theatre. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is YES. Aside from protection from never knowing when a movie you want to see will be pulled from one or many streaming catalogs you already are subscribed to on you don't, buying a percentage of your own movies on physical media protects you from corporate greed interfering with your enjoyment of movies. It also helps protect us as a whole from the same vices. Audiences, en masse, buying fewer physical media movies gives film distributors/studios more rope to hang the audience with via streaming network subscriptions. Most movies that I like enough to purchase I\u2019ll watch 4\u20135 times over several years and sometimes more. It's cheaper to buy the movie than to rent it that many times or more. The problem is that as we get closer to an all-digital \u201dStreaming Only\u201d model for movies and serial cinema distribution every streaming network will get smaller and smaller as subscription streaming networks multiply because none of the film distribution rights owners wants some other network getting any part of their share of the digital take. This essentially means that eventually every movie you want to watch at home will be on its own streaming network, and/or in a separate higher pay tier with a bunch of movies you don't care about. Ala-carte digital movie rental rules will also get more and more stringent, as in 24-hours, whether you watch the movie or not you pay $5, or $10 for 4k or whatever. The torrent wave isn't going to last forever either pirates. Don't believe flixtor is safe forever. Movie studios and streaming networks will regularly start suing individuals, planting movie downloads with hardware currupting viruses. Every dirty trick to n the book. It's going to a be a mess for consumers that will be magnitudes worse then cable networks ever have been. MARK MY WORDS. Inexpensive physical media, if it survives, is the ultimate equalizer. ",
