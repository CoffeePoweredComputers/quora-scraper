            "answer_text": "These days, commercially made power supplies are so cheap it doesn\u2019t pay to make your own. Linear supplies are easier to make and design but they usually require a properly sized power transformer and heat sinking as they are inefficient. Switch mode power supplies are much more efficient and small and require less heat sinking. But the layout is very critical. You can buy switching DC-DC power modules to do most of the work and then just use a wall wart. I wouldn\u2019t design a power supply these days. just buy some modules from Banggood or T-mart. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is possible and, with some basic understanding of electronics and electronic components, not very difficult. BE AWARE it could be dangerous if you\u2019re not familiar with some of the basics. In short you need a few items. A transformer which lowers your input AC line voltage to a level which is suitable for your particular needs.A rectifier circuit which will convert the input AC (Alternating current) into your output DC ( Direct current).A regulator to regulate the output.Some voltage filtering to \u2018clean up\u2019 the output voltage.Keep in mind this is a very simple list but it is the basic circuits needed.

            "answer_text": "Before you do anything, you need to specify what you want - input voltage, output voltage and current, AC or DC, frequency if AC, duty cycle, adjustment, regulation, temperature range, etc. Then look and see if you can buy one ready-made. It might be cheaper than anything you can build. Power supplies often require special transformers, ICs, and other parts that you can\u2019t get. Often the transformers are custom made. ",
