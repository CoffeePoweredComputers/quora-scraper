            "answer_text": "In almost all cases, yes, faster charging. Airplane mode turns off the RF cell communication, so that saves power. Cell phones \u201clisten\u201d for any incoming calls or texts, so they are pinging every couple seconds to see if anything is going on. Doing that requires some power and that\u2019s partly why cell phone batteries drain gradually throughout the day. With the cell phones I\u2019ve had I\u2019ve noticed that my battery lasts about 5 times longer in airplane mode. So airplane mode uses less power, allowing faster battery charging. It is possible that a hefty charger (meaning 1.5 amps or more) could provide full battery charging while also powering the cell phone communication, which means airplane mode would make no difference. At some point a battery can only charge as fast as the design allowed current to flow but for most standard cell phone chargers, they provide an amp or less of charge, so airplane mode would allow faster charging to take place.

            "answer_text": "Think about it like this. What if you were filling a pool with water and draining it at the same time. That is what wireless radios do. but if you stop draining the pool (or turn off the radios/ put the phone on airplane mode) it reaches its peak faster Your phone still draws power from the battery while it is charging(I think. Even if it does not draw power from the battery, and instead gets power from the charging cable, that still means less power gets to the battery over a given time, which ultimately means slower charging). Disabling the wireless radios will use less power which ultimately reduces charging time. This effect is minimal in many phones that have quick charging though, but can be very effective for those phones which do not have this feature. (I'm looking at you Apple. Those Plus phones take forever to charge. Please?? Pretty please????) ",
