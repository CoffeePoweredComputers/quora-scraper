            "answer_text": "Time travel into the future happens all the time, but the effects are so tiny we don\u2019t notice it. According to Einstein\u2019s relativity, time slows down for people who are moving relative to another person, so it you get in a vehicle and move at high speed to a distant location, then return, when you get back your clock will be behind those of the people who stayed home. Do this fast enough and far enough, and a trip that takes you 10 seconds might find you coming back to a place that has experienced hours or days or years more than you did, so you have effectively moved into their future. For the effects to be obvious, the speed has to be a significant fraction of the speed of light. That\u2019s so much faster than any current method of transportation that even for astronauts, the effect is not detectable with ordinary clocks, but it has been measured using atomic clocks in ordinary commercial airline flights. So the effect is tiny at ordinary speeds, but gets larger as you go faster, and gets much larger (without limit) as you get close to the speed of light. If you traveled very close to the speed of light, a trip that takes you only a few seconds could bring you back to a world that\u2019s a million years in the future. So time machines already exist. Your car is one. But it\u2019s a one-way time machine and can only travel into the future. Actually of course we are all always travelling into the future, but at what (normally) appears to be a fixed rate that\u2019s the same for everyone. And that \u201cappearance\u201d is not quite exactly correct. Going _back_ in time is a much more difficult problem, since you run into the obvious \u201cgrandfather paradox\u201d contradictions: what if you went back in time and killed one of your ancestors before they had conceived the child that was next in line between them and you in your family tree. Then you wouldn\u2019t exist and couldn\u2019t have traveled back in time in the first place. ",

            "answer_text": "Time machines have been around for over 120 years, the first known example was invented by these two chaps  They are of course Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re. True the first machines were very crude  compared with those most of us routinely carry around with us today without knowing what they are. The only way there will ever be able to travel back in time is through the miracle of movie camera, video and, today, the smart phone. If you would like to travel back in time the easiest way is through you tube where it is simple to travel back 100 + years. Simple by clicking this arrow you can travel back to the year 1889  Of course you can not interact with those you see. You can only observe in amazement. Through the imagination of science fiction writers and filmmakers any thing is possible. But can you appreciate the utter confusion if it were ever possible to do what you are suggesting? I love science fiction time travel movies & books but that is all it will ever be, the figment of the author\u2019s vivid imagination. The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor WitShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it. Omar Khayy\u00e1m \u201cYesterday has just departed And tomorrow hasn\u2019t started All that matters is right now \u201c Cupid's Inspiration No, scientists didn\u2019t just \u201creverse time\u201d with a quantum computer I suggest you read this article carefully before you hop into your time machines to put the world to right.
