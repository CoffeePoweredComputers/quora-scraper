            "answer_text": "There are multiple cardio workouts that millions of people do because their ways to them are the very best. I\u2019ve tried various methods such as bicycle riding, swimming, running, Trikke riding, Street Strider riding, walking. For my needs, the very best is a Me-Mover stepping machine. My needs require stability because I am 81 years old, I also require no hard foot impact on my joints. I also need a fast cardio workout, something that doesn/t require hours to do. My mobility is important to me, so I use the Me-Mover to ride in my county as well as many others for transportation purposes. Bottom line I get a cardio workout almost every day I\u2019m on the scooter, even a short ride to the store. The very best in anything is a personal opinion that you should make up your own mind through evaluation. Good luck. ",
