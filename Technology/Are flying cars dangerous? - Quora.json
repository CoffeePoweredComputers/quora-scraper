            "answer_text": "Are flying cars dangerous? Let\u2019s cut to the chase. A flying car is, for all intents and purposes, really a \u201cRoadworthy\u201d or drivable airplane. Which means that unless it\u2019s an unusual design, it\u2019s going to be subject to all of the issues and constraints that airplanes are. Specifically; Different types of airplanes handle differently.Different types of airplane are more subject to unusual aerodynamic issues.Different types of airplanes are easier to learn to fly.Different types of airplanes are easier to fly that others.Different types of airplanes need longer runways for landing and taking off.Different types of airplanes have better safety records than others.And on and on\u2026Most of the above is essentially the same thing \u2014 different airplanes fly differently. There\u2019s no reason drivable airplanes shouldn\u2019t have the same issues/constraints as airplanes. Oh, and BTW, unless the Federal Aviation Administration changes the Rules, while operating the \u201cflying\u201d aspect of the vehicle, you\u2019ll need a pilot\u2019s license. ",

They would be as dangerous as the drivers competence to drive (or perhaps pilot?) them. Given their lack of ability to stay in the air if they had mechanical trouble I imagine there would be a \u2018fly-in-the-air\u2019 or \u2018Airgoodness Certificate\u2019 of some sort, so would have to reach a higher standard of \u2018fly-in-the-airness\u2019 than ground based vehicles. All a bit of a dream really. ",

            "answer_text": "Energy usage. Flying takes much more energy than rolling. Most people would have difficulty affording the massive increase in fuel costs to go the same distance. More fuel or batteries mean a heavier craft, which further reduces efficiency.Licensing. The procedure to get a pilot\u2019s license is much harder than getting a driver\u2019s license. Many people cannot afford this.Difficulty of use. We have lots of bad drivers. When they need to work with a third dimension, this will be much harder.Coordinating traffic. Current air-traffic systems are not created for flying cars in urban areas. It would take a major overhaul to support this.Maintenance. Ground vehicle require much less maintenance than air vehicles. In part, this is because most failures in ground vehicles simply mean the vehicle has to be towed. Air vehicle failures often mean a crash landing.Safety issues. Current vehicle accidents are very dangerous. Flying vehicles have more potential energy because of gravity, and they will likely carry more fuel than ground vehicles.Landing/parking area. Air vehicles require a place to land and take off. They also require more space to park than ground vehicles.",

In this case there are multiple shortages: autonomy (time of flight is short - about 10-15 min), sound pollution, payload is very small. The other solutions for flying cars available have other issues as well: need of a runway for some, putting wings or propellers up procedure. All these makes it unpractical to use as a car and more suited as a hoby. ",
