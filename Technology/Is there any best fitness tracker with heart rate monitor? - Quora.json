            "answer_text": "I'm also in search for something similar. The Samsung Gear Fit seems excellent on 'paper' since it is a fitness tracker with heart rate monitor and a smart watch which apart from telling time also gives you weather, email/IM notifications etc.. Although it does not track automatically, you need to turn it on and off, which is a big minus point if you're someone like me who doesn't need to think about it and I don't know how accurate the measurements are when compared to something like the Fitbit Flex. I'm still deciding what to buy. ",
