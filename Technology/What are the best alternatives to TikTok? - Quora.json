            "answer_text": " (Ranked: The World's Most Downloaded Apps)  (TikTok was most downloaded non-gaming app at the start of 2020) Many articles list Instagram Reels, Thriller, Byte, Dubsmash, and many other popular alternatives to TikTok, but none of them could board on the hall of fame except Likee. On the top apps worldwide downloads for the first month 2020, it was Likee that was listed in the sixth position, honorably ahead of Snapchat and YouTube! At least from the recent trend and many other people\u2019s predictions, I think these five apps Likee, Instagram Reels, Dubsmash, Thriller, and Byty could be the most popular TikTok alternatives among all possible choices in the future. Likee - a Singapore-based app with its parent company being in China. Likee is a photo and video editing app that is very similar to TikTok. So far, Likee has 115.3 million monthly active users. It offers more personalization than TikTok in its special effects, face-swapping features, stickers, music video filters, beauty filters, collage options that people go crazy about. In addition, the app launched a Talent Creator Academy that offers financial support for content creators. VP of owner sister company BIGO Technologies, Mike Ong said \u201cThis academy provides a platform to select talented people to showcase their skills, create quality videos, and earn good benefits.\u201dDubsmash - a New York-based video-sharing social media service app. Performers can dub over the piece of video that they recorded from movies, shows, and music clips, in which lips are synchronized, the words are interpreted closely, and the emotion and tone are carried over. Dubsmash rode along with the surge of interest in short-form video and has revived itself as the #2 to TikTok. Now Dubsmash has 1 billion video views per month. (5).Instagram Reels - owned by Instagram obviously. It is a brand new way to create fun and engaging video content from Instagram Stories. Instagram Reels allows you to record and edit 15-second short-form video clips with background music and share them to their Stories, Explore Feed, and the new Reels tab on a user\u2019s profile. Similar to TikTok\u2019s For You page, Instagram Reels has new Reels Explore Feed on the Instagram Explore Page. Starting from August 5th, 2020, Instagram Reels has launched globally in over 50 countries, including the U.S. However, since TikTok has acquired unprecedented success, it is not that easy to advise those TikTok fans to transfer to Reels although Reels has similar functions and better features than TikTok. It is wrapped inside Instagram and can take advantage of all available features that Instagram has. It would bring convenience to Instagram users' use.Thriller - a 5-year-old, AI-driven entertainment platform, California based video creation and sharing social media platform. Users can use the app's editing algorithm that uses intelligent audio and facial analysis to decide when to cut. President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign\u2019s first video on this rising video platform had nearly 1.2 million views as of noon August 16, 2020. Trump ordered TikTok to sell U.S. assets within 90 days last Friday, citing national security concerns.Byte - a U.S. based social networking short-form video hosting service. Released on January 24, 2020, Byte allows users to create 15-second looping videos, similar to Vine. Some former Vine stars have joined the app and begun crafting their own short videos. So far, Byte does not allow for duets \u2014 side-by-side video reactions, filters, or augmented reality that has been popularized by TikTok.From what I read, it sounds like Thriller is possible to land on the stage to replace TikTok if TokTok did not sell its U.S. assets in 3 months.

            "answer_text": "The largest competitors to TikTok are Instagram and Facebook. Both are testing out apps/features with the intent to compete against TikTok. Facebook\u2019s Lasso  Facebook released an app called \u201cLasso\u201d in late 2018 to directly compete with TikTok. The app can be seen as a pretty direct copy of TikTok\u2019s concept. This is Facebook\u2019s try to stop the hype of TikTok, which could result in lost users for Facebook. At this point, the Lasso app hasn\u2019t really hit any major milestones. It has only received a couple of million downloads since its release, which is nothing when compared to the hundreds of millions of downloads TikTok received in the same time span. It will be interesting to see if the app can pick up some steam, but I don\u2019t think it will be a huge success. Still, you never really know. And since Facebook is a very powerful company they might be able to give TikTok a hard time. Here are some of the sources: Facebook launches Lasso, its music and video TikTok clone \u2013 TechCrunch Facebook quietly launches a TikTok competitor app called Lasso Instagram Reels  Instagram is testing a variety of features it calls \u201cReels\u201d in Brasil which have a lot in common with the features that make TikTok so compelling for it\u2019s users. This could be serious competition for TikTok, since Instagram already has a huge user base. The challenge for Instagram will be to add this set of feature into its app, which is already full of features without confusing its users. I will also be exciting to see, if these features will even be used by Instagrammers. But remember: When Instagram did this to Snapchat in 2016 (by copying the \u201cstories concept\u201d) it worked out great for them and ended in Snapchat losing many of its users. Here are some of the sources: Instagram Stories launches TikTok clone Reels in Brazil \u2013 TechCrunch Instagram is launching a new video tool that\u2019s nearly a copycat of popular video app TikTok ",
