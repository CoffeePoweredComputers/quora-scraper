            "answer_text": "Yes definitely smartphones with same camera sensor will produce different image quality, It depends on many factors like aperture, lighting conditions, software optimization\u2026.. Lets assume 2 identical sensors with different aperture captured a picture in well light condition then the output image is identical (you may notice some differences which we will talk in a bit)When you take a picture with these 2 in low light condition then the output image will differ due to different aperture - one with good light and sharp details other with poor details and noisy.Now Lets assume 2 sensors with same hardware(i.e aperture), if you click a picture even then we will notice some differences like dynamic range, exposure, contrast,\u2026\u2026 This is due to the fact that not every smartphone is loaded with same software every brand uses its own software algorithm to get the best results, that\u2019s why smartphones with 48MP or 64MP cannot beat industry leaders like pixel 4xl or Samsung S10 or Note 10\u2019s with 12MP camera\u2019s. Pixel is known for its Best software optimisation that is the reason why a lot of people go crazy for Google camera( I think you heard about this).At last everything is important(hardware and software) and everything serves it\u2019s purpose.",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. Yes, very much so. All phone cameras have tiny sensors and fixed apertures, and the image quality from all is similarly poor. What differentiates the images is the quality of the lens (better in high end phones, obviously) and the image processing by the phone computer. That is why iPhone and Google Pixel 12 MP phone cameras give better pictures than 48 and 64 megapixel phone cameras. Better lenses, superior processing software. Regards, ",
