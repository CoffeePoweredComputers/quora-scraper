            "answer_text": "An upscaling DVD player that turns all of the movies you own\u2014plus all the ones you can rent from Netflix or Blockbuster\u2014into high definition goodness. The quality isn't going to be as good as HD DVD or Blu-ray, but if you add in the extra features that these very refined DVD players have\u2014streaming, Internet radio, and DivX playback\u2014you can possibly get an even richer media experience. you should understand that Upscaling DVD players aren't the same as actual HD DVD or Blu-ray players. You still have the same amount of data in terms of pixels you came in with, namely, a lot less pixels than actual HD players. These don't turn SD content into HD content technically, they just make your SD content look a whole lot better than they do on regular SD players. ",
