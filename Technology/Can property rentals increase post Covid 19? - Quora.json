            "answer_text": "Yes, Property rentals are going to increase post covid 19. Always Demand and supply is the the main reason behind increase or decrease in pricing of that particular product. Due to following reasons Rental will increase :- Work from home culture and online education from home is creating demand for one extra room . People want to have bigger( from 2/3 bhk to 3/4 bhk) house now. Increased demand will surly increase the rentals.Due to covid19, construction of the new properties is not going on or delayed . No new supply in the market. Demand is already there but supply is limited ,it will support to increase in rentals of existing properties.People will prefer to stay on rent instead of investing huge amount in buying of the property. Mindset to keep sufficient money in hand will stop buyers to buy, they will prefer to stay at rent. Definitely demand will increase of rental properties\u2026..rent will increase.Job lost or job insecurity due to covid19 problem will also stop them towards buying decision of their own home. Their choice will be to stay on rent instead of paying EMIs to bank . Directly or indirectly Rental demand will increase in the market and obviously rent will increase of residential properties.Social Distancing will be new normal and to keep social distancing People will have to take more residential properties on rent instead of staying together. This concept will increase demand of rental properties. No doubt increase demand will lead to increase in rentals.",

            "answer_text": "In Mumbai rentals would rather reduce than increase. Commercial property rents and rates will go down. Work from home will become more popular which will lead to shut down of offices or taking up small office spaces which would further lead to a lot of unoccupied inventory which would force the landlords to reduce rentals. Residential Property rent will go down in the short term as a lot of reverse migration has been happening again leading to a lot of unoccupied inventory. However this could change when things get 100% normal. ",
