            "answer_text": "Q: Does China have the best 5G technology? A: No. 5G was invented by The West5G was not invented by China (Huawei, etc.)China (Huawei, etc.) has to comply with the standards made by The WestAll 5G cell phone systems must comply with certain standards set by the 3GPP, internationally3GPP - WikipediaHuawei simply received Chinese taxpayer subsidies to start their 5G cell tower products earlier than everyone elseThe Chinese government was attempting to push Huawei into leading position so that most if not all cell companies in The West would implement the Huawei products which were not only early to market, they were being offered at a discountThat plan backfired, manufacturers in The West geared up production quickly and passed by Huawei easilyIn fact when Huawei was making claims that in early 2019 they owned all the critical patents to 5G technology, the truth was that Nokia (not counting Ericsson) already had 50% more critical 5G patents issued to them and they were submitting patents much faster than Huawei was submitting themBy the end of summer 2020 Nokia and Ericsson were able to complete their 5G cell tower designs, get them into production, and deliver enough product to the United States that all three cell phone carriers have deployed 5G across the US from Coast to CoastHuawei has not covered China from border to border (\u201cCoast to Coast\u201d) by the end of summer 2020 with 5G, they only have two major cities (possibly three, its difficult to get the truth out of China) and several rural areas with 5G coverage, so Huawei and China are far behind in 5G, no matter how you look at itThe rural area coverage in China turned out to be a clever way to over-report 5G coverage in major cities by claiming that the city had coverage when in fact it does not, by placing barely a handful of 5G towers in rural areas, they could be deployed quickly compared to the lengthy amount of time it takes to properly cover any major city properly with 5G, so we see that China is severely over-reporting their 5G coverage",

            "answer_text": "No, China has got the exact same 5G technology as everyone else (except maybe a few users of Verizon, who have been \u201cblessed\u201d with fake 5Ge). 5G has been developed by 3GPP, an international cooperation of regional and national standards organizations, including US, China and Europe. All network infrastructure providers are using the exact same international standards to implement their kit, which they deliver to the requesting operators. These providers include Ericsson (Sweden), Nokia (Finland), Huawei and ZTE (China) and Samsung (Korea). They all deliver to all markets: Huawei have got contracts in the West, while Ericsson and Nokia hold contracts in China. China regulator has released the exact same frequency bands for 5G, that the western regulators are looking at. China as a country has an upper hand in the network rollout, mainly due to lower administrative hurdles for implementation of radio base stations. ",
