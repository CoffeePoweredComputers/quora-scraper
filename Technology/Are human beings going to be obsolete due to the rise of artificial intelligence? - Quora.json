            "answer_text": "Question: Are human beings going to be obsolete due to the rise of artificial intelligence? Answer: Well that depends upon what you think the function of a human being is. We invent machines to perform functions. If we invent better more efficient reliable machines, we say the old machines are now obsolete. They are obsolete because the new machines now perform the function better, cheaper, more efficiently, more reliably. So what is the function of a human being? If the function of a human is to build pyramids, then machines can largely do that better. Egyptian slaves are now obsolete, yes. If the function of a human is to eat, sleep and reproduce other humans, then technology can\u2019t do that yet \u2026 but watch this space. If the function of a human is to develop spiritual awareness, to worship the Creator God, and perfect one\u2019s soul, then technology isn\u2019t even in the game. If the function of a human being is to think - then yes, AI may make us obsolete. If the ideas of the Noosphere, the idea that the universe is developing consciousness, are correct, then it\u2019s an open question whether AI can replace human beings. The function of consciousness itself is a \u2018hard problem\u2019 and it\u2019s unclear whether intelligence necessarily results in consciousness. Beyond question AI can increasingly replace human intellectual labour in the same way that it has replaced human physical labour. It will be a while before AI can write Shakespeare, but then not many humans can write Shakespeare either. But the fact that Egyptian slaves were made obsolete by technology wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, and didn\u2019t make humans obsolete. And the fact that AI has replaced a lot of secretaries, the typing pool, and the switchboard operators isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, and doesn\u2019t make human beings obsolete either. But \u2026 when technology can do everything better than a human can \u2026 it does leave one wondering. But spirituality, qualia, consciousness, being Human \u2026 there\u2019s a way to go before technology can replace the human experience. So no - we aren\u2019t obsolete yet. But we may need to seriously think about what the purpose of being human is. Hope these thoughts help. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so, well, at least not for ALL human beings. First, some comforting \u201cproof\u201d that a Turing machine cannot replace human intuition, see his 1936 paper, \"On Computable Numbers\u201d of the proof that a universal algorithmic method of determining truth in math cannot exist. Will AI compensate lack of intuition with speed and brutal force trial and error? Like natural selected and gene mutation work hand in hand for evolution? We don\u2019t know, because of the cost of the trial becomes higher and higher as the intellectual content becomes more and more sophisticated, the chances that something desirable come out of the trial and errors also decreases, which washes out the gain in speed of the AI, so the time required for reaching breakthrough innovation might not be (fully) compensated by the faster speed of calculation AI can master. And the mere fact that natural selection works based on the \u201cunfit die out\u201d principle, it is hardly optimal for advanced intelligence to evolve. Nevertheless, we leave that as a possibility, whilst, not an optimal one, hence unlikely. Of course, the less than the sunshine side of the message is, (being a mathematician) Turing\u2019s proof is centred around Turing Machine cannot replace Mathematician\u2019s intuition. So at least \u201csome\u201d of us who liked math would be safe. Second, intelligence arguably used to be what we differentiate ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom. However, our intelligence did not lead to a conclusion that we should render all other animals obsolete - on the same token, once AI overtakes us as the \u201cmost intelligent\u201d species, there is no reason why it should render us, and all less intelligent beings obsolete. Third, depending on that \u201cpurpose\u201d humans have, to render all human obsolete, it will require AI to excel in all those areas where human might consider as our purpose - for example, maybe the compassion towards another human being is something AI will never develop, maybe the appreciation of the beauty of the nature is something AI will never develop - think about what is needed for AI to survive, and what is natural logical extension of rationality. Our appreciation of the beauty of nature could be a secret link to ensure we connect our own survival to the environment and the natural resources that support it, and this intuition could be something evolved through millions of years that AI simply does not have sufficient time to observe yet. Fourth, What superintelligence evolve into could be super rationale, and might simply leave us alone - it seems once intelligence raises beyond survival necessity, it inevitably appreciate nature and possibilities. In other words, the more \u201cexcessive\u201d intelligence, the less likely a species use that intelligence to wage wars, or harm anything nature has to offer - this is a good thing. Because most of the cruelty we observed during our history, either was due to survival conflict or more likely due to a lack of rationality, which means super-rational AI will be less violent than us. At least I can say I have not found a rational reason why superintelligent AI will eliminate ants, fish, chickens, rabbits, or apes, and on the same token, if they are way smarter than us, I don\u2019t see a reason to get rid of us.

            "answer_text": "Yes. In fact we are already obsolete, and are being phased out gradually and replaced with next-generation smartwatches. The watches will wear themselves. :)  More seriously, only people can render other people obsolete. And even then, surely a person isn\u2019t obsolete to themselves? So you should really spend some time asking questions like: What does the word \u201cobsolete\u201d mean?Who gets to decide whether someone is obsolete?If artificial systems and robots replace human workers, that will not be because the AI bots decided on this. It will be because humans who seek profit above all else chose to fire human employees to save on wages and insurance costs. So if humans become \u201cobsolete\u201d (whatever that might mean), it will be because of the rise of human greed and selfishness, rather than artificial intelligence. AI is just a tool \u2014 what it does to us depends on what the tool-user chooses to do with it.

If you look at from the side of those who need useful people as workers and who pay salaries, if that is where the meaning of \u2018obsolete\u2019 find its meaning from, then yes. However if common men can establish societies where his usefulness or purpose does not derive from him employability, then it may be possible to think AI and robotics as a way of finding more time to enjoy his time, and utilize machines to produce his basic needs.
