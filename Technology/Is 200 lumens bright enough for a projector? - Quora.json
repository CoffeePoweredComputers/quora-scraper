            "answer_text": "The reality is that it all depends on your ambient light environment, content, and screen size. Back when projectors were first released, they topped out at 150\u2013200 lumens. This meant that you needed a completely darkened environment. We measure projectors today with both lumen and screen size. So lets say you have a screen size of 100\u2033 in 16:9 format. That means you\u2019ll have a screen area of around 360 sq/ft. That will give you basically 360/200 or .5 lumens per square foot. To give you an idea of the luminance of that, its equal to the power of of half a candle at 1 foot. Not ideal. Today\u2019s projectors that are used in any kind of real world application start at 3000 lumens. That gives you 8 lumens per sq ft. That would be a minimum brightness you would want to have with any lights turned on or a screen size 100\u2033 or larger. ",
