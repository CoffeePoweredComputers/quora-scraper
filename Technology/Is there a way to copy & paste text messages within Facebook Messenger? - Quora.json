            "answer_text": "The touch and hold method for selecting text within facebook messages no longer works in mobile. Now when you tap and hold on any bit of text, nothing happens. No text highlights nor movable tabs to select anything. It used to work for many years. However, very recently (within the last month or 2) it was crippled. Quality user experience has never been facebooks strong suit. The only ways that are left to copy text in Messenger (that I know of). Install an app like \u201cUniversal Copy\u201d which allows selecting and copying of text on screen in MOST apps. However, with this method.. you can only copy what's on your screen currently. These apps won't allow scrolling in copy mode. The other way to copy Messenger text, go to the Desktop website of facebook then open messages from there. Copying isn't (yet) hindered there. To get to the desktop website from your mobile - If you're using Chrome or Firefox, open the browser menu and select \u201cRequest Desktop Site\u201d. When the page reloads, it will still show the mobile website, but it will look widened. Go to the address bar and where it says \u201cm.facebook\u201d, change the \u201cm\u201d to a \u201cwww\u201d ..so it shows \u201cwww.facebook\u201d. Leave the rest of it alone. (A User Agent switcher Addon on Firefox will also work to view the desktop site). Hope this was helpful. ",

It will not come in as individual pieces and you can edit it and add to it. I needed to set the format, select all again with Ctrl-A and choose normal and then what I did as a reply to an issue in my thread, I colored their messages in a color my messages in another and the added text as regular black on white. this way i was able to send him in a letter format my replies to their texts. all these answers that say you need a hacker are bunk. yes it took me a while to figure it out but it works!
