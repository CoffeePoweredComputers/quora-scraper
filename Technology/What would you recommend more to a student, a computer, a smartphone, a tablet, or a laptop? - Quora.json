Make sure it has a 5GHz WiFi radio built in. \u201cSupports 802.11ac\u201d is *not* sufficient. Make sure it has USB and/or VGA video output, *not* a \u201cdisplayport\u201d. Make sure it has at least one USB 3.0 or better port. That will allow you to attach all sort of peripherals. Thereafter, get the most CPU, RAM, and HD you can afford. A \u201cdocking station\u201d would be nice, to make it real easy to add a full sized keyboard, mouse, and display when your\u2019re at home. ",

A tablet can be used in conjunction with the cloud. It is good for videoconferencing. A laptop is the usual choice for its versatility. As a (former) physics lecturer, I do not recommend a laptop for taking notes. Until the interface for making diagrams is seamless, it\u2019s not as good as pencil and paper. I am interested in the Surface computers, but I have not given them a test drive. ",

A tablet or phone are inadequate as working tools, and a laptop has the power and screen size to work, as well as having plenty of capability to run software that students will need. Most students will have a cell phone anyway, but they will need a laptop. If they need a second screen, a monitor can be connected to run in dual-screen mode. ",
