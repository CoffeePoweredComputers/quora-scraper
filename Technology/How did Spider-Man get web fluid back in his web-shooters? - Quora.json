            "answer_text": "When Peter invented his famous webshooters, he was very forward thinking. He knew that if he was mid swing, or mid fight and he ran out, he\u2019d need to be able to \u201crefill\u201d quickly. Hell, if he HADNT thought of it before hand, it would have been shortly after his first outing after uncle Ben\u2019s death, if not during one of his promotional appearances in the origin story. A simple google search will give you an example of a decent rendition of what he\u2019s put together.  As you can see\u2026it\u2019s prettyndetailed. The wristband of his shooters carries a multitude of cartridges. Of course his BELT carries more as backup. Segmented similarly. This makes a quick mid swing, or mid fight cartridge change \u201cquick\u201d to say the least. Now, of course in the Sony movies, the first three, his \u201cshooters\u201d are organic. It\u2019s like any other bodily fluid. Refills over time as needed. (Potentially distressing on his body/health). You\u2019d think of the fluid like a full bladder of urine (gross) or sperm ejaculate? It\u2019d be limited\u2026 i can imagine that each cartridge is filled with some sort of eye dropper device tho that\u2019s an assumption. added: I mentioned the belt above, it\u2019s more than just web cartridges\u2026. as an example here.   It also includes space for a \u201csignal\u201d light to throw thugs and villains off their game, and room for his camera (one holds it in the back, the other to the side of the spider-signal/flashlight).
