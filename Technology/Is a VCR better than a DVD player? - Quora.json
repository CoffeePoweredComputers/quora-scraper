            "answer_text": "No. In fact, a VCR is so much worse than a DVD player that I have to conclude that whoever\u2019s asking this has no or very limited experience with VCRs. Let\u2019s consider the ways it\u2019s worse: Quality. Even recording at best quality, a VCR\u2019s resolution and color quality are much, much worse than a DVD\u2019s.Convenience. You have to rewind a VCR tape after watching it. You can\u2019t easily go to a specific scene.Durability. VCRs have a lot more moving parts, making them more prone to breakage. The tapes themselves are also prone to break, and the magnetic coating slowly rubs off over time, making the quality become worse each time you watch a particular tape. The tapes also have internal moving parts that can fail. The magnetic coating rubbing off also means the VCR itself needs periodic cleaning to keep the best picture quality.Storage. VCR tapes are physically bigger than DVDs, even when the DVDs are in their cases. They\u2019re also far more sensitive to heat and moisture. You can leave a DVD in a car on a hot day, even here in Florida where I live, and it\u2019ll be fine. The same is definitely not true of VCR tapes.Capacity. At best quality, a VCR tape can only record about two hours of video. A single DVD can record up to around four hours at full quality. This is very important for people collecting TV shows.Options and content. VCR tapes don\u2019t have additional language options, and don\u2019t usually have closed captions. They don\u2019t have special features, such as director\u2019s commentaries, deleted scenes, alternate versions, and so on.Cost. Mass-produced DVDs are stamped out by a press, making it very cheap to manufacture them in high volumes. VCR tapes have to be recorded. This means it takes much longer to manufacture a single tape than a DVD, which means a factory can make a lot more DVDs each day. Further, as noted above, VCR tapes have internal moving parts that can fail, so there needs to be testing and quality control in place. The upshot was that new VCR tapes never dropped below about $20 in price, and popular movies usually cost about $35. (Adjusted for inflation since 2000, $30 and $53.) Even blank tapes cost about $3 to $5. These days, you can get DVD \u201cfour-film collections\u201d that cost less than the tapes to record the films would have cost in VCR days.For those who like to collect TV shows, the combination of the differences in storage, capacity, and cost made DVD a \u201ckiller app\u201d. On VCR tapes, a 26-episode season of a US one-hour drama took 13 tapes, occupying 13 inches of shelf space\u2026 and costing around $250 or more ($378 in 2020 dollars, with inflation). On DVD, that will fit on seven DVDs, which with collector set cases don\u2019t take more than an inch of shelf space, and which can be profitably sold at $30. The big advantage VCRs had was the ability to record\u2026 but there are DVD recorders, if you really want to record. They\u2019re expensive\u2026 but VCRs were expensive as well. They were around $2000 when first introduced, dropping to around $900 by 1980. The VCR boom lowered prices a lot, putting them in the $200 to $300 range by 1990. Toward the end, they got very cheap\u2026 but that was after DVDs arrived, giving them competition such that they had to drop prices. (And don\u2019t forget inflation adjustments! A VCR costing $200 in 1990 is equivalent to something costing about $400 today.) ",

            "answer_text": "The vcr produced a terrible rendition of 525 line video that WASN\u2019T 525 LINES. But, I recorded more cable movies and newscast with it by setting up three vcrs to get all three network newscasts at the time, and all the movies also. When cable went to digital channels, one couldn\u2019t get a clean channel to record. That wrecked my system. The DVR was never as pliable as the VCR had been earlier. I filled one up that didn\u2019t charge a yearly fee, but eventually abandoned it, without even watching all of it. TIVO is the equivalent of the vcr, but one has to pay for the service, so I don\u2019t have it. A friend paid a lifetime subscription fee to TIVO and dumped his cable for a smaller set of channels he actually wanted from Hulu. Not the part of Hulu that offers Cable and over air TV program streaming, but streaming cable that carries channels he and his wife actually want to watch. I used to own a cable company but won\u2019t sign up for cable or satellite, because only two or three channels on either medium are any good. The DVD player is the best way presently to gather a movie collection. I\u2019ve burned 9,000 dvds and copied hundreds of them from commercial dvds. The real great rare stuff, however, comes from other countries, particularly Europe. The far East is a contributor as well, particularly Japan and China. I get those and often the subtitles separately, from the Internet, from the Pirate Bay, Open Subtitles, Subscene and YIFY, these latter three, subtitle websites to handle the language problems. After you\u2019ve gotten a look at the great films outside the US, you realize the US has essentially been making old movie formulas over and over, for the most part, from the beginning. I\u2019m just finishing up watching a 1984 German miniseries called Heimat, in 11 parts, that is the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen on a screen. It\u2019s about changes in a German village, before the Nazis, during the third Reich era and afterward. Its the most extraordinary film I\u2019ve ever seen. ",
