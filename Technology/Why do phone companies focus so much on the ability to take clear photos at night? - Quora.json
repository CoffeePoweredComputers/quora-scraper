            "answer_text": "The tiny sensors in phone cameras only perform well in good light. So, without clever software tricks, the hardware just would not be capable of capturing usable images in low light without very long exposures, which would usually result in very blurred pictures. So, in night mode, the phones have the ability to take a rapid-fire series of short, dim images and add these together under software control. That simulates a long exposure, but without the blurring. The merging process has to try to stop any moving objects being captured with ghostly multiple-exposures, and also not to blow the highlights. So the multiple exposures won't all be the same length, and won't all be used in the same way. But if all the tricks work, phone cameras can generate merged images that are much better than the individual frames they shot. These multi-frame noise reduction techniques are not new, but phone cameras have both more need for them, and more computational power available, than larger separate cameras (the Sony NEX cameras had such techniques back in 2010, but they weren't used as much as in modern phones).

            "answer_text": "Because people want to take clear pictures not just in the day! In low light situations, celebrations, parties, church weddings, those are occasions to celebrate and people want to make memories. The phone camera is the best tool for the casual snapper and getting good quality pics in dim lighting is the what the phone manufacturers chase because DSLRs have been able to do that for more than 15 years. Yes, any decent 15 year old DSLR can arguably snap better lowlight pics than any phone camera at the moment because of the sensor size difference. ",
