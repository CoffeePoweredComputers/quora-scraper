            "answer_text": "As far as I know, you would need a high speed & high capacity microSD card to run your GoPro at a smooth speed. Not every memory card will work well with your GoPro camera. For example, if your card is slow or having low storage then you will end up recording error or end up half-track. Usually, GoPro comes with a 4K resolution video. When you film at 4k or 1080p video settings, the camera uses 256 codec and writes video files 12mb/s. That requires a fast microSD card known as UHS-1 V30 or U3. Class 10 or below will not be able to work at that speed. You can see the chart if confuse:  GoPro on their own tested some memory cards and listed some. These memory cards are fast(V30 category), reliable and cost-effective. Some are listed below. SanDisk Extreme UHS-I 160MB/s.Samsung EVO Select 100MB/s.Lexar Professional 1000X.Samsung Pro Plus UHS-I.SanDisk Extreme PRO UHS-I.The list goes on. My recommend will not go with a specific brand rather I would like to advise you to choose as you wish for your camera. If you are confused then try by comparing it to each other. Or you can watch this video to get a brighter idea about this topic. Thanks.  ",

            "answer_text": "As far as brands go, I can\u2019t give you a specific name, and anyway, any answer I did give would be out of date very quickly. But to answer your question, \u201cWhat are the best SD cards for a GoPro?\u201d, my answer is, the fastest you can find. But you also want a brand that is known for robustness (given it\u2019s going to get quite a battering in a GoPro, this should be common sense). Why fast, and not just robust? You\u2019ll want an SD card that won\u2019t become a bottleneck for the GoPro; there are expensive professional ones meant specifically for Digital Cameras (like the DLSR and other types). If you can afford them, though expensive, it will be worth the money, because of the reliability. I can give you some article leads, and I hope these help: https://gopro.com/help/articles/Block/microSD-Card-Considerations(a bit out of date): Which SD Memory Card For My GoPro? - UnsponsoredThe best microSD cards for your phone, GoPro, or Nintendo SwitchThe Best microSD CardsI hope that helps.
