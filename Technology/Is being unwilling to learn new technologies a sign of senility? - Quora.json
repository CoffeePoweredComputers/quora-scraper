            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a difference between unwilling and unable. I would suggest that an unwillingness to learn new technologies is not in any way a sign of senility. Ever had a \u201chot new\u201d device/gadget/app that you refused to use? If you\u2019re unwilling to use it\u2014or to learn how to use it\u2014then you\u2019re simply not interested. Your conscious decision not to learn the new technology doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re somehow less capable than others who choose to embrace it. Ever had something you felt you were unable to learn? Perhaps something you tried to learn but discovered that it didn\u2019t come so easily? In such cases, you must eventually decide whether or not the activity is worth your continued time and effort. If you\u2019re truly unable to learn something, then it could be a sign of various physical or mental limitations, only one of which is senility. However, there are also so many people who say things like, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t do math,\u201d as they dismiss a numerical question that could be answered with mathematical skills. Is it true that they can\u2019t do it, or are they simply uninterested in making the investment necessary to learn how? The science of neuroplasticity has shown us that lifelong learning is possible for everyone, including the oldest among us. I cringe when a TV show portrays an older adult with a cell phone as a bumbling idiot, or when a grandchild mocks grandma\u2019s attempt to send a personal text using emojis, or when a 30-something-year-old hiring manager presupposes that a 60-something-year-old applicant is \u201ctoo old\u201d to master the technology requirements of a job. In looking for a way to identify signs of senility, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily point to the older adult\u2019s adoption of or interest in new technology. A better gauge might involve comparing cognitive performance in tasks the person has always done\u2014then and now\u2014to find out whether aging has led to diminished capacity in things familiar to the individual.

            "answer_text": "Not in my experience. The problem with new technologies for those of us who can function without them, is that they are usually really expensive. My parents would never have paid several hundred if not thousands of dollars for a phone ever. I don\u2019t intend to either. I am currently using a cellphone I purchased in 2004, I have had other cellphones in the interim, but they have broken or not made properly to begin with. My old cellphone will be going obsolete soon and I will be without one, I just don\u2019t care. No senility involved. Ditto for laptops and computers. I am sick of doling out money for technology that is going to be obsolete in a year or less. Of course a person could be suffering from senility and also be uninterested in new technologies. It just isn\u2019t necessarily true. ",
