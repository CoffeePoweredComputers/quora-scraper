            "answer_text": "First color TVs were actually sold already in 1950. They were based on a mechanical system which was incompatible to black and white systems. It was not popular with some 200 sets sold. Then the government banned the manufacturer of color-TVs because of the Korean war. It was so seen that the color TV ha to be all electronic and compatible with black and white TVs so in 1953 the NTSC system was created. It was two way compatible: color TVs could show black and white programs and black and white programs could show color programs though of course without color. This was not an easy task nor was it perfect. Back and white TVs could show some artifacts on color programs. On new black and white sets that could be avoided. It should be noted that everyone did not rush to buy new color-TVs. Everyone did not even have a black and white TV. It was in the early 70s when color TVs outsold black and white ones In Europe things were slightly slower. This also allowed improving the system to fix some problems of the NTSC. Most of the Europe adopted PAL. France and Eastern Europe adopted SECAM*. In Finland color TVs were introduced in 1969. By 1976 69% of sets sold were color (I do not have any earlier data). According to TV licenses in 1980 half of TV households had a color TV. (Though it could be more as some cheated by paying only the cheaper B/W license). * Soviets probably wanted to make following Western programs harder with SECAM. I think they also used AM sound for that purpose. So while US was some 15 years ahead in the start, the adoption speed in Europe was much faster - likely because the sets were at reasonable prices. Interestingly the nominal price of a color TV was rather stable 3000 marks (500 \u20ac) from 1969 to 1999. Of course inflation adjusted it dropped and wages increased even more. Here is the median price of a color TV in Finland in 1976\u20132018:  The bottom line is the nominal price, the middle one is adjusted to inflation and the green line adjusted to wages. That was still in the early 80s color TV was more than a typical monthly net wage and in 1976 maybe twice that. You can see two bumps on the curve. 2006 people started to buy flat panels. It also coincided with the digital switchover (September 2007). In the early 90s there was a severe depression. It might first be strange why people would buy more expensive sets during depression. They did not. Those who bought cheaper ones did not buy at all. According to the starts last black and white TVs were sold in 1989. This is not strictly true. I bought a 5.5\u2033 black and white TV as a secondary set in 1997 or so. Also those are average prices. Now you can get a 32\u2033 TV for 150 \u20ac. In 2005 one could get a 21\u2033 for 170 \u20ac. In 2001 a 14\u2033 was 170 \u20ac. Now people buy sets that are well above the bottom price. In the 80s or 70s that was not the case. ",

            "answer_text": "The NTSC color standard was adopted by the FCC in 1953, and color televisions were on the market fairly soon afterwards. Early sets, though, were quite expensive and so the initial adoption of color television was slow. As set prices dropped and quality improved through the 1960s and 1970s, color televisions became the dominant type in the market. There\u2019s a little-known (today, at least) bit of history here, though, in that the 1953 NTSC standard was actually the second color TV system approved by the FCC. The first was proposed by CBS and adopted in 1951, but was a field-sequential system that wasn\u2019t compatible with the existing black and white standard. What became the 1953 spec was developed by RCA, and was a fully-electronic \u201ccompatible color\u201d system that could be received by existing black-and-white sets, delivering what appeared to be a normal black-and-white program. Because the CBS system was not compatible with the existing standard, it just never caught on, and was formally abandoned by CBS in 1953 to clear the way for the adoption of the RCA spec as the new NTSC standard.
