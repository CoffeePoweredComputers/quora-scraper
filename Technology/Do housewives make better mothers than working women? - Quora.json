            "answer_text": "I think you would really need to begin by defining what makes one mother better than another. A working mother can often afford more clothing, better schools, more lessons if a child shows an interest in something not taught in schools, more trips to places far from home. But she\u2019s usually less available to the children. On the other hand, many working women are single mothers or divorced mothers. Both of these have some negative consequences for children. By definition, a housewife has a spouse who can provide some benefits \u2014 or in some cases, more threat to the children, especially if it\u2019s not the children\u2019s own father. On yet another hand, many working women have a husband or wife who is home with the kids when she\u2019s not. Again, a very different set of opportunities for the child, but probably fewer of the ones that require money. A mother who is unhappy working or unhappy doing housework is likely to be a worse mother than one who is thriving. A mother at home who homeschools her children provides them with some advantages at the expense of other advantages. A mother who can take her children to work provides them with some advantages at the expense of other advantages. A mother who abuses her children is certainly a better mother for being away from them as many hours a week as possible. And a mother who leaves her children with an abusive caretaker or spouse to go to work is certainly a worse mother for being away. And then there is the child and their individual need for stimulation and physical care, the interests and talents they are born with, and their primary love language (working mom can bring home more gifts and may text more words of affirmation than an at-home mom normally says in person, while at-home mom can provide more quality time, acts of service, and physical touch). I think the categories are way too broad and the desired outcomes way too diffuse to draw any conclusion about the two options. But there\u2019s one category of mothers that I\u2019m pretty sure are better than others, and that\u2019s mothers who actively love their children\u2019s other parent as well as their children. Thanks for asking the question. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think this is an answerable question. First, saying a stay-at-home-mom (SAHM) isn't a working women is simply disingenuous. Any good mom who is home with children is likely working her butt off. Not all of that work is directly related to the child but much of it is, and less of it is playing or cuddling than you'd think. There's a lot of cleaning and meal prep and driving and more, and that's assuming it's a child who's already weaned and potty-trained. Pile on a lot more work if the child still an infant or young toddler. Second, there are many degrees of working moms (WOHM/WAHM). There are women who work during school hours so they're home when their kids are home. There are women who work online from home. There are women who split shifts with their partners so there's always a parent home. There are women who work a more traditional schedule. I could keep going. Finally, neither of these groups is a monolith. There are excellent WOHM/WAHM and terrible ones, and every level in between. There are excellent SAHM and there are terrible ones, and every level in between. Most of us, though, no matter whether we are one or the other or a combination of the two, have some times when we're excellent at meeting our child's needs and also times when we're not as good. Moms are human but overall, most of us just want to make the best choices we can for our kids given the circumstances under which we live. ",

            "answer_text": "Mothers are Mothers, whether house wives or working. Their biological relationship or emotional quotient do not change in either case. It is a myth that a house wife has lesser challenging responsibilities compared to a working mother. There fore a housewife is not more or a working woman is not less liable for her child. A woman choses a vocation and it need not change for any person, reason or situation. All these come and go but only she remains with herself. She remains with herself come what may, so it is her prime responsibility to keep herself happy. That is possible only when she follows her vocation and passion. She does not have to sacrifice anything unwillingly to prove her care and love. A mother is capable of handling multiplicity of chores but it should not be a burden. She needs to take care of herself so that she can take care of the rest. Children these days understand and their mindset is moulded to deal with spending limited but quality time with parents. They themselves are busy and have to prepare continuously to compete in their world. So, I would like to repeat Mothers are Mothers. Whether they are working or house wives, their affection and nuturing never differ. They put their heart, mind and soul in whatever they do and wherever they are. Moreover, we are no one to judge anyone. Each one of us is fighting our own battle, mothers are no different. They are also human. ",
