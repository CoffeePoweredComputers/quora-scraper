            "answer_text": "There are a ton of benefits to exercising outdoors, at least for cardio. Running outdoors targets your core muscles much more due to the uneven terrain. The differences in ground firmness also can help to increase your bone density. Hiking in large, green areas has been shown to improve mood and reduce stress levels, which should also help to keep you motivated when exercising. Anecdotally, I find it much easier to motivate myself to run when I\u2019m going somewhere (i.e. around a park) instead of just running in place on a treadmill. ",
