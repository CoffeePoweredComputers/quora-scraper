            "answer_text": "Most of early Enterprise fits the following format: T\u2019Pol: Captain, in order to achieve your goals and maintain your ethics, you must do the thing. Archer: See here, you Vulcan killjoy, we are humans and we do things our way, whether you like it or not. The thing violates our ethical principles and common sense; there is no way we will do the thing. *shenanigans, during which the humans\u2019 ideas flop horribly* Archer, resolute: For the benefit of the galaxy and the betterment of ourselves, I have resolved to do the thing. *heroic soundtrack plays* T\u2019Pol: *glares* Enterprise strikes me as mostly a missed opportunity. Star Trek: Enterprise / What Could Have Been - TV Tropes The initial proposal was for the show to start off by covering the Warp 5 engine project as essentially similar to the Mercury program\u2014this intense and highly risky exploration of many frontiers in science by very brave and talented people who only half know what they\u2019re doing, and who have to justify enormous investments in untested technologies to a socially and politically divided public. Only instead of trying to catch up to/surpass the Soviets, we\u2019d be trying to get out from under the thumb of the Vulcans. That\u2019s why the show was initially just called \u201cEnterprise\u201d instead of \u201cStar Trek: Enterprise.\u201d It was about this daring idea and endeavor to build a new, idealistic future, instead of just people leaning in chairs to pretend they\u2019re getting shot at and people in jumpsuits and prosthetics running around empty rock quarries. Archer would have dealt more with his father and allegations of nepotism, there would have been a lot more character drama, and the themes would have been very directly relevant to a nation that was letting its space program wither on the vine and was unsure of what to do with its strange and evolving self at the turn of the millennium as signs showed that we might not have reached the end of history after all. All these plotlines got thrown together in one early episode and they went very quickly into the Trek formula of traveling to a new planet that looks suspiciously like a California quarry, dealing with the locals\u2019 issues, summing up with a pithy monologue on the bridge, then flying away to the next planet without stakes or consequences. They tended to resort to time travel a lot as a plot filler, and unlike the handful of really good Trek time travel plots like City on the Edge of Forever and O\u2019Brian\u2019s episodes dealing with him losing his child and his time in prison, the stakes weren\u2019t personal and therefore weren\u2019t particularly compelling. They also responded to 9/11 in a really weird and weak way, through their Suliban and Romulan plotlines. They were hardly alone in this, or the worst perpetrators\u2014Friends, the sitcom that tried to show New York to the world, never discussed it at all, and just silently dropped the Two Towers from their credits sequence \u2014but as part of a franchise with such a strong legacy of social commentary and a tradition of reflecting and inspiring the best in humanity, you expect better. This could have been a more principled examination of the many sides of pacifism and terrorism (which DS9 did super well in the 90s), or a closer look at the hard realities of waging war, conducting occupations, and their effects on all parties involved (which, again, DS9 did pretty damn good). At the time, I really thought Enterprise was garbage, but it\u2019s aged better than I thought it would, and personally find it much more watchable than Voyager, my least favorite of the modern series. Carbon Creek, the episode where three Vulcans land in 20th century Appalachian Pennsylvania and one goes native, is one of my favorite Trek episodes, and is deeply touching. The bottle episode with Travis and Malcolm stuck in the shuttlepod and waiting to die was also good\u2014they did character drama well. But I find Discovery way more interesting. I think this is the first look at an actual Federation of species and genuinely alien peoples, instead of an almost entirely human cast dealing with \u201caliens\u201d who are basically humans with a single trait emphasized\u2014-anger, treachery, logic, whatever\u2014but whose psychology and sociology remain highly flat and static, and who have functionally no agency or depth, just weird blue whiskey or edible worms or something. By contrast, Discovery\u2019s depiction of the Klingons, Kelpians, and Vulcans (and their very recognizable issues) has been quite interesting, and they seem to also have some interesting things to say about AI. Most impressively, they have managed to keep this TNG-style sociological focus while maintaining the most compelling interpersonal drama and conflict ever shown on a Trek show, save perhaps DS9. It\u2019s not flawless. I find Michael a compelling protagonist with some interesting issues and good strength of character without being bland. But there are a lot of people who can\u2019t get behind her, some because she\u2019s a black woman and they\u2019re idiots, but many for lore reasons (Spock\u2019s never-before-mentioned sister?) or just because they can\u2019t get into her head. Because the show is told almost entirely from her perspective, I can respect people who find that annoying and feel that it\u2019s difficult to adapt since Trek is traditionally such an ensemble experience. However, I think it\u2019s good that the writers are bold enough to try something new rather than just recycling formulas to make \u201cMillennial TNG\u201d, a problem that Enterprise and Voyager both fell into. The serial nature of the show is also weird for Trek and hard to get used to, and makes it difficult to have the languid pacing and extensive characterization of non-lead characters we used to get through poker games and people pretending to be Dick Tracy and going to fucking oboe recitals and whatever. Discovery\u2019s creators are very visually ambitious, are working under greater time restrictions than any previous Trek series, and try to pack in a lot of storytelling by showing rather than telling, and sometimes I wish they\u2019d try to justify some of their more dramatic changes\u2014explaining more clearly that the Klingon ships all look weird because they have a tribally divided shipbuilding system, for example\u2014but these are pretty minor issues in storytelling terms, and are made up for by several things: Tilly is delightful and is precisely what a fresh ensign on an elite Federation science vessel should be likeSassy gay banter, which Trek has been sadly short of since DS9 went off the airLorca is the best Star Trek villain since classic Khan, no contestYOU HAVEN\u2019T SEEN THE LAST OF HARCOURT FENTON MUDDMichelle Yeoh and the upcoming Section 31 series she roundhouse-kicked into existence KNEEL BEFORE YOUR EMPEROR ",

            "answer_text": "Now this is easy. ST Enterprise was cut in its prime. It was a great show with a proper mission to start with that became more complex. The show was darker and more adult like than previous Trek series but it dispensed with the frustrating Federation niceties in order to allow the team to complete the original mission which was to save the earth from being destroyed by an imminent threat of being wiped out by the Xindi. The first series took getting used to but that\u2019s normal with most shows as we get to know the crew and it was well cast and directed by Roxanne Dawson of ST Voyager fame. In the second season characters were well established and we had relations build between crew members and the plots were very exciting with cliff hanger episodes. Yes there was time travel as a lot of the mystic was about the temporal Cold War which is why the Xindi wanted to destroy the earth so as to destroy the Federation early on before the Federation could become a powerful adversary in the future. The show was also a prequel to ST The Original and felt like one from the onset with the ship starting out without photon torpedoes and being outclassed until receiving technological upgrades. It didn\u2019t even have shields or tractor beam. ST Discovery was meant to be another prequel but in no way did it feel like it. The Discovery was out there and used some crazy spore drive that allowed the vessel to travel much faster than usual warp speeds. The show wasted a lot of time on boring plot lines with reinvented Klingon lore and excessive Klingon ritual scenes we really didn\u2019t need and nor was it interesting\u2026fast forward please. There were unrealistic relations between characters and what I particularly loathed was Captain Lorca turning into the bad guy after building a rapport with the crew and audience alike as a heroic figure. Burnum\u2019s character was brilliant and done so well by Sonequa Martin Green but Michelle Yeoh was atrocious with her wooden acting, I really couldn\u2019t wait for to be spaced or vaporised. There were some good aspects like visual effects and sets but the story writing was all over the place and disregarded established lore and reinvented Klingons. In season two we saw the silly time travel suit operated by Burnam\u2019s mum. It just got silly! ST Enterprise was best. In Australia it was broadcast on the Nine Network and at a very late time slot well after working folks would be awake at 11 pm. I tried to stay up and the network would notoriously reschedule it due to any reason whatsoever usually with it airing much later. It was near I possible to record. Many Trek fans were infuriated by how the viewers were treated by constant viewing rescheduling, at a time before streaming services in our country were normal. ",
