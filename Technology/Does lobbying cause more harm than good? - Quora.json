            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re referring to political lobbying, and not like lobbying for something outside of politics, there are two kinds and you can easily distinguish between them. First is lobbying for the common cause or helping others, these could be like environment groups lobbying for clean air - obviously something that everyone benefits from, or child protection services lobbying for better services for children in foster care, clearly a noble cause to help those with unequal chances in life. Second is lobbying for private interests. Lobbying for private interest is a type of corruption, since politicians are elected to serve the public interest, not private interests. If the lobbying does not have any results it\u2019s only attempted corruption. This type of lobbying activity also creates the context for bribes. Despite politicians denying it, and even pretending bribes, like paid vacations are normal, it\u2019s actually criminal activity. Still a lot of this criminal activity is somehow under the radar, because law enforcement can never prove the connection, but when a politician gets paid a million dollars to give a speech to a certain interest group, it\u2019s only reasonable to assume they will represent that group, or at least they will not do anything that would go against their interests, since this group has essentially purchased protection from that politician. (No way their hour long speech was worth a million dollars). Both Democrats and Republicans in the USA openly engage in this type of corruption to line their pockets. This was a reason a lot of people hated the Clintons. ",

            "answer_text": "Others have answered the question directly, so I\u2019ll just point out that lobbying is only worth doing when government has the power to manipulate the economy, to pick winners and losers. That is, when government can pass laws and regulations that favor your company and hobble or destroy your competition, then you must lobby using every trick you can think of, or you will be the one destroyed. Clearly, government should not have such power. Government\u2019s only legitimate function is to protect us from those who would cause us harm, and never itself cause harm. What we desparetly need is a complete separation of state and economy. Lobbyists would then become powerless and seek honest professions instead. The irrefutable philosophic argument is that government must respect and protect inalienable rights from violation, and never itself violate them. A government that violates rights, becomes illegitimate. To quote Jefferson \u201cThat whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.\u201d More detail in this short video. #5 Inalienable Rights and Government  ",
