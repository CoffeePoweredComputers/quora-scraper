            "answer_text": "Photographic film is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals. Now when this film is loaded inside the camera there is a contact between the camera mirror and the film. Once we press the shutter button the shutter raises up and the scene that we shot gets reflected on the light sensitive film base. When the light comes in contact with the film there happens a chemical reaction which converts the simple film into negatives. A very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph by using developer and many other items. ",
