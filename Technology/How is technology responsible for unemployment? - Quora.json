            "answer_text": "How is technology responsible for unemployment? Change can eliminate or create jobs. If skills are no longer needed (there is little need for the skills of a wet nurse in the U.S.) then people with only those skills will not be employed. Fortunately, everyone has multiple skills. Technology itself does not cause unemployment but technological change can. The history of the last 250 years is that changes in technology cause loss of some jobs and creation of an even greater number of jobs - short term increase in unemployment and long-term increase in employment. People are unemployed because: 1. They choose not to work (e.g. retired or taking an extended vacation) 2. They are between jobs, having resigned or been laid off (this is only temporary) 3. They are prevented by law from working because they are too young, too old, the wrong race or sex, or because they are prevented from accepting pay appropriate to their skills or desires I suppose there are other reasons but that pretty much covers it. Government unemployment is determined by government\u2019s criteria for defining someone as unemployed. Many people who are not employed (such as me) are not designated by government as \u201cunemployed\u201d. In that sense unemployment is caused by government criteria, nothing else. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology? Responsible? Is that argument still going on? People are responsible for employment and unemployment issues. Of course, some of them will deflect responsibility from themselves, if they\u2019re management, or their superiors, if they\u2019re speaking for management, by blaming tech or whatever. But ultimately, replacing people with machinery, no matter how advanced the machinery (certainly given the present state-of-the-art in automation and AI), is a decision made by a person or persons. If the result is unemployment or some other deletorious circumstance, then the person(s) making the decision should be responsible for that; sometimes they are and sometimes they aren\u2019t. The \u201chow\u201d of the matter is kind of old hat. It\u2019s just a matter of economics and finance; someone thinks they\u2019ll get a bigger cut of the pie or their company or shareholders will get a bigger cut of the pie by automating some process or every process or making some other substitution of tech for people. For instance, you might be able to do a cost/benefit analysis that shows the return on investment will be greater with automation than human beings, or that tech will reduce errors and increase quality at a lower cost than running a fully capable quality system with people in the loop, etc. It\u2019s simply a matter of having an eye on the quarterly statement or the annual report numbers to the exclusion of everything else.
