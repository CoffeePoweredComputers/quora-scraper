            "answer_text": "Roughly 850 grams. The carbon emission factor for coal-combustion generated heat is 0.330 kgCO2/kWh[1], based on the net calorific value (latent heat from combustion vapour is condensed and heat extracted). THEN, there are the efficiency losses for the generation of the electricity. Modern coal-fired power stations are about 40% efficient (efficiency of converting the heat to power). Then there are some transmission losses before it gets to your home/workplace. So the carbon emission factor for the electricity generation at the point of use is more like 0.850 kgCO2/kWh.
