            "answer_text": "It will not be a serious competition feature or spec wise. There will be few people buying it for the form factor and half of them might buy a Bollinger instead. You'll be looking at 200-250 miles range with these or a double battery size to compensate and at least +$50k to the price for that. It will be missing all the features available on a Tesla screen and self driving (short term \u2014 driving assist) features. ",
