            "answer_text": "Future technology will probably bring more and more long distant relationships into life. But I doubt that it'd actually enhance those relationships. (Enhance - intensify, increase, or further improve the quality, value, or extent of. ) The thing with indirect communication is, you don't feel their expressions as you would in reality. No matter how good the video quality is, no matter how fast your internet connection is, it still won't be enough for you to feel them as if you were right next to them. Have you ever got into a fight/disagreement with your partner via text messages? Wasn't it easier to solve it via a phone call? Didn't it effortlessly got solved when you were actually with them? Humans have five senses, and all those five needs to be stimulated in the right way for a relationship to work. And I'm afraid technology is not there yet. In other terms, quantity of long distant relationships goes up, quality will fail to go up. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. Future tech might end up reducing long distance relationships as tech is focusing on helping find people nearby who might be interested in a romantic relation. Some 18+ tech are in development and available for purchase which help with the lack of intimacy. Long distance relationships have a high failure rate and considered abnormal by most societies hence inventors might not find any lucrative opportunities economically. Married people living far away due to work or some other unavoidable reasons heavily rely on voice calls, video calls, social media etc. Future tech would enhance such communication mediums but I don\u2019t see anything ground breaking happening any time soon.
