            "answer_text": "I think teenagers talk about science too much. I actually have quite an entertaining story of when my friends starting speaking science at the weirdest time. When I was in my first year of college, my friends and I would go to gatherings and parties on weekends if we had no work. At these gatherings, lots of my friends would get piss drunk. We would have lots of fun, and then when the party started to die, we would head home. One night, we got back to our dorm and none of us were feeling sleepy. One of my friends had to pee really badly and this sparked an idea in my head: how fast does pee come out? We were all studying engineers, so we whipped out our calculators and started doing the work. \u201cWell the horizontal distance the pee-rabola travels is x, and it has a height of y when at this trajectory\u2026\u201d \u201cWhen we factor in gravity, the final velocity, as dictated by this kinematics equation, must be this, given that initial velocity is z\u2026\u201d And Bam! A couple teens randomly spoke about physics at the weirdest time! ",

            "answer_text": "Grouping all teenagers together makes this question a bit ambiguous and impossible to answers\u2014 it just depends who you ask. If you ask me, a 19 year old Indo-Guyanese American female whom is majoring in biology with a concentration in the biomedical sciences\u2014 yes\u2026 I do talk about science. However, if you ask my friend whom majors in business, same age as me and grew up in the same town, they couldn\u2019t tell you the atomic number of hydrogen. If you were looking for more of a specific answer for a specific population, rephrase the question. Not all teenagers are petty and uneducated. ",

I like to post generalised questions and then dig more deep into the details after I get some answers. No slight on you guys. Maybe I could work the other way around questions-wise? Like: do university students studying legal topics like to converse about legal topics in their down time? ",
