            "answer_text": "At least for me, it has not. I still see friends irl every week, including a close friend who I\u2019ve been friends with since 2005. We still have decent, genuine conversations despite smartphones. Most of my other friends do not have social media or rarely use it so we end up having no choice but to meet irl. Plus, I still have the advantage of interacting with neighbors because we have barbecues frequently. I have noticed it can affect genuine human interaction in others, however. Some people would definitely just rather sit behind a screen and communicate with other people, which leads to loneliness inevitably because they are talking to people who are not going to help get rid of their loneliness, which is epidemic possibly due to technology use. However, people say that technology is the main driver of loneliness when in all reality we have been lonely for centuries (people even said television use caused loneliness in the 90s also, it seems this is an ever popular trend with every new technological advancement we have) so I think its the fact that lonelier people tend to use social media more. This does have an effect on their social skills in person as they are not practicing them effectively in the real world. In all fairness however, we may end up finding out that this technology and the fears that came along with it were the same as the fears we had as far back as the printing press, which people said ruined social interaction as well, but it never technically did.

            "answer_text": "Undoubtedly. Kids these days prefer playing on gadgets rather than playing outdoor. A friend sitting in the neighbourhood needs to be contacted via phone. The urge to meet an old friend can be relieved with the help of skype and other video calling apps. The whereabouts and well being of near and dear ones is easily available through social networking site. Even in social gathering, a bunch of people sitting together and everyone would be busy with their phones. Booking a movie ticket, plane ticket, buying grocery, clothes and various other items, paying bills and many other facilities is just a click away then why we will make an effort to stand up and and feel the touch of human relations. Sadly but its true, even if modern technology has put our lives to ease, it has taken us away from the feeling of interacting and meeting new people. ",

            "answer_text": "There will always be pros and cons of every part. As technology changing the ways of life living, it reduces the long-distance connection and instant reply to any person, but we have to ask a question our self this ease can affect our face to face interaction with people which is most important of our lives. Nothing beats the face to face meeting as means of building rapport and strengthening the relationship in the workplace. Whether it\u2019s a coffee meet up with colleges to discuss a new term strategy or lunch with clients, the connection built with simple human interaction could be more valuable a dozen emails. We need to find a right balance between \u2018Tech\u2019 and \u2018Touch\u2019 in the workplace by adopting technologies which allow the business to become more efficient and deliver a better product.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion it is. i have spoken before about these kind of things, and i definitely think it plays a large part. Everywhere you go, you see people glued to their cell-phones, i-pods, i-pads, tablets in the street, on the buses,and, on the train, laptops, etc. I appreciate a lot of people take their work home with them, and do some on the train going into work,or on the way home, but, it gets to the stage that people only communicate by email, and text. younger people ,particularly. I have had younger relatives visiting, and you can barely have a conversation, as they are busy, fiddling around with their phones. Its becoming a world of androids! i don\u2019t like to think what life will be like in the future. we are becoming a very isolated society. Years ago, there were communities, in which we had relatives nearby. People didn\u2019t move around so much then, and there was always someone on hand . but then people started moving around, and that had a lot to do with breakdown in relationdhips. Everything seems so fractured today. but i certainly would agree that modern tech. plats a big part. ",

What ever we are utilising the tech it should be in the helathy way and there should be boundaries. If we start using it beyond the boundaries it start effecting in our lives. For example now days youth getting addict to the smart phones apart from that we can use those gadgets in healthy way till it should not effect our life. I can tell this it's not running our lives till when we start it Mis using the things. We should be cautious and aware of terms and conditions while we are going to start. ",
