Non-payment of the account billsphone was reported stolen to the carrierPhone was reported stolen to a carrier and Asurion (US phone insurance company), then request a replacement through insurance, when in fact it wasn\u2019t stolen and now the phone you purchased/inherited is blacklisted.IF the phone account is past due and can be paid, the phone will work again, just tell the original owners to pay it. IF it was past due and went to collections, the phone will continue being blacklisted until the collection account is paid up. IF the phone was used in an insurance scam, this phone will never work again on a cellular network, unless it\u2019s somehow jail broken and used on an overseas carrier. ",

Carriers do not normally use whitelisting or blacklisting as such. They either have the SIM assigned a phone number and enabled, or not. To get a blocked phone working, replace the SIM card with an enabled one, that may have the same number as the one that disabled. When a number is ported from one network to another or moved to a new SIM on the same network, the old SIM card will be blocked. ",

If you bought a blacklisted phone you can try to return it if you bought it on eBay or Amazon. Something pretty difficult is that you can hire someone to switch out the chip that contains IMEI information with a good one. (This would probably be pretty expensive and rightfully so.) You could just sell it for parts on eBay, phone repair guys like to use locked/blacklisted phone parts to fix broken unlocked phones. ",
