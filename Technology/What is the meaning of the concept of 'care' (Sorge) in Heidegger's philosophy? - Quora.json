            "answer_text": "Thanks for the follow-up request. Sorge is another complex Heideggerian concept to deal with, but much less tenacious than Dasein or Division 3. As I have sub-commented in my previous answer regarding Dasein, the translation of Sorge as \u201ccare\u201d is quite problematic as it doesn\u2019t cover the full sense of what Heidegger was trying to imply. Most significant philosophers whom have published notable volume(s) of lasting works often employ an underlying concept as the driving force of their philosophy. For instance, for the case of Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology, it was the Desire of consciousness to realise itself and the world it is in. For Nietzsche, it is none other the (in)famous will to power. For Sartre\u2019s Being and Nothingness, it was Otherness that drives the individual to take decisions upon itself and the world. As you might have guessed, for Heidegger\u2019s Being and Time, it is Sorge. The best explanation that I can provide for Sorge is from the text itself. Sorge is a fundamental tendency for Dasein to orient itself towards the world of things that surrounds it. Putting it simply, it refers to a kind of innate concern with the states of affairs that it is thrown into, but without the sentimentality as implied of the word. While Sorge is later explained to be grounded within temporality, I think it would suffice to look at Division One for a substantial explanation of what it means.  The introduction of care structure comes after an exposition of Being-with (Mitsein). Having established that Dasein is thrown into the world, in which it is surrounded by other things, and that Dasein is fundamentally engaged with them, Heidegger turns to what allows this engagement to be possible. Being-in-the-world is characterised by three components: thrownness, projection, and fallenness. In Dasein, this combination manifests as disposedness, understanding, and fascinated-with-the-world respectively. This two pairs together form the care structure, which said to be Dasein\u2019s structural ontological whole. I will now try to explain each factor individually. Thrownness is basically the most comprehensible notion \u2014 that we are \u201cthrown\u201d into the world, in which I am concerned in the things with it, without any prior causal explanation for my being-here. While we can find deterministic explanations as to our arrival into the world, we can never answer the question of \u201cWhy do I have to exist at this place, at this time?\u201d. Our inability to know things like these basically turn them into something akin to brute facts (but not quite so for Heidegger). Disposedness is better understood as something like a disposition towards things around us. It corresponds to Thrownness, and can be seen as Dasein\u2019s attempt to find something that it can be concerned about. To explain this, Heidegger introduces the notion of mood, which is not just a subjective, sentimental response to things, but aspects of what it means to be in the world. When we are in a certain mood, things appear differently as they were in another mood. For instance, if I am depressed from a fallout with my friend, I become more apprehensive about my aspects of passing an interview. It also necessarily follows from this that Dasein is essentially social and culturally influenced. In dealing with the things in the world, Dasein projects possibilities of the actions it can take, thus projection. Some possibilities will be actualised, and others will not (thus Dasein contains within itself not-being, which became obsession in What is Metaphysics?). The possibilities that Dasein can take is also limited by thrownness, hence Dasein finds itself as a balance between what it can choose, and what it was given with. Understanding is how Dasein interprets itself in face of the possibilities that it projected for itself. In that sense, there is parallel relation given here, as given by projection and thrownness \u2014 what Dasein interprets of its possibilities is given by its disposedness, as we have seen in the previous example for mood. What I am concerned about, and how so, affects the way Dasein sees its possibilities. However, understanding is not only affected by mood, but also by the very cultural and social influence that constitute thrownness. We now come to the third aspect of the care structure, fallenness. This aspect is more complication, and for Heidegger, it bears quite a heavy significance, especially in the second division, in the discussion of Death and Anxiety. Being thrown and having fallen are two different matters \u2014 the former implies some sort of ontological condition that we accept, while the later implies some sort of agency. Dasein has a tendency to choose fallenness, through the activity of idle talk. Idle talk is, as the term suggests quite literally, talking for the sake of talking about things \u2014 it fails to examine carefully what it is saying. There are two other ways in which fallenness manifests: curiosity and ambiguity. Curiosity is the relentless seeking of novelty that ultimately leads Dasein astray from his belongings, while ambiguity is the failure to differentiate between genuine knowledge and idle talk. Taken into Dasein, all these factors lead to a fascination of the world. Heidegger suggests that this fascination is something characteristic of Being-with, and in its everyday mode, this produces a kind of averageness, or more familiarly as the they. To reiterate, this tendency to become lost in the they is innate. As much as we like to individuate ourselves from the \u201ccrowd\u201d, we still tend to do things that are agreeable with the crowd, and find all the above aspects tantalising at some point. Here, Heidegger introduces authenticity as the possibility of breaking out from this they, which will be further explored in the first half of his second division.  In Division Two, Heidegger continues his exposition on authenticity and anticipatory resoluteness. After which, he continues discussing explicitly about temporality, as I have crudely summarized in my previous post. In the discussion about Being-towards-death, Heidegger sees death at the ever-present possibility of our impossibility. It is an inevitable outcome of Dasein being human, and its own death is essentially unique to itself. In relation to death, the care structure once again evolves, and is split into two types of structure: authentic, and inauthentic. For the authentic, the three aspects are anticipation, anxiety, and moment of vision. Anticipation refers to Dasein\u2019s projection including the prospects of itself dying, and accepting it as ever-present for-the-sake-of-itself. Anxiety corresponds to disposedness, which is the way the world appears for Dasein in light of the possibility of death. In anxiety, Dasein no longer feels itself to be in the world, and realises the possibility of the world being independent of its existence. This alienating state-of-mind later overcome by the authentic Dasein in anticipatory resoluteness. Moment of vision only appears much later, in his discussion of temporality. It basically refers to authentic Dasein\u2019s resistance against falling into inauthenticity, by virtue of keeping in mind the possibility of its non-being. In the case of the inauthentic, there are only two aspects: fear and expectation. While this might be because the inauthentic is much less interesting to explore and not relevant to later developments, there isn\u2019t much to say about Dasein if it has already fallen into the world. Fear, as the literal, presents itself as a disposedness to treat death as an event of negation, as a case of death. This contrasts with the case of anxiety, which treats death as a possibility of non-being. One is about losing something, while the other is calling to an empty nothing. Expectation is the awaiting of death somewhat like an incoming event that will happen on Dasein. While anticipation is an active meeting of something (e.g. I anticipate my graduation, hence I work towards that graduation), expectation presents itself as passive.  A closing remark regarding Heidegger\u2019s method: you can see quite clearly by now that Heidegger is very fond of the triadic structure (i. e. postulating in terms of three). While I am not very certain what this preference really implies, I can guess that it was Heidegger\u2019s dedication to found whatever he was thinking based on time. In any case, I have just compiled Heidegger\u2019s elaboration on the care structure according to its relevant parts, albeit in a condensed and diluted content. Nonetheless, it is quite clear that Sorge is a much more comprehensible concept than Dasein or Being, since there are intimate connections that we can draw relevant from our everyday life. I hope this summary helped in some way. ",

            "answer_text": "Heidegger continues to write about care through much of his career, until he begins to talk about preservation. In Being and Time care is directed into the future, Heidegger here is concerned with willing and willing projects us into a future. Post-turn Heidegger wants to remind us of Thinking, thinking remembers and presents to us the past. History is not contained in things long past but surrounds us, we carry the past everywhere we go. It is good to remember and keep hold on the past otherwise Being is in oblivion, and concealed, and so on. There are certain objects in the world that hold the world and set forth the world in their presence. Temples, great works of art, historical artifacts, and the like. Without active preservation these wondrous things will decay, and fall from the world into mere earth, and Being will be concealed. For Heidegger, this active preservation of things is the perfect example of his ever so confusing call for us to will-not-to-will. We respond to the call for care and preservation from the Being of the thing, we willfully approach these things to hear the call, but the will finds its end in continued response to the Being of the thing, to the material, to the conditions, to the history contained within. Care and preservation continue to be of importance to events in the world that cannot be maintained through some manner of work. It is not enough for these events simply to be remembered, but to become as concrete as possible through the reification of the event into an object (and, by the time we get to Heidegger lecturing on Holderlin\u2019s poetry objects only exist in remembrance). In the distant past some of these objects would be handed down word for word through generations. Remembered, preserved, cared for, these things we call stories stand in for the more individual appropriation and personal reification of events into objects. An event that happened in the world is doomed to fall into oblivion from the world once there are no longer any alive who remember it, and so these objects must be taught, must be passed on. Additionally, every person has events in their own life, perhaps experienced by only them, without the memory of which that person would be somehow different, one might say they at least would be in some kind of inauthenticity. The care and preservation of such remembered and reified events is equally important, if not more so, than the care and preservation of historically or artistically significant things. If no one remembers why that lump of stone that used to house a great golden Zeus requires preservation no-one will any longer be able to hear the call of Being to engage in the care and preservation of the thing. And, it might as well just fall from the world back into the earth. ",
