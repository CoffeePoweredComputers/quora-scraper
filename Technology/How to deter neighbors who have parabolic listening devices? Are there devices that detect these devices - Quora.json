            "answer_text": "You can download and use this file via an outside loudspeaker pointed in the direction of where you think their parabolic device is and play using a cd player set to play same track on repeat or a digital recorder also set to play track on repeat via an amplifier. This cannot be heard by adults but will overload their microphone preventing other sounds being heard unless they fit notch filter at the particular frequency needs( technical knowledge) but still will make very hard to hear any speech. This will upset any young children or teenagers but you don\u2019t need high just directional level ( play to them and ask if they can hear it!) (Text below from my website) Teen ringtone has two uses: The High frequency tone cannot be heard by adults so if used as a ringtone at school the teacher will not know your phone is ringing. The second Adult use is to play over public address system in shopping malls or supermarkets and other locations where groups of youths hang out from boredom or to make trouble. Adult shoppers will not notice the sound but it will be harmless and very annoying to young troublemakers who will leave the area.

Where the H do you live? parabolic listening devices sounds like a POLICE state or an investigation. Turn on lots of electric devices mostly blenders and put in some marbles or screws and puree. Loud music works. The IDEA is to drown out normal talking. OR construct a SOUND ROOM around the house. ",
