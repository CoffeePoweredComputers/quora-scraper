            "answer_text": "NO! In my opinion no foldable device is worth buying cause they are extremely overpriced (for the same price you can get a smartphone with the same specs, a tablet and still have some more left). Also they tend to have durability problems and the apps are not optimized for those devices (eg. The YouTube app is like 70% functional). For the foldable devices to be worth, you must wait for the technology to mature a little bit. ",
