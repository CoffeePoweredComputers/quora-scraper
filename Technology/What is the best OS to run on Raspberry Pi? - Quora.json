            "answer_text": "Depends. If you\u2019re after all-round functionality and versatility, I would strongly recommend Raspbian, the Raspberry Pi Foundation\u2019s officially supported OS for the Raspberry Pi series of SBCs. However, all operating systems have their pros and cons; in the end, it all boils down to what you want to do with your Pi. Want to put together your own media centre or HTPC (Home Theatre PC)? Try Kodi or OpenELEC, open-source media/entertainment centres designed for this particular purpose. For a quick and easy Pi desktop, Raspbian is my go-to OS. I\u2019ve also run Arch Linux with the ultra-lightweight LXDE desktop environment and had some great successes with it, but Raspbian just seems better suited to the Raspberry Pi and its quirks. If you\u2019re getting bored with Linux or just feeling adventurous, you can always try Android for Raspberry Pi or even Windows 10 IoT, a lightweight ARM port of the x86 desktop Windows 10 many of us are familiar with. Happy hacking! ",

            "answer_text": "Your own GNU/Linux based distro off of Buildroot. Takes under 3 secs to boot if done properly, minus the X or Window Managers, of course. Good thing is, Buildroot also lets you install apt-get or its own package manager, so you can build your own distro from the ground up. Since its a low power SoC, Buildroot is great. I found Raspian very slow, unfortunately - and somewhat useless. If you need a small and energy efficient computer, Atom based boards makes sense. Otherwise, you wont need GUI on Raspberry. ",
