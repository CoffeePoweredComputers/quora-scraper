            "answer_text": "This app is a wonderful app!!. Iam not telling this as an exxageration. It really works. Ad is their revenue. They give a share of their income to our wallet. For each refferal to level 1 you get 4rs.(Direct referral of yours comes under level 1 , the people reffered by the level one cones in level 2 and so on).From all other levels too you get income. The projected OneAD balance is credited in this means - Projected Bal \u00f7 30 per day. So by 30 th day u will get the desired amount. Iam saying again this app is legit, gives real money. Only thing u need to put some effort. I have redeemed it many times. No problem at all. If it is Paytm, redeemed at the second itself but bank account takes some time but no matter whatif we get free money for just installing an App. Only problem is that the people you have reffered should keep the app installed and should have a check on it. Usually the irritation with the app is notification stuck at the notification bar.. but it can be killed by long pressing it and turing off the notification. U can begin with ma refferal code\u2026AJ22QCM. Or click mmy refferal link \u2026 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.application.onead&referrer=AJ22QCM Sign up with OneAD app. My referral code for registration is AJ22QCM. If you have any further doubts you can comment down.. ",
