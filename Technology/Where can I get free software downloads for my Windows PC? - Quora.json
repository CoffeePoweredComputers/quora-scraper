            "answer_text": "On the internet, you will find both free and premium software. Since the numbers of free software were high compared to the premium ones, it becomes confusing and difficult to pick proper software. This is why we have decided to compile a list of best free software that you should have on your Windows PC. But the main confusion is which and from where you should Download free software for your new pc or laptop in 2020, Because there are plenty of websites are offering free and paid software online and you don\u2019t know which is right and which isn\u2019t. The big thing is, all software vendors are saying that they are the best and the cheapest, they are trying their best efforts to tempt you to buy any paid software. But, if you are a home user or a small office utility you don\u2019t need to buy any paid software. I have found one website which is really doing good for all free software for your pc or laptop. They are taking trial software from all legit software developers and put it on their website, even here you don\u2019t have to click many things, just a single click and your free software are there, even safe to download. Thanks, ",

            "answer_text": "Just do a Google search for \"free Windows software\" or \"Windows freeware.\" Be aware in advance, however, that all free software, and even some for-pay software, no matter how benign it may seem, comes packed together with spyware, crapware, viruses, rootkits, keyloggers, and many other forms of malicious software that you may not recognize or be able to refuse before it damages or even hijacks your Windows installation.
