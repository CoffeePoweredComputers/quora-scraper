            "answer_text": "Are Fossil watches a good brand? Fossil watches are a popular brand and also manufacture Relic, Michele, Zodiac, and Skagen watches. In addition, Fossil makes fashion watches under contract for Adidas, Burberry, Diesel, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tory Burch, Marc Jacobs, Emporio Armani, Emporio Armani Swiss Made, Armani Exchange, Karl Lagerfeld. Given the thousands of watches that pour off the assembly line Fossil becomes less manufacturer and more marketing company and subcontractor.  According to Fossil, \u201cof the watches we procured from the Far East, approximately 59% were assembled through our two majority-owned entities. The remaining 41% of the watches we procured from Fossil East were assembled by approximately 40 unrelated factories located primarily in Hong Kong and China. Production of approximately 73% of the jewelry products we sell is sourced from one of our majority-owned entities. The remaining 27% is manufactured by approximately 20 factories located primarily in China\u201d. It is no surprise that quality control slips when one considers the number of production facilities making products for Fossil and other fashion retailers. Regarding failures in quartz watches, Fossil leads the herd from personal experience. When you consider a watch as a gift and the watch fails that reflects poorly on you. This is why I no longer give Fossil watches as gifts. If a relative finds a watch they like made by Fossil, I look for something similar by a different maker. In the event you do not find a better deal you will probably find a better watch. I took a group of kids to the Timex watch museum in Connecticut. After wandering through the small facility, we went by the gift shop and everyone got a watch. Each child received more than a timepiece, they walked away with a watch and a memory. I felt confident that Timex was robust enough to survive what kids can dish out.  ",

            "answer_text": "Selecting a wristwatch may not be the easiest task to complete. The number of brands and models looking back at you from numerous online stores can make your head spin. One brand that particularly keeps popping up everywhere is Fossil. This famous brand seems to have a watch for every taste, boasting collections from modest dress wristwear to flamboyant skeleton watches. Although Fossil is known as every other widespread trademark, it\u2019s still not considered on par with famous Swiss or Japanese watch companies, attracting interest over the reliability they provide. The American company of Fossil is known for its ultra stylish and flashy watches that always catch an eye. In the 1980s, a person wishing to acquire a wristwatch had literally two options to go for a reliable but pricey classic Swiss watch, or settle with a cheap looking piece of plastic. The market had a considerable gap for attractive yet affordable timepieces that needed covering. With the arrival of Fossil in 1984, though, the stores started to fill with eye catching watches that also boasted attractive prices. Thus the stream of fashion watches we have today got an ignition precisely from the emergence of the Fossil brand. During the years, Fossil has taken the leading role in providing fashionable wristwear but is not only limited to that. All kinds of accessories, jewelry, and leathers also come from the production line of the brand. However, the watches are still their primary source of income. The lot of you may not even know that Fossil Group consists of numerous world famous fashion brands. Over the years, they\u2019ve complemented the portfolio from topdealsonline.shop of brands with Skagen, Zodiac, Relic, Misfit, Michele Watch, and WSI. Fossil also makes licensed accessories for other recognized brands, such as Diesel, Emporio Armani, DKNY, Puma, Burberry, Michael Kors, and Armani Exchange. So, if you are an owner of a Diesel or Armani watch, you\u2019re now aware that your timepiece has been designed, manufactured, and distributed by no other than Fossil Group. Recently, the most significant addition to Fossil\u2019s portfolio has been Misfit. ",

            "answer_text": "Fossil watches are mass-produced quartz watches, and as such, they usually have a pretty good level of quality control and finishing, and they\u2019re likely to be defect-free and to keep accurate time for years and years. They\u2019re not built to last for decades, especially since people buying quartz watches rarely know how/when to get a watch serviced. Gaskets fail after a few years and need replacing, or you\u2019ll do what I did: wear a Fossil diver from the mid-1990s into a pool, and ruin the thing because water was able to enter the case and movement. FOR THE MONEY (about $100), I would highly HIGHLY recommend looking at a Seiko, Orient or Citizen watch with an automatic movement and 100m water resistance rating. Seiko\u2019s \u201cSeiko 5\u201d line in particular is renowned by anyone who knows about watches for providing incredible value, durable automatic movements, timeless styling and affordable maintenance & serviceability. If you want to wear a nice watch that keeps time, while communicating to the world that you care about wearing a well-made timepiece, those three brands (Seiko, Citizen and Orient) are just a fantastic place to start.

So you are not necessarily in for a treat\u2026 2. They have a rather high pace of phasing new models in and phasing old ones out, which means that after three to five years it might be hard to source replacement hands or a dial for the specific model that you are purchasing. 3. They have a strong \u201cfashion\u201d input, which means that a model might look trendy now and outdated in five years.

            "answer_text": "Depends on you, what type of person are you? If you just want an instrument that will tell you the time, as cheap as possible, don't care about longevity and rotate watches every other day - it will get the job done. And if you are passionate about watches: do you like quality and are willing to pay for it ?Are you looking for a watch that is repairable and that will last for many years up to a life time?Do you think quality is better then quantity?Do you wish to have a watch that will retain its value for a possible resell in the future ? (So your watch is like a bank deposit that you use to tell the time until you decide to sell it- if ever!)If so, don't waste your time and money on cheaply made (and sold for 50x more profit) Quartz watches that will die after 2\u20133 years (or less.. Depends) Get your self a decent mechanical watch! it doesn't have to be an exotic \u20ac50K+ watch, you can pick up a beautiful Nomos Orion (35 or 38mm, with or without date) with a manual wind mechanical in-house movement for less then \u20ac3K ! mechanical Swiss/German watches will last more then a life time with the right caring. If you are really right on the budget, you can look for a Japanese Seiko 5 automatic or a Seiko diver automatic - but buy only the used vintage models since they have the \u201cold\u201d and better movements (today Seiko put plastic parts in some of their automatic movements which is a shame) Good luck ",

Fully compatible with almost all of my critical IPhone functions. So yes. It does work great with my Iphone. Many customizable faces. Functions important to me work well. Heart rate, steps, weather, texts, Gmail, current news, most others. I wanted stainless steel, and this cost half the price of the Apple stainless steel watch, and is much more attractive.

All are between 100-400$ range and better than fossil in brand name. However fossil got some of the best leather straps in business.   ",

Also, they regularly have great discount offers available to save you a bit of money on your Fossil order. They are posted online and you can see them on their website at http://savemoneyoff.com/fossil Hope this helps anyway, I definitely would recommend them as a good brand. ",

If you have a sporty, outdoor lifestyle and that you feel you don't need a dress watch for everyday usage, a Fossil smartwatch may be perfect for you. However, if you are in a suit all day or you have a professional working environment, I would recommend going with a more dressier watch. This does not have to be a brand new Vacheron Constantin but something that resembles your working environment. Like I say, it depends on your lifestyle - and if you are going to buy a watch, make sure you love it. You have to love it before anyone else does. Hope this helped! ",
