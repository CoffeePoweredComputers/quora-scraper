            "answer_text": "Projects don\u2019t, but the entities behind them may. An entity can be a person, business, or other organization recognized by tax authorities. I\u2019ve built a number of open source projects (see github.com/coreybutler). I have a few sponsors (whom I appreciate more than I can say). I also write about open source projects on sites like Medium. Each of these provides a small trickle of revenue\u2026 and I mean very small. Sponsorship funds are collected by a company I setup, not by me personally. If I received funds directly to my name, it would be considered personal income and would need to be reported in my personal tax returns. Since most of the projects cost more than they make (or make just enough to cover costs), there are rarely taxes to pay when taxed as a business. If there were a profit, the business would pay the tax. I prefer to approach it this way so that if there are ever enough funds to pay people to work on a project, I can do so without personally taking a tax hit. Either way, the project is not taxed. Code is just code, just like a burger is a burger\u2026 i.e. code is just a \u201cthing\u201d (burgers obviously don\u2019t pay tax). However; the restaurant that makes/sells the burger is taxed for profits when they sell the burger. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not aware of any profitable open source projects. Many open source projects are affiliated with non-profit foundations. Tax deductible donations to the foundation fund project expenses, such as resources for testing the software. Many for-profit companies donate employee time and other resources to open source projects. For tax purposes, depending on the tax jurisdiction, the company does not need to separately deduct that donation of salary and benefits because it deducts all labor expense as \u201cSelling, General & Administrative,\u201d \u201cManufacturing,\u201d and other categories of expense. Some may be listed as Research and Development, if there are special tax advantages for that. ",

            "answer_text": "If they have taxable income, then yes they should pay taxes. Open-source does not necessarily mean free of charge. Open-source licenses do allow the makers to charge fees for their product. This is a common misunderstanding about open source. Besides charging for copies of the software, many open-source projects make money by providing support, training, certification, or even by asking for donations. Those are all taxable income. ",
