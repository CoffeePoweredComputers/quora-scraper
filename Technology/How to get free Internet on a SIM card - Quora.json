            "answer_text": "\u201cfree Internet on a SIM card\u201d implies Internet over a cellular connection. Generally, there is no way of getting truly free Internet over such a connection. You may be able to find a cellular network wherever you live that provides unlimited Internet, but there will still be some form of charge for the cellular network connection for voice or text. You can get close to free Internet if you connect to a WiFi network at a coffee shop or similar establishment that offers \u201cfree WiFi\u201d. I say \u201cclose to\u201d because the coffee shop will expect you to buy something on each visit to use their WiFi. Note: using WiFi to connect to the Internet does not require a working SIM card, although the device may require an unregistered card, maybe from an old cellular account, to be present before the device will boot up completely. There is another alternative. Persuade a friend to give you Internet access via the hotspot on their phone and using their SIM card to access the Internet over their cellular network. You can get free Internet over your WiFi connection to your friend\u2019s phone, but they pick up the bill for cellular Internet. ",

            "answer_text": "Well you could go with FreedomPop as they offer LTE SIM\u2019s where the basic plan is free monthly service. Other than plans through some provider, the only other way to get essentially free data would be through some measure of exploit. Possibly places to look are any plan limitations that are only client-side instead of server-side. However those types of vulnerabilities have for the most part been patched. You could see how unmetered data access in some plans are implemented, and if anything can be adjusted client-side then you have hit a jackpot. Note that this is for informational purposes only. ",
