            "answer_text": "No, you can not patent an app in any country. But, you can patent technical operations and sequence of operations as long as they are novel, distinct and technical. Novel means new, not stated anywhere else. Distinct means strongly different from previous ones. The international criteria is as \u201cnon-obviousness to a person skilled in the art\u201d. Not so definitive, so implementation may vary. Technical means being beyond object-oriented programming. Usually, this is implemented as operations that can not be done with paper and pen for example. For more details, you can ask as with details of the app you want to patent. ",
