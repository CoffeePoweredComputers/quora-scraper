            "answer_text": "The phrase is XR. The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) uses the phrase XR to refer to VR and AR (with MR being in the middle, more or less). This document uses the acronym XR throughout to refer to the spectrum of hardware, applications, and techniques used for Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and other related technologies. Examples include, but are not limited to: Head-mounted displays, whether they are opaque, transparent, or utilize video passthroughMobile devices with positional trackingFixed displays with head tracking capabilitiesThe important commonality between them being that they offer some degree of spatial tracking with which to simulate a view of virtual content. Terms like \"XR Device\", \"XR Application\", etc. are generally understood to apply to any of the above. Portions of this document that only apply to a subset of these devices will indicate so as appropriate. Emerging Technologies is a term for anything that is starting to \u2018catch on\u2019. The Emerging Technologies area in SIGGRAPH, for example,embodies areas that are \u201chalfway between inception and adoption\u201d. Emerging Technologies - SIGGRAPH 2019 I would make the argument that AR and VR are fully into adoption; especially with Beat Saber selling more than a million copies, and a million headsets being used per month. It\u2019s still pretty new, but it\u2019s definitely there. XR does not, as Wikipedia mentions, stand for \u201cExtended Reality\u201d. The talk page shows the details. Use XR as the W3C does; it\u2019s part of the official standards of the web now. MR doesn\u2019t encompass VR, although it sort of encompass AR. MR may use devices normally associated with VR, but the phrase is sort of falling out of favor due to a lack of devices. VR is not MR, so you can\u2019t say that MR encompasses VR; VR can be entirely \u2018non real\u2019 whereas MR assumes that some of what you are seeing, either directly through a pass through HMD like the Hololens or Magic Leap. With VR, I could be immersed in something that\u2019s entirely non-real. So MR cant\u2019 stand for both AR and VR. Use XR. Then again, this stuff is all so knew that \u201cA rose by any other name would still smell as sweet.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The term I\u2019ve used with clients in the VR/AR field to serve as a catch-all term is \u201cextended reality\u201d or \u201cXR.\u201d The original definition of mixed reality or \u201cMR\u201d as described in the seminal 1994 white paper by Paul Milgram & Fumio Kishino is the \u201cgray area in between\u201d VR & AR. Microsoft is latching onto the \u201cmixed reality\u201d term to describe their HoloLens platform but when you explore that environment you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s actually just fancier, eyeglass-based AR with spatial inputs considerably more sophisticated than that used by the popular Pok\u00e9mon phone app. See more about extended reality on Wikipedia here: Extended reality - Wikipedia In summary: XR speaks of anything in the VR/MR/AV/AR technology environment. I also like the term \u201cTEE\u201d which stands for Technology-Enhanced Experience, focusing on the user experience rather than the specific part(s) of the virtuality spectrum that are used. MR is any blend of VR & AR. AR is still augmented reality, like you\u2019ve seen in Snap Chat and Pok\u00e9mon. AV is augmented virtuality, a subset of MR described within the Wikipedia MR page here:Mixed reality - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Uhhh, I suppose that\u2019s basically what you\u2019d call MR, or \u201cMixed Reality\u201d, which, as the name implies, is the mix between AR and VR and it\u2019s tech that Microsoft has been really pushing recently. They already have a name for their device for MR which is called HoloLens. MR Has more similarities to AR than to VR though, as it\u2019s still just stuff added to your space, to your world, but stuff that feels more alive and interacts with the environment. It\u2019s not like in Pokemon GO where a Pikachu might be clipping through a car or a building. With MR, the Pikachu would probably jump/walk/stand around or on the car in question. That\u2019s basically the only difference between AR and MR. We\u2019re moving super fast with technology, and I love the fact that people like Sony, Microsoft and HTC have been pushing VR/AR/MR lately, but I\u2019m still perfectly fine with my custom-ordered Google Cardboard from a Google Certified Supplier!

            "answer_text": "I agree with Vitaly, 'mixed reality' is probably closer (or close enough) to what you are looking for.  See the definition in Choose Your Reality: Virtual, Augmented or Mixed: \"Mixed reality lets the user see the real world (like in AR) while also seeing believable virtual objects (like VR). It then anchors the virtual objects to a point in real space, making it possible to treat them as \u201creal,\u201d at least from the perspective of the person who is enjoying the MR experience.\"  'Immersive' may be more relevant for VR than for AR. And 'emerging technologies' is simply too broad, I'd rather use it as an adjective for all technologies that are seeing a growing interest & relevance. ",

            "answer_text": "Original question: What term encompasses both VR and AR? There is much debate on this one, as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and others have the ability to define and redefine general definitions. As an example many would say MR (Mixed Reality). Yet Microsoft use that word to mean what most call VR (Virtual Reality) with the Windows Mixed Reality headset solutions, yet oddly enough its\u2019 the same term that is also used with their Hololens, that many would call AR (Augmented Reality). In a nutshell, (Extended Reality) XR is a safe bet or it was until a couple of months ago with Apple brought out the iPhone XR. Now\u2026who knows! ",

So MR includes a lot of technologies, but not pure VR, so maybe this is not the one you\u2019re looking for.
