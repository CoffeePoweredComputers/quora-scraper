            "answer_text": "They are the same technology. OLED panels. The answer is dependable on what exact panels we compare. Usually I would say AMOLED (Samsung\u2019s implementation on OLED) against POLED (LG\u2019s way of the same thing), as Samsung has done this for almost a decade (Samsung Galaxy S.. the first one already used AMOLED) LG only tried it recently (LG V30, and I think they did the panels for iPhone X too). There were issues with these. They might perfect the solution later on. But Samsung panels as of right now are a safer bet (that\u2019s why all the other phones use it, like Xiaomi or Oneplus) Generally though, it\u2019s the same thing. Depends on the actual implementation, and not on the technology. Compare brightness, resolution, color correctness, view angles, color depth of the panels of the phones you want to buy. In case of TV\u2019s (but I assue we\u2019re talking about phones, as there are no amoled TV\u2019s) only LG makes OLED panels. The future of display technology is called microLED though. It has all the advantages of OLED, without the majos disadvantages (pixel burnout) ",
