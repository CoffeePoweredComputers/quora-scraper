            "answer_text": "As a student in the 21st Century myself, there are definitely certain skills you should be focusing on. However, these vary depending on what type of student you are or are interested in being. A high school student will require slightly different skills (e.g. good listening skills, research skill, problem solving skills, etc.) than a college student(e.g. effective written and oral skills, adaptability, critical thinking, etc.), a college student will require different skills than a self-taught entrepreneur and so on. I\u2019m going to assume, however, that you\u2019re interested in the self-learning path. For this type of \u201cstudents\u201d you will need the following skills. And I\u2019m not saying these are the only skills you\u2019ll need, but they are a good place to start if you already have a good grasp on the basic learning skills mentioned in the examples above. ConsistencySelf-DisciplineFocusConsistency In the self-learning world you have to be able to develop a routine and keep the momentum going. This is exactly what consistency is. If you start learning and truly want to become good at it, keep doing it, keep learning, keep investigating. This will separate you from the pack and give you a tremendous advantage since not everyone has what it takes to stay consistent. Self-Discipline Consistency goes hand in hand with discipline, for without it you won\u2019t be able to stay consistent. Learning in and of itself is hard. This is especially true for self-taught persons. Therefore, if you truly want to make progress in your learning journey, you have to work on being more disciplined. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to go through enormous amounts of uncomfortable situations in order to accomplish your goal (though it can be this way sometimes). Rather, it means that you have your learning goals well defined and do everything in your power to meet those goals. Try to make it easy for yourself to meet your goals. Focus Attention in the 21st century has become more and more scarce. There are tons of things trying to get our attention from many different directions. That is why focusing while you learn is of outmost importance. You have to be able to go into your learning sessions with 100% of your focus directed to it. This way you will make sure to be making the most out of your learning time. By focusing, you\u2019re also reducing the amount of time you have to study overall since you will be able to retain the information more efficiently. These are just some of the skills you need to be an effective student in 2020. However, there are a ton more you should master such as curiosity, analytical skills, and others. Hope this helped, and if this isn\u2019t the type of student you were referring to or had in mind, feel free to specify it and I\u2019ll do my best to answer accordingly. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Well considering we are entering 2019, 2020 is around the corner. Here are the top skills that would be valuable to anything you are doing, whether working for yourself or for an organization. This topic has been discussed in detail by the World Economic Forum, as they have mentioned that we are on the cusp of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. There are some valid points, but here are six of the ten mentioned, with my personal thoughts: Critical-Thinking. In our ever increasing automated world, employing logic and reasoning to direct those machines (think of A.I.) would be important.Creativity. This is why I encourage everyone to do things for themselves, like write, or create something because it exercises this muscle. It fosters innovation, pushes critical thinking and in a world where we are navigating new technologies, pushing new products and services are important leveraging newer tools to reach new audiences will become more valuable.Adaptability. One of the key traits that leads to resentment in this world, is the resistance to adapt and change with rapid technological advances. This manifests in to politics and plays in to the electorate. Keep up with trends, study new tools and see how careers are being shifted so you are not caught off track.Decision-Making Ability. With vast amount of content and data, decision making could be seem like it\u2019s more of a mission. With the assistance of data analytics, being able to analyze, make sense and making informed decisions as a business (whether you are in one, or running your own) will be key in the information age.Negotiation. This has been a key skill identified by the World Economic Forum, however, I would personally argue that the art of negotiation and interpersonal skills should be honed in on during the grade school years. A lot of people are afraid to ask for what they want in understanding their self worth. This could be a tough transition to ask for in the working world if the formal educational system has them institutionalized.Relationship Management Skills. The World Economic Forum has cited the rise of technology signifying the importance of people management and people oriented skills. This is especially true in leadership and management. However, this could be extended to other aspects other than business but on a more personal level. Trying to replace people with technology is a self-defeating endeavor and the statistics show that is it not working, causing a lot of isolation, loneliness and in some cases depression. ",

            "answer_text": "Before jumping straight into the answers, let us first of all define what skills mean in a language that is easy to understand. Skills simply refer to the knowledge, abilities and experience that are needed to perform the job. They are simply the tangible factors which make you able to perform the job well and in a manner that satisfies your employer. Nowadays with the rapid pace at which technology is being adopted , it is much more clear that most companies are interested in digital professionals that help them automate their work processes while also ensuring a corresponding increase in profitability and brand loyalty to the organization. But is technology the only thing that employers are looking for? The answer is no but most of the jobs are headed that way because of the manner in which communication has also evolved together with technology. Social media is undoubtedly the means by which most social interactions take place today. The days of face to face client interaction are gone. And on top of that , online communication also uses less physical infastructure and can generate more leads. Now let's categorize the skills based on the three most important career clusters as per today's job market. These three clusters include Information Technology, Health, and Administrative careers respectively. Let's start with information technology. Irrespective of whether you want to be a data scientist , system administrator or computer programmer there are minimum requirements expected of you if you are to excel in any career related to this cluster. These include: An understanding of cyber security threats that an organization is likely to face. You can demonstrate competence by enrolling for cyber security certifications such as CompTIA security+, Certified ethical hacker (CEH), Certified Information Security Manager ( CISM) and Certified Information System Auditor ( CISA).Ability to manage remote working teams. This is important as nowadays not many people have the time to meet face to face yet they are interested in sharing knowledge and collaborating in various projects.Ability to use standard office applications without hustling too much. An example could be the ability to use Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create and edit images such as logos , drawing or pictures for use in DTP , websites or other applications. Another way could be through the use of database software such as Oracle / My SQL to manage data in many forms from various lists for instance from customer contacts to catalogues. On top of that you could even practice on using MS PowerPoint to make presentations. Another use of office applications is the use of MS word to do word processing tasks like writing letters and reports.Mastery of Customer Relations Management tools to allow businesses to better understand and analyze their customers. An example of this tool is a loyalty card.Ability to use Digital Communication Technologies. These technologies enable communication by electronic means .They can be divided into two. The Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network ( WAN.)Local Area Network involves linking a number of hardware items together in an office building These include things such as hardware , printers ,scanners printers with software applications and data within your company's office building. It's basically coming up with an internal communication structure for the company. Wide Area Network ( WAN) is a communication platform for communicating with people outside your company. In simple terms it's a network that covers a wide geographical area. Some examples of WAN include satellite link , last mile ( where companies provide internet services to consumers by connecting their homes with fiber) , and ATM facilities for organizations.Let's now look at the most important skills in health relevant to today's job markets . These include : Ability to use electronic health records systems ( EHR) to enter information of new patients and keep a digital record that they update with each encounter.Attention to detail. This makes sure that you do not only make mistakes but also give great patient care. Observing verbal nland non verbal cues is an example of this and it helps give you a very great diagnosisof the conditions that patients are suffering from rather than relying on laboratory examination and medical imaging.Critical thinking- This is a skill that involves being a good problem solver. A good critical thinker in the health sector is able to integrate various evidence, findings, outcomes and experiences and translate them into effective plans and solutions for patients. It also includes being able to consult with your supervisor about various problems as well as being able to keep in touch with current findings of professional journals and being involved with the faculty's quality improvement processes.Time management , that entails the prioritization of tasks. This includes being able to come up with personal checklists, spreadsheets and flowcharts to plan your work effectively.Finally let's have a look at the most in demand / important skills in the administrative / managerial sector: Analytics \u2014 this refers to both the social media metrics eg likes ,comments and shares together with business metrics for instance traffics ,leads, conversions and revenue. As a social media manager ,this should be the guiding principle in your organization when it comes to measuring your performance across various social media channels. A good knowledge on analytics can enable you to know how to drive traffic from a social media channel such as Instagram and drive it into your website and eventually drive sales for the organization. With this knowledge, being able to attribute traffic back to channels will be useful both to you and your team to know which content is more useful in influencing more clients to engage with you and your organization.Graphic and video design \u2014 this is creation of visual content for your organization.

            "answer_text": " Sales - Everyone has something to sell no matter who they are. A product, service or even themselves in job interviews! Master this skill and you will always find a job!Problem-solving - Every corporation, business and employer will face problems, and if you can be the person that finds a solution to their problem then your value will be priceless to that company! People do not pay to gain anything but to remove their own problems!Communication - Communication is the most important skill when it comes to forming relationships and creating a mutual understanding, which is always needed!Positivity - Positive, happy people can work more effectively, make their surroundings more friendly and infect others with that positivity, creating a wave of motivation that rushes through the entire company.Marketing - If no one knows about a product or a service then there is no chance anyone will buy it. Marketing will always be an in-demand skill just as sales.Self management/awareness - Most people need a kick in the butt before they see their own problems and focus on fixing them, often just resulting in them getting fired. Being able to solve your own problems as soon as they arise is just as important as being able to solve others problems, if not more so!Leadership - Leaders always get better paying positions and are always needed. Try running a company without a good leader and it will fail, but put a great leader in a tiny company and even it will succeed!Fast Learning - The amount of information available multiplies every year to the point where what you learn today will be out of date within the next 800 days. Being able to keep up with this, learn fast and continue learning is a required skill at this point.Productivity - The average person gets less than 3 hours of work done for every 8 hours they are at work. That being said, if you can learn to work 4 or 5 hours out of every 8 you will have a near 150% increased productivity compared to the other people working there. The rest is self-explanatory.Coaching - As seen in point #8 there is just too much information out there for you to get it all, especially not if you still have to produce something during the day! That is why coaches, in every possible field are more important now than ever. Knowing what others don\u2019t and being able to teach that will always generate you money no matter what happens in the future!",

Web Architecture and Development Framework 4. Middleware and Integration Software 5. User Interface Design 6. Network and Information Security 7. Mobile Development 8. Data Presentation 9. SEO/SEM Marketing 10. Storage Systems and Management \"While we see job applications spike on LinkedIn in October, we know companies aren't actually hiring at the same rate until January,\" says LinkedIn career expert Catherine Fisher in a press release. \"While some skills expire every couple of years, our data strongly suggests that tech skills will still be needed for years to come, in every industry. Now is a great time for professionals to acquire the skills they need to be more marketable.\" Talking about skill sets , let me have a brief discussion of few particular techs which might help to expand the knowledge of the readers:- Data ScienceThe industry has been building up to this for several years, and it\u2019s never been more true than it is right now: big data is king. Companies are clamoring for employees who can take huge amounts of information and analyze them for insights. Well it\u2019s a known fact that , more than 90% of the data has been collected in the last two years. As far as concrete skills you can learn right now, R is the language of choice for statistical analysis and visualization. And according to Dice, pay for R-related jobs has climbed 9.7% over the past year. SAS is another hugely useful programming language to learn for analytics. Familiarity with Cassandra databases is lucrative as well. Cloud and Distributed computingThe technology , in which the industry worked and took all these years to develop , is now being overrun by a new tech - Cloud. Many companies are also preferring distributed computing, which allows multiple computers to network with one another to solve a task (and, unlike the cloud, gives companies control over the actual hardware involved). Many of the skills involved with cloud computing and distributed computing are related, so the two are often grouped together. Skills to learn include SQL for database management, programming languages like Ruby, JavaScript, and Python for building cloud-based applications, and DevOps (a software development system popular in the cloud computing field). Specific in-demand programs include Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Data VisualizationThe old writing adage \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d now has a place in the tech world as well. Data visualization goes hand in hand with analytics and other data skills--because once data is collected and organized, it needs to be presented in a way everyone can understand. Typically, this involves using diagrams, text, and symbols to create \u201cdata models\u201d that illustrate how data is connected to each other. Think of it as both an art and a science: breaking down complex concepts into easy-to-understand visual communication. Mobile DevelopmentThe use of smartphones and tablets is only continuing to grow. Mobile development-- building mobile apps for iOS and Android--will be in high demand for the foreseeable future as companies continue to explore implementing apps and mobile-friendly websites that will allow customers and users to have access on the go. Key skills include cross-platform development ability so apps can be launched for different types of devices, UX(User eXperience) and UI(User Interface) know-how, and familiarity with agile methodologies, which are common in the mobile app industry. User Interface designUser interface design is key for apps, programs, and websites. When it comes to the part of a product that users see and interact with, the design should be intuitive, modern, and attractive, with the end goal of creating a pleasant and efficient user experience. The role of a UI expert involves anticipating user needs, analyzing audiences and the tasks they\u2019ll be completing, creating and refining prototypes, and more. Skills to have include front-end web development , graphic design, and soft skills like communication. CyberSecurityWithout robust systems in place to prevent security breaches that can lead to information theft, a company will ultimately lose the trust of its consumers. Because of this, cybersecurity is one of those \u201cevergreen\u201d skills that will always be needed. Skills to pursue include general programming/software development knowledge, knowledge of firewalls, proficiency in scripting languages, deep understanding of networks and operating systems, and more.

            "answer_text": "Quora has a large number of users with professional jobs in high tech industries, which explains why so many of the answers to this question emphasize jobs that require at least a four year university degree. Here are some interesting statistics: For every job requiring a masters degree there are two jobs requiring a bachelors degree and seven jobs requiring one or two years of post secondary school. This graphic explores the need for skilled trades people: http://www.explorethetrades.org/wp-content/uploads/Shortage-Skilled-Workers-v8-notrim.pdf One problem, according to Forbes is that the population of skilled trades people in the U.S. is rapidly nearing retirement age. But the pool of young adults who choose a four year college education is rising while the number of young adults who choose a vocational education has been declining: America's Skilled Trades Dilemma: Shortages Loom As Most-In-Demand Group Of Workers Ages Meanwhile, this Newsweek article discusses the number of college educated young adults who are unemployed or under employed: Millennial College Graduates: Young, Educated, Jobless For the past 50 years I have observed higher and higher percentages of high school graduates going on to college, while fewer and fewer high school graduates choose post secondary vocational training. The result: There are now trade related jobs that pay more than jobs requiring a four year degree or even an advanced degree. I recently read that welders now earn an average salary of about $80,000 in many parts of the country, and some sub-specialties within that trade can earn six figure incomes.  The shortage of trades workers is not unique to the United States, as illustrated in this report from British Columbia: The Problem of Too Many Skilled-Trades Jobs And this report dealing with university trained engineers who immigrate to Canada: Jobs in demand for skilled trades and engineering professionals? USA Today has just started an interesting series on jobs in America, and how so many more people are needed to fill good paying positions in the trades: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/30/job-economy-middle-skill-growth-wage-blue-collar/14797413/ If you are a college educated person, consider how much it costs per hour to hire a skilled plumber, electrician or HVAC person. Then consider if your daughter or son might be happier working with their minds and their hands when you discuss with them their post secondary education. IT and programming jobs are now out-sourced to other countries, and that trend probably will accelerate in the coming decades. But you can\u2019t send a pipeline welding job in Louisiana to a welder in Korea. Not every person with above average intelligence has the aptitude or creativity to work as a finish carpenter or a nuclear welder, just as not every person has the kind of focus and creativity needed to sit in front of a computer for 12 hours a day creating the next big thing in application software. Remember, some of most successful people in our nation did not graduate from college. Do you know some of the names :-) Top 10 College Dropouts - TIME ",

            "answer_text": "The most important non-obvious business skill is the ability to select and manage vendors. Vendors are becoming as important as Employees The number of vendors any organization uses has increased by an order of magnitude in the last ten years. Most companies have way more vendors than they have employees. A start-up has 10 times the number of vendors as they have employees. We are moving to a world where the number of companies is going to increase dramatically but the number of employees per company will decline. Companies will rely more and more on other companies for functions that they once relied on employees for. The most important business skill to have in the last 100 years was the ability to recruit, manage, and grow people. That will continue to be a very important skill in the future. But the skill that no one talks about is the ability to select and manage vendors. Some people are much better than others at utilizing vendors. The DNA of your company is defined by your vendors If all one knows about a company is their list of vendors, you can pretty much tell everything you would need to know about the company. You likely would know what industry they are, how fast they are growing, how long they have been around, the number of employees at the company, and even their future prospects. ",

            "answer_text": "The most in demand skills in 2017 are mostly related to technology. In this age of artificial intelligence and neural networks, skills related to these technologies are very high in demand. While my stint at at a technology company as an intern, I also noted that Cloud technology is one upcoming area of interest and there is a huge requirement of people having the expertise in this domain. In my opinion, the below 8 would be the most in demand skills in the coming times: 1. AI/machine learning researcher  Machine learning is already being used in a majority of applications these days and development of machine learning algorithm is required almost everywhere. It will be one of the hot skills of the future. 2. Data Analyst  With so much data being generated these days from innumerable sources, there is a dire need to handle the humongous amount of data. Data analysts come into the picture who can help crunch the data and derive something useful from it. All organisations make data based decisions and need to develop the ability to work with data. One of the most in demand skill of the industry is big data analysis. 3. Linguist  This world has become one small place due to rapid globalization. Organizations are operating in countries that have a different culture and language. To operate efficiently and deal in such environments, many organizations require Linguists who can help them understand different language. Any of the above skill and knowledge of a foreign language increases the demand of that resource exponentially. 4. Design Engineering Design engineers take an idea and convert it into a concept, they translate ideas into something that can be brought to life. With the advent of 3D printing, this skill can lead to self employment by creating one\u2019s own goods and merchandising it. Also, with such a high growth of 3D printing, 3D designers are very much in demand. 5. Full Stack Development  With a shift towards digital world, there is still a huge requirement for developers who can develop end to end applications. A developer is required to know a combination of languages and technologies to be considered a full stack developer. With increasing AI, a developer today needs to upgrade their skills and must be comfortable with a host of technologies. 6. AI software development  It is still a niche field but with growing usage of AI, organizations need people who can develop systems which can apply machine learning to the inputs. Knowledge of machine learning along with coding language can help one enter into this domain easily. 7. People Skills  This is one skill that will always be in high demand. This skill is what leads you to effective collaboration with different stakeholders. It helps you in an organization as well as in social life. This is the only skill that AI will never be able to emulate. Having this skill makes you a cent safer in these times. 8. Analytical skills and creativity  Out of the box thinking capabilities help organizations to bypass their problems. This skill is also required to create something disruptive. Creativity is one skill that can differentiate a resource in any organization. This skill is required in almost every process in any organization - from product development to marketing the product.

            "answer_text": "To be a good programmer, developer in the field of computer science., the first step that you need to take is to register to Holberton School where you learn the 2017 skills needed in the market. You will be able to learn the fundamentals of all the languages and the languages you need to learn to become a great programmer. You also need to do the following: 1. Willingness to learn: Technology is always evolving and the skills and abilities a programmer has today will likely be outdated in a few years. It\u2019s important to find a programmer who has an interest in following the latest trends and is eager to participate in any continuing education opportunities that are available. 2. Debugging skills: Creating code is only part of a programmer\u2019s job. When software doesn\u2019t work as expected, a programmer is expected to get to the root of the problem quickly and effectively. Instead of spending hours blindly making changes, search for a programmer who prefers to carefully investigate his code and research possible issues until an answer is found. 3. Problem-solving skills: A good programmer thrives on finding ways to make something work, despite the odds. 4. Passion for the work 5. Ability to plan 6. Ability to handle failure 7. Teamwork mentality 8. Willingness to research 9. Respect for deadlines ",

            "answer_text": "I would say system architecture first and soft skills, providing a culture of continues learning improving and communicating best practises. Then secondly all the stuff you learn from a masters in CS. Major pain points I have seen in my career so far, is not because of programming language errors or algorithms, but on communication and frictions wasting passion and time in unproductive way. Considering all the buzz words (agile, start-up culture, flexible working hours), you can follow the trend and learn to work with processes and a non blaming culture, in great teams and learn to be like them if you\u2019re not yet. System architecture is pretty much related. A healthy team splits responsibilities per project and maybe per service. Mainly, they all get along and identify who wants to be involved in more areas to learn of course, you can see a mix of pair-programming mentoring and solo trying-failing tasks assigned by leads for the learning process. Everything gets adjusted to a happy working flow when the system architecture allows that as well while deployments and versioning flows. ",

Yet, as soon as we hear the phone ring, we act as if we are firefighters rushing to a five \u2013 alarm fire. We run to pick it up as if our lives depended on the call being answered at once. I have seen people interrupt quiet family dinners, dedicated reading times and meditation periods to answer those seemingly urgent phone calls, many of which turn out to be ones that could have been taken later. It is so easy to run to it, simply because we want to know who is calling us. Often, picking up the ringing phone is just another way to put off doing something you don\u2019t really want to do. But once you get good at letting it ring and staying focused on the activity at hand, whether it is reading a good book, having a heart \u2013 to \u2013 heart conversation with your life partner or frolicking with your kids, you will wonder what the hurry to pick up the phone was all about in the first place. Here is my resolution to pick less calls and spend more time with family and friends. Thanks Happy reading ",
