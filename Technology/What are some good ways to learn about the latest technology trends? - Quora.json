            "answer_text": "Whether you\u2019re a developer, a consumer or a business CEO, there are a few things you should know about technology Regardless of how little or how much you work with technology day to day, there are a few things that everyone needs to be aware of in today\u2019s tech-driven world  1) EXPERIENCE IT Seeing a Tesla and experiencing it, are two different things. Don't just watch it go by, go to a dealership. If you can, sit in one to truly know the implications of its \"user experience\". What makes this Tesla unique is its 100% digital, reconfigurable 12\" cluster and 17\" GUI touchscreen dashboard with an upgradable Linux OS interface whichcontrols everything from the navigation system to air conditioning, seat temperature, the sound system, the car's steering, lighting, ride settings and brake regeneration control. That requires some seriously thoughtful user experience design and futurist thinking. Why does that matter? Humanity is accelerating and decisions are made quicker everyday-the world of knobs, switches and gauges is not efficient enough. Gesture-driven touch control, quick visual reference and intuitive design are how we are beginning to make all decisions online and offline. It's enough to make your thumb and index finger tremble in anticipation. We are all becoming spoiled by the interface of our mobile devices, which is spreading to all other consumer goods. How do I know? I sat and rode in a Tesla and you should too. 2) GET WET, BUT DON'T DROWN  Everyone knows that information is a finger tap away. Blogs, newsletters, subscriptions, posts and feeds. How much noise and information is out there? Some interesting statistics: Number of Blogs and Web Sites in 2013: Tumblr.com - over 101.7 Million blogs with 44.6 Billion blog postsWordPress.com - over 63 Million blogsLiveJournal - over 62.6 Million blogsNumber of Live websites in 2013 - 510 MillionThat's a lot chicken casserole recipes. So the point is to be selective. (Source: Netcraft, April 2014) So how do you find a good source of information for your particular browsing method? A simple rule is that if a website is responsive and optimized for mobile, it is most likely current in content. Here are a few of my favorites: Daily shot of knowledge with great technology information: Smashingmagazine.comCnet.comTechcrunch.comFastcompany.comBusinessinsider.com/techFacebook is not just for your friends' Yosemite adventure pics. Join a few pages on Facebook that are insightful and post information regularly on technology that you personally find useful. My top three are: TEDMIT Technology ReviewTechCrunchYou could also follow thought leaders on Twitter.

            "answer_text": "One of the hardest things I believe is keeping up to date on the latest happenings with the many technologies. Still there are some ways to keep update about latest technology. Web Media (Blogs, Podcasts, Forums) In doing this, you start to see who the experts are because they are usually the ones designing the new stuff and writing about it. Choose the right blogs, podcasts in which kind technology you are interested in. Social Media (Twitter, Facebook) Anyone can sign up for Twitter and follow whoever they like without sending out one single Tweet. The beauty of this is that all of the gurus and companies are Tweeting, and what they Tweet is usually links to their blog posts (before they hit the feed readers) and links to other peoples blog posts that they have found interesting.Organize those that you follow into their respective categories so you can pick and choose what to read and when. Twitter or Facebook are not the only one, so try out several and find out which one works best for you. Print Media (Books and Magazines) While this can be a great resource, I offer a word of caution on this topic. Make sure the book is based on the correct version of the technology you are researching. This might not be your best option since you probably want to learn about it when it first comes out not months down the road. It can be tough to find time to fit this into your schedule, so you may have to get a little creative. Make a little time for this you can stay updated about the latest technology trends. ",
