            "answer_text": "\u201cOur life is absolutely in our hands, but not always we can change our life actions and situations. We must learn to accept the change and move on. So that our life becomes beautiful.\u201d Whatever it may be- our career, our work, our health, financial crisis, relationships, or any other unanticipated, unpleasant event, fighting doesn\u2019t always make a great change. On some level, we all know how important it is to accept the things we cannot change. What the research shows is that our willingness to accept the unchangeable has a great deal to do with our emotional and psychological well-being. Instead, when we do battle with reality, we cripple our capacity to cope with the situation and manage all the emotions we experience in response to it. If you have faith in god, believe that everything god gives has a true value behind. And if you are the one who does not have faith in god, always believe everything happens for a reason. Once you have this belief, you get to know the importance of acceptance in your life. Not everyone gets what they wish or dream in their life and at the same time, those people don\u2019t get annoyed but move on with positivity. POSITIVITY + BELIEF = ACCEPTANCE => SUCCESS What does the above formula suggest? A person with positivity and belief automatically accepts life changes and that indeed leads him to success. I have read the book of Deepak\u2019s Chopra\u2019s The 7 Laws of Spiritual Success which was published in 1994. Though it is a book of long back, his writings stay along even today. He dedicates one complete chapter (Law #4) to how we need to receive with open arms what happens to us, because if we fight and resist it, we are generating a lot of turbulence in our minds. He explains that even though we might want things to happen as we wish in the future, in the present moment we need to accept things as they are That\u2019s the way you can make your life flow smoothly instead of roughly. During the last year of my life I have learned the true power of acceptance. This is just an example. There are a lot of books and sayings of great people on the importance of acceptance in life. In brief, to lead a happy and a peaceful life, learn to accept the way it happens and mold it slowly to make a change instead of fighting the present. Thank You Team Learnweel. ",

            "answer_text": "To be accepted, one is judged and found worthy by someone or some group. When we are not accepted, then we are rejected. We all know how horrible rejection feels. In today\u2019s society, it is possible to ignore acceptance by others. However, most people prefer life that includes acceptance to one degree or another. Groups of people supporting each other are stronger and more capable. A healthy family is a good example. The perception of acceptance can be applied in small or very large situations. The importance of acceptance is something we learn as we grow older. To develop a good idea of how important acceptance is for you, imagine less acceptance in your life. Imagine friends rejecting you (at any level) or coworkers who no longer accept you. Imagine family being less accepting. Imagine cashiers, servers at restaurants, bank attendees, police, or even strangers when you walk around. There is a sense of hostility when we feel people do not accept us. There is also beauty and wonder in acceptance. When a stranger smiles without prompting, when a friend takes your side in a discussion, when family says your bad day will get better. There is a sense of warmth and belonging when we feel people accept us. Hope this helps and take best of care! ",
