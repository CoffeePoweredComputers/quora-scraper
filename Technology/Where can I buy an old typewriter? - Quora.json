            "answer_text": "Anywhere really. Garage sales, resale shops, antique stores, the side of the road, the internet...You can get a good machine anywhere from $25 - $1,000, depending on the kind you want. Newer machines from the 60\u2019s on are definitely cheaper, with some from the 70\u2019s only costing $10-20. Machines from the 20\u2019s or 30\u2019s, or the late 1800\u2019s are significantly more expensive, and harder to find working, but operate just as well.If you are confident in your ability to fix anything that could possibly go wrong with a typewriter, than go search eBay. You can find any machine at a wide price range. Broken machines are cheaper, but if you can fix them, then you come out on top.If you don\u2019t know your way around a machine too well, then go find one at a store where you can verify that it works before purchasing it. Test every key, including tab, margain release, and backspace. Check the vibrator, the spool reverse, color change, and all carriage functions. Happy shopping. ",
