            "answer_text": "One of the big advantages of older technology is that it\u2019s more likely to function in the event of a disaster that cripples civilization. You can fell a tree with an ax and hew out timbers with a hatchet and an adz, even if there is no electricity or gasoline. There are lots of potential ways civilization could get crippled, either temporarily or long-term, and I like having backup methods at my disposal. Even at that, I wouldn\u2019t go much past late19th century technology if I could avoid going totally primitive. I watched a guy who calls himself Clickspring work on reconstructing the Antikythera mechanism using ancient tools and techniques, and I would pass on that if I could. Let\u2019s not carburize our own iron files, or use a bow drill to make holes please. Figuring out a different way to power things like modern lathes and milling machines would be vastly superior to going back to the oldest techniques. Another example I like is the jukebox. Vintage jukeboxes had an immensely complicated electro-mechanical control system with thousands of moving parts to keep track of what records were selected to play in which order. You could replace thousands of metal moving bits with a simple little black box driven by a micro-controller today. If I were rebuilding civilization from scratch, I might hold off on jukeboxes until we rediscovered how to make integrated circuits. I guess there are winners and losers when it comes to old tech. Bow drills and extremely complex electro-mechanical controls, not so much in the winners column. ",
