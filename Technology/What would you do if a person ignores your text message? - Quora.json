            "answer_text": "I get kind of touchy about this subject. Unless it was in the middle of a conversation and they just up and stopped talking, I usually won\u2019t respond with anything. If I want to keep talking to them, I\u2019ll try to make a comment based on the last thing I texted, but usually won\u2019t go further than doing that once, maybe twice if the issue is really pressing. I\u2019ll leave it for a day, and if they don\u2019t respond, I figure the conversation is done, and the next time I talk to them, I start a new conversation. Why I\u2019m so careful about this is because I used to have a friend with super bad clinginess issues. If I didn\u2019t respond to his text within an hour, even if the conversation was over, he would start freaking out. It\u2019d start with \u201dHello?\u201d Then maybe 30 minutes would pass. \u201dHello??\u201d 30 more minutes.\u201dHello..\u201d 30 minutes. \u201cYou there\u2026?\u201d Slowly getting more and more depressed, as if I was purposefully ignoring him instead of, oh, I don\u2019t know, being in school? His clinginess and subtle guilt tripping whenver I was too busy having a life that didn\u2019t revolve around him really bugged me. It bothered me so much that I started feeling guilty whenever I was busy doing things and couldn\u2019t constantly be on the internet. Which is wrong. No one should make you feel guilty for having your own life, or for doing things that don\u2019t involve them. Anyway, it got really, really annoying and quite frankly kind of suffocating, to the point where I eventually never wanted to talk to him. Call me paranoid, but I don\u2019t want to make someone else feel like that. So I\u2019m careful about over-texting. The only time I get a little impatient with waiting for someone else to respond is (NERD ALERT) when I\u2019m roleplaying with someone over text. I absolutely love doing fantasy D&D-style rpgs, and text roleplay is kind of another form of that. So when my rp buddy goes silent on the rp for a while, I usually send them irritating or goofy messages to try to subtly remind them that I still want to roleplay. I still do try to keep it lighthearted and low-pressure, because it\u2019s supposed to be fun, and I don\u2019t want to make it a chore for them to have to respond. ",

Don't sit and over think... you probably came to this conclusion, that they're ignoring, just by over thinking... Don't keep sending them texts, asking about the obvious.. if they're ignoring, they are not interested in talking to you... leave it at that... Repeated asking of the reason is not gonna make you more interesting...  Do not feel bad about yourself..Give them space.. respect their decision...  by doing so,  you free their mind off of 'you'... sometimes this might make them contact you back ... if not for a chat, at least for saying what was the problem first of all...Don't talk about it to others..that's  not gonna do you any good... it could make it worse... Do not judge them... you never know what is going on with them.. what you thought of as   ignoring cud be due to some genuine reasons of not being able to contact you.. After all this if you are so sure that they're definitely ignoring you, then deep down, if you think properly, you already know the reason for doing so... find it and think what you should do to make things better... Be positive and feel happy about all the special people in your life... even if you are not one to them, be happy that you met them and you liked something about them that you value them so much... that'll keep you going... :D   ",

We can usually guess pretty accurately why the person isn\u2019t answering based on the relationship we have with them\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": " Attraction requires attention. In order for you to have any chance with a woman you have to get her attention. If you don\u2019t have that you are pretty much dead to her. Men think that the worst things a woman can do is be mean to you but it\u2019s not because there is some attention there even though it is negative. You may be able to turn that negative attention into positive attention and win her over. However what the worst thing a woman can do to you in terms of showing that she doesn\u2019t care about you is indifference. If a woman is indifferent towards you then you do nothing to her emotionally. Being that women are emotional beings that is not a good sign. With all that said, no attention means no interest. If I were you I would just move on and find some other women to talk to. Most women won\u2019t be mean and reject you out right so they do things like ignore your text, calls, flake on you, etc. Just take the hint and move on. No need to approach her and ask her why she hasn\u2019t responded to your text. Be the bigger person and find a woman who won\u2019t ignore your text and give you the attention that you want. Choose women who choose you! No need to waste time chasing women who simply aren\u2019t interested in you because you can never get that time back. Hope that helps. Your Dating Coach, Jacob. ",

It\u2019s not that I\u2019m terribly busy and important - it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t like to be disturbed in the middle of a project that requires focus and concentration. For reasons that I have never understood, my retired friends seem to think that I have nothing better to do than engage in nonsensical chitchat. If you are family, this is true. If you\u2019re just some random person I know trying to kill time while you wait for something else to happen, then you\u2019re a nuisance and I ignore it, according to my personal policy that my time is not yours to kill. Also I don\u2019t understand people who have emergencies. If you have a flat tire, you call AAA. Why text me? If you think you\u2019re having a heart attack, you dial 911. You don\u2019t text a friend. There was one recent exception - a 90-year-old neighbor with a baby opossum trapped in a wastebasket. She was afraid of being bitten, so I walked over and put the baby out in the yard where its mama could hear it calling. Mama came and got it and all was well. That really was an emergency for my friend. But mainly I use my phone for my own purposes. ",

            "answer_text": "This question reminds me of my son. Once we were having a digital conversation and for whatever reason, I stopped responding. The next time I looked at my phone I saw that he\u2019d texted, \u201cGood talk, Ma.\u201d I do love his sardonic wit. I laughed out loud but also regretted that I hadn\u2019t replied to his last question or comment. He\u2019s done this a few times since, although not so much that the joke has become old. How you respond to a lack of a response in text depends upon the kind of relationship you have with the person you\u2019ve texted. My closest others and I have an implicit (in some cases, explicit) understanding that if we don\u2019t reply to a text, we are probably super busy, down, simply not in the mood, or sleeping. With those who are less close and with whom I text infrequently, I make it a point to reply within a reasonable period of time. If they don\u2019t reply within a couple of days, I\u2019ll wait to have the conversation until whenever they do reply or when we next speak. If I\u2019ve never texted with someone, and I\u2019ve texted first and received no reply, I let it go. Some people don\u2019t particularly like to text and others have no particular interest in texting with me. It\u2019s not a big deal. With people you don\u2019t know well, the reply to the lack of a reply is no reply. They\u2019ll get back to you if they want to. ",

(Do this if you have the energy to deal with this person or you like this person) Also check back to the last few messages you sent to this person and see how they might of felt about it. not sure if my advise is good but its here ",

If you're reaching out about something that's time sensitive, maybe ask if there's a platform they respond quicker on. Call me old fashioned but you can always call them and save a lot of time. If it's just making plans to hangout or to catch up, give them space and respect that some people use their phone less often and technically have no obligation to respond right away, every time. I know this is anecdotal evidence but I have a friend that is terrible for carrying a text conversation if it's not about anything important. Once every few weeks we may have a phone call to catch up or check in with each other and talk for an hour or two. That's just our relationship. Some friends I have we just text each other frequently to make plans or joke about some meme or something. All in all, it's going to vary person to person. Don't have the same expectations for everyone. ",

With me, if something doesn\u2019t have a deadline, it tends to get moved to the back burner and I sometimes forget that back burner is there. So a resend would nudge me and get me to respond. Did you indicate you wanted a response? Because if you didn\u2019t, they might not have seen a reason to respond, especially if it\u2019s a guy. If your message did require a response and if the person did receive it and chose not to respond, then I\u2019d ask them why. I wouldn\u2019t jump to any conclusions, I\u2019d get the information first. If it comes down to it, you\u2019ll have to deal with the reality that this person does not want to communicate with you.

I don't remember how I got her number but I believe it was one of them new contacts things I don't remember or either a friend gave it to me or something but like she was tripping and stuff giving attitude and stuff and being the type of guy that's confident and all knowing that I'm damn well good looking I snapped when she left me on read. So a friend told me this trick to get back that them by saying \"hey guess what \", now try typing it as entertaining as possible or as simple as above and it would definitely prompt a reply which you in turn leave them on read or un read and enjoy the satisfaction. I've used this trick only twice or so but I deleted some of my chats so the i lost the spicy ones.  Don't mind my Grammer I'm a bit lazy to correctly check stuff.\ud83d\ude2a  ",

Sometimes fate favors the bold. Sometimes not. It\u2019s a calculated risk to go after a person who keeps you on their \u201cpay no mind\u201d list. You need to have a thick skin to take rejection if you continue to pursue a person who\u2019s not recognizing your value. The best prediction of future behavior, is that of the recent past.

I don\u2019t know what is the reason for it , but this person wants you out of their friend\u2019s list . I hope not , because if he/she does , then this person can just delete you . Also , out of self respect , you have to stop acting like you are desperate to connect because if the person still wants to talk to you , he/she will do the reconnecting . Find other worthwhile things to do than worrying about someone who is ignoring you despite your trying to be in their circle of friends . But for me , I will just take it as a sign that I am not wanted and have to disconnect myself after the third time I don\u2019t get a response for my messages . Moving on with life and finding better friends instead that are worthy of my time and effort . ",

Even my most faithful text companions occasionally doesn\u2019t see a message come in because they\u2019re doing something. If I don\u2019t get a response to my first text in what I know is a reasonable amount of time, I send a second message. Something like \u2013 did you see my message? If I\u2019m texting with a friend I wait longer after the second one And if I still got no answer I send a third one that says- Are U OK? If I were texting with somebody I was Just getting to know I would wait 24 hours before the second one. If it was an older friend after the third one I\u2019d call. If I don\u2019t hear anything after three messages and 24 hours, I know something is up. The key thing is to text in a way that shows you care but, is not invasive or demanding. Showing you care by following up is caring but, Sending too many messages is \u201cblowing up their phone\u201d. ",

Some offices require their employees to keep their phones off during work hours. So do some doctors offices. Many government offices require visitors to turn off their phones. If they are driving, most states require drivers not to text. It can cause accidents. If they are in a concert hall, movie theater or any other theatrical venue, karaoke bar, etc., people don\u2019t want to hear the ding of the phone. I have gotten texts when my phone was down or misplaced. If you have to text someone 24/7, you may have an addiction or stalking problem. Be reasonable about when you expect them to return a text. Recently, the Mom of an acquaintance had a stroke. You need to be sensitive to your friends needs and schedule. Otherwise, IMO, you aren\u2019t being a very good friend. ",

They\u2019re not responding for a reason, and I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s worth it to find out why; I\u2019d just take the hint and skedaddle. If I did know the person, then I\u2019d try to ask why and see if there was something I\u2019d done that\u2019d caused this behavior. If they either weren\u2019t reciprocating or simply ignored me after my \u201cmending the fences\u201d attempt, then I\u2019d amscray and leave them be in the future. When we message too much - or simply are attempting to contact someone that doesn\u2019t want to hear from us - then we\u2019re either being clingy or wasting time. Onto the next person, preferably someone that either likes us better or is willing to communicate when things go awry. ",

I have seen this question numerous times in the last week, For the most part if you don't receive a text back it is best to let whatever it was you were talking about go for a bit. I'm not saying you should drop the subject but things happen people get busy, or forget to check their phones. They have lives and as much as it sucks to say this if they read your text and intentionally don't reply than you are better off without them. It take very little time to send a hey I'm busy text, or something of the sort. If you feel that it is important to get a reply my suggestion is not to hold whatever the conversation is over text. Leave the trivial what are you up tos and how are yous for text and discuss important things over phone call or even coffee. ",

They might be busy when you gave them a message. Sometimes people do read messages and they want to respond as well but they can`t due to urgent work.Their phone might get switched off.Their net may be slow.I feel is that we should not judge them but instead we should talk to them, care about then and be more understanding of one another. Common reasons why people NEVER respond to your messages. This might sound rude but trust me self-respect is more important than anything else. They don`t see you as their priorityThey don`t share a strong bond with youMany a times feelings change as well and sometimes it changes so drastically that it takes time to accept the truth.I just want to tell you that take it as an experience and I think experience is a gift which we should not ignore at all. Love and respect yourself and cut negative people from life no matter how much you love them. But remember we all have at least one person who genuinely wants us to progress in our life. So focus on this kind of people. Take care. ",

The second half of that mix is being willing to hear the other person out. I\u2019m willing to do both. The question isn\u2019t what I will do. I have already done what I wanted to do. I reached out. The next move is out of my hands. So I wait. PS - I will add that the question said the text was ignored, so that indicates to me that it was read and there is no response. If no indication is available that it was truly ignored, I only know that I sent it but not that they have received it. My options then become try sending again or to continue the conversation in person. ",

If you want to contact me you should normally call. The only reason to send me a text message is if you are sending me an address or phone number or short message of that sort, or if it is urgent, and I am in the wilderness far from cell towers. (Sometimes text gets through when a phone call won\u2019t.) Today\u2019s young people have different expectations. They get annoyed if you don\u2019t respond in seconds or minutes. That\u2019s silly, in my opinion. You might be outside shoveling snow or mowing the yard. You might be studying for a test or writing a term paper. Your phone\u2019s battery might be dead. You might be driving. There are many reasons not to answer a text right away. Be a little patient, and relax. ",

If I feel ignore, I\u2019m learning to just remove myself, and I realized that isn\u2019t a friend, and especially after he mention to me, that he ignores my text. So I learn that it\u2019s a game, it\u2019s best to just don\u2019t text them and move on with your life. No one needs that frustration and trying to figure out why they\u2019re ignoring text, we have better things to do. \ud83d\ude03 ",

Once this happened where i was texting someone in WhatsApp and was eagerly waiting for the revert. There was no response for a while. I wanted to be harsh on this unresponsive behaviour and wrote something. I immediately thought that those words would be inappropriate and deleted the message. While there was no response for earlier messages, I got a reply the moment this message was deleted - \u2018what did you write, why deleted?\u2019 I actually learned that day that this method can work well at times and started using it once a while.i.e., when someone doesn't respond, write something and delete it. The curiosity of the recipient may get you a response, Bingo! ",

It really depends on what you sent last, but a good follow up text for a non responsive text is to mention what you are doing atm and ask what they are doing. This lessens the abruptness of some random question or neediness of asking why they didnt reply. However whats most important is to leave open ended text that way you wont be concerned with non responsive people unless they purposefully chose to not respond to you. ",

One thing Ive learned about texting, it can be taken the wrong way very easily. What you may be thinking is a funny lil poke at somebody, they may take it offensively. So it can be touch n go depending on the people doing the texting. If i take a text offensively, ill make a point of asking if they meant it that way & more times than not, they did not mean it that way. Its best to give the benefit of the doubt. ",

If it is an important relationship to you, but not an intimate one, I recommend a follow-up but keep it calm and non-emotional. If it a close family member then a follow-up might be a bit more emotional, such as, \"did I do something to hurt your feelings?\u201d ",

It does not matter to them what you might be doing, you should respond immediately. That just is not realistic. With my ex that was ghosting me off and on would really annoy me. We would be in the middle of a text conversation and she would just disappear. My response was, \u201cI hate it when you go dark on me\u201d. Perhaps you can understand why she is an ex. ",
