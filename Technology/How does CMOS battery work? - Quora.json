            "answer_text": "On modern computers the purpose of the battery is essentially to keep up the clock when the computer is powered down. On earlier computers it kept up CMOS memory that had some important configuration information. The battery was intruded in the IBM PC/AT in 1984.The PC did not have a clock that kept tune when it was powered down and the user had to enter date and time at boot up.* The click could be added as a separate third party board though. The battery lasts about ten years and on laptops it can be very hard to change. I once had such a case. I ended up installing software that fetches the time from the Internet at boot time. * A strange omission but IBM was used to mainframes that seldom were booted up and many computers of the time had no concept of current date and time.

            "answer_text": "The bane of all computer techs. Originally, some information about the hard drive parameters needed to be stored somewhere permanently, also a Real Time Clock was needed to keep calendar time when power is turned off. There is a chip which has a low power circuit for the time, and also some small amount of memory which is retained by a small coin cell. Current is so low that the battery can last for years. When the computer is powered, the drain is zero. All well until that battery voltage falls below the memory retention level. Now your computer not only doesn\u2019t know what time it is, but also doesn\u2019t know what type of hard drive is installed, and so it can\u2019t be accessed. Almost nobody remembers to change the battery every few years. If you do change it, do it with the computer turned on so that the data is not lost. I think I will change mine today, or maybe next week. ",
