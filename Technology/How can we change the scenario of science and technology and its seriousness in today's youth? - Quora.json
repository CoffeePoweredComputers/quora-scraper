            "answer_text": "Thanks for your request. It is linked to the education system. Overall in the West, there are places where the science and math education are important, but in the U.S. we are way behind. \u201c\"We're losing ground \u2014 a troubling prospect when, in today's knowledge-based economy, the best jobs can go anywhere in the world,\" said Education Secretary John B. King Jr. \"Students in Massachusetts, Maryland, and Minnesota aren't just vying for great jobs along with their neighbors or across state lines, they must be competitive with peers in Finland, Germany, and Japan.\" Math was a stubborn concern. \"This pattern that we're seeing in mathematics seems to be consistent with what we've seen in previous assessments ... everything is just going down,\" said Peggy Carr, acting commissioner at the National Center for Education Statistics.\u201d https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-12-06/math-a-concern-for-us-teens-science-reading-flat-on-test In the U.S. in the 60\u2019s, it was completely different. \u2018 \"We need rock stars. In the 60s astronauts were rock stars,\" Imahara said. \"Everyone wanted to be an astronaut.\" Imahara said that by bringing back the esteem and awe of the scientific community and scientific discoveries, kids will develop a passion and desire to learn more about these subjects.\u201d \u2018 https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/11/13/behind-americas-decline-in-math-science-and-technology It\u2019s been a good forty years of math, critical thinking, logic and science have kind of been put on the back burner. A lot of young people in the U.S. can\u2019t read or write at the appropriate levels. I don\u2019t just know this from Google. I know this from many years of teaching at the college level. Most kids of all walks of life really struggle with math, science AND basic reading and writing. So if in the US for example, we struggle to teach kids to read at a college level or to write essays, how can we really get upset that they struggle with math and science? They need to REALLY be able to READ in order to really be able to do anything of note in all fields. It\u2019s a state of emergency, ESPECIALLY in the age of A.I. and computer learning. Sadly, I don\u2019t think D.C. politicians care at all. And since they don\u2019t, it\u2019s up to parents and older people to create a different type of environment in the nation around basic life skills. Anyway, I\u2019m ghost.

            "answer_text": "I believe you are referring to the predominance of technology, social media and phone use amongst the youth of the early-21st century. This phenomena is a repeat of earlier generations use of new technologies throughout history. When books first became easily available to the public, adults worried the youth were spending too little time living and too much time reading. When cars first became available to the youth of the West adults worried they were using them too much. In the future it will be a different technology. Although I do believe the use of technology amongst the youth of today is unhealthily high, it is not something to be eliminated. The controlled use of technology by the youth, and the growing adult population in the same situation, is something to aim towards. As to ways this can be achieved, I suggest using campaigns that have worked in the past to change social behaviour. Advertisements; lessons in school; information for adults, parents and kids in public places; etc.. ",
