            "answer_text": "Q: Will iPhone 12 5G have outdated 5G chip in two-three years? A: No, not at all. Apple\u2019s iPhone 12 features a next generation 5G modem chip that is not available on any Android deviceThe iPhone 12 5G modem is far more capable than all 5G Androids, it operates on all 5G bands, low, mid and high band; and it covers all carriersThe first and second generation Android 5G modem chips are all very limited, they cannot operate on all carriers/bandsSo its Androids that are already becoming obsolete on 5G because they rushed to market to advertise that the had 5G, but they are poor performers on 5G, they don't cover all bands, they can't offer al speeds, and the very few that have high speed (high babd) capability will overheat and switch to 4G or overheat and shut down the phone within 30 seconds (as witnessed by the reviewers who tested all those Androids)In fact, the current controversies is that T-Mobile (a major cell phone carrier in the United States) bought out Sprint (a major cell phone carrier in the United States) and is in the process of shutting down all of Sprint\u2019s 5G frequencies (bands) to eventually migrate them to T-Mobile serviceThat means that in each area that T-Mobile shuts down Sprint 5G, those Sprint 5G customers lose 5G service because those Android phones are extremely limited and cannot switch to the other 5G bands that are already in severe by T-MobileThose Sprint customers are complaining that they have to go buy new replacement Android phones that can access T-Mobile 5G bandsIf they had iPhone 12 then they would find that it would switch to the other bands because iPhone 12 can service all carriers on all bands in the United StatesiPhone 12 5G will work just fine on low, mid, and high bands for as many years out as we can see (permanently).",

            "answer_text": "It's possible, 5G is a battery killer.. so if Apple gets 5G on their iPhone 12, they must include a FAT and bigger battery\u2026 but if you haven't known Apple already, they would want to avoid giving customers too big of a battery.. first, they are worried the big battery would cause the weight of the iPhone to be too heavy (batteries are heaviest part of a phone).. and the iPhone is already heavy with the stainless steel frames. But the second reason is more obvious, they don't want to give customers too much.. otherwise, it would create too much expectations in the future iPhones.. and plus Apple does not want to pay more money for bigger capacity batteries in all iPhones.. So Apple needs to figure out how to include 5G without having the 5G drain so much battery.. so they may end up with a battery killer iphone which doesn't have a big enough battery inside it, so Apple may have to delay the launch of the iPhone 12 to figure this out. The iPhone 11 Pro should have gotten 5G already but Apple always waits a bit longer until they release their own version of what's already available in the market.. the obvious reason is to maximize profits, they know people will still buy the iPhone 11 even if it didn't have 5G, but the iPhone 12 is expected to catch up with the other Android phones that have 5G so Apple has no time to lose.
