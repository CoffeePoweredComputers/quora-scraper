Parents have more experience,  more practical knowledge and ways to skip difficulties,  so they warn children before any critical situation but we are not able or as mature as them to understand itAnd children avoid them and ignore them for  reacting more And teenage is the age where generation gap effects maximum and after that age we actually came to know that no one can think as better as our parents for us. Not even we.... love your parents and try to understand their views they are always there for you , to love you, to care you in any situation at any palce any time.... ",
