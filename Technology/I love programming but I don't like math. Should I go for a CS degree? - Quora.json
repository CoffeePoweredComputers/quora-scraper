            "answer_text": "Are you speaking of high school math (which is mostly arithmetic) or college level math (which involves things like proofs and number theory and more theoretical concepts)?  It may make a difference.  But assuming you don't like either, you should think about what kinds of things you like to program and might like to program in the future.  Some things require math.  For example, math is used extensively in graphics, data analysis, and signal processing applications, but not so much in many others. Would you prefer to design a real time operating system, a data base, a weather forecasting system, a video game, or a user interface?  Does it really matter to you what your employer's business is?  I ask these questions because the field of computing is truly vast. It's not just a matter of wanting to write programs, it's a matter of wanting to be involved in an organization whose products interest you and whose way of operating fits your personality and work style.  I saw a cartoon the other day where one guy is asked what he does and he answers \"I work with computers\".  The other guy says \"yes but everybody does that these days.  What do you actually do?\"  In other words, almost every company doing anything is likely to use computers these days.  In the companies I worked for, secretaries had to be computer literate.  Knowing your way around a computer and how to program are becoming comparable to knowing reading, writing and arithmetic these days.  What separates you from others is not your knowledge of programming but your knowledge of some application domain where computers are utilized.  I've had students who ended up working in medicine, the legal field, high finance, and manufacturing food products, as well as things like aerospace and defense (NASA, Boeing), computer design and manufacturing, design and construction of \"smart\" heating and air conditioning systems, and creating systems for managing companies. Some other things to think about.1) Programming can be a lot of fun but in many cases it is more of an entry level skill than one that will take you through a 40 year career. Many of the career opportunities you encounter, particularly those that pay better, will require a lot more than programming skill.  For example, designing software, leading software development teams, planning future software projects, deciding which software tools to acquire, or figuring out how to produce software that has fewer bugs so your costs of support aren't so high, and (especially) figuring out how software can add significant value to the products your employer makes.  I loved to program but did very little of it after the first ten years of my career, unless you count spreadsheets, which I still develop today (and some are very elaborate).2) In college you probably don't really know what you will find most enjoyable in your ultimate career.  I know that what I thought I would be doing is not at all what I ended up doing.  So try to learn as much as you can.  Be open to learning new concepts, including those outside your major field of study.  And try to find internships or other employment opportunities that teach you something new.  Experience will take you far and open up possibilities that never occurred to you when you were younger.3) Figure out what you like to do (do this throughout your life) because there will be times when things are rough (the project doesn't get funded, you have a lousy boss, you have a medical problem, you have a family problem, you get laid off, ...) and if you are doing things you like to do, it is a lot easier to get through these rough periods.

            "answer_text": "If you wanted to get into a highly technical industry then I would say don't do it. Defense, aerospace, and scientific research are probably out, but even then they need people to support the business side of things. The skills that have best served me are logic and problem solving. I've worked in automotive, financial, and healthcare on the business side. I never needed calculus or any of the high order mathematics. They're good to know but I never needed to apply them. I excel at breaking problems down into manageable pieces and logically ordering operations to gain speed, reusability, and efficiency. In school I also did very well at digital logic (hardware) which helped me understand how computers work underneath my software. I've been able to survive many of the downturns in the industry like the dot-bomb bubble and more than one recession because I got really good at the basics and made sure I could apply them wherever I went.  Good luck either way. ",
