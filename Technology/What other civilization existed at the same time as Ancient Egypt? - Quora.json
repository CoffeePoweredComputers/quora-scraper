The Norte Chico civilization also know as Caral or Caral-Supe civilization. was a complex pre-Colombian society that included as many as thirty major population centers in what is now the Norte Chico region of north-central coastal Peru. The civilization flourished between the fourth and second millennia BC, with the formation of the first city generally dated to around 3500 BC, at Huaricanga, in the Fortaleza area. It is from 3100 BC onward that large-scale human settlement and communal construction become clearly apparent, which lasted until a period of decline around 1800 BC. Since the early 21st century, it has been established as the oldest-known civilization in the Americas. Norte Chico civilization - Wikipedia     ",

            "answer_text": "Ancient Egypt lasted for over 3,000 years, so there were lots of other civilizations at the same time. The big ones during the height of Egyptian civilization would be Sumer and the Indus Valley. Nearer to the end of Egypt there would have been quite a lot. In the Middle East alone there were dozens of major cultures and empires like Assyria, Babylon, the Hittites, and the Persians. China had also begun to rise to power. So had the precursors to Greek civilization, the Minoans and Mycenaeans. It also depends on how you define civilization, but by the time Egypt was conquered, there were numerous advanced cultures doting the globe. ",
