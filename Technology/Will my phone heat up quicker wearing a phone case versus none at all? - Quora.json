            "answer_text": "Yes, your phone will heat up a small amount quicker. Anything covering a phone will insulate it somewhat and prevent heat from escaping. It will also prevent air circulation from moving heat away from the phone. Generally speaking this is a small enough amount that it won't be a problem. It could, possibly, cause trouble if it's prone to heating or is being used heavily. (As noted in other answers to this question.) The only time I've seen heating problems is related to overcharging or a bad battery. I wouldn't worry about a case because they are designed to be used on phones and surely the designers would think of that. (Yes they would.) ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously Yes!! Phone cases won\u2019t let heat dissipation faster. But the level of heating depends on the type of material of which the case is made of. If the case is heat conductive like aluminium mixed cases, it dissipates heat faster due to heat dissipation all over the case body and let your smartphone to cool down rapidly, but if the case is made of normal plastic then its gonna make your smartphone brittle in long run as the heat is trapped inside and your smartphone temp keeps increasing(heat might not be felt by the user in this case ). This is also one of the reason of trending of metal body smartphones now a days. So choose wisely or Go Caseless. :P;P ",
