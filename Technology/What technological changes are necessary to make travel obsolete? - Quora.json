            "answer_text": "Setting aside the notion of business travel (this questions seems geared toward leisure travel only)... People travel for experiences. More and more, there is a bias toward authentic experiences. In that way, themed restaurants, the Travel Channel, and Second Life are all poor substitutes because they are all inauthentic proxies for direct experiences. In order for technology to obviate the need for travel, technology would have to offer fully authentic experiences in distant locations. The most concrete example I can envision is a fully immersive experience that brought you to an actual physical location, in real-time, somewhere else in the world. A system similar to the fictional world of Surrogates is one example. Surrogates movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0986263/Based on this graphic novel series: http://www.amazon.com/Surrogates-Graphic-Novels/dp/1891830872 Even still, there is a layer of inauthenticity in this situation because people would not be in any physical danger. Given this, there are no technological advances that could make physical travel obsolete. ",

            "answer_text": "The popular answers in Why do people travel? What do you feel when you travel? indicate a few remaining reasons that people travel. Many of them could be eliminated with vastly improved telepresence. I could also see Google Earth reducing, and soon removing, the need to travel to simply, \"see the sights\". These technologies you mentioned already make travel obsolete if you travel for specific reasons: Themed restaurants bring Disneyland to you. (So people must no longer travel for the Disneyland experience). The Travel Channel and Wikipedia bring knowledge of places or cultures to you. (So people must no longer travel for basic knowledge of places or cultures). Second Life and Chat Roulette bring exotic people to you. (So people must no longer travel simply to meet with exotic people). Jamie Beckland's answer indicates that people travel to satisfy the search for authenticity (What is the \"search for authenticity\"?). If you include social advancements, like the concept of natural rights, technological advancements, then even that need for travel can be addressed. ",
