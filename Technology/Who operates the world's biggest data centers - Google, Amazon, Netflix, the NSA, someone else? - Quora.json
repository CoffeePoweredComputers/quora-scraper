            "answer_text": "I worked at AWS S3 and now I\u2019m working at Google Cloud, so I had to chance to get a feel of the scale these companies operate at. It\u2019s mind blowing. Interesting fact - Google is quite open about DC capacities to its workers, you could literally look up how much CPU, memory, GPU, etc. exist at which DC. But of course, it\u2019s prohibited to share this knowledge. I\u2019m not sure if Amazon is not as open or just doesn\u2019t have such tools, but I didn\u2019t see an easy way to check DCs locations, capacities and load. I just had a chance to deploy software there and get a feel of their scale. As I\u2019m not allowed to tell actual numbers, I\u2019ll be using public data and just general knowledge. Let\u2019s think logically. Here\u2019s what Google made public: Data center locations. And here\u2019s Amazon\u2019s one: Global Infrastructure. I don\u2019t think government agencies have or, actually, need so much compute and storage power as commercial companies. Plus, I suspect government just uses commercial data centers for some things. E.g. take a look here: US Federal Government in the Cloud - Amazon Web Services (AWS). Also, I don\u2019t know much about Chinese internal cloud or other countries. I assume it\u2019s impressive, but let\u2019s look at the rest of the world. And the only 3d major player in cloud I could think of is Microsoft Datacenter Infrastructure | Microsoft. So, let\u2019s concentrate on Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Now, Amazon controls around 37% of cloud, Microsoft 29% and Google 17%. Don\u2019t be fooled by low number for Google - it\u2019s a new player in cloud and most of DC resources are used for it\u2019s enormous products like Search, Gmail, etc. Same for Microsoft with Bing, Skype, etc. And of course Amazon has amazon.com, which is consuming a lot of resources as well, with all the video, music content, features and visitors. Google is the only company out of these 3, which started with the product that requires tons of resources - Search and it\u2019s still the most important product for Google, and most visited web site. But Google is also crazily efficient with hardware usage (Large-scale cluster management at Google with Borg). I think Amazon has to use more hardware to achieve equal goals. So, could be equal to Google or bigger in size. And I don\u2019t know where to put Microsoft, because it has search engine, chunk of cloud and tons of it\u2019s own cloud based products. All 3 companies spent billions of dollars on data centers and keep building them. But the trick is that while they have to build DCs in advance, they can\u2019t build much more than projected demand as it\u2019s super expensive to operate them and there aren\u2019t many places with resources to operate data center, like electricity, water, close transportation, educated specialists, etc. Now answering the question - I think it\u2019s gotta be one of Amazon, Microsoft or Google, but which one - it\u2019s a big secret. Even if there are people who could answer it, they can not do it. ",
