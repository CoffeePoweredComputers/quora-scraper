            "answer_text": "The departmental stores are basically run in the format of outright buying, which means the store like shoppers stop or lifestyle buy products from the brand at a specific margin and retail them. this process of buying happens twice a year, summer and winter. the shelf life of each product is 120 days which i basically four months. so if a product is non moving it will become just a stock pile over for them. In order to sort that the retailer approach the brand to contribute in providing discount so that the product gets sold and they have more inventory to buy new products. The brand help them because if they wont the budget of the brand will become less and retailer will not buy new products because of their monetary limitations and inventory. e.g., if shoppers stop bought one brand with a margin of 40 percent, then they are having profit of 40 percent which includes the store operating cost. now their budget for this brand is 1lac and the brand\u2019s average selling price is 1k per product. Shoppers will be able to buy 1lac/1k = 100 products. Now 30 products are unsold. so in next season shoppers will but only 70 products which lead to the loss for the brand. so brand will take the hit on MRP and provide discount. if the discount is not appealing and still it is lying on the rack, the store will take hit on their 40 percent margin and provide further fancy discount. this combine discount usually become a good number like 40\u201350% and it appeals the consumer to buy it.

            "answer_text": "Imagine u are selling a watermelon, Its so ripe that if you donot sell it by end of the day, it will spoil. You bought it for Rs 10 per kg. A customer comes and tells you he will pay Rs 8 for the kg. Now you have two choices a) Sell for Rs 8 and book a lossb) Keep the watermelon and let it rot and book Rs 10 loss. Same way, Shopper Stop and other stores end up with lot of unsold stocks, which they sell for discount. Also some of Stock is 400% margin, so even by selling at 50% they are making money. Hope it helped ",
