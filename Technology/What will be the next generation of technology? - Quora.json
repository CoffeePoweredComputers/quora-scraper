(this isn't really a serious list. Just some stuff to give you an idea of what we're paying with). I propose; \u201cthe driverless car\" Yes, yes. I know this has already been invented, and is successfully in use. But I'm talking about using it to its full potential. Imagine ONE company, that acts like a taxi company. That owns 100% of all vehicles on the road. And all these vehicles were exactly the same make and model, driverless car. (exceptions for the trucks, ambulance, special service vehicles). Imagine you, the customer; Not buying a car Not buying insurance Not buying petrol Not paying for parking Not paying for any fines Not paying for rego Not paying for a new set of tyres Not paying for a mechanic Not risking your life or the lives of others because of human error. Making it to work in half the time because there are no more traffic lights, and all cars can communicate with each other, allowing for higher, safer speeds, and no need to slow down because of dense traffic. And how much will the consumer pay? Less (way less) than it would for the consumer to buy a cheap car, and keep it on the road. How can it be cheaper? The ONE company can cut costs by; having only one type of vehicle to supply parts to. No costs for insurance. Rarely any damage to cars. Buy in bulk car parts, fuel (petrol or electric. If electric, the company can set up it's own solar plant) Other benefits include; No \u201choons\u201d or illegal street racing Less death on roads. (much less. Almost 0%) More time saved by commuters. Ability to work whilst traveling (these cars will have Wi-Fi) Can assist emergency vehicles by blocking off wrong streets, and effectively avoiding the route of the emergency vehicle entirely. Can be used as an emergency vehicle if applicable. \u2026. This can revolutionise the way we travel. So convenient. So safe. So cheap. I'd love to make this my business, but I don't have the funds. And I'm in the wrong country (Australia) ",

            "answer_text": "Ask this question to various experts and you are likely to get a deluge of varying responses, from full migration of data to cloud-based solutions to breakthroughs in genetic research that will allow us to live longer and stronger. But if i were to pick one piece of technology that is affecting our world more than any other, and at a faster rate, i would have to pick the evolution of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. As AI\u2019s evolve and become more complete they bring with them the ability to handle a more complex and larger volume of work. This means that other technologies that make use of it such as self-driving cars, data visualization and a host of others will see quantitative leaps in their development also. Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling a new era of people and machines working together with data-driven insights and highly strategic and outcome-focused processes. To fully realize the promise of the AI-fueled organization, we can highlight three system models currently in play: cloud-native, package-adjunct, and open-algorithm. By embracing AI, machine learning (ML), and other cognitive tools across the IT ecosystem, we can spend less time on redundant and mundane activities that waste the value of every employee and spend more time on informed decision-making. But the enterprise is not the only space AI is going to make its mark, In June 2018, researchers at OpenAI developed a technique that trains an AI on unlabeled text to avoid the expense and time of categorizing and tagging all the data manually. A few months later, a team at Google unveiled a system called BERT that learned how to predict missing words by studying millions of sentences. In a multiple-choice test, it did as well as humans at filling in gaps. And as we progress this technology is already evolving into full competent assistants that can allow us to navigate our business and personal lives. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m writing from the perspective of gen z, but some of this may apply to millenials as well. Space expansion. Super intelligent AI. Immortality. Perhaps even the technological singularity. Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist and futurist, wrote about the future of humanity in his latest book, The Future of Humanity. He prophecises that humans will terraform mars and start expanding into space. He also covered things like nuclear fusion and solar sails. These technologies will aid humanity\u2019s journey into the final frontier, and this will be the defining tech challenges for this generation. Max Tegmark\u2019s book, Life 3.0, talks about what it would mean to be human in the future. In particular, he spends a large amount of the book talking about the technological superintellegence. Nick Bostrom wrote a book dedicated to the subject, but I got to page 12 and gave up (it\u2019s very technical, I\u2019ll pick it up again after I take AP calculus). Basically the idea is that the superintellegence is an AI that is more intelligent than a human. A big challenge for our generation is to figure out what this means, and what do we do with it, if we want it at all. While not heavily covered, Kaku\u2019s book (the one mentioned above) spends a short chapter discussing the potential for immortality. Your genes start to weaken and start breaking down as you progress into old age, but scientists have found a specific part of DNA that stops this; tests in mice have increased lifespan. They\u2019re called telomeres, and altering them could potentially stop aging, perhaps making you immortal. By immortal, I mean stop aging, but if you get hit by a train, you\u2019re still probably going to die. An End to Aging: Can Science Allow Humans to To Become Immortal? Finally: the technological singularity. This is the hypothesis that one day a self replicating AI would create a new \u201cgeneration\u201d of itself a little bit smarter. That generation would create the next generation and so on, until it got so smart that a new generation is made constantly and intelligence increases at an exponential rate. Whether this will happen or not is up to debate, and so is when it will happen. But no matter the fate of this idea, it is still an interesting possibility to explore. ",

            "answer_text": "As corporations still create innovations in their fields, what\u2019s ensuing revolutionary improvement? When Apple free their 1st notebook computer (PC) in 1977, it began the industrial use of computers, associated trade price billions these days. Since then, abundant smaller inventions are hailed because of the next massive issue, the foremost recent example being the MacBook bit bar. Similarly, tv and screen style square measure reaching a technological highland with the introduction of 8K extremist HD displays. The mobile market is traditionally competitive, with Samsung and Apple pushing one another towards yearly innovations. Most changes square measure tiny, thus what's ensuing major technological breakthrough? personal and industrial laptop performance has been steady up since the terribly 1st computers were unreal throughout warfare two. Before 1977, computers were principally military machines, used for complicated calculations and strategic designing. many key laptop elements directly light-emitting diode to the slimming and production of computers, most significant of that was the chip, usually referred to as CPU\u2019s. fashionable CPU\u2019s use tiny quantities of gold, principally for its high electrical physical phenomenon, to run most of a computer\u2019s commands, and square measure found in nearly every phone, laptop, and laptop.  Gold could also be an associate implausibly smart electrical conductor, however, it'll eventually be phased out of physics. Experimental carbon technologies like graphene could replace metals in computing. presently big-ticket and sophisticated to create, graphene may be a compound consisting of one layer of carbon atoms. In 2014, IBM created a laptop chip made from graphene that was reportedly ten,000 times higher than alternative similar processors. it's unclear once graphene chips are offered for public use, however, it's clear that they'll be superior to our current technologies. Scientists and researchers are wanting into alternatives to graphene. Atom-wide structures created out of semiconducting material, boron, an element might all replace graphene because the premier wonder-material, and solely time can tell whether or not they are successful. Similar to computers, screen technology may additionally be hit a biological process highland. Pixels square measure a set of 3 small anodes that emit red, blue, and inexperienced lightweight. Combined, these 3 lights turn out each color on a screen. As mentioned antecedently, 8K extremist HD televisions, that have a large thirty-three million pixels, square measure the present peak performers once it involves commercially offered screens, and that they might not be terribly removed from the optimum product. Retina displays presently utilized by Apple and alternative corporations square measure already sharp enough to be indivisible from higher screen resolutions. In alternative words, at a definite purpose, our eyes simply can\u2019t see a lot of pixels. Scaled up, these displays square measure a lot of elaborated than that of IMAX theater screens.  Apple corporate executive Tim Cook enters the stage throughout the Apple Developers Conference in point of entry, Monday, June 11, 2012. Apple says it\u2019s introducing a portable computer with a super-high resolution \u201cRetina\u201d show, setting a replacement commonplace for screen sharpness. The new MacBook professional can have a 15-inch screen and 4 times the resolution of previous models, Apple corporate executive Tim Cook told developers at a conference in point of entry. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) As of Dec eighteenth, 2016, the Samsung Galaxy S7 has the best picture element density of concerning 577 pixels per area unit (PPI). It nearly doubles the iPhone 7\u2019s 326 PPI, despite the fact that the Oculus will barely distinguish between the 2 at arm's length. If not in mobile technology or computing, what field might ensuing major technology arise? a well-liked answer to the present question would be the sector of artificial technology (AI). many products have already been created which will learn severally of their creators. Amazon\u2019s Echo and Echo Dot, alongside Google\u2019s Google Home square measure each capable of observant their homeowners' patterns, and adapting their behavior supported past experiences. despite the fact that AI has been employed in some capacity for many decades, it has created vital enhancements these past few years. Artificial intelligence has arguably the foremost potential of any future technology. In a piece by a Business corporate executive, consultants argue that its future can greatly profit humanity. High functioning learning programs might predict natural disasters before they even happen (including preventing and fixing climate change), rummage around for cures to diseases in ways in which no human might, and even be enforced into folks to enhance reality. Oren Etzioni, the corporate executive of the Allen Institute for AI, says that once it involves AI, \u201cthe sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d When it involves technology, nobody will predict what massive issue will actually create a control, whether or not or not it's immediate or a protracted term investment. though new things square measure created every day, nobody will tell whether or not they\u2019ll be booms or busts.

These would be implanted sometime after birth so we would learn to use them as we (as infants) also were learning to use our brains and bodies. The really interesting question is what effect this would have on us and our cultures. It\u2019s one thing to have widespread access to the internet and all human knowledge as we do now, but what if every human being had this access? How would they use it? Would anything actually change or would we still have as many despots, criminals, stalkers, abusers, financial greediness, political power seekers? Would war still be the preferred way of settling disputes? Would science and technology proceed any faster? Would human beings be any better off with such intimate access to information? ",
