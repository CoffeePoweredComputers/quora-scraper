            "answer_text": "No they can\u2019t because armed drones are restricted for exports due to MTCR (Missile Technology Control Regime) agreement. Leading drone operators like the US are signatory to the MTCR which limits the spread of ballistic missiles and long ranged armed drones in the world.  Turkey and China blatantly violate international law and the Harop drones that Israel is providing to Azerbaijan are suicide drones like the WW2 Kamikaze the only difference being that they are unmanned. Turkish drones have proven themselves in this war by causing massive casualties among Armenian forces.  Armenian forces are obsolete, poorly trained and lack killer instinct what they need is to do now is to swallow their pride and give a call to Don Kirlin  Owner of DOD contractor air USA.
