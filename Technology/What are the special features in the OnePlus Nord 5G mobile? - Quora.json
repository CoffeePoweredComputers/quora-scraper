The next 5G phone available in India is the Relame X50 Pro with a starting price of Rs 39,999, comparatively much more expensive than the Nord. This is the first OnePlus smartphone to feature a dual front camera setup. The device features a pill-shaped cut out to accommodate the front camera located on the top left corner of the display. It sports a 32MP primary sensor paired with an 8MP ultra wide angle lens for taking selfies. OnePlus at the launch of the device also launched a number of cool and funky covers for users to buy. These covers include various designs that make the device look a lot more personal. It also officially partnered with Dbrand to launch a teardown cover, which shows the internals of the device with a few minor tweaks like a Blue battery instead of a Black one.
