But nobody likes having a shitty life, and everyone wants to believe that things will get better, because, well otherwise, why not commit suicide right now? I\u2019m not saying everyone is depressed, but I think that if we all found out that life only gets worse from here on, that would make us depressed and suicidal. But we don\u2019t want that, so we tell ourselves that this year will be THE year. This year will be the new beginning; new chapter - of only good things. We can\u2019t handle not thinking that. Whether we\u2019re right or wrong, whether this year turns out to actually be a good year or not, next year we\u2019ll do the same thing. Well, if this year actually turns out to be the turning point in our lives, then we won\u2019t have to say the same thing next year - that 2021 will be the best year, because 2020 will have already made our lives seem worthwhile. But if 2020 sucks, then there\u2019s always next year\u2026 \u201cToday is yesterday\u2019s tomorrow.\u201d ",
